HEADLINE: Hello, Old Friend: Rediscovering Manhattan's Chinatown 

BYLINE:  By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
NOBODY says much about Chinatown these days. Not Manhattan Chinatown, anyway. Flushing is where the excitement is, or Brooklyn. "You know," one Chinese-food maven whispered to me recently, "there are really two Chinatowns in Brooklyn now, Sunset Park and the Avenue U area near Bensonhurst, but nobody knows about that one."
 Lovers of Chinese food crave secrecy and are suspicious by nature. They are desperate to learn where the hot chefs are cooking, but fear they have chosen a restaurant where the great chef has already left. They are certain a restaurant's real treasures are denied to them because they can't read the proverbial Chinese-language menu. Long ago the writer Calvin Trillin said that he carried a card with the Chinese sentence for "Bring me what they're having at the next table." 
 But the big secret in Chinese food these days is right out in the open, if only anybody were looking. It's Chinatown -- Manhattan Chinatown -- where the food, to my mouth at least, is as good or better than it's ever been. 
It's not just the restaurants, although that's a pretty good place to start, but fish shops, meat markets, greengrocers and purveyors of things you never knew you wanted, like dried licorice plums, which doubtless have some health benefit but to me just smell good.
Even while much of Chinatown may seem familiar, like the jurors flocking to Big Wong on Mott Street for roasted pork at lunchtime, it is constantly changing. Street vendors are now all over, selling fried turnip cakes on Canal Street, for example, and little fried-dumpling shops are springing up, offering the unbeatable deal of five for a dollar. New-wave Chinese restaurants like Shanghai Cafe and Big Eat cater largely to a younger crowd and offer glimpses of the latest crosscultural dining trends in Hong Kong.
"It's still a really exciting place," said Mr. Trillin, who regularly rides to Chinatown on his bicycle from his home in Greenwich Village. "There's constantly something new there."
Even with something old, you can learn something new and exciting. On a recent sunny afternoon, when I stopped at the Mei Lai Wah Coffee House, a worn and battered cafe practically hidden on Bayard Street, I found the dregs of the day's baking, a steamed pork bun that had sat around long enough to turn as tough as one of the listing vinyl booths. The place was empty and lifeless.
But when I returned in the morning, Mei Lai Wah was hopping, filled with men drinking coffee from paper cups as trays and trays of fresh buns were stacked in racks. The baked pork buns were superb, with a glossy, pliable pastry and a savory, slightly sweet filling, and just 60 cents apiece. A sweet braided sesame bun, still warm from the oven, was just the right chaser.
Mei Lai Wah was there years ago when Chinatown was just a small clutch of narrow bends between Canal Street and Chatham Square. Chinatown's star shone brightest in the 1970's and 80's, when New York City's love affair with Chinese food was at its height. Woody Allen and Mariel Hemingway nurtured their doomed love affair in "Manhattan" over Chinese takeout containers while Edward I. Koch, the noshing mayor, was an irrepressible Chinatown habitue. College students from Connecticut -- I was one -- used to consider it an adventure to drive down after midnight to Wo Hop or Hong Fat, places where even the greasiest moo shu pork tasted great at 3 a.m.
Chinatown has grown tremendously since then, expanding to the north and east, reducing Little Italy to a quaint diorama as it has engulfed much of the Lower East Side. But it's no longer a big deal to many New Yorkers. 
It came to be taken for granted, diminished in the city's imagination by an expanding world of Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Korean restaurants -- many of them in Chinatown itself. Like network television in the age of cable, Chinatown is now noted for what it lacks rather than appreciated for what it offers.
Of course, 9/11 hit Chinatown especially hard, and so did the SARS link to Asia. But those events only accelerated the slide downward. 
"Life was tough there even before 9/11," said Leonard Lopate, the talk show host on WNYC radio, who lived in Chinatown for 30 years before moving to Brooklyn in 2001. "People now have all these other options. Food tastes have changed as well."
And why not? The world has grown: people have seen, tasted and traveled more, and nobody, least of all the Chinese, expects to settle for the same old dishes. Cantonese, particularly by way of Hong Kong, is still the dominant style in Chinatown, though you can also find Shanghai, Fujian and even a little Sichuan, often all on the same menu. 
Bubble tea shops are proliferating, as are fancy bakery chains with as many French and Italian pastries as traditional Chinese delicacies. The Flushing and Sunset Park Chinatowns may have more Taiwanese or Sichuan restaurants, but they don't have Manhattan's variety. What they do have is parking.
"Parking is such an issue, but I would not say the culinary attraction has shifted," said Wangsheng Li, who works for MetLife and is a frequent visitor to Chinatown. "The Chinese restaurants there have become more sophisticated in terms of trying new things." 
Consider, for example, the bizarre curry bun at Big Eat, one of Chinatown's shiny new restaurant-lounges. It's a hollowed-out roll as big as a jack-o'-lantern, filled with spicy, peppery curry tinged with coconut milk. A chicken leg pokes out the top like an umbrella in a stand. It's good, too, though it's not exactly clear what makes it Chinese. With other dishes like Malaysian curry, Thai pork chop, edamame, and a mysterious "baked pol bello mushroom and cheese rice casserole," Big Eat caters to the worldly tastes of its clientele.
"It's an infusion of nouvelle cooking from China, and newly arrived chefs reflect these kinds of tastes," Mr. Li, a onetime restaurant manager, said. "The distinction between regional cuisines has become very blurred."
The more traditional flavors of Chinatown are still easy enough to find and can be astonishingly good. At Chanoodle, a bright new restaurant on Mulberry Street, the fried rice with two kinds of Chinese sausage is a beautiful, colorful dish, putting to shame the grease bombs that pass for fried rice at the takeout joints. The green of the peas, the red of the cubed peppers and the bright yellow of the egg contrast with the white of the fluffy rice, and the sausages -- one dried, the other fresher -- add complementary pungencies. 
OK 218 Grand is a plain little restaurant alongside a takeout shop with excellent roasted meats served over rice, and surprisingly good Peking duck, served with graceful ceremony as a waiter swiftly anoints pancakes with hoisin and rolls them up with duck.
"I still go to Chinatown all the time," Mr. Koch said. "But I feel so sorry for the people because the business is way off." One of his favorite Chinatown restaurants, Sun Lok Kee, relocated to Flushing last year after a fire at its longtime Mott Street site.
"The rent was too high, and the restaurant was too small," said Sunny Lee, manager of New Lok Kee, as the restaurant in Flushing is now called. "In Flushing, more people are on the streets."
That may seem difficult to comprehend for people who have dodged and parried their way up Mott Street, particularly on the block between Hester and Grand Streets, home to a fabulous selection of food shops. Here, one after the other, are greengrocers with neatly stacked piles of mustard greens, cabbages and melons, with baskets of shiitake mushrooms and Chinese pumpkins. 
Fish shops display fat striped bass, live blue crabs tied with cloth so as not to expend energy and lose body fat, buckets of squatting frogs and glistening little silver fish still breathing. Butcher shops offer every possible portion of the pig and cow. 
"To my mind it's the single best food market in the city," said Ed Schoenfeld, a restaurant consultant and longtime expert on Chinese food. "To me, it makes Arthur Avenue's covered market look like small potatoes."
A block away, Peter Lam and his brother Joe Si, who own four Joe's Shanghai restaurants in Manhattan and Queens, have gone against the grain. They opened Joe's Ginger on Mott Street just a couple of months ago, reinvesting in Chinatown at a time when everybody else is counting it out.
"9/11 and SARS and the parking, those three big problems, have killed a lot of business in Chinatown," Mr. Lam said. "We found a good location because we felt that next year the Manhattan economy will be better."
Chinatown itself has taken steps to rebuild its business. In September, it cordoned off Bayard Street for a Moon Lantern festival, an unusual occurrence for a community that usually limits its celebrations to the Chinese New Year. There has been talk about improving sanitation and parking, although not everybody expects much to change.
"There is lip service to community effort but I don't see it happening," said Michael Batterberry, a restaurant historian who is editor and publisher of Food Arts magazine. 
As with almost anything having to do with Chinatown, the more you try to understand, the less you realize you know. Things change for reasons that are difficult to discern, and don't change for equally unfathomable causes. 
Why is it, for example, that at least three well-known restaurants have changed their names slightly? Harmony Palace, a longtime dim sum specialist on Mott Street, recently promoted itself to Grand Harmony, while NY Noodletown on the Bowery performed a similar upgrade, becoming Great NY Noodletown. By contrast, the Triple Eight Palace on East Broadway knocked itself down a digit, and is now called 88 Palace.
"Quite a lot of businesses have changed hands," said Ray Chen, an antiques dealer. "There's always this sort of thing."

A Country's Many Flavors, in a Few Blocks
Chinatown has no shortage of edible delights. Following is a small selection, both new and old.
BIG EAT -- 97 Bowery (Hester Street), (212) 219-9955. Good traditional Cantonese food in an almost surreal environment, with some new-wave fusion dishes, too. 
BIG WONG -- 67 Mott Street (Canal Street), (212) 964-0540. A renovation has freshened the dining room, but otherwise Big Wong remains a roast pork king and a juror's friend.
CHANOODLE -- 79 Mulberry Street (Bayard Street), (212) 349-1495. Excellent new place to revisit old Cantonese favorites.
CONGEE -- 98 Bowery (Grand Street), (212) 965-5028. Plain decor, but top-notch cooking, like salt-baked squid and, yes, congee.
CONGEE VILLAGE -- 100 Allen Street (Delancey Street), (212) 941-1818. Great Cantonese food on the far reaches of Chinatown. 
FAY DA BAKERY -- 83 Mott Street (Canal Street), (212) 791-3884. Glossy, bustling, modern bakery with seven other city branches.
GOLDEN UNICORN -- 18 East Broadway (Catherine Street), (212) 941-0911. Though looking drab, a good place for dim sum, especially sesame buns. Go early to avoid lines.
JOE'S GINGER -- 113 Mott Street (Hester Street), (212) 966-6613. Hong Kong meets Shanghai, from the owners of Joe's Shanghai.
MEI LAI WAH COFFEE HOUSE -- 64 Bayard Street (Bowery), (212) 925-5435. A taste of very old Chinatown; go before 11 a.m. for great pork buns and other pastries.
MOTT STREET -- between Hester and Grand Streets. Almost like a one-block shopping mall, lined with fine greengrocers, meatmarkets and fish shops. 
OK 218 GRAND -- 218-220 Grand Street (Mott Street), (212) 226-8039. Low-key and unprepossessing, with fine roast meats and Peking duck.
SILK ROAD MOCHA -- 30 Mott Street (Pell Street), (212) 566-3738. The shape of Chinatown to come? An art gallery and cybercafe, with pork buns and lattes.
YUE FUNG -- 53-55 Elizabeth Street (Hester Street), (646) 613-0019. Outstanding selection of dried foods, from lily buds and red dates to sea cucumbers and "deer tenders." ERIC ASIMOV

HEADLINE: $16 Million Is Pledged To Renovate Tully Hall 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Lincoln Center has received a $16 million grant from the Alice Tully Foundation toward the renovation of Alice Tully Hall, the center's prime stage for chamber music and jazz. The gift, announced yesterday, is the largest so far by a private donor for Lincoln Center's redevelopment project.
 The Alice Tully project is expected to begin in 2005, with a total cost of $56 million. It is to be part of the overall transformation of the West 65th Street portion of the Lincoln Center campus under a design by Diller & Scofidio. 
 Bruce Crawford, chairman of Lincoln Center, called the foundation's gift "a vote of confidence" in the redevelopment. James McGarry, president of the Alice Tully Foundation, said his organization had determined that the hall "was in need of upgrading."
The grant is contingent on Lincoln Center's raising two and half times the $16 million for a total of $56 million. Reynold Levy, president of Lincoln Center, said yesterday that he was optimistic that the center could come up with the rest of the money. "This is a significantly improved climate for fund-raising from what it was a year ago," he said. 
Renovations are to include an extensive updating of the 1,096-seat hall, an enlarged outer lobby, and expanded "performer support" areas like dressing rooms.
Since it was first announced as a $1.5 billion project in 1999, Lincoln Center's redevelopment has been scaled back because of the economy. What the revised figure will be is not yet known because of uncertainties about renovations at Avery Fisher Hall, the home of the New York Philharmonic, which is considering moving out and merging with Carnegie Hall in 2006.
Alice Tully Hall was built in 1969 with a gift from the singer Alice Tully, a granddaughter of the founder of Corning Glass Works; she died in 1993. The Alice Tully Foundation, established in 1953, gives grants primarily in the arts, education and human services. 
Tully Hall was conceived as the first major concert stage in New York City for chamber music. Today it serves as the home of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and a primary stage for performances and events presented by the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Lincoln Center Inc., the center's umbrella organization.

HEADLINE: Love on Campus: Trying to Set Rules for the Emotions 

BYLINE:  By SARA RIMER

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif. 

 BODY:
The University of California is beginning the academic year under a new policy that bans "romantic or sexual" relationships between professors and their students.
 Like a lot of people on campus, Catherine Gallagher, a professor of English here, is confused. 
 What precisely does the word romantic mean, she wonders. "Does it mean a personal relationship? Does it mean you can't go out for coffee?"
The university has long had a strict sexual harassment policy. With its new rules, it has joined a small but growing number of colleges that have taken the extra step of trying to regulate those relationships that, at least at the outset, both parties seem to want. 
But setting policy for how sex and romance should play out on campus turns out to be as complicated and problematic as, well, relationships themselves. The policy took effect at the University of California's nine campuses in July. People have been debating it ever since.
At the University of Michigan, which is revising its policy on consensual faculty-student relationships, the administration has even come up with detailed hypothetical examples of what situations might arise and how they should be handled.
"Department Chair X is having a sexual relationship with Graduate Student D who is a member of Assistant Professor Y's laboratory in the same department," one example reads. "In managing the resultant conflict, Chair X would have to recuse himself from evaluative/promotional reviews of Assistant Professor Y's work while Graduate Student D is a member of the laboratory."
Schools that have adopted such policies include Stanford, Yale, Duke, the University of Virginia, Ohio Wesleyan and the University of Iowa. The strictest policy, put in place at the College of William and Mary two years ago, forbids consensual relationships between all faculty members and undergraduate students.
But more typical are policies like the one Duke adopted in 2002, which strongly discourages faculty members from becoming involved with their students but says that if such a relationship develops, the faculty member must report it to a dean and then be removed from all authority over the student.
Peter H. Burian, a classics professor at Duke who was chairman of the Academic Council when it took up the issue, said he received dozens of e-mail messages from faculty members about the policy -- more than any other issue the council considered under his watch.
"People have very strong feelings about this." he said. "There were people who felt the university was morally culpable for not saying no to any such relationship. There were other people who basically said, 'You're trampling on our rights. We know faculty members who are x years later happily married to former students. We know this is going to happen.' "
The new policies, at Duke, the University of California and elsewhere, arise out of a range of concerns, including the ethics and conflicts of interests involved in such relationships. Gayle Binion, a professor of political science who helped negotiate the adoption of the new policy at the University of California, said her primary concern was ensuring that faculty members did not cross "normal professional relationship boundaries," the same sort of boundaries that have long been clearly established between doctors and their patients, she said.
As other supporters of the policy do, she questions if relationships between faculty members and students they supervise, recommend for graduate school or jobs, or otherwise evaluate can ever be truly consensual.
"It's not just about power," Professor Binion said. "It's about the asymmetry of the life situation. For faculty members, they have relationships, they break up, their lives go on. They're established. For students, these things can have dramatic repercussions. We're saying the faculty member has to be the one to take responsibility. You can't just say the student says it was O.K."
At several schools, including William and Mary and Ohio Wesleyan, the policies were prompted by highly publicized incidents involving sexual relationships between professors and students.
At the University of California, such a policy was already under discussion when the dean of the university's Boalt Hall School of Law at Berkeley, John Dwyer, resigned after a student accused him of sexual harassment. Mr. Dwyer, who was not married at the time, said that he had had one consensual encounter with the student -- whom he did not teach or supervise -- and that his actions represented "a serious error in judgment."
The new policy prohibits faculty members from entering into consensual relationships with any student for whom they have, or "reasonably expect" to have, academic responsibility. That includes students they are teaching or supervising or evaluating in any way. Faculty members who violate the policy are subject to disciplinary action ranging from a reprimand to dismissal.
While the University of California's new policy was approved by an overwhelming majority of the academic assembly, it continues to stir debate here. Professor Gallagher is one of more than 60 faculty members, mostly from the humanities and including many from women's studies, who have objected to the new policy as too vague and too sweeping.
They say it is impossible to know with certainty which students they may "reasonably expect" to have academic responsibility over.
Professor Gallagher wonders whether her own romance would have been against the rules. She has been married for 30 years to Martin Jay, a professor of European intellectual history. They met on campus in 1970, when she was a graduate student of English -- not his student -- and he was an assistant professor in the history department. But since her speciality is British literature and history, Professor Gallagher wonders if someone could have said that her future husband might have "reasonably expected" to have academic responsibility for her at some point.
In a letter to the administration, the Berkeley faculty members argued that the policy goes too far. They said it would be more realistic to assume that there will be faculty members and students who enter into relationships, and to allow faculty members who do so to recuse themselves from evaluating or supervising the students.
Arguing that there are many examples of faculty-student relationships that have been conducted responsibly, it cites one of the longest and best known: the marriage of Kitty and John Kenneth Galbraith, which began more than 50 years ago. Mr. Galbraith is Harvard's celebrated professor emeritus of economics.
Even students, who at Berkeley in the 1980's were pressing for sexual harassment policies, are questioning the necessity of the new rules. The Daily Californian, the student newspaper here, said in an editorial that the new policy failed to recognize "that each of these relationships is between two consenting adults," and said that it "portrays students as timid and in need of protection."
"It's like saying I can't make choices about who I want to date," said Virginia Griffey, a 23-year-old undergraduate who is a member of the paper's editorial board.
Almost no one thinks that romantic or sexual relationships between professors and their own students are a good idea. Nor do most people believe they are common.
But these relationships have always existed. In fact, they are reflected in an entire body of literature, from poems about the medieval French lovers Abelard and Heloise to Anne Bernays's satiric 1989 novel, "Professor Romeo."
The policy at the University of California grew out out of a discussion initiated two years ago by a university regent, Judith Hopkinson. Professor Binion said that she and Ms. Hopkinson had both assumed that such a policy existed, and were surprised when they learned that only an informal prohibition was in place.
Professor Binion said that nothing in the new policy was intended to keep faculty members and students from going out for coffee -- or even a glass of wine. "Any kind of nonamorous, nonromantic, nonsexual relationships are fine," she said. "People know the difference."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
A survey finds that relations between agencies and clients are tense in a tough economy.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE latest results from a closely followed annual survey of advertiser-agency relations would most likely give pause to even the most persistent Pollyanna.
 In the survey, to be released today, many measurements intended to assess the strength, effectiveness and amity of the relationships between agencies and clients are at or near record lows. The consequences are serious, according to the survey, because they contribute to a waning belief in the efficacy of advertising among marketers -- an ominous trend for agencies, whether led by optimists or pessimists. 
 The primary culprit for the increased tensions, the survey reported, is the economy, which is in its third year of disappointing Madison Avenue with setbacks like reduced client spending and increased layoffs. 
"Everything comes back to the economy," said Nancy L. Salz, president of Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, which has sponsored the survey since 1986.
"It's a tough, tough world out there," Ms. Salz said, "tough for both sides."
Asked when results might start to improve, Ms. Salz replied, "Who knows?"
Indeed, a survey recently released by the American Advertising Federation in Washington echoed her uncertainty. While 54 percent of the top advertising executives surveyed by the federation said the industry was slowly recovering from its prolonged slump, they also said they doubted that strong growth would come anytime soon.
Ten percent of those responding to the federation survey said they thought that while the industry's decline had reached bottom, any recovery was uncertain. Only 16 percent of respondents said they thought the industry was recovering well and anticipated strong growth.
In reviewing the results of the 2003 Salz Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations, as the Salz study is formally titled, Ms. Salz said the principal difference was that "last year, agencies were feeling the effects of the economy more than advertisers, but now, the advertisers have caught up -- or 'caught down' -- to the agencies."
When advertisers were asked how much sales could improve if their agencies were always able to do the best possible work, the mean figure the respondents gave was 20.8 percent. That was the third-lowest figure recorded for that question since the survey began, behind only the 20.2 percent of 1989 and the 20.4 percent of last year. As recently as 2001, the figure was as high as 27.7 percent.
"It's two years in a row of lower expectations among advertisers of what advertising can do for them," said Ms. Salz, whose company offers training seminars on advertising development and agency relations for marketers like American Express, Clorox, the T-Mobile division of Deutsche Telekom and Toyota Motor.
Also, when advertisers were asked to rate the quality of work from their agencies on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 as high, the mean rating remained low, at 7.2. While that was a slight improvement from the 7.1 registered last year, it was still a comedown from the record of 7.5 set in 1986 and matched in 1996.
On the other side, when agency executives were asked for the percentage of major clients for which they were they able to do their best work, the response was 56.6 percent. Not only was that a historically low figure, it represented a significant decline from the response last year of 69 percent, which also happened to be the record high figure for the question since the survey began.
The increasing discord between advertisers and agencies is also evident in the responses to questions that both sides were asked.
For instance, when asked whether there was more teamwork in their relationships than last year, 50 percent of the advertisers agreed and only 29 percent of the agencies agreed. That gap was the largest for the question since 1999 and an increase of 16 percentage points from last year, when 46 percent of advertisers agreed and 41 percent of agencies agreed.
When both sides were asked whether there was more of a focus on money issues in their relationships than last year, 61 percent of the advertisers agreed, the highest figure by far for that question, and an increase of 12 percentage points from last year -- and 29 points since 2000.
By comparison, when agencies were asked the same question, 77 percent agreed there was more of a focus on money issues than last year, a slight rise from the 76 percent figure in the 2002 survey.
"I know marketers are very concerned about what they're paying their agencies," Ms. Salz said, "but there are some things they can also do internally to reduce costs" rather than dwell on the issue with the agenciesand risk intensifying the tensions as well as diminishing the ability to work together to create effective ads.
And when both advertisers and agencies were asked whether the agencies were more focused on client needs than last year, only 30 percent of advertisers agreed, "the lowest number in 10 years," Ms. Salz said, and down sharply from the 49 percent figure registered in the 2002 survey.
When the agencies responded to the same question, 59 percent this year agreed, compared with 52 percent last year. That means a slight difference of 3 percentage points has widened in a year to a chasmlike 29 percentage points.
Despite the fact the survey "does not reveal a pretty picture this year," Ms. Salz said, she found some encouraging results. For example, advertisers and agencies agreed that the costs to develop ads would decline if they could work together more productively, with the advertisers estimating a savings of 17 percent and the agencies a savings of 23.5 percent.
And both sides agreed that the major reasons for higher ad-development costs could be found in the executive suites of the advertisers rather than the agencies. Among the problems both cited: too many rounds of creative revisions, too many approval levels for creative changes and too many disagreements about strategy as well as the creative elements of the ads.
The survey was conducted in May for Salz by Thurm Marketing and Consulting in Princeton, N.J.

HEADLINE: Out of the Shadows 

 BODY:
With the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, immigration reform in America came to a halt. The emphasis understandably shifted from inclusiveness to security and the failures of the immigration service. For the estimated six million illegal immigrants who are here to find work or a better life, any hope for a guest worker program or an easier time for their children was stalled aswell. Only now, two years later, is there some chance that Congress might focus on needed immigration reform. 
 About 900 immigrant workers, some of them undocumented, have been crossing the country by bus this past week to tell their stories. Calling their trek the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride, they were motivated in part by the brutal deaths of more than 145 migrants last year trying to cross the border. The workers also need relief from employers who mistreat those in a shadow economy. 
 There are important new ideas in Congress about how to improve the system. One, the "Ag Jobs" bill, would streamline the nation's failing program for bringing in temporary farm workers. The other, known as "The Dream Act," would help children of illegal aliens gain access to college and become legal.
The agricultural jobs bill is considered a model that could help offer ways to bring in guest workers for other segments of the economy. The result of years of negotiations and debate among unions, agricultural interests and workers' rights advocates, this bill now has wide support. The Senate version is co-sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, and Senator Larry Craig, a conservative Republican. 
More comprehensive reform should be the goal for an inadequate system. But change on such a scale requires far more debate. Meanwhile, Congress and the White House should start with proposals for agricultural workers and immigrants' children that already have strong bipartisan support.

Yen Declines After Japan Moves to Stem Its Rise

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The yen fell against the dollar in New York trading yesterday after Japan's Ministry of Finance sold yen to stem a gain that had pushed the currency to its highest since December 2000.
 The transactions, conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, came after an earlier round of sales in Asia. 
 Japanese officials are concerned that a too rapid rise in the yen will make the nation's products more expensive for United States consumers and hurt the Japanese economy, which is recovering from its third recession in a decade. 
Japan's "main policy tool is to keep a weak yen and keep the economic recovery sustained," said Larry Brickman, a currency strategist in New York at the Bank of America Corporation.
Japan's currency strengthened to 111.42 in New York, from 110.91 on Monday.
A Ministry of Finance official said he could not comment on the size of the sales. 
A Fed spokeswoman, Linda Ricci, declined to comment on whether the central bank was buying dollars. The United States Treasury also declined to comment on the situation. 
Japan refrained from yen sales leading up to and after the Sept. 20 meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations. The ministers called for less government manipulation of exchange rates. 
Yesterday's sales show that Japan's tolerance for a stronger yen has limits, analysts said.
"There used to be a line drawn in the sand around 115" yen, Mr. Brickman said. "The pain under 110 is too much for them to handle" and be able to "keep their economy alive," he said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Slips To Its LowestSince March 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in September as the economy's failure to generate jobs raised questions about whether the expansion can be sustained, a report showed yesterday.
 The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped to 76.8 in September, the lowest since the war in Iraq began in March, from a revised 81.7 in August. The percentage of people who saw jobs as hard to get rose to 35.3 percent, the highest since December 1993. 
 In another report, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its factory index declined to 51.2 from the August reading of 58.9, which was the highest since May 2002. The index has been above 50, meaning business expanded at the region's factories, for five consecutive months.
"The experience of the last 15 to 20 years makes me hopeful" for the future of manufacturing in the Midwest, Michael H. Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a speech yesterday. 
"I have witnessed a heroic turnaround which the Midwest pulled off following the dismal years of the early 1980's," he said, when "many of the issues" were the same as today.
Consumers, whose spending accounts for 70 percent of the economy, have helped underpin the expansion this quarter. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said September sales were at the high end of forecasts, rising as much as 5 percent, and a Commerce Department report on Monday showed that consumer spending rose 0.8 percent in August.
The pace of layoffs, however, picked up in late August as companies kept cutting costs. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise a tenth of a percentage percent, to 6.2 percent, when the September figures are released Friday. 
"The most important thing of all is that my customer is concerned about jobs, until you see unemployment going down and people see their next-door neighbors finding a job," Allen Questrom, chief executive of the J. C. Penney Company, said at a meeting of investors Monday in Lewisville, Tex.

HEADLINE: In Westchester County, the Get-Out-of-Jail Cards Aren't Free. They're Plastic. 

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS

 BODY:
A credit card is now good in Westchester County for more than a trip to the mall. When it comes to making bail at the county lockup in Valhalla, all major cards are accepted.
 County Executive Andrew J. Spano said Westchester was following the lead of a number of jurisdictions upstate. A spokesman for the New York City Department of Correction said the city was exploring doing the same in its system, which processes $36 million a year in bail. 
 "It's simply the trend of things," said Robert McCrie, a professor in the department of law, police science and criminal justice administration at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. "People going to church and synagogue can pay on credit, why can't people arraigned in court have that same freedom?" 
The Westchester jail uses Government Payment Services Inc. of Indianapolis, which charges the user a fee of 8 to 10 percent, said Debbie Conrad, a vice president and director of marketing at the company. She said it offers similar services in more than two dozen New York counties and 29 other states. Money is wired to the county's bail account, then sent to the courts and returned to the accused after court appearances are made or the issue is adjudicated.
The move beyond cash and its equivalents, like certified checks and money orders, has to do with convenience for the incarcerated and potential cost savings.
"We had people stay in jail an amount of time that was ridiculous," said Sgt. Donald Smith of the Westchester Department of Correction.
"You'd have a guy flying into Westchester County airport first-class, and he'd have a few too many drinks, get into a car, get arrested for D.W.I., and bail would be set at $1,000," he said. "But it was late Friday, and he'd have to wait the weekend in jail while his wife steamed up from Alabama." 
Mr. Spano said that most people who are arrested do not have enough cash in hand for bail, and the county, which had 8,229 people go through its jail in 2002, spends $250 a day to house each inmate. 
"That's not chicken feed," Mr. Spano said. He did not want to estimate the cost savings, because it is unknown just how many people will use credit cards.
Allowing inmates to charge their freedom, he said, goes beyond the issue of economics to one of fairness: if bail is set, efforts should be made to help the accused to meet it. "They shouldn't have to rely on someone else to get out if they don't have to," Mr. Spano said. The arrangement poses no great risk, he added, because those with bails that fit within normal credit limits are not generally accused of violent felonies.
While some bail bondsmen oppose the use of credit cards, Eric Paykert of American Liberty LLC in Queens said he does not worry about losing business, because those seeking his services generally face high bails.

HEADLINE: As Millions Die 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
A generation ago, Americans protested and held divestment rallies in a snowballing movement against the injustices of South African apartheid.
 These days, an incomparably greater injustice -- random sickness and death, often striking infants -- ravages South Africa. Yet the response in America and Europe, as in Africa itself, has been tepid. 
 The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, for years pursued a disgraceful policy of raising doubts about whether H.I.V. causes AIDS and questioning basic policies to confront the crisis. Even now, although Mr. Mbeki has largely backed down, AIDS sufferers are slow to seek treatment because of the doubts Mr. Mbeki has sown. 
Mr. Mbeki's know-nothing obstructionism has killed incomparably more South Africans than any apartheid leader ever did. 
South Africa announced this year that it will begin treating AIDS patients with antiretrovirals. I'll believe it when I see it. It is inexcusable that the country with the best medical infrastructure in Africa should also be the one with the most H.I.V. and AIDS sufferers -- and that in 2003 they should die untreated.
In America, we think of AIDS simply as an epidemic. In fact, like the Holocaust, it is a moral challenge to the world, one we are failing.
"It's mass murder by complacency," declared Stephen Lewis, the United Nations special envoy for AIDS in Africa, adding: "The time for polite, even agitated entreaties is over. This pandemic cannot be allowed to continue, and those who watch it unfold with a kind of pathological equanimity must be held to account."
AIDS is not only killing the sick, but also crushing the healthy. "There are two kinds of people here," says Dr. Marlin McKay, who treats AIDS patients in Johannesburg. "The infected and the affected."
Already, across southern Africa, a new kind of famine is spreading, as those enfeebled by AIDS can no longer work their fields or hold jobs. Those most vulnerable are the 11 million African children who have lost at least one parent to AIDS (the number is expected to rise to 20 million by 2010).
"Getting money for food and clothing is very difficult," said Thembi Mashaba, an AIDS orphan who now is responsible for her school-age younger brother and sister. To help pay the bills, she has found a boyfriend who chips in $27 a month to the family pot; such liaisons help women and children survive, but they also spread AIDS further.
"I'd say 65 percent of girls aged 14 to 18 sleep with older men for money," said Sandile Mohlape, a social worker in Sekhukhune, a rural area northeast of Pretoria. "We do not have 14-year-old girls sleeping with 14-year-old boys. No, the girls sleep with men who are over 30. They do it out of poverty, to get food to eat.
"They are aware of AIDS, but they need food and money, so they can't tell the man to use a condom. Most men won't use a condom. They say it is like eating bread with the plastic bag still around it."
Rape is common and deadly, for 45 percent of the rapists caught in South Africa have the AIDS virus. More broadly, social mores and institutions are eroding amid the desperation, leaving society increasingly a free-for-all.
"Teachers are asking for sex to pass a girl, or to give her a good grade," said Thulani Nkosi, himself a 10th grade teacher with H.I.V., although he says he has never done this himself. Ultimately, AIDS may leave some African countries as failed states; a World Bank study in June warned that if South Africa does not combat the epidemic, it will face "a complete economic collapse."
The little African country of Botswana is ground zero in the epidemic, for some 39 percent of adults have AIDS or H.I.V. You see its impact everywhere on Botswana's streets, in the form of cadaverous adults and children.
Yet Botswana is also a rare place of hope. It has led the way in Africa in providing treatment, and 7,700 people are now getting antiretroviral drugs to fight AIDS. Dr. Ernest Darkoh, who helps run the program, notes that of those getting the drugs, 85 percent have had the virus suppressed after six months of treatment. 
Botswana shows that millions of lives can be saved if only we act aggressively -- which simply raises the question: Why aren't we?

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Two in a Row: Market Posts Another Gain For a Quarter

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT 

 BODY:
The stock market yesterday posted its first back-to-back quarterly gains since its tumble began in early 2000, reflecting improving corporate earnings and strengthening global markets.
 Although stocks lost ground for the month, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 3.2 percent during the third quarter, adding to a 12 percent increase in the second quarter. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose 15 percent in the second quarter, gained 2.2 percent in the third. The Nasdaq composite index gained 10 percent in the quarter after posting a 21 percent increase in the previous one. 
 Led by information technology stocks, the gains put the market on track to make 2003 a positive year, after three consecutive years of declines. So far this year, the S.& P. 500 is up 13.2 percent, the Dow is up 11.2 percent and the Nasdaq has gained 33.8 percent. Analysts said they doubted that the fourth quarter would wipe out those gains.
In addition to stronger corporate earnings, analysts attributed the upswing to encouraging economic data, like growth in capital spending and continued consumer spending, both of which may have been helped by tax cuts.
Furthermore, most European markets edged up and Asian markets have had robust returns this quarter. For example, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks in Japan rallied 13 percent. In addition, Japan reported this month that its economy was experiencing an "incipient recovery" driven by capital spending. 
All of this bodes well for companies when they begin to roll out quarterly earnings reports.
"No matter how you slice it, we're in for some good earnings news here in the third-quarter reporting season, and I think it will continue into the fourth quarter," said Charles L. Hill, the research director for Thomson First Call, which compiles analysts' profit estimates and other figures. "My warning is that we are in a gradual recovery, more gradual than many people think."
Indeed, the market has most recently been drifting downward. All three major market gauges finished lower for September, reversing six consecutive months of gains for the S.& P. 500 and the Dow and a seven-month run by the Nasdaq. 
In trading yesterday, stocks dropped sharply, responding to a poor profit forecast from Sun Microsystems and some weak economic data. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said that manufacturing in the Midwest expanded less than expected in September and that the region's manufacturing plants had shed jobs. In addition, consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level since March, falling to 76.8 in September from a revised 81.7 in August, fanning fears of a retreat in the consumer spending that has sustained the economy. 
Many people remain on the market's sidelines, and analysts say these potential investors are trying to ascertain how much momentum is behind the economy's rebound or how healthy corporate profits truly are. For one thing, analysts said, the projections made by executives over the last quarter have varied more than during the previous quarter, and there is still a lingering question among many people whether companies can be trusted at all.
Some analysts also cited lingering concerns about the war in Iraq, while others said that last week's announcement of a cut in production by OPEC might be weighing on the market as investors fear the international economic consequences of a rise in oil prices.
"All these items lead to uncertainty, and uncertainty is not good for investors," said Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
"I think corporate governance is the most significant item," he added. "We expect to get a solid answer. We expect to get a truthful and valid assessment of the situation. If you don't believe in something, you can't invest in it."
Comparing the third quarter with the period a year earlier -- when markets were reeling over that summer's spate of corporate scandals -- the S.& P. 500 is up 22.2 percent, the index's best year-over-year return since the third quarter of 1999. The Dow, which had finished the third quarter last year at a four-year low, has also increased 22.2 percent; the Nasdaq, which stood at a six-year low, has risen 52.5 percent.
Of the 10 industry sectors in the S.& P. 500, information technology led the rally in the third quarter, increasing 10.8 percent. The materials sector, which produces paper, metals and chemicals, rose 5.6 percent, making it the next best-performing sector. That rise suggests investor optimism about home building and capital spending, some analysts said.
Telecommunications services, meanwhile, was the worst-performing sector in the S.& P. 500, losing 10 percent of its value; the decline was led by Qwest Communications and Verizon. Health care and utilities also put in negative performances.
Analysts said that the activity in the markets for Treasury notes and bonds, although volatile, also suggested that investors expected the economy to continue to improve.
The prices of Treasury notes and bonds rallied yesterday, pushing down yields. The rate on the benchmark 10-year note fell to 3.95 percent from 4.08 percent, while its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 16/32, to 102 17/32. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 4.89 percent from 5.01 percent.
But because rates are still near their lowest level in decades, economists maintained that the increases should still allow for an economic recovery by keeping the housing market brisk and encouraging consumers to refinance their mortgages for spending money.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: U.S. Must Counteract Image In Muslim World, Panel Says 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
The United States must drastically increase and overhaul its public relations efforts to salvage its plummeting image among Muslims and Arabs abroad, a panel chosen by the Bush administration has found.
 "Hostility toward America has reached shocking levels," the panel stated in its report, which will be released Wednesday. "What is required is not merely tactical adaptation but strategic, and radical, transformation." 
 The report added that "spin" and manipulative public relations "are not the answer," but that neither is avoiding the debate. A copy of the report was made available Tuesday to The New York Times. 
The panel warned that the war in Iraq and the intensified conflict in the Middle East had increased anger at the United States, and that people throughout the world were ignorant of or misinformed about American policies.
"A process of unilateral disarmament in the weapons of advocacy over the last decade has contributed to widespread hostility toward Americans and left us vulnerable to lethal threats to our interests and our safety," said the panel, the United States Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World.
Led by Edward P. Djerejian, an Arab specialist and former ambassador and White House spokesman, the panel spent several months surveying the American efforts to promote the United States' views to the world's 1.5 billion Muslims. Its 13 members, including academics, diplomats and writers, traveled to the Middle East, Asia and Europe.
The committee found that the State Department spent about $600 million last year on its programs to advocate American policies, and $540 million more for the Voice of America and other broadcast networks.
If the $100 million to expand economic aid in the Middle East is included, the report notes, the total is about three-tenths of a percent of the Defense Department budget.
Examining those figures, however, the panel found that only $150 million of the "public diplomacy" budget was spent in Muslim-majority countries, and most of that went to exchange programs, overhead and salaries. The government spent only $25 million on "outreach programs" in the entire Arab and Muslim world.
"To say that financial resources are inadequate to the task is a gross understatement," the report concludes.
Senior State Department officials said that they were very pleased with the report and that they hoped it would pave the way for increased financing for these activities.
The panel's recommendations -- including the establishment of a special White House coordinator for public relations efforts abroad -- come at a time when some American officials acknowledge that programs even in the last couple of years have been confused and fitful.
The Bush administration, for example, started a program called "shared values" last year, a series of television commercials showing that Muslims in the United States lead lives of dignity and equal rights. The advertisements were suspended after several Arab countries refused to show them.
Many in the administration were privately critical of the commercials, agreeing with Arab and Muslim spokesmen who said they were irrelevant to Muslim concerns about American policies toward Iraq and Israel.
The advisory panel said that it recognized that American policies might well be the root of the problem, but that Washington could do far more to present its side of the issues and rebut widespread misinformation among Muslims overseas.
In an interview, Mr. Djerejian, a former ambassador to Syria and Israel, pointed to the power of Arab satellite television, and the absence of American perspectives there. He said he was struck during a recent visit to Cairo when he saw a panel discussion on Al Arabiya television about the "Americanization" -- a code word for corruption -- of Islam.
"It was their version of our saying that extremists have hijacked Islam," he said. "But during that whole two-hour program, there wasn't one person who could in any way convey the American context."
Another panel delegate visited some of the worst slums in Casablanca, Morocco, Mr. Djerejian added. "She said it was your worst nightmare," he said of the delegate. "Those hovels all had no plumbing, but they all had satellite TV dishes. You know, Woody Allen said 90 percent of life is just showing up. In the Arab world, the United States just doesn't show up."
Mr. Djerejian said that compared with the early 1990's, spending on "public diplomacy" had dropped more than 30 percent in dollars, and probably closer to 50 percent in real terms. Compared with the high spending levels in the 1980's, at a peak in the cold war under President Ronald Reagan, the drop has been far sharper, he said. Mr. Djerejian was a deputy White House press secretary for foreign affairs from 1985 to 1986 in the Reagan administration.
The panel's recommendation may get traction, in the view of some of its officials, by invoking the crisis of the cold war. Its members and supporters note that the State Department has requested sharp increases in financing for its "public diplomacy" activities but has been rebuffed by President Bush's budget aides.
At the beginning of the cold war, the United States Information Agency was created to explain and promote American policies. The Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and other related entities were filled with programs and news reports.
There was no recommendation to revive the information agency itself, which was dismantled in 1999 and folded into the State Department. Rather, the panel recommended that steps be taken to coordinate public relations efforts with other agencies.
The advisory group's report, titled "Changing Minds, Winning Peace," was issued only four months after the panel was created in June 2003 at the request of Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia and chairman of a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee.
Mr. Djerejian, director of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, said he tried to pick a bipartisan cross-section for members of the panel. Among them are Shibley Telhami, a scholar at the University of Maryland, and John Zogby, an expert on public opinion in the Arab world.
The group's major recommendations, besides creating a new White House director of public diplomacy, were to build libraries and information centers in the Muslim world, translate more Western books into Arabic, increase scholarships and visiting fellowships, upgrade the American Internet presence, and train more Arabists, Arab speakers and public relations specialists.
A photograph in the report, showing a picture of the Cairo opera house, said the structure had gained credit for the Japanese for its construction, while the United States got no credit for building the city's infrastructure. A new consulate in Istanbul, it said, "satisfies important security concerns" but looks like a "crusader's castle" atop a mountain.

 BODY:
A Lack of Hiring Appears To Be Biggest Economic Ill
A lack of hiring, rather than a wave of layoffs, appears to be the main problem afflicting the American economy.
 Even as unemployment continued to mount, the number of jobs being eliminated last year fell below the level in late 1990's, according to a new government report. But the number of jobs that businesses created in 2002 dropped to its lowest level since 1995. Compared with the size of the economy, the rate of hiring was even slower than during the weak recovery of the early 1990's. Page A1. 

F.C.C. to Enforce No-Call Registry
Michael K. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said the agency would enforce the national do-not-call registry despite logistical complications caused by a federal judge's ruling. Under the federal regulations, telemarketers who call phone numbers on the registry face fines of up to $11,000 for each violation. C10.

To the Editor:
 "Big Increase Seen in People Lacking Health Insurance" (front page, Sept. 30) is only the tip of the iceberg. 
 An accompanying news analysis mentions increases in co-payments and deductibles.
Many people have inadequate or insufficient insurance. A tax credit will not help the millions who pay sales and payroll taxes but no income tax. 
Health care and prescription drug costs continue to rise sharply. Our politicians -- our leaders -- refuse to recognize that other developed countries have universal health care and much lower prescription drug prices. 
If Americans are not bright enough or motivated enough to develop a more efficient and more economical health care system, why not just copy and improve an existing system that works better?

HEADLINE: Australia Damaged By Drought 

BYLINE:  By KAREN MIDDLETON 

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
In a nation that calls itself the sunburnt country, it takes a mighty dry patch to reach the record books and knock farmers sideways.
 But the worst drought in a century -- even kangaroos have strayed from nature reserves to graze on suburban lawns in Canberra -- has throttled agriculture and undermined national wealth. 
 The drought, which has lasted 18 months, slashed farm incomes almost in half, to 7.2 billion Australian dollars ($4.9 billion), in the year ended June 30, according to estimates by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics.
Agricultural production was down 28.5 percent in the period, slicing one percentage point, or 7 billion Australian dollars, from gross domestic product. 
Though the dry spell may finally be coming to an end, with recent good rains in all areas except the north, the drought's impact will continue to be felt for a while, according to the bureau's latest forecast for commodity exports, released last week.
Annual farm exports are expected to fall by almost a billion Australian dollars in the year ending June 30. Crop exports are likely to fare better than exports of livestock products, which are forecast to slump 8 percent from the previous year, to 12.8 billion Australian dollars.
"The 'income drought' associated with the previous poor harvest will continue until farmers are able to market this year's crop," the bureau's executive director, Brian Fisher, wrote in a statement accompanying the forecasts. The effect on livestock industries "will linger longer," he said, as herds and flock are rebuilt.
Australia exports nearly two-thirds of its agricultural products, and the United States is one of Australia's biggest markets, accounting for 11 percent of Australia's total agriculture sales. In the fiscal year 2002-03, exports to America -- mostly of beef -- were worth $11.5 billion Australian dollars.
A rise in the value of the Australian dollar against the United States currency has compounded the difficulties of exporters, making their products more expensive and shrinking the return on what they manage to sell.
Additional drought-related costs also contributed to a slump in annual average income on the country's 135,000 farms, to 52,900 Australian dollars ($36,000) in 2002-03 from 97,000 Australian dollars a year earlier.
The scorching weather in New South Wales, the state with the largest number of farmers, forced many farmers whose livestock usually graze to buy feed. At a cost of 1 Australian dollar a day for each sheep and up to 4 Australian dollars for cattle, this has leached an extra $3,000 Australian dollars a week on average from these farmers' pockets.
In the last fiscal year, Australia has had to import 340,000 tons of feed, including 53,000 tons of corn, from the United States. It was the first United States corn exported to Australia in at least two decades.
As in America, agriculture is culturally significant here, though it accounts for only about 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product and 17 percent of its total exports. Wheat and beef are among the biggest exports; other agricultural exports include wool, cotton, sugar, fruit and rice.
At this month's World Trade Organization meeting in Cancun, Mexico, Australia joined with developing countries to argue against United States and European farm subsidies, saying such agricultural policies disadvantage its own innovative, efficient and unsubsidized producers.
In the driest inhabited continent on earth, remote areas accommodate huge livestock stations, running to millions of acres, though most agriculture is on the family farm.
There are United States players in the Australian market, too. Australia Meat Holdings, owned by Swift & Company of Greeley, Colo., is the nation's biggest meat producer and processor. Cargill Australia, a unit of Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, has big operations in oilseed and beef processing, flour milling and grain and cotton trading.
Cargill Australia's commercial manager, Tony Day, said this drought had been much tougher than dry periods in 1992 and 1981. "It's the worst drought in terms of production in crops that we've ever had in Australia," Mr. Day said in a telephone interview. 
On a 3,000-acre cattle farm called Garrawilla East in the state's northwest, prohibitive feed costs forced the owner, Robert Anderson, to make a heartbreaking decision. He sold off nearly all his herd.
"We couldn't afford to buy feed, and even if we could have, we couldn't afford to buy water," he said in a recent phone interview.
Having avoided overgrazing on his pastures, he was able to board stock for other desperate cattle farmers.
"Once we got past the fact that we'd sold 100 years' worth of breeding stock, we actually managed better than most," Mr. Anderson said. "At least we weren't staring at dying cattle every day."
He has now switched to boarding cattle for the longer term, trusting that other farmers will need somewhere to graze their stock in the wake of terrible losses of feed crops and the decimation of many pastures.
Crops harvested for humans were also hit hard. According to the National Farmer's Federation, production of wheat and barley fell 60 percent, and that of the thirstiest crop, rice, fell almost 70 percent in the year ended in June.
Though some agricultural prices rose amid shortages -- wool, for instance, climbed to record levels -- the need to slaughter livestock before the animals starved created a beef glut, causing meat prices to fall 9.2 percent. When Mr. Anderson sold most of his 1,500 cattle in March 2002, he says he secured only 700 Australian dollars a head, about 300 Australian dollars shy of a good year's price. He kept 300 animals to sell gradually when he needed cash and was dismayed when prices fell even further.
He said he still had 100 heifers, all now pregnant, and he planned to sell them with their calves -- or maybe keep some to breed.
The government estimates that until the retreating winter broke open the clouds six weeks ago, up to 70 percent of the country was in drought. It has made available almost 1 billion Australian dollars in farm assistance, paying out 235 million Australian dollars so far in direct income support, interest-rate relief, financial counseling and skills training to help landowners avoid having to sell the farm.
More help, though, may come from the Southern Hemisphere's spring, which has brought sustained rains and hopes of a healthy November harvest.
Early last month, the agriculture minister, Warren Truss, announced that while some areas might now see their best crops ever, the government assistance would go on for two years as the herds and flocks are rebuilt.
Mr. Anderson also qualified his optimism. His crops are green only on top.
"If it stops raining now, we'll have 90 percent of this state back in serious drought in a month," he said. "We're right on the cusp. A couple of reasonable falls in the next month to six weeks will take us over the cusp into a good season. They're predicting a worse summer than average this season. That could finish us off."

HEADLINE: Cap on U.S. Work Visas Puts Companies in India in a Bind 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Prasad Tadiparti, global general manager of human resources at MindTree Consulting, is working his way around what he calls "a logistical nightmare."
 He is trying to anticipate what skills his clients in the United States may need in the next few years and match them with the profiles of his approximately 1,000 software engineers and others. All this while factoring in how many are willing to travel, how many hold valid visas to work in the United States, and for how long. 
 The "nightmare" is a sharp drop -- to 65,000 from 195,000 -- in the number of H-1B visas granted for skilled foreign professionals. The change, effective Wednesday, is making the business environment tougher for Indian software services companies like MindTree. 
MindTree, which counts Franklin Templeton and Avis among its clients, will be competing with others in the industry for the tighter number of visas. If the visas are exhausted in the next few months, as some expect, services companies say that their clients' delivery schedules and new projects will be delayed.
H-1B visas are given each year to foreign workers whose specialized skills are sought by American companies. During the technology boom, the H-1B visa program, which allows foreigners to work in the United States for up to six years, provided a gateway for thousands of Indians who came to work in the United States, especially in Silicon Valley.
More recently, the number of visa applications has dropped. Last year, petitions for H-1B visas dropped by 75 percent, to 26,659, according to the American Electronics Association, a trade group that represents technology companies. The lighter use of the visas reflected the downturn in the dot-com sector and the elimination of technology jobs.
But critics now point to another visa, the L-1, that is used to bring in cheaper foreign workers who may be replaced once they are trained. Congress is also looking at the L-1, which has no quotas. The L-1 visa has grown in use, rising nearly 40 percent, to 57,700, last year from 1999, and some say technology employers are switching to this type of visa. 
According to an estimate by the American Immigration Lawyers' Association, there are some 900,000 H-1B employees in the United States, 35 percent to 45 percent of them from India.
The H-1B program became an issue as the United States economy softened and employment slumped. Critics of the program argue that American corporations are replacing employees with less-expensive foreign workers from places like India and the Philippines.
Some have even called for scrapping the H-1B visa program altogether, a move seen as part of a reaction against the increasing trend of sending technology and back-office jobs abroad.
Despite this antipathy and public outcry, American companies argue that the program is essential to help maintain competitiveness in the global economy.
In recent Congressional testimony, the chairwoman of the immigration subcommittee of the United States Chamber of Commerce, Elizabeth Dickson of Ingersoll-Rand, said the visa limit delayed the hiring of needed professionals. "We cannot afford to let arbitrary caps dictate U.S. business immigration policy," Ms. Dickson said.
But with Congress keeping the cap at 65,000, Indian services companies are scrambling to build teams of visa-ready people, said Laxman Badiga, chief staffing officer at India's third-largest software exporter, Wipro. Over 3,000 Wipro employees hold H-1B visas.
As Indian software services companies grapple with the vastly reduced quota ofvisas, American companies will have to figure out ways to collaborate with them to help manage a supply imbalance that is expected to emerge as the economy improves, said Atul Vashistha, chief executive of neoIT, an outsourcing advisory company based in Santa Clara, Calif. "We are already advising our clients on how to manage this risk scenario," he said.
For the Indian subsidiaries of multinationals like Intel, however, the impact of the reduced limit is expected to be minimal. "We see this as a bump in the road rather than something which will have a huge impact in the long term," said Ketan Sampat, president of Intel India.
But Mr. Vashistha's firm is urging clients like Cardinal Health and Exult to look at increasing the number of expatriates to help bridge the gap. "If foreign resources cannot be brought here, then take resources from here to the offshore location," he said.
The reduced visa limit may gradually diminish the United States' ability to attract the most talented workers, industry leaders contend. "With U.S. baby boomers retiring, and the number of tech grads declining, there will be an acute shortage of skilled talent in the coming years," said Kumar Mahadeva, the chief executive of Cognizant Technology Solutions, a software services company based in Teaneck, N.J.
As the economy recovers, industry executives envision an even more acute shortage of skilled workers. "If there are no visas to bring talent to the U.S.," Mr. Badiga of Wipro said, "American companies will eventually say, 'Let's go to India where the resources are."'

HEADLINE: Don't Forget Afghanistan 

BYLINE:  By Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware is the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With our attention focused on Iraq, we run the risk of overlooking the alarming deterioration of security in Afghanistan. In both countries, the projection of American military power was decisive, but we have fallen short in demonstrating the staying power necessary to achieve stability.
 Today, huge portions of Afghanistan outside Kabul have been ceded to warlords. Since March, the Taliban have embarked on a campaign of murder and intimidation, targeting humanitarian workers in an attempt to set back reconstruction efforts and to discredit both the government of President Hamid Karzai and the United States-led coalition that supports him. 
 Our troops, and those of our allies, are doing a remarkable job -- but they're not tasked with the mission of providing security for the Afghan people. The 11,000 soldiers participating in Operation Enduring Freedom are not meant to be peacekeepers. The only troops assigned to protect reconstruction projects, let alone civilians, are the provincial reconstruction teams, whose combined units number only a few hundred soldiers.
With chaos growing, reconstruction efforts have slowed. Humanitarian groups have withdrawn from Kandahar and other areas because their staff members have been assassinated. And Afghanistan has once again become the world's foremost supplier of opium. The harvest of 2002 was 20 times as large as it was in the last year of Taliban rule, and drug profits last year dwarfed both the central government's budget and international reconstruction funds. That kind of money buys a lot of cooperation -- and the terrorists know it.
Of President Bush's $87 billion proposal for the military protection and reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, he has allocated $1.2 billion for Afghanistan -- a sum that does not even match the amount pumped into the economy by the drug trade. What's more, a third of this is recycled money: funds raided from existing accounts, like a desperately needed program for embassy construction. That leaves a mere $800 million in new money.
Inadequate funding is just one way the president has failed to make good on his pledge of a Marshall Plan for Afghanistan. He has also failed to provide the leadership necessary to encourage the rest of the world to join in the rebuilding effort.
The best way to bring stability to Afghanistan is finally to expand the United Nations-mandated International Security Assistance Force. The force is now permitted to operate only in the capital; because of its presence there, Kabul is one of the few secure sites in Afghanistan. While President Karzai and Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, have called for an expansion of the force, the Bush administration has been slow to endorse such a move, citing the reluctance of other countries to supply troops.
NATO allies must wonder why we can't take "yes" for an answer. Last month, for example, Germany approved plans to take over peacekeeping operations in the cities of Kunduz and Herat. The more countries that join in, the better. After all, every German, French or Turkish soldier deployed to bring security to the Afghan countryside potentially frees up an American soldier to hunt down Al Qaeda -- or maybe even to come home sooner.
With United States support, the United Nations can expand the security force almost immediately. The money is there. Under the 2002 Afghanistan Freedom Support Act, Congress authorized $1 billion for the expansion of the security assistance force. All the administration has to do is request its appropriation. It seems a reasonable price to pay to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a failed state and a haven for terrorists.

HEADLINE: Rules That Work 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has spent the better part of three years weakening federal regulations and belittling their value. Now, from a most unlikely source -- the fervently anti-regulatory Office of Management and Budget -- comes persuasive evidence that the health and social benefits of these rules greatly outweigh their costs.
 In a report issued last week, the budget office said that an examination of 107 major rules finalized over the last 10 years found quantifiable benefits of between $146 billion and $230 billion, compared with costs of $36 billion to $42 billion. Of particular interest was the finding that just four clean air rules administered by the Environmental Protection Agency -- all challenged at one time or another by industry -- accounted for a big chunk of the benefits. Designed partly to meet Clinton-era health standards, the rules limit emissions of soot and other pollutants from power plants, cars and trucks. These four rules produced even better ratios -- annual benefits of between $101 billion and $119 billion measured in terms of fewer premature deaths, hospitalizations, emergency room visits and lost work days, compared with costs of only $8 billion to $8.8 billion. 
 Whether these findings will alter the administration's suspicion of federal regulation is unclear. President Bush has rarely allowed science (or, for that matter, logic) to interfere with his policies -- witness his attempts to suppress or ignore alarming evidence about global warming to justify his cost-free strategy. Whatever the numbers, fundamental policy shifts are probably not in the cards. Even now there are efforts afoot to weaken rules protecting water quality, transportation safety and the public lands. Nevertheless, the positive results are now there for all to see, and it should become harder for the administration to keep blaming everything from the California energy crisis to the economic slowdown on environmental regulations.

HEADLINE: Air France and KLM to Merge, Europe's No. 1 Airline 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Europe's skies are changing, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Air France intend to stay ahead of the changes. They will create the largest European airline through the first major cross-border airline merger in decades, their chief executives said on Tuesday.
 The catalyst for the deal, they suggested, was a fundamental change in how air transport agreements were negotiated. The European Court of Justice ruled last November that the European Union had the power to override its 15 member nations' individual deals with nonmembers and negotiate open-skies agreements that cover them all. 
 Talks on a new Europe-wide agreement with the United States are to begin on Wednesday. And when 10 more countries join the union next year, the common air-travel market will widen further. 
"It's time for the airline industry to accept this European dimension," said Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chief executive of Air France, who first suggested the merger to his counterpart at KLM, Leo van Wijk, 21 months ago. 
Indicating that the day of national champion "flag carriers" was ending, Mr. van Wijk added, "All airlines know that the structure of our industry cannot be maintained." 
Borrowing from the consumer goods industry, Mr. Spinetta and Mr. van Wijk said at a joint news conference that their two airlines would form a holding company to be called Air France-KLM, but remain independently managed and preserve their distinct identities. The company would have three core businesses, they said -- passengers, freight and aircraft maintenance.
If the merger is approved by regulators in Europe and the United States, Mr. Spinetta would become chief executive of the combined company and remain head of the Air France subsidiary; Mr. van Wijk would be his deputy at the holding company and remain head of KLM. 
For Air France, the deal crowns a seven-year comeback from near-bankruptcy in the mid-1990's. For KLM, which has been struggling to reverse losses by imposing job cuts, a merger represents a quick injection of capital and a strong partner. 
For air travelers, little change is expected, at least right away. KLM will join the SkyTeam marketing alliance led by Air France and Delta, and its American partner, Northwest Airlines, will probably do so as well. Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands will remain KLM's hub, and Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris will remain Air France's.
Over the long term, the merger will probably speed the transformation of the European airline industry into something more like that in the United States, with fewer, larger carriers competing on more routes and restraining fares. 
Some executives and analysts said that deals like the one on Tuesday, with its focus on long-haul routes, would spur the growth on short-haul flights of newer discount carriers, like Ryanair and EasyJet, adding further pressure to hold down Europe's traditionally high air fares.
But others said Tuesday's deal seemed mostly aimed at market dominance. "Ultimately, it is an attempt to control the degree of competition in the market," said Keith McMullan, joint managing director of Aviation Economics, a London airline consulting firm. 
Likewise, Ryanair issued a statement saying that big airline combinations like that of Air France and KLM were "essentially anticompetitive" and would probably lead to reduced capacity and higher prices. 
Under the deal, Mr. Spinetta said, Air France shareholders would receive one share in the new holding company for each Air France share; they will own about 81 percent of the company. KLM shareholders will receive 11 new shares for every 10 KLM shares, plus warrants for additional shares that are good until early 2008. The deal values KLM at 16.74 euros a share, or 784 million euros ($913 million), a 40 percent premium over KLM's closing price on Monday. 
Not surprisingly, shares in KLM rose more than 12 percent in Amsterdam on Tuesday, while Air France shares fell 4 percent in Paris.
Philip Butterworth-Hayes, editor of Jane's Airport Review, noted that airlines from Denmark, Sweden and Norway successfully combined after World War II to form SAS, and said that the merger announced on Tuesday would be groundbreaking for the industry as well and "could lead to major changes." 
Europe these days is scattered with small national airlines, many of them losing money or only marginally profitable, like Iberia of Spain, Olympic Airways of Greece, Aer Lingus of Ireland and TAP of Portugal, and their future is uncertain. In the 1990's, Swissair tried to stitch together a Europe-wide network by buying stakes in such carriers, but it was blocked from taking majority control and ultimately collapsed under the weight of their losses, especially those of the Belgian carrier Sabena. A reconfigured carrier, Swiss International Airlines, has assumed some of Swissair's old role. 
The Air France-KLM deal was a setback for Alitalia, a longtime money loser, which owns 2 percent of Air France and had been pressing to be included.
Mr. Spinetta -- who held joint news conferences on Tuesday with Mr. van Wijk at both Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle Airports today -- said that Air France and KLM had signed new cooperation agreements with Alitalia that would, among other things, combine all three airlines' cargo businesses. Alitalia said it hoped to join the merger before long, but Mr. Spinetta would not say whether or when that might happen. 
Even so, a chart of the new company's network, displayed at the news conferences, showed Milan as a hub along with Schiphol and de Gaulle, illustrating the challenge that the merger poses to British Airways, which the new company would eclipse in size, and to Lufthansa, the next largest in Europe.
Mr. Spinetta said the new network was meant to match that of British Airways, which is building a hub network around London's Heathrow, Madrid (home of Iberia, one of its closer partners), and Zurich (home of Swiss International, which announced an alliance with British Airways last week).
Similarly, Lufthansa has built a hub network around Frankfurt, Munich, Copenhagen and Vienna. 
Already, Mr. Spinetta said, some 54 percent of all European long-distance air traffic is concentrated at the four busiest airports -- Heathrow, Frankfurt, Paris and Schiphol -- and that trend is expected to continue. 
Air France-KLM would be the world's largest carrier by revenue, with a combined 19.2 billion euros ($22.4 billion) and a combined 58.8 million passengers a year. Measured by passenger-miles, it would rank third worldwide after American Airlines and United Airlines.
The merger would effectively end KLM's 84-year history as an independent airline. The new shares issued to buy it would dilute the French government's stake to 44 percent, from 54 percent of Air France now -- a concession to Dutch sensibilities.
To protect KLM's landing rights under existing agreements, a majority of the voting rights, though not the equity, in the KLM subsidiary would be held for three years by the Dutch government and two Dutch foundations, keeping it technically Dutch. Some analysts saw the seeds of future governance problems in the arrangement, but Mr. van Wijk said that there was no risk and that KLM's management had "always been driven by economic interests."

HEADLINE: A Slowing Stream of New Jobs Gives a Full Picture of a Slump 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
A lack of hiring, rather than a wave of layoffs, appears to be the main problem afflicting the American economy.
 Even as unemployment continued to mount last year, the number of jobs being eliminated fell below the level in the late 1990's, according to a new government report. But the number of jobs that businesses created in 2002 dropped to its lowest level since 1995. Compared with the size of the economy, the rate of hiring was even slower than during the weak recovery of the early 1990's. 
 The results come from a survey that the Bureau of Labor Statistics published for the first time yesterday, offering a fuller picture of the nation's long jobs slump. The government previously reported only the net change in employment, which does not explain whether a weak job market like the current one stems mainly from layoffs or from companies' unwillingness to hire.
The new numbers portray an economy stuck in neutral, with workers no longer losing their jobs at the rapid pace of 2001 but with relatively few new job opportunities popping up. In the last three months of 2002, 7.8 million jobs were eliminated, while 7.7 million were created, according to company records studied by the bureau. 
"You get a picture of a job market where employers, nervous about undertaking new labor costs in the face of weak demand, are very reticent about hiring," said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington.
The absence of new jobs means that conditions have not improved for people entering the work force, like graduating college students. But the drop in layoffs since 2001 has clearly helped many workers, sparing them the financial and emotional pain of job loss.
This could be one reason that polls show Americans remaining more upbeat about the economy than they were in the wake of recessions during the 1980's and 1990's, analysts said. The difference in attitudes could benefit President Bush in his re-election campaign and damp the effect of criticism by Democrats challenging his economic stewardship. 
"Most people feel pretty confident in their job," said Karlyn H. Bowman, a public opinion expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. "It's what they see in the larger economy that concerns them."
"It's a complicated situation for the administration," she added.
On the campaign trail and Capitol Hill, the Democrats have continually criticized the administration for the net loss of 2.7 million jobs since the start of 2001. The detailed new data lays out a more nuanced picture of the hiring and firing that produced that net job loss, the worst in 20 years.
Economists warn that the combination of meager job creation and mild job elimination is usually a symptom of a sickly economy. During the economic boom of the 90's, a cycle often described as "creative destruction" seemed to take hold, with the number of jobs eliminated by layoffs or plant closings continuing to rise, but not nearly as fast as new jobs were being added.
By the end of 2002, the pace of layoffs was near its low point for the last 10 years, relative to the economy's size. The data released yesterday covers a period from 1992 to 2002.
"Lots of jobs get destroyed when the economy is doing well because people will do risky things and take chances," said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard. "And some will fail."
In the 1990's, employment in many parts of the country where large numbers of jobs were eliminated -- like the Washington suburbs, Detroit and Cincinnati -- actually rose more quickly than in cities that experienced less job destruction, like Baltimore and Allentown, Pa., according to R. Jason Faberman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Today, the stagnation of those cities struggling to add jobs has spread across much of the country, and many people looking for work have found only disappointment.
The average length of unemployment has jumped to about 19 weeks from roughly 13 weeks during the late 1990's, according to the Labor Department. The number of applications to law school and medical school has soared as college graduates have struggled to find work. The rare businesses that are adding to their payrolls have been inundated with applications. 
When Charles River Apparel, a small company based in Medford, Mass., that makes pullover jackets and other outerwear, recently advertised an opening for a sales manager, it received about 1,000 resumes, said Barry S. Lipsett, the company's president. While only a few years ago Charles River struggled to fill its ranks, from executive to warehouse worker, now the company receives phone calls and resumes from job seekers even when it has not listed an opening.
"People are calling us unsolicited," said Mr. Lipsett, who oversees a work force of about 65, up from 55 a year ago. "That's the most amazing thing."
Economists attribute the hiring slump to both the aftermath of the 1990's bubble in stocks and technology spending and the whipsaw nature of economic growth during the last two years. The bubble left many companies with more workers than they needed, while the economy's uncertain path since 2001 has made many executives reluctant to make the costly decision to hire a new employee.
The popularity of cost-cutting in corporate America, relative to earlier decades, also seems to be playing a role, said Erica L. Groshen, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
"Employers now see a downturn as a mandate to lower costs," Ms. Groshen said. "They're making permanent changes," she said, instead of quickly hiring back workers once a recession is over.
The most recent recession ended in November 2001, but net job losses have continued since then, as growth has remained tepid and many companies have figured out ways to increase production without adding workers.
The new report almost certainly understates the amount of churning in the economy because it is based on the number of people employed at a job site at the end of each quarter. If a job changes hands during the quarter, or is eliminated and replaced by another job, it does not show up in the data, said Richard L. Clayton, a division chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In the next six months, the bureau plans to release the data broken down by geography and by industry, Mr. Clayton said.
On Friday, the bureau will publish the most current picture of the job market: the net change in employment during September and the jobless rate for the month.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook; 
Good Cigars and Bad Communists

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Nothing seems to stick to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Democrats are throwing rocks, dredging up Mr. Schwarzenegger's past braggadocios about group sex, drug use and even the seduction of a best friend's girlfriend. Too far in the past, voters are saying. Old news.
 There may be no smoking gun, but there is a smoking cigar. Two weeks ago at the state's Republican convention, Mr. Schwarzenegger, a moderate on issues like gay rights and abortion, gave a speech to the party's right wing meant to prove that he is one of them. Mr. Schwarzenegger hates Communism, from the soles of his exotic cowboy boots to the gray roots of his hair. He told how as a boy he watched the Communists crush the spirit of Eastern Europeans. Like Ronald Reagan, he would fight them. Are there Communists left? 
 "There are a few in Cuba," his spokesman, Rob Stutzman, reminded.
As it turns out, Mr. Schwarzenegger prefers tobacco from President Fidel Castro's farms. But Cuban cigars are contraband. To buy or sell them is a felony under the Trading With the Enemy Act. Exceptions are made when travelers carry in less than $100 of cigars from Cuba. In 1996 in Cigar Aficionado magazine, Mr. Schwarzenegger recalled buying two boxes from a man, Mr. Habana, procurer of outlawed cigars to much of Hollywood's elite. In the article, the actor asked, "How do I know they're real?"
"My guys guarantee it," the seller said. "If you smoke two or three and don't like it, I give you all your money back."
A did not deny the candidate enjoyed a Cohiba now and then. The spokesman, Sean Walsh, asked whether hypocrisy was at work, said: "Not at all. Death to the regime. Power to the people." 
At the Fairmont Hotel here, Mr. Schwarzenegger said about Cuban cigars in the last seven years, "I get them as gifts when I travel overseas."

'The Collectinator' Speaks Out
Since his appearance in the televised debate last Wednesday, Mr. Schwarzenegger has been visibly pumped up. He is so confident on the stump that he speaks from the hip. Some in his party are saying he might consider a hip replacement.
Outside Fresno on Monday, a farmer asked him why the state needed its Environmental Protection Agency when the federal Environmental Protection Agency regulated many of the same areas. Mr. Schwarzenegger, crusader against waste, swelled like a water balloon.
"Overlapping agencies -- they cost a fortune," he said at a town hall meeting. "We have to strip that down and get rid of some of those agencies."
A spokesman, Rob Stutzman, was not around but still did his best to explain them. "We are looking at places where there are duplicate efforts," Mr. Stutzman said, adding that Mr. Schwarzenegger had no plans to eliminate the agency. 
On Tuesday, the Democrats made hay.
"He wants to cut agencies he can't even name," said Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, who according to polls, may soon be in the unemployment line. "It looks like he's changing his environmental policy day by day, depending on who his audience is."
At the town hall, Mr. Schwarzenegger also floated the idea that he would let Indian casinos expand so long as they agreed "to pay their fair share."
Should he win, Mr. Schwarzenegger must offer a budget by early January. As he has promised not to raise taxes except in case of an emergency, another man in Fresno wanted specifics. Mr. Schwarzenegger offered few. If elected, he said, he would morph into the "Collectinator" and demand that Washington return more of California's tax dollars to the state.

A Movieland Cavalcade
The campaign plans a bus tour starting on Thursday in San Diego and ending on Sunday in Sacramento. Mr. Schwarzenegger will ride a coach christened "Running Man," after his 1987 movie. Supporters will ride on "Total Recall," like his sci-fi movie where he kills his wife. Reporters will ride on "Predator" and "True Lies."

HEADLINE: The Iraq Reconstruction Bonanza 

 BODY:
Complaints about the $20 billion down payment that President Bush wants for the reconstruction of Iraq are going in the wrong direction. There's no question that the United States has an obligation and clear interest in rebuilding the country it invaded. The cost cannot be whittled down through political compromise or disguised as a loan.
 The real problem is that without strong legislative safeguards and oversight, billions of taxpayer dollars are sure to be wasted through insufficiently competitive contracts to politically connected firms like Halliburton and Bechtel. That has largely been the pattern until now. Congress also needs to make sure that reconstruction programs do not fritter away their resources by relying on expensive American workers and supervisors when qualified, reliable and currently unemployed Iraqis could easily do the work. 
 These issues need to be addressed through explicit language in the financing legislation now taking shape. Striking the right balance is going to be tough for lawmakers facing elections in which they will have to explain why they are paying for a new postal system or schools in Iraq when they are not paying for those things back home.
It is clear that the White House cannot be left to manage the process on its own. The Bush administration's promises of more competitive bidding and more use of Iraqi labor are welcome, but difficult to put much faith in. It is hard to enter the debate over postwar Iraq without tripping over a business associate or political ally of the White House.
Vice President Dick Cheney has insisted that he severed his financial ties to Halliburton, his former employer and holder of an exclusive contract in Iraq. Just two weeks ago, he said on television that he has "no financial interest" in Halliburton.
But a recent report by the Congressional Research Service suggests that this is true only if you don't count the stock options Mr. Cheney continues to hold and $367,690 in deferred compensation he has reported receiving so far while vice president -- on top of the $20 million severance package awarded in 2000.
Mr. Cheney's aides argue that he does not participate in the awarding of contracts, that he has insurance guaranteeing his deferred salary if things go badly for Halliburton and that he will give his after-tax proceeds from the sale of options to charity. But Mr. Cheney has not disclosed the full options agreement. His aides also note that he has complied with existing ethics rules. Unfortunately, that still leaves the unsavory image of the vice president cashing checks from a former employer while it profits from a huge no-bid contract.
On Tuesday, The Times reported that President Bush's former campaign manager and other businessmen with close ties to the White House have formed a business designed to use their connections to help other companies share the postwar bounty.
Senator Frank Lautenberg and other Democrats are right to call for hearings on Halliburton's contract. But Congress should look beyond that deal and work out fair and clear rules for awarding future contracts with public disclosure.
Unless Congress puts an end to this kind of profiteering, American taxpayers are almost certain to be saddled with much higher long-term reconstruction costs. The rebuilding of Iraq's shattered public services and vital infrastructure, already behind schedule, will be subjected to further dangerous delays. As the elections approach, Mr. Bush will find himself facing even louder demands than he's now getting from the conservative right and the liberal left to cut the nation's financial and military losses. Bowing to these pressures could have disastrous results. The faster Iraq's economy and society are restored, the sooner American troops can safely return home without leaving behind a new breeding ground for terrorism.

HEADLINE: Dean Struggles With a Stance Over Medicare 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 

 BODY:
Back in 1995, when a new Republican-controlled Congress was in a pitched ideological battle with the Democrats over the budget, Howard Dean was an iconoclastic, budget-balancing governor of Vermont and chairman of the National Governors Association, willing -- even eager -- to challenge party orthodoxy on spending.
 Dr. Dean said, according to news reports at the time, that he "fully subscribed" to the idea of substantially reducing the growth rate in Medicare spending and he praised that element of a Senate Republican budget plan that was vehemently opposed by Democrats on Capitol Hill. 
 He argued that "we ought to put Social Security back on the table " in an effort to balance the federal budget, and he suggested that Congress consider raising the retirement age.
He also sharply criticized the speaker of the House at the time, Newt Gingrich, on a variety of other issues like welfare and Medicaid. 
But today, it is his stands on Medicare that have resurfaced as a difficulty. Dr. Dean, after all, is a candidate running as the champion of the "Democratic wing of the Democratic Party," who has faulted many of his rivals for not holding the line against President Bush and Congressional Republicans.
Dr. Dean's opponents, who have researched his past, assert that the record shows Dr. Dean did not stand with his party when it counted on an issue of critical importance to older voters, who loom large in early primary and caucus states like Iowa.
Dr. Dean has scrambled to explain. In last Thursday's debate, when Representative Richard A. Gephardt and Senator John Kerry accused him of siding with Mr. Gingrich on Medicare, Dr. Dean flashed with anger and declared, "That is flat-out false." 
On Sunday's "Face the Nation," Dr. Dean said: "The person I supported was Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton signed a bill which was very much like what I was proposing."
On Monday's "Talk of the Nation" on National Public Radio, he said, "I was the first person to pick on Newt Gingrich when all the other Democrats in Washington were paralyzed."
Dr. Dean's allies argue that his views were common among Democratic deficit hawks in the mid-1990's, and among Democrats who worried about the long-term solvency of Medicare and Social Security. As one aide put it, Dr. Dean "was in the mainstream of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party." Moreover, Dr. Dean maintains that his views on reining in Medicare spending were eventually embraced by Mr. Clinton and codified in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. 
"I believe I'm a far-sighted person," Dr. Dean said in Iowa on Sunday. "I believe Medicare had to be saved and I supported the plan that Bill Clinton eventually signed."
The debate has become a war of old news clippings, many of them collected and circulated by the Gephardt campaign, which first raised the issue in in Iowa. That is widely considered a crucial state for Mr. Gephardt, now in a fierce fight there with Dr. Dean. The Dean campaign is now circulating news accounts of its own, which highlight Dr. Dean staunchly criticizing Mr. Gingrich and his "Contract With America."
The Dean campaign also released endorsements from fellow governors and a former longtime liberal member of the Senate, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio. "Eight years ago, when Howard Dean saw Medicare spinning out of control and facing bankruptcy, he joined with the Clinton Administration and key members of Congress in calling for cost controls," Mr. Metzenbaum said. He added that the efforts resulted in the 1997 budget act, "that balanced the budget, saved Medicare and laid the foundation for a strong economy."
But several veterans of the budget wars of the mid-1990's noted that there were major differences between the Republican plans for Medicare in 1995 and the one that ultimately passed with bipartisan support two years later. For one thing, the spending reductions in Medicare. were smaller. (An estimated $260 billion over seven years in the Senate plan in 1995, compared with an estimated $200 billion a few years later.)
Chris Jennings, Mr. Clinton's health care adviser, said: "Dean is right that the Clinton Administration desired to constrain growth in the Medicare program and strengthen the trust fund. But we did not embrace the magnitude of cuts advocated by the Republican leadership."
Robert Reischauer, who headed the Congressional Budget Office in the early 1990's and now is president of the Urban Institute, said: "There was a pretty broad consensus that Medicare spending would have to be slowed down. The program was careening toward insolvency, and there were many proposals to reduce the rate of growth of Medicare."
But when Democrats were confronted by the Republican proposals in 1995, "there was a feeling that it was too much and that it came in the wrong form," Mr. Reischauer said.
Other Democrats on Capitol Hill, who were reluctant to speak publicly about a candidate at the top of the polls in Iowa, argued that 1995 was a searing time for their party, when it had just lost control of Congress and when signature Democratic programs like Medicare seemed on the brink of wholesale restructuring.
At stake was not just a reduction in spending in Medicare, but whether it should continue in its traditional form as a social insurance program, those Democrats said.
In that context, one veteran Democratic staffer said, anyone breaking ranks and saying positive things about the Republicans' spending goals was "extremely unhelpful."
In his comments in May 1995, Dr. Dean praised the budget plan advanced by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, which called for reducing the rate of growth in Medicare spending by about $260 billion over seven years. A spokesman for Dr. Dean noted that the candidate supported Mr. Domenici's general goal on Medicare spending.
Like so much other legislation that year, the plan passed the Senate later that month on a largely party line vote, with the support of three Democrats -- Senators Charles S. Robb of Virginia, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, all known for their fiscal conservatism.
Mr. Kerrey, now president of the New School University in New York, said in an interview that "the essence of what Domenici was saying was right," that spending on Medicare had to be reined in, and that broader changes in Medicare and Social Security were essential to preserving them over the long term.
Mr. Kerrey, who has not endorsed a candidate in the Democratic race, added that such a position was "a difficult thing in a Democratic primary to defend," recalling the difficulties that the late Paul Tsongas faced in the 1992 race for the Democratic nomination, when he advanced similar positions. But Mr. Kerrey added of Dr. Dean, "If he gets through the Democratic primary he'll be much stronger against President Bush."
Dr. Dean has said that he no longer supports raising the Social Security retirement age. "I want to leave the retirement age exactly where it is," he said on CBS on Sunday. "That was a time where the budgetary situation was a disaster in this country. Bill Clinton has shown that when the economy gets better and people start paying payroll taxes, Social Security becomes solvent."
Nor is Dr. Dean now calling for any spending reductions in Medicare. Like the rest of his party, he supports adding a prescription drug benefit.
Dr. Dean has also been haunted by comments he made about Medicare in 1993, when, according to an account by The Associated Press, he described it as "one of the worst things that ever happened" and a "bureaucratic disaster."
His allies say he was simply describing the management of the program from a doctor's point of view. Bruce Vladeck, who was running Medicare and Medicaid at the time, said he remembers Dr. Dean "saying something gratuitous" about Medicare.
"It sounded to me like the complaints of a general practitioner, who really didn't know what he was talking about," said Dr. Vladeck, now a professor of geriatrics and health policy at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. "But he did run a really good Medicaid program."

President Bush raced across the Midwest on Tuesday collecting money for his re-election campaign, raising $5.3 million at two events, his record for a single day. Democratic presidential candidates raised money from Los Angeles to New York before the deadline for third-quarter financial reports. 
 Mr. Bush raised $3.6 million with a 28-minute lunchtime speech to 1,700 people at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. Later, he collected $1.7 million at a Cincinnati reception organized by Carl Lindner, the owner of the Cincinnati Reds. That reception, in Indian Hill, a suburb, was closed to the news media. 
 Between the two events, Mr. Bush had a meeting at the University of Chicago with the city's mayor, Richard M. Daley, and 16 Chicago businessmen. Mr. Bush discussed the economy at the meeting, which was considered a policy event, enabling the Bush campaign to charge taxpayers for part of the trip.
Mr. Bush's take put his total this year at close to $84 million, Bush-Cheney campaign officials said. His goal is $170 million or more. 
Howard Dean, the most prodigious fund-raiser among the Democratic presidential candidates, has raised nearly $25 million this year. 
For the quarter ending Sept. 30, Mr. Bush raised more than $50 million, while Dr. Dean had raised $14.7 million by midnight. Dr. Dean's figure beat the single-quarter record for a Democrat set by President Bill Clinton in 1995, and was close to his goal of $15 million.
Mr. Dean attended two fund-raisers on Tuesday night in Los Angeles. On Monday night, his campaign had held what it said was the largest conference call ever, connecting Dr. Dean with more than 1,400 fund-raising parties. He raised $500,000 in the hours after the call, his Web page said.
Dean has raised about $25.5 million for the year, almost certainly making him the best-financed Democrat in the race. 
The third-quarter financial reports, which track fund-raising from July through September, are a gauge of the political potency of the 10 Democrats. Candidates are releasing preliminary figures now, with official tallies due in mid-October.
Campaign finance experts and campaign aides say the Democrats will each need to raise about $20 million by the end of the year to remain competitive heading into early voting in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The candidates were candid as they sent e-mail messages to supporters and made in-person appeals at events large and small.
"Today is crucial in order for me to continue to run my campaign according to plan," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut in a note to supporters on his Web page. "We must show strength in the third-quarter financial report." 
He added that "this is by far the most important day of this campaign so far, and we have to make it a success." 
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, after less than two weeks in the race, expects to raise at least $2 million, a campaign aide said. The Clark campaign, like its rivals, is still tallying money; aides say the total could reach $2.5 million or more when counting is complete.
The general is attending several California fund-raisers this week, including one on Wednesday at the Brentwood home of the television producer Norman Lear. Because that is one day past the third-quarter deadline, many paid in advance.
Donnie Fowler, General Clark's campaign manager, sent an e-mail appeal to supporters Tuesday saying "we must have the financial support to keep this movement soaring."
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts raised between $4.5 million and $5 million. At $5 million, he would have raised $21 million for the year.
Mr. Lieberman raised roughly $4 million, which would put him at more than $12 million for the year.
Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who raised money in New York on Tuesday, is expected to take in $2.5 million to $3 million, a campaign aide said, putting him at almost $15 million for the year.
Richard A. Gephardt, the former House minority leader, did not release figures. He was criticized earlier this year after his second quarter totals did not match his campaign's predictions. He had raised about $9.8 million through June. 
Aides to Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who was fund-raising in California's Silicon Valley, declined to say how much he had raised this quarter. Mr. Graham had brought in $3.1 million through June.
Some of the candidates, including Dr. Dean and Mr. Kerry, are considering opting out of the public financing system, which would release them from spending limits in the primary. No Democrat has declined matching funds since the program began in 1976.

HEADLINE: Where a Fresh-Caught Fish Is the Best Neighbor 

BYLINE:  By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
THERE are several ways to consider the fish smell that hangs over the stone-paved streets by the Fulton Fish Market in Lower Manhattan. One is as a seasonal calendar, its pungency changing with the tides and temperature.
 On a wind-swept block near the market the other day, Gary Fagin, 51, offered a different take. Mr. Fagin, a musician, has lived near the market since 1986, and some neighbors refer to him as Mayor. He described the aroma as a kind of protective talisman that shields the tiny neighborhood of 19th-century brick warehouses against the invading forces of New York real estate. 
 "Tourists don't like the smell of the fish market," he said. "Wall Street traders tend to want newer buildings with more amenities. So what you have is a close, tight little community of people who are drawn to this." 
He paused. The Fulton Fish Market, which has been in operation since 1822, is moving to the Bronx, probably before the end of next year.
"It's the end of a history," said Nicole Bilu Brier, who lives with her husband, Greg Brier, and their 4-month-old son, Flynn, in a converted icehouse on Front Street. An ancient iron safe, too heavy to move, occupies one corner of their floor-through loft; they use it as a liquor cabinet. The market's aroma was no comfort when she was pregnant, Ms. Brier said, but it keeps the rents down. "We like the seediness of the neighborhood," she said. "There's fewer and fewer places like this."
To the untrained nose, the air carried notes of Atlantic coastal breeze, deep-water seafood and F.D.R. Drive exhaust.
In a pocket community distinguished by its resistance to change, the market's departure is just one shoe dropping. In June the city sold a strip of 11 abandoned buildings and vacant space to a developer for $5 million, to be turned into 96 rental apartments and retail space. After renovation, the 11 buildings will retain their low-slung 19th-century exteriors. The fish market site is part of a city-owned stretch of waterfront being considered for redevelopment, extending from the Whitehall Ferry Terminal to Pier 40 at the foot of Houston Street, according to Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation. Plans for the two fish market buildings, one with landmark status, are not yet settled, Ms. Patterson said. Private fish companies are also expected to vacate a number of commercial buildings across South Street.
The 38 acres that the New York City Landmarks Commission designated as the South Street Seaport Historic District in 1977 make up one of the oldest neighborhoods in New York, and at the right hour one of the most robust. The district, which includes the fish market, hugs the waterfront from John Street to Dover Street, anchored at the foot of Fulton Street by a mall of restaurants and stores. At last unofficial count the district had 200 to 250 residents, clustered in 15 or 20 buildings on 11 very unsquare blocks. Many residents are involved in the arts.
By day the streets are almost empty. But by night, in the hours of the fisherman's breakfast -- a delicate repast of eggs, hash browns, bacon, kippers, toast and whiskey -- armies of union workers stack 200-pound groupers along busy slips and salt the night air with baroque cursing that would make you believe the fish still come and go on ships. (Now trucks do the job.) On the uneven stone streets, these reefer trucks make a racket that could suck the sleep from the dead.
Mr. Brier, who owns a SoHo lounge called Groovejet, said he likes going home in the middle of the night to a neighborhood in full motion. "What you see between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. is absolutely amazing," he said. "There'll be fires in the trash and a guy with a gaff hook in a seven-foot swordfish. The integrity of the neighborhood is funky and cool. We don't want it to get too cleaned up." The inconveniences of the neighborhood, he said, "we hope will keep away the people we don't like."
The Briers said that when they moved from Chelsea last year, they were promised rent subsidies under a federal program to attract residents to Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Brier said they had not seen any money yet, but were enjoying other advantages of the neighborhood. Since the move, he has photographed the Brooklyn Bridge every day. "You really feel part of the water here," he said.
IN these transitional weeks between late summer and early fall, the streets feel languorously cut off from the bustle of the financial district or the tourist activity of the harbor and the mall. The scale is small, the action slow. The handmade brick on the buildings turns a soft pink in the afternoon light. At dusk, from the outdoor tables at Quartino, a Ligurian restaurant that opened on Peck Slip in 2000, the tall buildings of the financial district rise over the neighborhood like the illuminated screen of a drive-in movie.
Painted signs peeling from warehouse facades announce businesses long forgotten. Above a Beekman Street coffee shop called Pepper Jones, a sign for Meyer's Brand advertises fresh, salt and something-ed fish. The shop's owners recently announced plans to leave the city. ("A disaster," said one neighbor. "It's the neighborhood living room," said another.) The owners bought the building in 1997 for $450,000; after a $582,000 renovation, they said they hope to sell it for $2.25 million.
The people in the district have for 20 years fought a developer's plans to build a residential tower of up to 43 stories in the district; in April, the City Council rezoned the area to prohibit buildings over 120 feet.
Though some, like Mr. Fagin, welcome the prospect of new neighbors in the renovated buildings, they fear that the fish market, now the most distinctive element of the neighborhood, willbe replaced by generic stores like those on Fulton Street -- or worse, a giant hotel that would block their views of the river.
Richard Sack, an independent real estate agent whose office is on Front Street, said that the few co-ops or condominiums in the neighborhood sell for $700,000 to $1.8 million; rental apartments bring about $2,000 for a small loft to $6,000 for a large one. With the fish market leaving, he said, new residents and businesses are eager to buy in. He said he hoped the retail development coming to his block would not follow the mall on Fulton Street, whose stores, including J. Crew and Brookstone, might be anywhere. "How high do rents have to go before the only people who can afford it are Haagen-Dazs?" he asked.
Rob Barocci, a cinematographer who lives in a rented loft on Water Street with his wife, Angie Day, a novelist, said he is already feeling a pre-emptive "nostalgic sense of loss" for the fish market.
The loft bears subtle reminders of its warehouse roots, including steel pillars covered in red bricks. Most of the neighbors are artists or architects. The market, Mr. Barocci said, was part of what attracted him to the neighborhood. "I had an office in the meatpacking district, and that connection to old New York is already gone," he said. "What I love about the fish market is that it's one of the last vestiges of New York as a working city."
Like the autumn light, the gauze of memory and historic preservation can play tricks among these weathered streets. As is often the case, historic preservation here feels like a seductive oxymoron. The movement of history -- of boom and decay, not to mention organized crime -- is precisely what advocates would like to preserve the neighborhood from, as if history were a moment and not a sweep of motion.
For many in the seaport, historic preservation blurs with autobiography: you worry over the old buildings not to preserve the past, but to preserve the present, before the unknown arrives -- or more precisely, to preserve the present's relationship to the past. It is the present, after all, that is slipping away.
Yet history is nothing if not the process of change, and change is nothing without the force of rot. For much of its two centuries plus, the history of the seaport community has been one of cyclical decline and, in downtimes, abandonment.
In his classic 1952 New Yorker article about the seaport, "Up in the Old Hotel," Joseph Mitchell quoted the owner of Sloppy Louie's restaurant, formerly on Front Street, about the building's past. "The Fulton Ferry Hotel lasted 45 years," said the restaurateur, Louis Morino, "but it only had about 20 good years; the rest was downhill." (At the risk of giving myself away, I know how the hotel feels.) For Mitchell, as for the neighborhood, this was not an aberration but the rhythm of port history: one day you're grand, the next you're a flophouse for low characters.
In a loft building on Front Street, opposite the strip of buildings being renovated, Kit White, 52, remembered a more complicated past. When he moved to the neighborhood in 1974, following the lead of the artists Robert Indiana and Mark di Suvero, the landmarks commission had only recently spared it from demolition by the developer Atlas-McGrath. Most of the buildings were shuttered and rotting from the inside. With another artist, he bought one of those wrecks in 1977 for $45,000. The wise guys who played cards across the street assumed that Mr. White and his partner were a police surveillance team until they saw how hard the artists labored at renovation, Mr. White said.
Though friends thought he had left civilization, he said, before the United States Attorney's office cracked down on organized crime in the market in the early 1980's the neighborhood had no street crime. Sea gulls clamored around fish carcasses in the mornings; he collected the shells of clams they dropped on his terrace. There was only one cigarette machine in the neighborhood, so the artists, fishmongers and wise guys all lived in each other's orbits.
"New York just gets more and more sanitized," he said. "Things are more convenient, but it takes away a lot of the grit and the sensory experience." With his wife, Andrea Barnet, a writer, he found the neighborhood ideal for raising their daughter, Pippa, now 17. "It's like a small town, and the rest of Manhattan doesn't exist," he said.
Halloween remains the highlight of the year, he said, because you can see everybody in the neighborhood and visit every home.
Pippa was one of a handful of babies who were born in the neighborhood within a few months of each other and who grew up together. "I think I learned about the neighborhood most from Halloween," she said.
Father and daughter are both taking the loss of Pepper Jones like a tragedy in the family.
"I have been fighting for 25 years to save buildings in the neighborhood," Mr. White said, including the 11 buildings recently sold for development. "I have more than a little ambivalence now, because I know it will change the neighborhood."
"I don't know what it's going to feel like," he added. "Maybe the character will remain intact, and it will continue to attract the kind of person drawn to it now."
IN Mitchell's "Up in the Old Hotel," the owner of Sloppy Louie's enlists the writer to take an old elevator up to explore the Fulton Ferry Hotel, which has been sealed up for as long as the restaurant has been downstairs. After a few dusty minutes Louie has seen enough. "Sin, death, dust, old empty rooms, old empty whiskey bottles, old empty bureau drawers," he says. "Come on, pull the rope faster! Pull it faster! Let's get out of this."
The nostalgia of old places is comforting because it conjures a time without surprises. But real engagement with the past, as Sloppy Louie realizes, can be a fright.
Under the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, Mr. Fagin unlocked a small lot that the neighborhood had reclaimed as a community garden. He said he was not afraid of gentrification but rather "the quaintification of history."
The Brooklyn Bridge, which opened to traffic in 1883, first signaled the doom of the old Fulton Ferry Hotel, which lost its saloon trade as people no longer needed the ferries to get across the river. As for Sloppy Louie's, it is now an outpost of the Heartland Brewery chain, its business tied to the spotty rhythms of the tourist trade. A paradox of the seaport area is that it lacks a good seafood restaurant.
Mr. White said he did not know what he wanted to happen in the market's place. This time the residents are not fighting a developer or a zoning law. "We're all just in mourning," he said. "There isn't much room for fighting this."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Surge on Strength in Building and Manufacturing

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street rebounded yesterday as reports of growth in manufacturing and construction spending brought buyers back to the market after Tuesday's declines. 
 Analysts said the reports soothed investors who were nervous after a report on Tuesday suggested that manufacturing activity in the Midwest might be deteriorating. Many were also jumping back in after end-of-quarter window-dressing, when fund managers often sell to lock in gains. 
 "People were concerned that today's figures would be much weaker, but they came in roughly in line, so it helped support the market's gain," said Peter Dunay, chief market strategist at Wall Street Access, a brokerage firm in New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 194.14 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 9,469.20. The advance was the biggest point gain since June 16, when the average rose 201.84 points.
The broader market also advanced. The Nasdaq composite index gained 45.31 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,832.25. It was the biggest jump since July 7, when the index climbed 57.25 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.25 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,018.22. It was the biggest advance since April 2, when the index climbed 22.42 points.
The Institute for Supply Management reported yesterday that its manufacturing index stood at 53.7 in September. The figure was below estimates of 54.8, but it still reflected a growing economy; a reading above 50 indicates expansion.
Meanwhile, construction spending came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $882.7 billion in August, a 0.2 percent increase from July, the Commerce Department reported. The level was the highest since January although it was slightly below estimates of 0.4 percent growth.
Stocks have moved mostly higher since mid-March, but lately investors have been questioning whether their valuations might be too high. That led to some declines in September that gave the Dow and S.& P. 500 their first losing month since February; the Nasdaq posted its first monthly loss since January.
Jeff Swensen, senior trader at John Hancock Funds, said investors were still largely upbeat. He attributed much of the market's recent losses to fund managers seeking to dress up their portfolios before the close of the third quarter.
"People are optimistic that profits will continue to improve in the third and fourth quarter," he said. "That's overshadowing the recently weak economic data."
3M rose $1.83, to $70.90, after the manufacturing company's chief financial officer, Patrick D. Campbell, said 3M was on track to deliver earnings growth of 12 percent to 14 percent for 2004.
Clear Channel Communications gained $2.01, to $40.31, after the media company reaffirmed its previous third-quarter outlook.
VaxGen jumped 58 cents, to $12.65, after the company said it had won an $80.3 million federal contract to test a vaccine against anthrax.
Decliners included LaBranche & Company which dropped $1.23 to $13.37, after the stock trading firm said it expected third-quarter earnings of 3 cents to 5 cents a share, citing the weak trading environment. That is far below analysts' estimates.

Treasury Bonds Steady
By Bloomberg News
The 10-year Treasury note held neara two-month low in New York trading after an industry report showed an expansion in manufacturing slowed last month.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to a price of 102 18/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 3.94 percent from 3.95 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32, to 107 9/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 4.89 percent.

HEADLINE: Buyers Cash In on Offers to Keep Car Sales Strong 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
September auto sales slowed from August but continued to show strength, surprising analysts.
 Customers took advantage of the latest price war. Last month, General Motors was giving away Dell computers to Saturn buyers, in addition to the usual offer of zero-percent financing and big rebates that were heaviest on remaining 2003 models. 
 G.M. announced new incentives for October, including cash-back offers as high as $4,500 for the 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche. 
Decreasing market share and rising incentives were among the competitive challenges leading the United Auto Workers to concede to a round of job cuts in labor contract talks last month. The Big Three will look to close or sell about a dozen plants, and trim tens of thousands of jobs as part of the agreement -- cuts that some analysts think are not steep enough to make the companies competitive with the likes of Toyota. 
Ford is in the process of eliminating at least 10,000 jobs worldwide as part of previously announced cost-cutting measures and new efforts in Europe and the United States. In North America, in addition to cutting thousands of blue-collar jobs along with four plants, the company will reduce 1,700 white-collar jobs and another 1,300 unfilled positions. 
But continued strength in industry sales was a positive. Last month, sales rose 1.8 percent from a year earlier to a seasonally adjusted selling rate of 16.7 million vehicles, ending a strong third quarter. 
"This was above our midmonth expectation," wrote John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, in a research note, adding "September's sales didn't dry up after August's flood."
Sales rates in the mid-16 million range are considered robust, and analysts at Ford and G.M. said they saw encouraging economic signs in the results. 
"I think all of us feel better about the economic fundamentals versus where we were six months ago," said Paul Ballew, chief industry sales analyst for G.M.
But declining market share coupled with hefty incentive spending, has meant that profits and sales can be mutually exclusive for the Big Three.
"From our lens, it looks like there was a basic fire sale for '03 vehicles inventory during the month of September," said Gary Dilts, the senior vice president for sales at the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler. 
The industry's buoyant results, he added, were "again fueled by nuclear level incentives." 
Chrysler has been the most troubled on the sales front of late. The division managed to reclaim its traditional spot as the nation's third-largest auto seller after being edged out by Toyota for the first time in August. DaimlerChrysler over all, which includes Mercedes, is still further ahead of Toyota, which includes the Lexus brand.
Toyota sales rose 10.5 percent and Honda sales 0.9 percent and Nissan sales 19.7 percent. 
But Chrysler sales fell 15 percent. The division lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter and appears to be an increasing drain on its German parent, DaimlerChrysler. 
G.M. sales were up 12.1 percent, adjusted for daily selling rates, according to the Autodata Corporation. The company's market share, which is down for the year, rose substantially, to 27.6 percent last month from 25.2 percent a year ago. 
Retail sales at Ford were up 0.8 percent, though the company got some good news from one of its most profitable vehicle lines, the F-150 pickup truck. The new version of the truck helped the company sell more F-series trucks than it ever has before -- 81,782 -- though the bulk of the sales were 2003 models. 
The company said initial sales of the 2004 F-150 were skewing heavily toward the biggest and most profitable versions of the truck but it remains to be seen to what extent the trend continues. 
"Ford's numbers were better than I expected, G.M.'s also were, and Chrysler's were particularly poor," David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, said. "Chrysler has had a string of weak months. Their new model pipeline has been anemic this year."
The company said, in its conference, that it declined to match some of the incentive levels of Ford and G.M. But it also has a bigger surplus of vehicles on dealer lots than its competitors -- an 86-day surplus of cars and trucks, according to Mr. Healy, compared with 72 for G.M. and 65 for Ford. 
The market continues to tilt toward light trucks -- sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans -- and away from passenger cars. And with net prices falling from continuing rebates and cheap financing, consumers continue to show signs of using discounts to trade up to luxury brands.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Expands Again 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Manufacturing expanded for a third month in September, driven by the strongest growth in orders this year, an industry report showed yesterday.
 The Institute for Supply Management's factory index was 53.7, the third consecutive month of expansion. 
 Readings above 50 mean more companies reported growth than contraction. The index was 54.7 in August, and fell slightly because of a continued decline in the report's employment measure. 
Manufacturers have relied on productivity gains to meet rising demand for goods and services instead of hiring more workers, economists said. The decline came after a report on Tuesday indicated that manufacturing in the Chicago area in September expanded at the slowest pace in five months. 
"It's consistent with a steady but not spectacular recovery," said Richard Syron, chairman of the Thermo Electron Corporation, the maker of measurement instruments used in medical laboratories, and a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. "I think things are getting better." 
Economists had expected a reading of 54.5 in the factory index, based on the median of 60 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.
The Institute for Supply Management, which is based in Tempe, Ariz., surveys more than 400 companies in 20 industries, including clothing, printing, transportation, furniture and plastics. Manufacturing accounts for about one-seventh of the economy. 
Another report yesterday showed that announced corporate job cuts in September fell to 76,506, down 4.3 percent from August. Still, last month's layoffs were 9.2 percent higher than in August 2002, according to the report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago-based placement firm. 
A separate report yesterday showed that spending on construction rose in August for a third consecutive month as home builders filled orders that had been placed months earlier. The increase of 0.2 percent, to $882.7 billion at an annual rate, came after a 0.2 percent gain was registered in July, the Commerce Department said.

HEADLINE: DEBATING A LEAK: THE EMPLOYEE; 
Cover Story Kept Work For C.I.A. A Secret

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL and DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Valerie Plame was among the small subset of Central Intelligence Agency officers who could not disguise their profession by telling friends that they worked for the United States government.
 That cover story, standard for American operatives who pretend to be diplomats or other federal employees, was not an option for Ms. Plame, people who knew her said on Wednesday. As a covert operative who specialized in nonconventional weapons and sometimes worked abroad, she passed herself off as a private energy expert, what the agency calls nonofficial cover. 
 But that changed over the summer, when her identity as a C.I.A. officer was reported in a syndicated column by Robert Novak. 
Ms. Plame's husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a retired ambassador, has accused the White House of releasing her name as a way of discrediting Mr. Wilson after he had questioned intelligence reports that Iraq was buying uranium from Niger.
Mr. Wilson, who is 53 and was married twice before, met Ms. Plame, 40, in early 1997 at a party in Washington, he said on Wednesday in an interview in his office. A telephone message left at their house here was unanswered, and Mr. Wilson said his wife had instructed him to say that she would "chew off her right arm off before she talked to anybody from the press."
Mr. Wilson proudly showed off photographs of Ms. Plame, calling her a real-life Jennifer Garner, the actress who plays a spy on "Alias" on ABC-TV and whom the C.I.A. has enlisted as a spokeswoman to appeal to recruits. 
Mr. Wilson would not allow publication of the photographs and asked visitors to protect the privacy of their 3-year-old twins.
"In her business, people get very good about sticking to their story," said Mr. Wilson, who has told friends that when they were dating Ms. Plame told him about her true vocation only because he, too, had a high-level secrecy clearance, as a political adviser to the American general who was commanding United States forces in Europe.
With that story in tatters, Mr. Wilson said, "we were at a reception the other night, and all people wanted to talk about was her clandestine career."
"Basically," he said, "her comment was, 'That's not something I discuss, even at work.' But it's been difficult. You have to go back and say to people that, 'Well, all those years that you thought of me as an energy analyst, I was really something else.' You have to build back the trust."
A neighbor of the couple, David Tillotson, said on Wednesday that the news about Ms. Plame, although "an absolute shock," did not change his feelings about her and Mr. Wilson.
"They are the salt of the earth," Mr. Tillotson, a lawyer, said. "They're some of the finest people I've ever known in my life."
For the six years that they have been neighbors, Mr. Tillotson and his wife, Victoria, knew Mr. Wilson and Ms. Plame from pleasant dinners in each other's houses. 
The talk was occasionally about politics, but far more often about "kids and life and gardens," as Mr. Tillotson put it.
People close to Ms. Plame said on Wednesday that she was born in Anchorage while her father, Lt. Col. Sam Plame of the Air Force, was stationed there. 
Colonel Plame and his wife, Diane, also had a son, Robert, who is older than Valerie Plame and lives in Oregon.
Colonel Plame and his family moved to the lower 48 in time for Ms. Plame to graduate from Lower Moreland High School in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., near Philadelphia. She studied foreign relations at the University of Pennsylvania and then received master's degrees, one from the London School of Economics and another in international relations in the Netherlands, people close to her said.
Ms. Plame was married just after finishing her studies, but that ended in a year. She then worked in a department store before going into government work and what would be, until recently, a life under cover.
In recent years, her life has been divided. Friends said she had worked as a volunteer counselor for postpartum depression while seeing to her "regular" job at the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Va.
Mr. Wilson said on Wednesday, "Her career as a clandestine officer is over."

HEADLINE: Chinese Girls' Toil Brings Pain, Not Riches 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: ANSHAN, China 

 BODY:
Each eyelash was assembled from 464 inch-long strands of human hair, delicately placed in a crisscross pattern on a thin strip of transparent glue. Completing a pair often took an hour. Even with 14-hour shifts most girls could not produce enough for a modest bonus.
 "When we started to work, we realized there was no way to make money," said Ma Pinghui, 16. "They were trying to cheat us." 
 She and her friend Wei Qi, also 16 and also a Chinese farm girl barely out of junior high school, had been lured here by a South Korean boss who said he was prepared to pay $120 a month, a princely sum for unskilled peasants, to make false eyelashes. 
Their local government labor bureau lent its support, recruiting workers and arranging a bus to take them to the big city of Anshan in northeastern China.
Two months later, bitter that the pay turned out to be much lower, exhausted by eye-straining and wrist-wrenching work, and too poor to pay the exit fee the boss demanded of anyone who wanted out, they decided to escape. But that was not easy. The metal doors of their third-floor factory were kept locked and its windows -- all but one -- were enclosed in iron cages.
These girls' ill-fated foray to work at Daxu Cosmetics and their attempt to flee one moonless night in May illustrate how even rudimentary workers' rights lag far behind job creation and profits in China's surging economy.
While multinational corporations like Motorola and Intel pay employees middle-class wages to work in world-class factories in this country, the sizzling export sector still relies heavily on smaller operations, both locally and foreign-owned, that assemble toys, clothes, shoes, tools, electronics, decorative items and cosmetic goods. Many measure profits in pennies on the dollar and squeeze workers to make their margins.
Lee Yo Han, the South Korean entrepreneur who runs Daxu, says he came to China about a decade ago mainly because Korean companies could no longer compete in the market for false eyelashes, which sell for as little as 50 cents a set in Asia and the United States.
Mr. Lee, who is 39 years old and speaks only Korean, keeps costs down by finding cheap rental space for his 12 production lines. The plant where Ms. Wei and Ms. Ma worked, along with 100 other young workers from rural Liaoning and Inner Mongolia, occupied the third floor of an old mental hospital.
While he acknowledged the cost pressures, Mr. Lee said he provided a good work environment. In faxed replies to questions about Ms. Ma and Ms. Wei, Mr. Lee described them as callow girls who tried to slip out of a work contract they had signed voluntarily.
"I treat my workers like I treat my own brothers and sisters," Mr. Lee said. "My company is a small one, and the welfare can't compare to a big company's, but I tried my very best."
That is not the view of Ms. Wei, who has since returned penniless to her home village in rural Liaoning Province. "What they called a company was really a prison."
She is a stringy girl with a nervous giggle. Ms. Ma is corn-fed and prone to tears. But they grew up in nearly identical circumstances. Their families live in neighboring villages near China's border with North Korea, where green mountains, crisp fall air and scattered dairy farms are reminiscent of the New England countryside, though far poorer.
They first heard about the job offer in Anshan from an advertisement on local television. Salaries of $120 a month seemed high for farm girls, but the ad was sponsored by the Labor Bureau of Huairen County. The bureau contracted with Mr. Lee to find rural workers and charged a $6 application fee.
"If this had not been arranged through official channels, we would not have let such a young girl go," said Wei Zhixing, Ms. Wei's father.
As soon as they arrived in Anshan, however, the problems began. They were asked to sign a contract that offered monthly pay far below the advertised level, initially just $24, minus a $13 charge for room and board. Bonuses were promised, but only for those who produced eyelashes above quotas.
The contract also demanded that workers pay the boss $58 if they left before the end of the yearlong contract, and $2,400 if they "stole intellectual property" by defecting to a rival eyelash maker.
Such terms are not unusual. Court cases involving unpaid wages, illegal contracts and life-threatening working conditions are common even as China becomes richer, suggesting that cut-throat capitalism and sweatshop factories are as much a part of China's economic revolution today as they were in the early days of industrialization in the West.
Beijing often looks the other way. Despite a long streak of fast growth, generating jobs for the country's 350 million peasants remains urgent. At least 150 million rural laborers have no steady income, according to government estimates. They are viewed as a source of unrest that could threaten the Communist Party's power.
Making sure the jobs created meet China's own standards for safety and fairness is a lower priority. Officials rarely punish factory owners for labor abuses, and workers, restricted by laws against forming unions, rarely press for better conditions.
Ms. Wei and Ms. Ma, eager to prove themselves in their first jobs, accepted the contract terms. They said they hoped they could still earn good money if they could make enough eyelashes to earn bonuses. That was what they thought until they finished their first full day on the assembly line.
Using tweezers to lay hairs in an intricate pattern was exacting enough, but the boss also fussily threw away eyelashes that did not meet his standard. Bonuses kicked in only after the girls made enough to cover their base salaries. In the first month, that meant producing at least 400 eyelashes. Everyone fell short.
Off-work hours provided little relief. The girls were occasionally allowed supervised play time on the mental hospital's grounds. Otherwise, the factory doors stayed bolted and the windows were barred, ostensibly to protect the workers from mental patients.
The workers were permitted one shower a week, on Tuesday mornings. Ms. Ma and Ms. Wei said the factory canteen served the same porridge of cabbage and potatoes at every meal.
Mr. Lee denied that the girls were locked inside the factory, saying such treatment would have been illegal. He also said living conditions, including the food, "were better than what they were used to at home."
Whatever the truth, Ms. Wei and Ms. Ma said they told the Chinese boss at the site, Lu Shijun, that they were resigning. But Mr. Lu reminded themthat they would have to pay the $58 fee to end the contract. After room and board were subtracted, they would need to work three more months to afford to quit.
Ms. Ma and Ms. Wei said they called the county labor bureau that arranged their jobs to ask for help. They said they were told someone would be sent to deal with the problem. Weeks went by and no one came.
As they approached the end of their second month, they said a furtive escape seemed like the only option.
Late at night, Ms. Ma, Ms. Wei and four other girls who shared their dorm room plotted the details. They would bind their sheets into a long braid, climb out a hallway window, the only one without bars, then rappel three stories to freedom.
On the chosen evening, the girls slipped off the production line early. They frantically tied bedding together, playing tug-of-war to tighten the knots. They secured one end inside and hurled the rest to the yard below.
Ms. Ma climbed out first. But she had not considered what it would be like to hang in the air, feet flailing, hands straining to keep a grip. First she slid, fireman style. Then she lost control and crashed to the ground.
The other girls had no idea what happened until Ms. Wei followed suit. When she lost her grip and plunged, she shrieked. Both she and Ms. Ma sat on the ground crying until the others panicked and called Mr. Lu.
The boss sent them to the hospital, where Ms. Ma and Ms. Wei were found to have broken legs and displaced vertebrae. Even then, they described Mr. Lu as bitter.
When he left them that night in their hospital beds, they recalled him saying: "We're on the seventh floor. I suggest that you use the stairs, not the window, when you leave."
Mr. Lu could not be reached for comment. But Mr. Lee said his company provided good medical care for Ms. Ma and Ms. Wei. The two girls described the company as stingy and said their families borrowed money to pay their medical expenses.
Their case generated local publicity and prompted some official scrutiny. The assembly line at the mental hospital eventually shut down, with production consolidated in Mr. Lee's other plants. Mr. Lee declined to give a reason for closing the factory.
One Anshan labor department official, who spoke on condition his name would not be used, said the factory violated child labor laws. While the official did not elaborate, China's labor law bars minors between the ages of 16 and 18 from doing jobs "that require them to keep their heads down or to maintain unnatural postures."
Relatives of Ms. Wei and Ms. Ma said they were never contacted by authorities and were rebuffed when they asked Anshan government and police officials to investigate the case.
"My view is that Daxu was a black society set up to cheat people," said Ms. Ma, who now walks with a heavy limp as she helps care for the ducks and pigs that live in her front yard. "It would still be going on today if we hadn't jumped."

HEADLINE: The Health Insurance Crisis 

 BODY:
Even most experts were surprised by the sharp jump in the number of Americans lacking health insurance last year. The latest Census Bureau figures show that the number of uninsured jumped by 2.4 million, the largest increase in a decade, bringing the national total to 43.6 million uninsured in 2002, or 15.2 percent of the population. The ranks of the uninsured have increased by 10 percent over the past two years, with the likelihood that things may get worse this year. 
 The lack of health insurance, a problem once confined mostly to the poor and nearly poor, has reached into the lower middle classes, most notably to those earning $25,000 to $49,999 a year, and even to some above $50,000. It is a problem that needs to be addressed by Congress and the administration, which have thus far sat mostly on the sidelines. 
 Several factors are driving the expanding crisis. The number of unemployed Americans keeps growing in this jobless recovery, thus depriving many people of the opportunity for employer-provided health insurance. Even many full-time workers -- an astonishing 20 million last year -- lack health coverage. 
Many employers, both large and small, are cutting back on the health insurance they provide, either by dropping it entirely or by making it harder for employees to qualify. Some are requiring much higher contributions from workers, so many workers are dropping coverage rather than paying amounts they consider unaffordable.
Underlying the problem is the still-unsolved issue of escalating health care costs, which leave employers struggling to find a way out and individuals staggered by premium increases.
The state and federal Medicaid programs and children's assistance programs have picked up some of the burden by enrolling the poorest of the uninsured. But with virtually all states suffering budget crises and looking to Medicaid for cuts, that safety net is beginning to unravel.
While the number of uninsured has been climbing, Congress has focused mainly on a different issue: the effort to provide prescription drug coverage for the elderly on Medicare. That would add a benefit for millions of Americans who already have basic health insurance but would do nothing to help those currently going without.
Earlier this year President Bush proposed spending $89 billion in tax credits over 10 years to help Americans buy health insurance if they did not have employer-subsidized coverage or access to public programs, and Congress included $50 billion in its budget resolution this year for a reserve fund to address the problem. But neither the president nor Congress has shown any inclination to actually push those plans to fruition.
Health care seems likely to become a significant issue in the presidential campaign and the next session of Congress. At least six candidates competing for the Democratic nomination have put forth health insurance plans of one size or another, and various members of Congress have introduced bills to chip away at the problem. The worsening crisis makes it clear that ways must be found to shore up the coverage provided by employers and to help low-wage workers pay their share of the ever-higher premiums.

White House Seeks Funds For Iraqi Weapons Search
The Bush administration is seeking more than $600 million from Congress to continue the hunt for conclusive evidence that Iraq had unconventional weapons. A1

A team of economic specialists led by the World Bank and the United Nations has determined that Iraq needs $36 billion for reconstruction next year, in addition to the separate assessment by the American-led occupation of $19 billion for Iraq over the same period. A14

Two American soldiers died in Iraq in separate incidents, and protestors seeking jobs clashed with the police. One of the soldiers was a woman, the fourth to die in Iraq or Kuwait since the war began. A14

Israel's West Bank Barrier

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: BAGHDAD; 
Two U.S. Soldiers Are Killed in Iraq; One of Them Is a Woman

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Two American soldiers, one of them a woman, died in separate incidents Wednesday, the military reported, while Iraqi protesters clashed with the police on the streets here. 
 The woman who was killed was the fourth American woman to die in Iraq or Kuwait since the war began. She was killed in a bold daylight attack just outside a United States base in Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam Hussein, a military spokesman said. Her name was withheld, pending notification of her family. 
 A roadside bomb exploded as her convoy passed only a few hundred yards from one of three major bases used by the Fourth Infantry Division in Tikrit, Master Sgt. Dave Johnson, a division spokesman, said. "It was immediately outside the base, in broad daylight."
Three soldiers were seriously wounded in the attack, and the woman died as she was being flown to a nearby combat hospital, Sergeant Johnson said.
In the other incident, one soldier was killed and another wounded when they were shot with a small-caliber handgun while on patrol in the Al Mansour neighborhood of Baghdad, Reuters reported. 
Six soldiers have died in accidents and ambushes in the last two days, bringing to 315 the total number of troops killed in Iraqand Kuwait since the war began. Of those, 176 have died in the five months since President Bush declared major combat operations over on May 1. 
Another 1,703 soldiers have been wounded since the war began, said Maj. Mike Escudie, a spokesman for United States Central Command, which oversees troops in Iraq. 
In addition, a soldier was killed Tuesday in a "nonhostile" shooting at a base about 40 miles north of Baghdad, the military said. 
Two other soldiers drowned Monday night when the vehicle they were riding in overturned and fell into a canal near Abu Ghraib prison, just west of Baghdad, as their convoy responded to a mortar attack. 
A fifth soldier was killed in an ambush on Monday. 
Meanwhile, a midmorning protest in Baghdad briefly turned violent after the police said they fired into the air to disperse a crowd of more than 100 unemployed men angry that they had not been hired as government security guards. The police account was confirmed by several witnesses. One protester was slightly wounded. 
The protesters threw stones and set fire to two cars, which burned for almost 20 minutes, forcing traffic to be rerouted from one of Baghdad's central streets. 
Several protesters said that police officials routinely demand bribes of $40 to $50, plus one month's salary, from anyone who is hired.

HEADLINE: Hardships and Damage Linger After Hurricane 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: POQUOSON, Va., Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Hurricane Isabel was an equal-opportunity destroyer, flooding the houses, snapping the trees and cutting the power of rich and poor alike. But the lingering hardships imposed by the storm are not likely to be so democratic, officials from across the region say.
 People with low or fixed incomes, the elderly and the unemployed are struggling harder to rebuild, the officials say. Many had little or no insurance; many lost everything they owned. 
 Nowhere is that more apparent than in this historic town nestled by Chesapeake Bay, which spilled waist-high water into the streets during the hurricane. Two weeks later, front yards looked like museums of ruined lives, piled high with rusting appliances, wrinkled photographs, sodden clothing and moldering rugs. 
In the heavily damaged Messick Road neighborhood, populated mainly by watermen and retirees, Poquoson officials estimate that as many as half the residents did not have enough insurance to cover their losses.
With little money for hotels, many Messick Road residents have been sleeping on soggy mattresses, in cars, tents or camping trailers, waiting for aid from the government, insurance companies or charities.
"We have retirees who took two feet of water in their homes and everything is gone," said Charles W. Burgess Jr., Poquoson's city manager. "They may get money to make their homes habitable again. And there will be folks who give them food. But replacing their material possessions will be a struggle. They may never get back to where they were."
James Wilkinson considers himself one of the lucky ones, if only because no one in his family was hurt. But falling trees punched holes in the roof of his clapboard bungalow, while four feet of water warped his floors. Virtually everything his family owned now sits in his yard waiting for the trash collector. 
One pile contained his daughter's prom dress and his son's stuffed animals. A Santa suit Mr. Wilkinson wore to entertain local children was drying in the sun. A neat row of his wife's shoes sat on the front porch, which had been ripped from the house and lay crumpled in the yard.
Mr. Wilkinson, 43, a dock foreman for a seafood company, had insurance, but he cannot be sure his losses will be completely covered. The house is unsafe and must be rebuilt, and he expects he will do much of the work himself. Meanwhile, he and his family are living in his camping trailer in his mother-in-law's driveway, awaiting temporary aid.
"It's been two weeks and I don't have anything," he said. "I need something to keep us going."
The insurance industry estimates that the storm caused $1 billion in privately insured damage, but the total losses will be four to five times that much, said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-financed group. Part of those costs will be covered by federal flood insurance, he added, but billions more will not.
Mr. Hartwig said only about one-fourth of the people who live in known flood areas buy flood insurance. "Some cite cost," he said. "And some say that they expect federal and state aid, so why buy it?"
Even people who had homeowners or flood insurance are finding in the fine print of their policies that their damages will not all be covered. Some companies, for instance, have higher deductibles for hurricanes. Amid widespread protests about such deductibles, one insurer, USAA, announced this week that it would waive its storm deductibles for policyholders in Virginia and Maryland.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has opened disaster relief offices throughout Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, can provide emergency aid to people who have lost their homes, including money for rent or clothing. The Small Business Administration issues loans to cover damages, including to homes and personal belongings. But the federal government does not provide grants to pay for uninsured losses, officials said.
Across the region, government officials and charitable groups were scrambling to help lower-income residents cope with the storm's aftershocks. Dozens of Red Cross and Salvation Army trucks have been providing hot meals in hard-hit neighborhoods. Many cities have set up offices to provide one-month disaster food stamps to eligible residents. And churches in flood-damaged towns have distributed canned goods and second-hand clothing.
In Norfolk, Va., 16 miles south of Poquoson, so many people showed up when the city began accepting applications for disaster food stamps that officials moved the site to its sports arena. "We needed a bigger venue," said N. Clark Earl, director of the Department of Human Services in Norfolk. 
The city has approved more than 12,000 of the applications over six days, Mr. Earl said.
On Thursday the line wrapped halfway around the arena, hundreds of people long. Almondo Bryant, 26, showed up with a folding chair when the office opened at 8:30 a.m., only to find himself behind scores of people who had camped out all night. 
"I lost a week's pay," said Mr. Bryant, who works at a Hardee's restaurant that was closed for five days because of the power failure. "I've got to scrape by until the next check comes."
To be sure, things have returned to normal for many people in southeast Virginia. Public schools in most towns reopened this week. Most gas stations were pumping fuel again, and grocery stores had restocked empty shelves. Only about 10,000 homes and businesses were still without power, down from 1.8 million immediately after the storm. Virtually all of those without power were in southeast Virginia, with almost all customers in Maryland and North Carolina restored.
Charles Penn, a spokesman for Dominion Virginia Power, said the utility expected to have everyone back on line by this weekend. 
But in parts of Poquoson, a city of 12,000 people, things were far from normal. More than a week after they returned to their homes, many people were still cleaning out flood debris, ripping out mildew-stained walls and salvaging heirlooms.
"Some things you can't prepare yourself for," Kim Messick said on Wednesday as she moved wrecked belongings from her house into her yard. "Death is one. This is another."
Carol Mann, who lives in a renovated farmhouse on the same plot occupied by her family for four generations, said many older residents in Poquoson did not believe the hurricane would be so damaging. Many had not bought flood insurance because they were on fixed incomes and could not afford it, or did not thinktheir homes -- some half a mile from the bay -- would ever flood. 
"Now they are just walking around in a daze," Mrs. Mann, 48, said. "They were in their houses when the flood came. And they watched everything they own go down the drain."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEXT; 
With a Motorized Hub, the Wheel on the Bus Goes 'Round

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
MOST electric vehicles work by connecting the wheels to a motor. But tomorrow a Dutch company plans to unveil a bus in which motor and wheel are one, a refinement that promises more miles per charge and a vehicle that is safer and easier to maintain.
 The company, e-Traction, has modified a city bus as a diesel-electric hybrid. It has a small combustion engine that charges the batteries, but propulsion comes from two electric motors with tires attached that serve as the rear wheels. E-Traction, based in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, where the bus will operate as part of the local transit service, predicts that the system will more than pay for itself because diesel fuel consumption will be reduced by 70 percent. 
 The idea of such a wheel-motor was first advanced by the automotive pioneer Ferdinand Porsche more than a century ago. Many companies have since tried to popularize such a motor, and a few are currently producing them -- including WaveCrest Laboratories, a Virginia company that is using a similar motor to power a bicycle. 
 But plenty of technological and economic hurdles must be overcome before such motors gain widespread use in transportation. "It is the future," said James Worden, founder and chief executive of Solectria, a company in Woburn, Mass., that has produced drivetrains for more than 100 hybrid electric buses. "Whether it is 10 years out, 20 years out or 30 years out."
 Mr. Worden said he had so far not embraced wheel-motors like E-Traction's because he felt that the underlying technology was not quite ready. But he said he would stop far short of saying it would never work, for fear that in 20 years, his comment would sound like a buggy manufacturer's prediction circa 1900 that cars were just a fad and would never replacehorses.
 E-Traction, which has already built a wheel-motor for a forklift truck, claims that the time is now. For one thing, it argues that in mass production, two wheel motors would cost no more than the large engine and other parts that the motors would replace on a regular diesel-powered bus. The prototype bus nonetheless cost $500,000, about two and a half times the cost of an ordinary bus, said Peter le Comte, a spokesman for the company. 
 The circular shape of e-Traction's motor is not unusual, but the basic parts are reversed. Usually an electric motor consists of a ring-shaped part that does not move, called a stator, through which a current runs, developing magnetic forces that turn the shaft that runs inside it, the rotor. For years, engineers have talked about building a motor in which the shaft is fixed and the ring turns. If the shaft were to serve as an axle, and the ring were to have a tire attached, the result would be a motor that serves as a wheel.
 Such an arrangement would have only one moving part, and would eliminate the parts of the drivetrain, which transfers power from the engine to the wheels. For example, it would eliminate the differential, gears that allow a vehicle's wheels to turn at slightly different speeds when cornering. With a direct-drive motor on each wheel, speeds could be independently controlled.
 Electric wheels would also be a simple way of making a vehicle four-wheel drive. And if one wheel started to slip in acceleration or braking, a central computer could determine that far faster than existing traction control or anti-lock braking systems, advocates say, and make adjustments. 
 Those benefits could be approximated by any vehicle that used one motor for each wheel. But the E-Traction wheel goes two steps further.
 First, it squeezes into the wheel an electronic part called the inverter, which changes the direct current from the battery into alternating current for the motor. Converting the current elsewhere in the bus would require running long AC cables to the motor, and such cables lose energy, said Arjan Heinen, the inventor of the motor. Running DC cables from the battery to the wheel and converting the power there to AC increases efficiency, he said.
 In addition, some electronic tricks can make the motor turn at speeds fast enough to run the bus without gears, he said. The result is to drop the gearbox, a source of weight and friction. Unlike vehicles with internal combustion engines, most electric vehicles do not need variable transmissions, but they do need a gearbox of some kind.
 If something went wrong with the motor, with the inverter or with the chips that control the motor, a mechanic could replace them all in about 25 minutes by swapping out the wheel, Mr. Heinen said. That requires unscrewing 12 to 20 bolts, depending on the wheel, and disconnecting a handful of cables, he said.
 Yet Mr. Worden of Solectria said that one drawback in the bus design was that the electronics in the motor were in direct contact with the road, not protected like the rest of the bus is by shock absorbers. If the tire hits a bump, he said, "it beats the living daylights out of any motor or electronics."
 He said the loss of the gearbox was a major benefit, if it could be made to work, but questioned whether having the current inverter in the motor was much of an advantage. Electric buses with inverters nearer the batteries do not lose appreciable amounts of current through the AC cables, he said.
 Mr. le Comte said the real proof of the design's viability would be the operation of the bus in Apeldoorn. Meanwhile e-Traction is also working on a Mercedes Jeep borrowed from the Royal Netherlands Army and a Range Rover. Both will have four motors, one on each wheel.

The Unmet Needs of Motherhood Bring Out the Entrepreneurial Spirit

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
A new wave of professional women is leveraging pregnancy into business opportunity.
 They had not expected to become entrepreneurs. They had promising careers to return to, even if some of them had been laid off in the creaky economy of the last few years. But as they approached motherhood, then cared for their newborns, they kept wondering why nobody had made a product they wanted but could not find. 
 And then they decided to make it themselves. 
Consider Beth Besner, 42, of Davie, Fla., who in 1995 created the Table Topper, a disposable place mat that adheres to restaurant tables so toddlers can eat on a clean surface. Ms. Besner, who practiced bankruptcy law for five years before having children, says she got the idea for the product after her 6-month-old son grabbed his plate of food in a restaurant and "threw it across the room like a Frisbee."
She spent months looking in vain for a food holder that would stick to tables. So she designed one herself, created a company called Neat Solutions and, using her legal expertise, patented it and negotiated contracts for its manufacture and distribution. Today, sales top $1 million a year, and the company has developed another product, the Potty Topper, a disposable sheet that adheres to public toilets. She got the inspiration from the mess her toddler made with the slippery paper toilet seat covers often found in public restrooms.
"This thing took on a life of its own," said Ms. Besner, the mother of three sons, who recently sold the business to her brother-in-law. She remains with the company as its chief inventor.
Another enterprising mother is Julia Beck Bromberg, 36, who got the idea for her company at classes she attended when she was pregnant with her first child. Her teachers gave her a list of items to buy for the big day, she said, but "I was very large, and the thought of running all over town to find these products tired me out." In early 2000, a year and a half after giving birth to a girl, she started Forty Weeks, a Potomac, Md., online supplier of products to help women in labor. Its biggest seller is a "labor comfort kit," with items like fluffy washcloths, massage oils and breath mints for birthing partners. "I didn't go into this blind," Ms. Bromberg said. "I felt like I had the business savvy to pull it off."
As her company's only employee, Ms. Bromberg, a former magazine consultant, does most of her own market research. She follows women into the lactation rooms of baby supply stores, butts into conversations between mothers with baby carriages at the local Starbucks and accosts women in toy stores, all to get ideas for new products.
While she declines to reveal sales figures, she says they have risen steadily by 15 percent a year, and in February she opened a consulting service for start-ups in maternity and baby products. A frequenter of industry trade shows, she says she has noticed a new sophistication in the mothers who start maternity and baby products businesses. A few years ago, many of them were "one-hit wonders, who came up with a fun idea and put it out in the marketplace" but did not do much to extend their brands, she said.
Now, the entrepreneurs she runs across at such events are more likely to have been high-powered executives who stumbled upon a great idea after having babies. These women often have specialties, like finance or legal expertise, that help them gain a bigger piece of the $5.4 billion baby products market.
With so many women clamoring for a piece of the maternity market, the competition would seem to be fierce. Wrong, says Rebecca Matthias, a doyenne of the trade who has watched it evolve.
In 1982, Ms. Matthias, then an architect and construction engineer pregnant with her first child, founded Mothers Work Inc., now the largest maternity company in the world, with nearly $500 million in annual sales. She started the company in her home on an investment of $10,000 after becoming frustrated at the paltry selection of maternity wear in stores. One thing that has surprised her since then, she says, is the willingness of women entrepreneurs to share their secrets.
"Most of us don't see one another as a threat," she said. Her company, with its A Pea in the Pod, Mimi Maternity and Motherhood Maternity Brands, opened its 1,000th store in Deptford, N.J., in August. Bloomberg Finance recognized it in January as the best-performing stock in the country, and the Small Business Administration honored Ms. Matthias last month for her entrepreneurial achievements.
A more recent entry into that market is Belinda Wasser, 42, owner of Blueberrybabies.com, a Web site that she started last October from her home in Jamaica Plains, Mass., to sell baby gifts like diaper bags and designer booties.
Ms. Wasser was laid off from her job as a manager at Digitas, a consulting and advertising business in Boston where she was in charge of a $3 million budget, after she gave birth to her daughter in August 2002. "It was the best thing that ever happened to me," she said, enabling her to start a business where she could use her management skills and set her own hours. She took a class for entrepreneurial women, learning "how to think like a C.E.O.," she said, and she hired a business coach to help her through the early stages of the venture. She declines to disclose sales but says they are growing strongly.
Sharon Mullen, 44, who started a Web site called Inventive Parent seven years ago in Hampton, N.H., to sell products created by parents, has an explanation for the proliferation of entrepreneurial mothers. As more women put off having children to pursue careers, Ms. Mullen says, they accumulate business skills and capital -- then use both to start businesses after taking pregnancy leaves.
Ms. Mullen started Inventive Parent after being laid off from her job as the theater manager for the arts center at Tufts University. Mothers whose products she has featured on her site include a rocket scientist, a doctor and a lawyer. One of her inventions on the site is the Car Seat Cozy, a coverlet resembling a sleeping bag intended to keep children warm in the car.
If mothers think running a start-up will take less time than their old jobs, they had better think again. Just ask Missy Cohen-Fyffe, 42, a former public relations executive who started Babe Ease in Pelham, N.H., in 1999 so she could spend more time with her newborn.
After one product, the Clean Shopper, a cloth covering for child seats in shopping carts, was featured in a national magazine in 2000, she said, hundreds of phone calls from customers poured in to her home office day and night. She has since hired three full-time employees and set up a Web site to handle orders. Revenue has "skyrocketed" from $21,000 in the first year of operation, she said, though she will not disclose figures.
Ms. Cohen-Fyffe usually works 50 to 60 hours a week, spreading them over evenings and weekends so she can spend more time during the day caring for her sons, Joshua, 8, and Andrew, 6. "I have to admit," she said, "it's a lot more work than I thought it would be."

HEADLINE: Tasting the Foie Gras, Listening to the Jam; 
Fine Restaurants Are Adding D.J.'s

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
It was 10:42 p.m. at the new fusion of night life and fine dining in Manhattan, and Steven Travolta-DuPlantier, the D.J., was spinning, matching and blending in his booth. He segued from the midtempo "I Got Somebody New" by George Levin to the mellow warmth of "A Little Deeper" by Ms. Dynamite. 
 His dinner audience of more than 100 on two different floors of the restaurant, industry(food), was animated by the music pumping from 22 speakers. But these people were not eating polystyrene club food. They dined on foie gras with pineapple chutney, stuffed squash blossoms with saffron vinaigrette, and confit of duck leg with pomegranate molasses. 
 "I wouldn't normally choose a restaurant with a D.J.," said Kimberly Gray, 31, a financial consultant from Brooklyn who was studying the menu. "But the music isn't too loud to be obnoxious. And the food is really good. It's all very New Yorkish." 
Night life in New York has become Darwinian, with the forward cocktail culture and new restaurant concepts jostling unmercifully for market share. Owners are looking to any formula that will give them an edge. And a proliferating number of restaurants -- industry(food), Butter, Hue, Lotus, The Sanctum, Tao -- have adopted a business plan that offers a combination of mood and food. 
"There is a movement to mix real food and night life environments," said David Rabin, president of the New York Nightlife Association, a 140-member group. 
"It's the model that everyone is following now," said Karim Amatullah, the 34-year-old co-owner of Hue, a restaurant that opened at 91 Charles Street in August. 
D.J.'s, rather than live or preprogrammed music at the traditional supper club, are the key. "Everything that people have sold is sold out," said Stuart Bronz, 34, a D.J. known outside the booth as Stuart Braunstein. "So restaurants are grabbing people's attention by spinning." 
For years, D.J.'s have created custom CD soundtracks for upscale restaurants. But no prerecorded soundtrack can suit both a quiet early dinner on Tuesday and a raucus table full of traders late on a Thursday. "Even if you have a vast CD collection and a with-it restaurant manager, there is no substitute for a D.J. with four boxes of CD's who can look out over the floor and see what people are responding to," Mr. Rabin said. 
Once a restaurant has hired a correct chef, a brand-name interior designer and a theatrical floral artist, why, some owners ask, wouldn't it splurge for the right sound? "I offer every amenity in Hue," Mr. Amatullah said. "But without the music, the restaurant would be an empty shell." 
If the very notion of a D.J. seems to clash with the idea of salutary digestion, most D.J.'s play down-tempo music early in the evening, and speakers are muted in dining rooms. "It's not noisy," Mr. Amatullah said, "but it adds a little something extra that most people don't even notice but enables them to relax." 
Mr. Travolta-DuPlantier, 35, who was flipping through his books of 100 CD's at industry(food), agreed. "The idea is to enhance the meal, not overwhelm it," he said.
As the night goes on, the tempo goes up. Often the D.J. programs music for the whole restaurant, including bar areas and lounges for what the trade calls "before-dining and after-dining." Owners know how hard it is to make a profit on high-end food, but liquor and wine markups are formidable. By offering varied dining and drinking areas, they are looking for additional profits after 11 p.m. 
It is still true that some lounges at first masquerade as restaurants to win a liquor license, defusing Nimby-alert neighbors who might protest against a clubby crowd on their block. "Later," Mr. Bronz, the D.J., said, "these places all but drop the food." 
Ones that did keep the food provided little more than rubberized staples like microwaved buffalo chicken wings. But alongside Butter's D.J., one can find grilled spice-rubbed pork loin with staw potatoes and mustard greens by Alexandra Guarnaschelli, formerly of Daniel. Such food shall not be served under a disco ball: the restaurant, at 415 Lafayette Street, envelops 60 diners on two levels with a seriously birch-tree motif. 
"People are used to having better and better food options in these kinds of environments," said Mr. Rabin of the Nightlife Association. Restaurateurs debate whether the trend is inspired by high-end, D.J.-driven restaurants in Paris and London or whether the Manhattan species is a home-grown hybrid that evolved to satisfy a demanding new clientele. 
Whatever, the intention is to attract a well-heeled core group of professionals and financial-services worker bees in their 30's and 40's, augmented by a 20-ish cadre that is described in the trade as lounge-y. 
The younger crowd has its buzzy upside but also its downside. Restaurant-hoppers often work their Nokias during the arrival of the truffle-oiled skate bruschetta. Then they skip out for new adventures elsewhere before a waiter can start to describe the litchi tart. How can a restaurant convince them to stay for after-dinner drinks?
"The D.J. keeps people here longer," said Alex A. Freij, 28, co-owner of industry(food), which is at 509 East Sixth Street in Manhattan near Avenue A. "Why do they need to head on to a club if they can get that right here?" (His restaurant's functionalist name derives from its mission statement as a hangout for workers in the restaurant and night life industry, and offers them 10-percent member-discount cards.) 
Mr. Rabin said that the D.J. imparted "that upbeat feel, and people love that vibe." Mr. Rabin, 42, is also a co-owner of Lotus, at 409 West 14th Street, which has one D.J. downstairs in the lounge and another in the 86-seat main-floor restaurant, which segues into a dance floor after midnight. 
At Lotus, the economic downturn after Sept. 11, 2001, dealt a severe blow to the restaurant, which had opened a year before the terrorist attack. Ultimately the fressers ceded to the clubbers when the restaurant area was closed last June. 
Now the Lotus restaurant has been reopened with a new menu offering "urban Asian street fare" ranging from tamarind leaf soup to grilled filet mignon salad with toasted rice by Tyson Ophaso, formerly of Le Cirque and La Cote Basque. 
A block to the south of Lotus, Soho House -- the posh private club on Ninth Avenue that opened last May -- has recently installed a D.J. five nights a week.
Still farther south, one of the newest of the fusion rooms is The Sanctum in the TriBeCa Grand Hotel at the corner of Church and White Streets. It opened during Fashion Week and offers beige wall textiles, blondish woods, energetic D.J.'s and a cornucopia of cocktails to 100 guests who nosh on everything from grilled tamari quail with toasted figs to tuna pear tartare with yuzu vinaigrette. 
Although the whole D.J./food thing has predominated downtown, there are more northerly practitioners. At Tao, 42 East 58th Street, 350 customers revel on three floors in a dramatic, cavernous, Asianish time warp dominated by a 20-foot-tall Buddha flanked by swimming goldfish. Diners eat everything from Kobe beef to miso-glazed Chilean sea bass. The D.J. can be found, well, to the west of Buddha. 
And at Balitore, the actor Gabriel Byrne's restaurant at Third Avenue and 81st Street, the management began experimenting with a D.J. "and our customers liked it so much we're having a D.J. Monday through Saturday," said Roy Pietrinferni, the manager. 
The new restaurant niche has proved to be an expanding employment opportunity in a city where, D.J.'s say, less than a hundred of their colleagues are able to pay the rent from their spinning.
D.J.'s, who can be paid more than $1,000 per shift at a hot club thanks to the door charge, can generally earn from $200 to $700 for a four-to-six-hour gig in restaurants. The cooler D.J.'s sport a halo of groupie lemmings, who help spread the word about a new restaurant, along with the usual paid promoters and well-comped pilot fish. They bring the supermodels, who bring the sharks, who have the credit cards. 
If some D.J.'s prefer the pristine isolation of a sealed booth, Wolf, 31, (who outside the booth is called Wolf Septimus) said that "being out there makes a connection between the D.J. and the crowd." Wolf has been one of six regular D.J.'s at industry(food) since its opening 18 months ago. 
There, just as in a club, restaurant D.J.'s say they can achieve that holy moment. That's when, as Wolf put it, "I feel a complete connection between my crowd, my music and me."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: South Korea: Trade Surplus Surges 

BYLINE:  By Samuel Len (NYT) 

 BODY:
 With exports to China surging, South Korea posted a trade surplus of $2.6 billion last month, its largest in five years, the government said. 
The surplus was triple that of September a year ago, as exports rose 24 percent, to $17.2 billion. Leading the list of exports were mobile communications equipment, semiconductors, computers and automobiles. Exports to China exceeded those to the United States, which typically had been South Korea's largest export market, for a second consecutive month. Despite the strong exports, South Korea's economy, which fell into recession in the first half, remains sluggish and the government expects its annual growth rate to remain below 3 percent this year.

 HIGHLIGHTS

MOSCOW: FILM FESTIVAL FUROR -- Russian human-rights advocates complained of Kremlin intervention yesterday aftera Moscow theater canceled a free festival of documentary films about Chechnya that had already been presented in Washington, New York and London. Yuri Samodurov, the festival organizer, said the Kinocenter Theater in central Moscow told him on Tuesday that it would not show the films. Speaking on Moscow Echo radio, the theater's manager, Vladimir Medvedev, said the festival's non-Russian films "showed anti-Russian tendencies" and his theater did not show political films. Mr. Samodurov, referring to the Russian domestic intelligence service, said, "My feeling is that the Kinocenter has come under pressure from the F.S.B." Organized by human rights groups, the festival of 18 films, 12 of them Russian, will run, nevertheless, from today through Saturday in the 90-seat auditorium of the Andrei Sakharov Center, Agence France-Presse reported. The films depict the war in Chechnya, a Russian republic where rebels are seeking independence, through the eyes of its people, Russian soldiers and their parents. A presidential election in Chechnya, organized by the Russian government, is to take place on Sunday.

BERLIN: NO CASTLE FOR NOW -- Germany's culture minister, citing economic difficulties, declared a two-year moratorium yesterday on plans to rebuild the Baroque castle that was once the Berlin home of Prussia's powerful Hohenzollern dynasty, which ruled Germany from 1871 until 1918. The 17th-century castle was damaged in World War II and razed in 1950 by the Communist government of East Germany, which replaced it with a concrete and glass building that housed its parliament. Reconstruction of the castle, approved last year by the German parliament, would cost about $760 million, Agence France-Presse reported. The German culture minister, Christina Weiss, said a final decision on the start of work would be made in 2005 if the government's economic reforms take hold and budget problems ease.

HARTFORD: CELEBRATING GRANDMA -- Her career started when she was in her mid-70's and ended with her death at 101 in 1961. Her name was Anna Mary Robertson Moses, but this self-taught, immensely popular artist was better known as Grandma Moses. "I had always wanted to paint, but I just didn't have time until I was 76," she once said. Emphasizing autobiographical storytelling, family and social bonds and the burdens and pleasures of farm work, her paintings, primarily landscapes, include depictions of plowing, harvesting, chasing turkeys, shoeing horses, sleighing and cutting hay. Beginning tomorrow, more than 50 paintings and related objects will go on view through Feb. 15 in "Grandma Moses in the 21st Century" at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford. Examining her work on its merits and within the context of modern art, this exhibition also raises questions about high and popular art, folk and outsider art.

HAYDEN PLANETARIUM: SIGHT AND SOUND -- If the name of Herman Melville's descendant Richard Melville Hall doesn't sound a familiar chord, try this: Moby, right. This electronic pop star has joined MTV2 and the American Museum of Natural History to create SonicVision, a 40-minute digitally animated alternative music show that will play every Friday and Saturday night at 7:30, 8:30, 9:30 and 10:30 at the Hayden Planetarium beginning tomorrow. The soundtrack, featuring Radiohead, U2, Queens of the Stone Age, David Bowie, Stereolab, Fischerspooner, Boards of Canada and Moby himself, is part of the technology that turns the planetarium dome into a computer-generated musical and visual experience.

WASHINGTON: ART FROM MEXICO -- The Mexican Embassy in Washington was the site yesterday for the announcement of a series of exhibitions next year at the National Gallery of Art and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, the Legion of Honor in San Francisco and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City. "Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya," "The Cubist Paintings of Diego Rivera: Memory, Politics, Place" and the film series "Cinema of Mexico" will be seen at the National Gallery from April 4 through July 25. The Mayan art will be exhibited at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco from Sept. 4, 2004, through Jan. 2, 2005, and Rivera's paintings at the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City from Sept. 19, 2004, through Jan. 16, 2005. The Hirshhorn will mount an exhibition of the photographs of Gabriel Orozco from June 1 to Sept. 1.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Backs Bill to Give Tax Windfall to U.S. Companies 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
American corporations that have deferred taxes for years on the profits they made overseas could be in line for a huge windfall from Congress.
 Hoping to bring more investment to the United States, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill on Wednesday that would give a one-time tax holiday to companies that have accumulated as much as $400 billion in foreign profits on which they have yet to pay American taxes. 
 American companies can usually defer paying taxes on foreign profits as long as they keep the money outside the United States. Much of that money is reinvested in foreign operations, and some is parked in passive investments. 
The Senate bill, which is part of a much broader bill to overhaul laws on international corporate taxation, would let companies bring those profits back and pay a tax rate of 5.25 percent.
Supporters say the six-month tax holiday could lure as much as $300 billion back into the United States, which in turn would increase investment and create jobs.
To press their case, companies like Hewlett-Packard have formed a broad coalition that includes the likes of Eli Lilly, Merck, Intel, Sun Microsystems and Dell Computer.
Among the coalition's main lobbyists are Bill Archer, the former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and his former chief of staff, Donald Carlson.
"The question is, Do we want this money invested in equipment and plants in Egypt or do we want it invested in the United States?" Mr. Carlson said. "To get this much bang for the buck is a rarity."
But many tax experts, including top tax officials in the Bush administration, say the move would be a mistake because it would validate the strategies of companies that spent years sheltering the overseas profits.
"The company that left Louisiana is going to pay a 5 percent tax on the widgets they make overseas, and the company that stayed in Louisiana is going to pay a 35 percent tax," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. "If that isn't an incentive to leave, I don't know what is."
Critics also warn that there is no guarantee that the companies will invest their repatriated profits in new factories or larger work forces. Indeed, Republican lawmakers defeated an amendment offered by Mr. Breaux on Wednesday that would have required companies to reinvest their foreign profits in things like new equipment. 
Pamela F. Olson, assistant secretary of the Treasury in charge of tax policy, told lawmakers Wednesday that she was skeptical about the bill's benefits and warned that it could "undermine taxpayers' perception of the fairness of the tax system."
The biggest beneficiaries of the legislation would be technology companies like Hewlett-Packard and Intel as well as pharmaceutical giants like Merck and Eli Lilly.
Hewlett, which has been one of the bill's most visible supporters, says it has accumulated $14.5 billion in foreign earnings and has kept them outside the country, in part to avoid paying the American corporate tax rate of 35 percent.
Eli Lilly, whose products include the antidepressant Prozac, says it has $8 billion in untaxed overseas profits. Intel, another big supporter of the legislation, says it has deferred taxes on $6.3 billion of foreign income.
Lawmakers say the measure has a strong chance of becoming law. The Senate bill has support from most Republicans as well as some Democrats. In the House, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Thomas of California, has proposed a similar plan.
Despite its unhappiness about the bill, administration officials made it clear Wednesday that they would not try to veto the measure because they were more concerned about passing the broader legislative package.
The main purpose of the bill is to replace a tax break for American exporters that has been declared an illegal subsidy by the World Trade Organization. 
If the United States does not repeal the tax break, which allows American manufacturers to avoid taxes on exports by establishing offshore sales corporations, the European Union has threatened to retaliate with $4 billion in tariffs on products from the United States.
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said in a statement Wednesday afternoon that the "top priority" would be replacing the tax break. "It is critically important that we continue to work together in order to get legislation enacted," he said.
But the effort to replace the old break with new ones of comparable value has touched off intensive lobbying by corporations.
The bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee would reduce the corporate tax rate on American manufacturers by as much as 10 percent and offer some modest new permanent tax breaks for American companies operating overseas.
The $75 billion bill is supposed to be self-financing, with the new tax breaks being offset by the repeal of older ones.
But the bill has also become packed with items that benefit farmers and agribusinesses, oil and gas pipeline companies and even movie producers.
By far the most controversial of those measures is the proposed tax holiday on foreign profits, which supporters call the "homeland reinvestment act."
The idea has tremendous allure to lawmakers because it offers the possibility of bringing at least a brief flood of money into the United States.
The Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan Congressional agency that calculates the effect of tax proposals on revenue, estimates that a six-month tax amnesty for overseas profits could bring back $135 billion.
Economists at J. P. Morgan who scrutinized the annual reports of large American companies estimate that American companies have parked as much as $406 billion in foreign profits outside the country and that a tax holiday could lure back as much as $300 billion.
Many tax experts say such estimates are greatly exaggerated, but even skeptics concede that the windfall to many large multinational companies could be huge. 
The added political allure is that, at least on paper, the measure looks cheap. Congressional analysts estimate that the measure would actually increase tax revenue by several billion dollars in the first year because corporations would pay the 5 percent tax on all the profits they bring back home. Over 10 years, the Joint Committee of Taxation estimates, the Treasury would lose about $3.7 billion.
After watching companies shed 2.7 million jobs over the last three years, most of them in manufacturing, lawmakers in both parties have become receptive.
Indeed, the Senate voted to include an identical provision in the $350 billion tax-cut bill in this spring, but the provision was dropped during the House-Senate conference committee.
Dan Kostenbauder, Hewlett-Packard's vice president in charge of transaction taxes, said his company would use much of its tax windfall to reduce its debt. Last year, Hewlett lost more than $3 billion on its operations in the United States but earned a profit of $2.6 billion overseas.
"If we have cash in our foreign subsidiaries, we can't lend it to our American subsidiaries because it would be taxed immediately," Mr. Kostenbauder said. "Having this cash available would enhance our ability to compete."

HEADLINE: Cancun Trade Talks 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman, writing about the Cancun trade talks, says the United States should offer to reduce its farm subsidies and textile tariffs (column, Sept. 25). 
This is exactly what the United States has offered. We put forward a tariff-free-world proposal that would cut our already low industrial tariffs if others cut as well, including textiles. 
 In agriculture, the United States proposed cutting more than $100 billion in yearly global subsidies, slashing global tariffs and eliminating export subsidies. 
Many others at Cancun, particularly midlevel developing countries, preferred pontificating instead of negotiations that included discussing their own reforms. This is unfortunate, because 70 percent of the overall tariffs that developing countries pay are to one another.
The United States already provides more than $20 billion in duty-free access for developing countries. We seek reciprocal trade commitments from developing countries to open closed economies, promote positive domestic reforms, like adherence to the rule of law, and to encourage sustained economic growth.

HEADLINE: Jeb Bush Leads Re-election Team For Presidential Effort in Florida 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Sara Kennedy contributed to this report. 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida will serve as chairman of his brother's re-election campaign in the state, whose votes could prove crucial in the presidential election next fall.
 The Bush campaign announced the appointment on Wednesday, along with that of Brett Doster, a 32-year-old lobbyist and former aide to Jeb Bush, as the president's Florida campaign manager. 
 The campaign also releasedthe names of 59 campaign leaders who will help raise money and get out the vote for President Bush here. They include Armando Codina, a Miami real estate developer and former business partner of Jeb Bush, and John Thrasher, a lobbyist and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. 
After the 2000 election, in which President Bush defeated Al Gore in Florida by just 537 votes after a protracted recount, Republicans and Democrats alike are viewing the state as pivotal in 2004. It is the fourth most populous state after California, Texas and New York. Karl Rove, the president's chief political strategist, has called Florida "ground zero" in the re-election effort.
At a news conference in Tampa on Wednesday, Governor Bush -- who was also chairman of his brother's 2000 campaign in Florida -- praised his brother's education policies, his handling of the 2001 terrorist attacks, his tax cuts and his efforts to stop off-shore drilling along Florida's coastline.
"President Bush has been good to Florida," the governor said, "and Floridians will be good to him in November."
Polls suggest that the president is on much firmer ground in Florida than he was in 2000, partly because the economy has not suffered as much here as in other states and because many military families who support the war in Iraq live here. But the main reason behind Mr. Bush's growing support here is his brother's popularity as governor, political scientists say.
Jeb Bush won re-election by a landslide last fall. Janet Reno, the attorney general under President Bill Clinton, lost the Democratic primary, and the Democratic candidate, Bill McBride, never gained momentum. Republicans, who already dominated the state's Legislature and Congressional delegation, gained more seats. 
Another plus for Mr. Bush is that Senator Bob Graham, the Floridian who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, is lagging behind most of his opponents. If Mr. Graham's campaign were thriving, Mr. Bush might need to worry more about Florida.
While the state has traditionally had more Democratic voters than Republican, the margin narrowed from 2000 to 2002. Yet Governor Bush said the Republicans were not taking Florida for granted. 
"We have learned the importance of political activism," he said.
Scott Maddox, chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, said his party's efforts to defeat the president here would focus on Mr. Bush's education and economic policies, and the drawn-out occupation of Iraq.
"I don't know how President Bush is going to justify spending $166 billion in Iraq when Florida is 50th out of 50 states in spending on higher education," Mr. Maddox said. "Florida is very much still in play."

HEADLINE: Sponsors Ease Bill on Gases That Warm The Climate 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
The two senators who are sponsoring legislation to fight global warming announced on Wednesday that they would soften the bill to gain support for a vote expected this month.
 "By modifying the bill, we expect to build additional momentum for the measure in the Senate," Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said at a Senate hearing on climate change. 
 Mr. McCain and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, have proposed limits for greenhouse gases from the industrial, utility, commercial and transportation sections of the economy, which together produce nearly 80 percent of American global warming emissions. Households, agriculture and smaller businesses would be exempt. 
The modified bill would, as the original did, try to bring carbon dioxide emissions down to the levels of the year 2000, starting in 2010, but it drops a follow-up phase calling for 1990 levels starting in 2016.
To ease the impact of these constraints, the bill sets up a framework for companies to buy and sell the rights to emit carbon dioxide, similar to the highly successful 1990 acid rain program. Opponents of carbon dioxide regulation call their legislation the equivalent of an "energy tax" since the gas is a product of the use of coal and oil. 
A study of the new proposal by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that the costs to be passed on to consumers would be $10 to $20 per family per year; the original plan, with its lengthy timetable, could have cost $30 per family annually in the early years, growing to as much as $400 per family by 2020. 
The original plan and the revised version are far less aggressive than the limits in the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty rejected by President Bush, which would require industrialized countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels by 2012. This would be the first Senate vote on a global-warming issue since 1997 when it adopted a resolution, 95 to 0, that said the United States should not sign any international agreement on climate change that would seriously harm the American economy. 
Mr. Lieberman and Mr. McCain have tried to bring their proposal to the floor for two years but have been stymied, by the opposition of the White House, which prefers voluntary controls, and by Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the Senate environment committee. 
The hearing on Wednesday and the coming Senate vote are the byproduct of the July negotiations over the energy bill, to which the senators tried to attach their proposal as an amendment. Instead, Senator McCain gained an agreement with Senate leaders for a vote on their proposal as a stand-alone bill this fall, with six hours of debate and no unexpected amendments. 
Environmental groups have unified to lobby for the bill, which has some bipartisan support, including that of a few northeastern Republican senators. But the bill is unlikely to win enough support to pass.
Still, environmental groups say the vote remains a milestone for fighting global warming because the simplified measures essentially make this a yes or no vote on whether carbon dioxide regulation is needed.
"It's not about the specifics or mechanics of the program," said Jeremy Symons, the climate change director for the National Wildlife Federation. "It's about whether or not you think something should be done or if you think it should be researched indefinitely."

HEADLINE: Hope for New Vigor At European Bank 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 1 

 BODY:
Next month, after years of waiting and wondering, Jean-Claude Trichet is to take the helm of the European Central Bank. He is not about to wallow in nostalgia during his final weeks in Paris.
 At the French central bank, which Mr. Trichet has run since 1993, he is scrambling to reach an agreement with labor unions that will eliminate 2,630 jobs. It is a characteristic effort by a man who spent three decades in the treacherous waters of French financial policy making. 
 The European Union's leaders are scheduled to meet in Brussels on Oct. 16 to anoint Mr. Trichet, 60, as the successor to Wim Duisenberg, the European bank's first president. Many analysts here say they think that Mr. Trichet's arrival will augur a new, more forceful era for Europe's youngest, yet arguably most powerful, institution. 
"His ability to lead will depend on his powers of persuasion," said Alexandre Lamfalussy, the former head of the European Monetary Institute, the central bank's predecessor. "I find him very persuasive." 
Resilient, too. Mr. Trichet has held sensitive posts under both Presidents Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac. He tangled with Mr. Chirac and still kept his job. And he survived a trial on corruption charges that nearly dashed his dreams of moving to Frankfurt, where the European bank is based. 
"Frankfurt is a city with an immense legacy," Mr. Trichet said in his gilded Paris office this week. "I'm happy to be going there." 
A polished, disciplined man with a central banker's knack for speaking a lot but saying little, Mr. Trichet refused to be drawn out on his plans for the European bank. He insisted that most of his remarks be kept off the record, to avoid any appearance that he was trying to push Mr. Duisenberg out of the spotlight early. 
Still, with Mr. Duisenberg scheduled to preside over his next-to-last board meeting in Lisbon on Thursday, the leadership transition is already under way. Mr. Trichet's extreme discretion -- some call it opaqueness -- has spawned a cottage industry of speculation about what kind of bank chief he will be.
Given his long tenure at the French central bank, his independent streak and his readiness to immerse himself in economic minutiae, many analysts say Mr. Trichet could prove to be an energetic contrast to Mr. Duisenberg -- a tall, snowy-haired Dutchman who sometimes seems to float above policy debates on interest rates.
Mr. Trichet cultivates a broad network of ties, including people on Wall Street and in Washington. Analysts are eager to see if he will form an alliance with the bank's vice president, Lucas Papademos.
Mr. Papademos, an American-educated Greek who once worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, is viewed as taking a broader economic approach to monetary policy than the bank's influential chief economist, Otmar Issing of Germany, who focuses on curbing inflation.
"You've got a stronger leader coming in," said Philip Lane, the director of the Institute for International Integration Studies at Trinity College Dublin, said of Mr. Trichet. "With more than one expert on the board, monetary policy could be a bit more unpredictable than it was under Duisenberg." 
Such a change would gladden the hearts of many economists and market analysts, who fault the bank for being timid in addressing economic stagnation in many of its 12 member nations. The weakness in Germany and other countries threatens to tarnish the euro, the common currency that is the bank's main responsibility. Last month, Swedes voted by a wide margin not to adopt the currency -- an outcome analysts say partly reflected a fear that Sweden's economy would become like Germany's.
The euro has risen strongly against the dollar in recent months, but even that trend is met with mixed feelings. Some critics say the bank shrugs off too lightly the damage that a strong euro does to European exports. 
"Duisenberg contended the euro wouldn't have an effect on Europe's economies," said Allan Saunderson, the chairman of EuroZone Partners, a consulting firm in Frankfurt. "If the head of an institution makes absurd statements, it undermines the authority of the institution." 
Mr. Trichet, many say, is likely to be more circumspect in his public remarks. Few expect anything like Mr. Duisenberg's gaffe in October 2000, when he said that the bank would not intervene in the currency markets to shore up the euro. His tipping of the bank's hand led speculators to drive the euro down to record lows. 
Bank watchers who dissected Mr. Trichet's recent testimony at the European Parliament said it was a marvel of nondisclosure. "We were saying, 'This guy is better than Alan Greenspan,' " recalled John Carter, European managing editor of Market News International. 
Mr. Trichet's elusiveness, like Mr. Greenspan's, keeps him from being pinned down by legislators on monetary issues, leaving him more room to maneuver in setting interest rates.
Aside from his Delphic pronouncements, though, Mr. Trichet is not likely to be Europe's answer to Mr. Greenspan. He is a technocrat rather than an innovator, with little in his record to suggest that he might redirect the bank's agenda away from its current cardinal objective: controlling inflation. 
Since the bank was founded, Mr. Trichet has been an influential member of its governing council, which set that policy. He is also a pragmatist, who recognizes that forcing radical change on an institution with 18 council members from 12 countries is as unlikely as it would be unwise. 
"The Fed is a monarchy, whereas the E.C.B. is like a college," said Professor Lane, referring to Mr. Greenspan's decisive role. "I would imagine, if there is going to be change, it would be evolutionary." 
Throughout his career, Mr. Trichet has shown an ability to pursue his goals while navigating political crosswinds. 
The son of a university lecturer, he was born in Lyon in December 1942. He studied at a prestigious mining school in Nancy and flirted with left-wing politics before enrolling in the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, a training ground for France's ruling elite. 
As a young man, Mr. Trichet rose through the civil service, becoming an inspector of finances, which gave him a peek into the often dubious accounts of state-owned companies. Having drifted rightward politically, he was chosen as an adviser to President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. 
By 1987, Mr. Trichet had become the director of the Treasury -- a post that was to cause him heartache years later because it involved signing off on the accounts of a state-owned bank, Credit Lyonnais. The bank was looted of the equivalent of billions of dollars around that time, and Mr. Trichet and other officials were later accused of manipulating its accounts to disguise the scale of the losses. 
In June, a decade after Credit Lyonnais collapsed, a Paris court acquitted Mr. Trichet. Had he been found guilty, France would have had to withdraw his name and recommend an alternative candidate for European Central Bank president. 
Despite the charges, Mr. Trichet remained a respected figure. He led the French bank's transition to independence in 1994, and defendedthe value of the franc in the face of heavy pressure from Mr. Chirac, who wanted him to use monetary policy more to spur growth than to fight inflation. 
In 1994, Le Monde described Mr. Trichet as "a functionary, the likes of which they don't make anymore: a touch Gaullist, naively patriotic, loyal to all the powers-that-be in France and completely convinced that he is doing his duty to serve the interests of the nation." 
Such a description might unnerve people in Europe's smaller countries, which have little say in who leads the shared bank. France pushed hard in 1999 for Mr. Trichet to be the first president, while Germany preferred Mr. Duisenberg; in a compromise, Mr. Duisenberg agreed to step down after four years, or half the eight-year term, to make way for the Frenchman. 
While former colleagues say Mr. Trichet vigorously defends the interests of France, they express a belief that he will be able to balance the interests of the 12 euro countries, and perhaps more members after the euro zone expands. 
"He will be very, very careful not to give the slightest evidence that he is serving a national interest," Mr. Lamfalussy said. 
That may require Mr. Trichet to take aim at his own country. France is now violating the agreement that created the euro and the central bank, by running a budget deficit greater than 3 percent of its gross domestic product. Unlike Germany, which is also exceeding the 3 percent limit, in France the leaders have openly defied European officials in Brussels and have shown little willingness to change policy to comply with the limit.
Asked about the matter during European Parliament testimony, Mr. Trichet said he would demand that all countries abide by the rules, continuing the stern line taken by Mr. Duisenberg. 
"I am not here as a Frenchman," he said. "If I am appointed, I will speak as president of the E.C.B." 
For Mr. Trichet, the goal is not the triumph of any country or any particular orthodoxy. Describing his legacy in France this week, he said, "It's a satisfaction to have been able to run an independent institution, which is respected in France, even if it was really hard times." 
The challenge for Mr. Trichet will be in repeating his bureaucratic victories on the bigger, and even more tangled, landscape of Europe.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The economic plan for Iraq seems long on ideology, short on common sense.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books and the Century Foundation. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
IRAQ'S new finance minister, Kamel al-Gailani, announced a sweeping liberalization of his country's economy at the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Dubai early last week. Amid the controversy over President Bush's request for $87 billion to finance the American presence in Iraq, the new laws hardly attracted attention in the United States.
 But by almost any mainstream economist's standard, the plan, already approved by L. Paul Bremer III, the American in charge of the Coalition Provisional Authority, is extreme -- in fact, stunning. It would immediately make Iraq's economy one of the most open to trade and capital flows in the world, and put it among the lowest taxed in the world, rich or poor. Is this Middle Eastern nation, racked by war, ready for such severe experimentation? Moreover, the radical lawshave been adopted without a democratic Iraqi government to discuss or approve them. 
 One would have thought that the failures of swift and sudden free market changes in Russia in the 1990's would have made even extremist economists cautious. In Russia and other nations, spontaneously freeing markets from price controls, reducing taxes and suddenly privatizing business was supposed, almost overnight, to create a thriving economy.
In a recent book, "Income and Influence: Social Policy in Emerging Market Economies" (W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research; $14), two economists, Ethan B. Kapstein and Branko Milanovic, remind us how the assumptions behind such "shock therapy" were not borne out. To the contrary, the gross domestic product continued to fall for years in most of the "reformed" nations, and eventually unemployment rose rapidly. The failure to grow immediately after the transition became, in the words of the M.I.T. economist Olivier Blanchard, "the major theoretical challenge facing economists."
And supply side economics, which argues that low taxes are the main ingredient in motivating people to save, invest and innovate, did not even work in the United States. The economist Arthur Laffer, a member of President Ronald Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board, claimed that reduced taxes in the 1980's would actually raise tax revenue. President Bush's current chief economist, N. Gregory Mankiw, wrote in his widely read textbook that "subsequent history failed to confirm Laffer's conjecture."
But never mind such historical lessons. The Iraqi planners, apparently including the Bush administration, seem to assume they can simply wipe the slate clean.
The new plan reduces the top personal income and corporate tax rate to only 15 percent. It reduces tariffs on imports to 5 percent. And it abolishes almost all restrictions on foreign investment. It would allow a handful of foreign banks to take over the domestic banking system.
The openness to private investment unleashed immediate protests among Iraqi businesses and is now being reconsidered. But an even bigger worry for regional economists like Fadhil Mahdi is the low tariff on imports. Mr. Mahdi is the regional program manager for the United Nations Development Program in Beirut; in an e-mail discussion, he stressed that his views were his own, not necessarily those of his organization.
"After the long years of war since 1980 and the sanctions since the 1990's," he said, "Iraq's technological prowess in the civilian sector is worse than Russia's in the 90's. Opening up to imports at a mere 5 percent tariff will most probably ruin many producers and exacerbate unemployment."
As for a 15 percent top income tax rate, can this ever be enough to support adequate social programs? High rates of inflation long ago undermined the Iraqi safety net. Pensions of $3 and $4 a month are almost meaningless. Flows of funds from the three million to four million Iraqi family members overseas are now crucial support. The most important social program is the food-rationing system developed internally when the United Nations created an exception to sanctions on trade, allowing Iraq to export oil in return for food.
But, as has been characteristic of such shock therapy in the past, the new economic planners have not included provisions for social programs. Mr. Kapstein and Mr. Milanovic point out that the shock therapy of the 1990's also neglected social needs. But out of necessity, this soon changed.
Even in Poland, where advocates of shock therapy claim success, the authors point out that there was substantial social spending. It is easy to forget that Poland's economic output fell sharply in the early 1990's after the first round of shock therapy. But unemployment benefits were ample -- reimbursing 60 to 70 percent of a worker's pay compared with an average of 35 percent in the United States. Public pension benefits were indexed to inflation.
Iraq is in far worse shape than Eastern and Central Europe were back then. After two decades of wars and United Nations sanctions, Iraq's economic output had fallen by the late 1990's to the same level it attained in the 1940's, discounted for inflation. The latest war destroyed transportation, water and communications systems. Mr. Mahdi estimates that the current unemployment rate in Iraq is 50 to 60 percent.
But even under better circumstances, ideology outweighs common sense in the current proposals. Free markets just will not be enough.
Infrastructure needs rebuilding. Law and constitutional authority must be established. Security is required to attract investment.
Mr. Mahdi argues that new capital is needed but so is a full-fledged equivalent of the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. He would like to see a public works program established to produce jobs. As part of this, Iraq's international debt should be reduced as much as feasible.
Mr. Mahdi also says he believes that the food-rationing system must be maintained for now and phased out only slowly.
The Iraqi Governing Council and its American supporters will be taken seriously when they present a balanced plan for growth that involves gradual evolution to a market economy that can attract foreign capital and create adequate, well-thought-out social programs. The current plan is supported neither by theory nor experience, only by the wishful ideological thinking of its advocates. Its consequences, as in Russia, could be widespread cruelty.

HEADLINE: Predict the Future? You Can Bet on It 

BYLINE:  By PETER WAYNER

 BODY:
THE off-again, on-again recall election in California hasn't been easy on politicians and voters in that state. It hasn't been too easy on Gavin Peters, either, even though he lives 2,500 miles away in Toronto.
 When the news came in mid-September that a panel of judges had delayed the vote, Mr. Peters, a computer programmer, rushed to his PC. He had been betting that Gov. Gray Davis would be gone by November, but now he desperately wanted to close out those bets and make new ones that Mr. Davis would still be around. 
Mr. Peters succeeded and watched his account grow as the confusion nurtured Mr. Davis's long-term chances. But his bets were still in place a week later when the panel's decision was overturned and the vote was reinstated. 
 "I lost a ton," he said. "I'm down to half of my original money."
 Fortunately for Mr. Peters, he is not playing for real dollars. He is trading play money on the Foresight Exchange (www.ideosphere.com), one of several Web sites that let people speculate on world events by imitating the futures and options trading pits. Instead of investing in the price of hog bellies or the S.&P. 500, the almost 2,000 members of the Foresight Exchange gamble on such questions as whether a space elevator will be built, whether the European Union will expand, or whether a certain cardinal will be the next pope.
 Sites like the Foresight Exchange captured the headlines last summer when Congress discovered that a Pentagon office under the direction of Adm. John M. Poindexter was planning a similar system in which anonymous players could bet on the likelihood of events like acts of terrorism. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which financed the project in the belief that it might help predict the probability of future terrorist attacks, retreated rapidly as congressmen started calling it ghoulish. The Pentagon office, the Information Awareness Office, has since been shut down.
 But in fact, marketplaces like the Foresight Exchange and the one envisioned by Admiral Poindexter are darlings of economists, who describe their workings with sophisticated terms like "price discovery," "opinion aggregation" or "risk analysis." They argue that the constant betting is an efficient way for distilling the opinions of many people into one number.
 In the simplest systems, players buy and sell contracts to pay 100 units of fake or real money at some future point -- like the end of a game or an election. In Mr. Peters's case, he was buying and selling the right to get 100 points if, "by Nov. 16, the Secretary of State has certified elections results in which a majority of voters elect to remove Gray Davis from office."
 These marketplaces synthesize a prediction for the future by letting the price fluctuate as everyone chooses how much to pay for the contracts. Someone who spends 50 points to buy a Davis contract is effectively betting with 1-to-1 odds that Governor Davis will be recalled by the voters. Paying 50 points will yield a profit of 50 points if he is voted out. Someone who paid 33 points would be getting 2-to-1 odds and someone who paid 10 points would be getting 9 to 1 odds.
 Robin Hanson, an assistant professor of economics at George Mason University and an organizer of both the Foresight Exchange and the Pentagon project, said: "What's nice about these institutions is they always come up with a number. When you talk to academics, they might say, 'That's not possible. We don't have the right data. We don't have the right insight.' These markets cough up a number. There may be a lot of error, but at least you get something."
 Markets like these are most accurate when the players have a stake in the question at hand and the result is determined by a large number of people. The Iowa Electronic Markets, for instance, collect small bets made with real money on the outcome of elections. They report that the prices of futures contracts pegged to the results of elections are often better predictors than most polls. (Data from the Iowa markets, run by the faculty of the University of Iowa's business school, are used to study trading behavior and as a teaching tool to introduce students to real-world markets.)
 But when the players know little or have little control of the outcome, the results are often not reliable. The Hollywood Stock Exchange, for example, lets people bet play money on the box office success of movies and stars by purchasing futures contracts. 
 One problem is that the guiding rule in Hollywood, at least according to the screenwriter William Goldman, is that "Nobody knows anything." Aggregating this collective intelligence doesn't always pay off. For example, the Hollywood exchange was predicting that "Gigli," one of this summer's greatest flops, would collect almost $35 million at the box office. It ended up with about $6 million.
 Karl Hallowell, a doctoral student in mathematics at the University of California at Davis, says that defining how the contract ends is an art that often generates deep arguments on the Foresight Exchange. The members try to take complicated policy debates and measure them with some objective number. "There is some evidence that there's global warming, but we're not sure how bad it is," he said. "There's one side that's pro-business and then there's the other side that says we should sacrifice." At the Foresight Exchange, he noted, participants can actually bet that the sea level will rise by a certain amount in a given number of years. "This is something that's measurable," he said.
 Patrick Kobly, a computer programmer in Edmonton, Alberta, and the judge at the Foresight Exchange responsible for determining the winners of the bets in the California recall election, said the bet was defined to hinge on whether or not Gov. Davis was voted out of office by Nov. 16. 
 An Irish company, Tradesports.com, takes a similar approach in offering contracts in political events but settles them with real money, up to several hundred dollars in some cases (being based overseas, it avoids the possibility of running afoul of gambling laws in the United States). The company extended the term of its contracts on the recall vote because they were written to depend on the "winner of the special election." The Iowa Electronic Markets, which also settles such contracts with real money, based their contracts on the results of the election, too.
 John J. Delaney, chief executive of Tradesports, concedes that there will always be a few ambiguities. "When we list the contract, we try to make the rules as clear as possible," he said. "We assume our members will apply common sense to something."
 While the ambiguities can be disconcerting for those who expect the marketplaces to deliver pure insight and clear predictions, they can be opportunities for savvy investors. Many members at the Foresight Exchange are excited about a contract that will pay off if Arnold Schwarzenegger becomes president of the United States by 2022. The contract began in 1998 as an April Fool's joke, given that Mr. Schwarzenegger is of foreign birth and thus prohibited by the Constitution from becoming president. But speculators now note that Sen. Orrin Hatch has introduced legislation to amend the Constitution to remove the native-born restriction. Yesterday, the odds on the contract were 19-to-1.

HEADLINE: Stay Close, Mayor Told Unions. Same to You, the Unions Reply. 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg gave the keynote speech last month at the annual retreat held by the city's labor unions, he repeatedly razzed the union leaders in the audience for holding their conference outside the city in Melville, on Long Island. 
 He noted teasingly that the location was close tohome for many of the union's members. He suggested that they should have called Local 6 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union to get a recommendation for a good union hotel in New York City. 
 He told them he hoped they would hold their conference in the city next summer and "generate some tax revenues" that could go "to pay your members."
So it was with some glee yesterday that the city teachers' union distributed a Department of Education e-mail message giving the details of an overnight retreat the city is holding for the parent coordinators who work in each school -- in Ossining, in Westchester County. 
"We don't begrudge the parent coordinators a retreat," Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union and the chairwoman of the union umbrella group that held last month's retreat, said in a statement. "But will the mayor be helicoptering up to Ossining to criticize the Education Department's choice of location?"
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor, said that the accommodations, at the G.E. Crotonville training center, were made available to the city free. 
"It's apples and oranges, since the facility is being provided for free for the 90 people that are attending," he said. 
"Randi decided she would hold her annual conference at a hotel outside of New York City and deprive city businesses of the economic activity it generated," he said. "I only wish Randi would focus her attention on helping us implement education reform as opposed to coming up with new and creative ways for wasting everyone's time on silliness."

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "THE AMERICAN EFFECT: GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE UNITED STATES, 1990-2003," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Oct. 12. Exploring ways that artists throughout the world react to the United States as a superpower, this show of documentary films, videos, installations, photographs, paintings and objects by 47 artists and filmmakers and 3 collaborative groups runs from sunny side up to deep despair. There are reflections on America's military and industrial might, its treatment of minorities, its consumerism, its justice system, its marketing strategies, its religious evangelism, its celebrity worship and its interference with other governments. There are also expressions of admiration for the freedoms, the opportunities and the material achievements of a country unfettered by ancient traditions. A wacky installation by a French artist, Gilles Barbier, in the form of life-size figures offers a wry take on the United States through its aging comic book heroes, viewed in the setting of a nursing home and in the last stages of decrepitude. The show has its weak spots but is provocative and visually compelling over all. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Grace Glueck).

* "THE DAWN OF PHOTOGRAPHY: FRENCH DAGUERREOTYPES, 1839-1855," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 4. Silvered sheets of copper, sensitized with iodine and developed in heated fumes of mercury, daguerreotypes are alchemical objects of ethereal physicality. The show, although a little too large and repetitive, lucidly tracks the brief evolution of daguerreotypy in France, where the medium lasted barely two decades after its invention in 1839. The best daguerreotypes remain weirdly unlike any other photographs, with their own mysterious sense of space. From this, photography got the seeds of its talismanic aura: most people wouldn't casually rip up photographs of their loved ones, because it is still commonplace to believe, if only unconsciously, that photographs somehow contain tidbits of the souls of their subjects. That is completely irrational and superstitious, of course. But you can see where it comes from when you look at daguerreotypes. They are perfectly true to life and somehow not of this world. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).

* "FRENCH ARTISTS IN ROME: INGRES TO DEGAS, 1803-1873," Dahesh Museum of Art, 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, through Nov. 2. The show auspiciously inaugurates the Dahesh's new Manhattan home in the former I.B.M. gallery, which is just about the only below-ground space in town that is not too bad for looking at art. It charts the evolution of 19th-century French academic art in Rome, although at heart it's about young friends finding themselves as artists in a great city with an intimidating past, a prototypical story that could be told about New York or Paris. The academic stars here are Ingres and David d'Angers. Adolphe William Bouguereau's "Battle Between the Centaurs and the Lapiths," an academic machine of a painting, is a remarkable picture if you can stand it. But the best works in the show tend to be informal portraits and sketches of the Roman landscape, fresh and bathed in light. The exhibition ends on an ethereal note, with paintings by Moreau, Puvis de Chavannes and Degas, who challenged academia and for whom Rome became, when they were older, a kind of enchanted memory. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; students and 62+, $4 (Kimmelman).

"FRIDA KAHLO'S INTIMATE FAMILY PICTURE," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, through Jan. 4. The message of this small painting-cum-photography show seems to be that one of the starriest idols in the feminist pantheon was half Jewish, on her father's side. It is based on her elaborate 1936 painting "My Grandparents, My Parents and I," which depicts her as a child with ancestral portraits, embellished by such clinical details as herself as a fetus in her mother's womb and an egg being fertilized by a sperm. The painting is accompanied by vivid photographs of the artist as a child and a young woman, taken by her photographer father; reproductions of other paintings, including some of her own and a portrait by Henri Rousseau and his wife that apparently inspired her; pertinent books; and other material. It all seems a rather slight basis for an exhibition but proves again that the personal, obsessive thrust of Kahlo's work makes you feel the pain of her life. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m.; Fridays, to 3 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.50 (Glueck).

* ELLSWORTH KELLY, "Red Green Blue," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Nov. 2. Mr. Kelly was the Chet Baker of the new, cool painters of the post-Abstract Expressionist generation. From the late 50's to the mid-60's he produced a series of paintings using the colors red, blue and green. On view in this show, they still sing. With their optically dazzling, high-keyed colors, their catchy, simplified designs and their satiny, brush-free surfaces, the paintings communicate the excitement of a new hedonistic optimism that did much to make the 60's what they were. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).

* "PASSION FOR THE MOUNTAINS: 17TH-CENTURY LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS FROM THE NANJING MUSEUM," China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181, through Dec. 20. The focus of this exquisite show is on the southern city of Nanjing between the defeat of the Ming dynasty in 1644 and the subsequent consolidation of the Qing dynasty. The scrolls, album paintings and fan paintings on loan from the Nanjing Museum distill both the verve of that cosmopolitan city and the mood of fatalistic nostalgia that has long defined classical Chinese art and was particularly acute in periods of political transition. A hand scroll titled "A Thousand Cliffs and Myriad Valleys" by Gong Xian, one of the great Nanjing artists, is a standout. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays, until 8 p.m. Admission: $5; for students and 62+, $3 (Holland Cotter).

* "STRANGERS: THE FIRST I.C.P. TRIENNIAL OF PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0090, through Nov. 30. Not that anyone except the curators felt there was a pressing need for yet another art survey, but the first I.C.P. triennial is that rare case: an instructive, topical show. The theme, "strangers," is nebulous enough to be a catchall for different brands of photography and video (works by Luc Delahaye, Rineke Dijkstra, Collier Schorr, Susan Meiselas, among others); not many of these are discoveries, but the range is wide enough to accommodate the dissimilartastes of the four curators and the diversity of photographic work being made today. The title is also specific enough to mean something. After 9/11 the subject of strangers has gained traction, and most of what's here expresses a cautionary view that the world is full of people who are strangers to one another. You might say that after years of navel-gazing, the climate of photo-based art, as this show presents it, has gradually shifted from me to them. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

KATY GRANNAN, Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, hrough Oct. 29, and Artemis Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, through tomorrow. Echoes of August Sander, Diane Arbus, William Eggleston and high-fashion shots inform these too-derivative photographs, whose youngish, anonymous subjects seem carefully unposed in unremarkable settings. In the black-and-white series "The Morning Call" the sitters responded to Ms. Grannan's newspaper advertisements for models; dressed or naked, most appear in their own homes, nudged by the camera into roles they seem to seek. In "Sugar Camp Road" at Artemis Greenberg Van Doren, Ms. Grannan ventures into larger color formats and outdoor settings. Light plays a formative role, and the approaches are more venturesome, some suggestive, some prim. Though highly acclaimed, Ms. Grannan does not seem to have arrived yet at a truly distinctive style (Glueck).

LOTHAR OSTERBURG, "At the Edge of the Real," Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500, through Oct. 17. Conjuring monumental phenomena with minimal means, Mr. Osterburg presents picturesque photogravures of events like a Zeppelin over Timbuktu or a landing craft's approach to a celestial body. But the settings and props are all contrived in his studio, using mundane materials like twigs, toothpicks, peanut butter and wee electrical parts. Photographed through a magnifying glass or a macro lens, his pictures are given a romantic, retro look through photogravure. Blowing up small objects and settings to make large-scale photographs is nothing new, but Mr. Osterburg's skill in constructing his scenes and suffusing them with nostalgia is quite special (Glueck).

Galleries: 57th Street

"AMERICAN EXPRESSIONISM: ART AND SOCIAL CHANGE, 1920'S-1950'S," Kennedy, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 541-9600, through Nov. 1. A group show of artists pegged by the show's curator, the art and cultural historian Bram Djikstra, as dealing with the hopes, desires and economic troubles of the working classes around the era of the Depression. The problem is that the show's concept has been stretched to a one-size-fits-all cover for an improbable mix of artists whose styles run from the in-your-face injustice imagery of Charles White and Harry Sternberg to the poetic modernism of Marsden Hartley and John Marin. Topflight artists have been lumped with those who at best were mere illustrators. Yet nostalgia buffs, who remember the socially concerned art of the 30's and 40's, will get a charge from some wonderful relics, like Paul Cadmus's rip-roaring satire, "The Fleet's In" (Glueck).

* RINEKE DIJKSTRA, Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Oct. 11. The Dutch artist presents two remarkable series of photographs tracing the progress of new soldiers, one an Israeli woman, one a Frenchman in the Foreign Legion, whom we see grow up over the course of the works. Ms. Dijkstra's subject is life in transition: the cusp of adulthood, parenthood, a new job or a refugee settling in a new country, passages through which people become themselves and in the process reveal themselves. As usual, her photographs are simple, head-on figures against plain backdrops, the subjects staring passively at the camera, presenting themselves as they wish, or trying to, alert but just on the edge of fatigue or distraction, which means their guard is almost down (Kimmelman).

"THE 1940'S: MODERN AMERICAN ART AND DESIGN," Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082, through Nov. 1. Set up like the living room of a sharp-eyed collector of Modernist antiques, this exhibition gathers paintings by Mark Rothko and Dorothea Tanning; sculpture by Alexander Calder and Jose de Rivera; furniture by Charles and Ray Eames and Frank Lloyd Wright; and much more. (In another room, Charmion von Wiegand's colorful, abstract gouache paintings, titled "Improvisations: 1945," are lightweight but infectiously playful.) (Johnson).

* JUDY PFAFF, "Neither Here Nor There," Ameringer & Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0051, through Oct. 11. Given the ubiquity of the installation-piece-as-planned-chaos, Ms. Pfaff should get more respect. "Neither Here Nor There" shows her fluency with a newly transparent, levitating compositional approach, which more than ever offers a seamless melding of drawing, painting and sculpture. It provides a global tour of architectural traditions, materials and motifs, mixing past and present, East and West, decorative and structural, into an elegantly articulate global reverie (Roberta Smith).

VINCENT SMITH, Alexandre, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828, through Oct. 11. After the recent Jacob Lawrence retrospective and with a Romare Bearden survey now at the National Gallery in Washington, this is a good time to revisit the work of Mr. Smith, a painter who learned much from both artists but struck out in directions of his own. A figurative painter of an abstracting and material-intensive kind, he is generous with pigment. Many of his images are pattern-based, made up of nested rectangles and fields of stippled flecks and dots in glowing colors. The results, without overplaying their political hand, generate a smoldering eschatalogical fervor (Cotter).

Galleries: SoHo

"INTERNAL EXCESS," the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through Oct. 18. Highlights of the Drawing Center's latest selection of emerging artists include Arthur Aghajanian's sly charts analyzing familial relations; Mie Yim's pastel pictures of stuffed bears and bunnies in anxiety-fraught situations; Lamar Peterson's coolly surrealistic cartoon images of middle-class blacks; Douglas Florian's idiosyncratic abstractions painted on paper towels; Christine Hiebert's elegantly airy mural made of blue tape; and Astrid Bowlby's bewideringly complex accumulation of cutout cartoon fragments (Johnson).

"O907," Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 925-2035, through Oct. 25. Three neo-Duchampians. Francis Baudevin makes elegant, hard-edged, geometric wall paintings exactingly based on actual corporate logos; Mathieu Mercier glues toothpaste, candy and roach trap boxes together into abstract, Constructivist-style structures; and Nic Hess created an expansive, faux-brick wall out of brown plastic packing tape (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

* ROGER ANDERSSON, Sara Meltzer, 516 West 20th Street, (212) 727-9330, through Oct. 11. Mr. Andersson, a young Swedish artist, uses the letters of the alphabet and a hyper-polished illustrational style to create a corrupt version of fairy tales. Each letter is painted large and embellished with tiny figures and emblems that refer to adolescent politics, pop music and drug culture, and with minutely observed depictions of Scandinavian flora. The primer format, executed in Delft tile blue-and-white, is a clever, if small-scale idea, but Mr. Andersson's smooth, sweet virtuosity gives it some bite (Cotter).

BONNIE COLLURA, "Rebel Angel," Susan Inglett, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 647-9111, through Oct. 11. Ms. Collura's life-size sculptures of angels expelled from heaven have twisted, bulbous, broken and otherwise fantastically altered bodies; and she gives them masks and costumes from sources like Bernini, the Commedia del Arte, "The Wizard of Oz" and Disney's "Snow White." Despite tendencies toward confusing generalization, the work exudes a compelling baroque pathos (Johnson).

TIM DAVIS, Brent Sikkema, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262, through Oct. 11. Mr. Davis's nocturnal photographs of nondescript houses with electric commercial signs reflected in their windows were magical. This show's pictures of paintings in museums, photographed to emphasize glaring surface reflections, similarly conflate different levels of reality -- the physical and the illusory -- but the effect is more interesting conceptually than visually (Johnson).

* PHILIP-LORCA DICORCIA, "A Storybook Life," Pace/MacGill Gallery at PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, through Oct. 11. An unusually personal show from a master of the baroque of everyday life, this show arranges 75 photographs from 25 years into a loose (but not chronological) narrative that intimates an artistic development, an array of personal ties and a penchant for fusing the artificial and the natural in pictures whose emotional and formal resonances seem to unfold in real time (Smith).

* LYLE ASHTON HARRIS, "Memoirs of Hadrian," CRG, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766, through Oct. 18. The large-format photographs in this New York artist's first local show since 1996 were inspired by Marguerite Yourcenar's fictional autobiography of the aging Roman emperor. At the heart of the story is the figure of Antinous, Hadrian's young lover, who drowned and was posthumously deified by imperial order. Their relationship is described in the book as a power struggle, with the emperor fixated on his lover's physical beauty and un-Roman exoticism. The focus of Mr. Harris's pictures is a young black boxer, played by the artist, an object of intense public fascination, but one routinely cast in racist terms of hero, villain and victim (Cotter).

SETH KELLY, "Pseudomorphosis," Derek Eller, 526-30 West 25th Street, (212) 206-6411, through Oct. 11. Mr. Kelly's clunky, allegorical sculptures look like the work of a pretentious teenager who wants to say something about the Middle East. They include an inverted ceiling-mounted mosque, painted to suggest a starry night sky; an army of 14-inch-tall desert warriors derived from Egyptian mythology and Hollywood movies; and a wall drawing of a rocky mountain cave that has the overall appearance of a hand grenade -- a clever allusion, presumably, to Osama bin Laden (Johnson).

JULIAN LETHBRIDGE, Paula Cooper, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through Oct. 18. Mr. Lethbridge paints with a rough immediacy that calls to mind Terry Winters and harks back to the all-over gesturalism of Pollock and de Kooning. In grays or two-color palettes, he creates busy fields of short straight lines, which seem to circulate in response to invisible electromagnetic currents over more broadly and loosely painted lower layers. The paintings have frontal authority; what they want is more adventurous unpredictablility (Johnson).

HANS NELEMAN, "Night Chicas," Ricco/Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through Oct. 11. It is a curious coincidence that Mr. Neleman's big, glossy photographs of prostitutes in Guatemala are up at the same time as Reagan Louie's pictures of Asian sex industry workers (at Von Lintel Gallery). Or maybe it's not, given the popularity of photographic slumming. In any event, Mr. Neleman's best pictures are powerfully theatrical and visually lush. The almost surrealistic image, of a beautiful naked teenager with her feral-looking pet racoon, is stunning (Johnson).

ALESSANDRO RAHO, Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212) 242-7727, through Oct. 11. Under the influence of Alex Katz and David Hockney's realist period, this young London artist paints life-size, whole-figure portraits of trim, beautiful people, floral still-lifes and small pictures of palatial tropical homes. If his paintings weren't so clearly sincere in their sensitively deft execution, you might wonder if Mr. Raho might intend a subversive parody of a certain high bourgeois taste (Johnson).

EDDO STERN, "GodsEye," Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323, through Oct. 11. Unlike most artists working with computers, Mr. Stern pays as much attention to the physical presence of the generic desktop as he does to the development of digital imagery on the monitor. Four sculptures inventively transform the familiar beige plastic outer shell into Lego-like models: an aircraft carrier, a castle, a windmill and a cathedral. Each houses appropriate video game-style imagery, like dragons, medieval warriors and contemporary soldiers (Johnson).

JIL WEINSTOCK, "Cool White"; GERHARD MAYER, "Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer," Caren Golden, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 727-8304, through Oct. 11. Ms. Weinstock soaks striped men's shirts in clear rubber, stretches them on rectangular wood frames and lights them from behind so they glow like stained glass. Women's negligees, similarly treated, add an alluring feminine spin to her commentary on art and its commodification. Mr. Mayer, a German sculptor, makes abstract ink drawings that are amazing for their trippy, systematic complexity (Johnson).

Other Galleries

* "EVERYTHING MATTERS: PAUL KOS, A RETROSPECTIVE," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 6. Mr. Kos's name will ring too few bells here. He helped germinate the Bay Area Conceptual movement that pioneered video, performance and installation art in the late 1960's and early 70's. The spirit of his work is lighthearted and sly. One of his best early videos, from 1974, was shot in Wyoming: "Pilot Butte/Pilot Light" switches back and forth between that eponymous butte and Mr. Kos fashioning a lens out of a block of ice (you see him spinning the block on the inside of the lid of a pot to get the proper curvature), then focusing sunlight through the ice to spark kindling. The through-line is Mr. Kos's catholic approach to materials. He balances a candle and a bell on the tip of a broomstick, which he discovered one day would stand up on its own if he jammed the business end of the broom against the floor just right. Better late than never to remind New Yorkers that some of what we take to be fresh or our own discovery in art has been done before, and elsewhere (Kimmelman).

TAKASHI MURAKAMI, "Reversed Double Helix," Rockefeller Center, (212) 980-3942, through Oct. 12. At the center of Mr. Murakami's eye-grabbing outdoor sculptural tableau sits Mr. Pointy, a giant slug-like cartoon character in colorful molded plastic who meditates with Buddha-like complacency upon a pair of hovering 33-foot black balloons emblazoned with winking eyes. Surrounded by pudgy, cherubic guards and flanked by patches of giant mushrooms, which serve as seats for weary parents and gymnastic pedestals for toddlers, Mr. Pointy might be a beneficent god of child-centric fantasy or a Pied Piper of contemporary digital oblivion (Johnson).

Last Chance

DERRICK ADAMS, Jack Tilton, 49 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 941-1775, through tomorrow. The ingredients in this young New York artist's solo debut show include sex, children's toys, racial stereotypes and breakfast cereal, which is actually not that unusual a mix in art these days. A video shows a gluttonous Teddy Bear's picnic shot near the Hudson River at 125th Street, while a sculpture in the back room involves a fuzzy pink elephant trunk spouting cornflakes. In short, there's a lot happening of an innocence-and-experience kind, and Mr. Adams's approach is evenhandedly naughty and nice (Cotter).

FRED BECKER, "A 90th Birthday Celebration," Susan Teller, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 941-7335, through tomorrow. A painter, draftsman and printmaker, Mr. Becker began his career doing etchings and wood engravings with the W.P.A. in the 1930's and later mastered a variety of techniques and styles. This show presents works going back to 1935, among them a winning, complex little color drawing of a bicyclist. But its highlights are a group of colorific acrylics from the mid-1950's, like "Abstraction," a gestural painting of black and white lines and shapes that dance on a ground of brilliantly hued planes. There's much else here, too, to surprise and entertain the eye (Glueck).

* BJORN DAHLEM, "Coma Sculptor," Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, through tomorrow. This young German sculptor is not really a zany madman, but he does a good job of playing one. With the skills of an inept handyman, Mr. Dahlem has used raw lumber, packing tape and ordinary electric lights to cobble together a sprawling, hovering model of what he claims to be a "galactic supercluster." At the center, inside a silver-painted wooden pyramid framework, is a symbol of essential life: a hot dog in a bottle of clear liquid (Johnson).

* SAMUEL FOSSO, Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1701, through tomorrow.This African artist, who was born in Cameroon and lives and works in Central African Republic, makes an overdue Manhattan solo debut with 33 photographs spanning his career. In the 1970's Mr. Fosso opened a professional photo-portrait studio, and between sessions with his clients took pictures of himself dressed in local versions of Western fashions. A result is self-portraiture both autobiographical and fictional, an art of trying on styles, moods and selves in the years after independence movements left Africa colonial and postcolonial, liberated and trapped. His pictures reflect much of that, and none with more immediacy than a 1996 photo made during political turmoil, in which he depicts himself as a naked prisoner, looking startled, intruded on, hurt (Cotter).

* "IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN," Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, through tomorrow. A great idea. For this show the gallery is functioning as a modest-size bookshop stocked with inexpensive and hard-to-find publications, in several media, by or about contemporary artists. From Lucas and Sternberg Press come polished books on Kai Althoff and Marcel Odenbach. A collaborative called Continuous Projects (Wade Guyton, Seth Price and Bettina Funke) offers photocopies of a hot publication of yesteryear, Avalanche. The musician Arturo Lindsay is represented by CD's; Ara Peterson, of the disbanded Forcefield collective, by a riveting video of horror movie outtakes. Most fun, and very cheap, is a tabloid newspaper published by Aleksandra Mir, a young New York artist who should be on everyone's radar by now (Cotter).

"MATERIAL DIFFERENCES: ART AND IDENTITY IN AFRICA," Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700, through Monday. Part Art Methods 101, part Advanced Connoisseurship, this handsome, thoughtful show examines the potent connection between matter and meaning in diverse African cultures and shows them to be organically connected. The material is spiritual in these cultures, and the show's 130 mostly ceremonial objects, arranged strictly according to materials and techniques, reflect the power of that belief. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3 (Smith).

MARC SWANSON, "Live Free or Die," Bellwether, 335 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 387-3701, through Monday. Mr. Swanson has assembled an elaborate two-room installation dense with personal symbols of what it meant to grow up gay and artist in rural America. Sculptures of black deer, sparkling with glitter, stand by the entrance; a rainbow-colored target fills a wall; marijuana leaves lie on a pedestal; weblike nets hang from the ceiling. The prevailing themes are hunting and escaping, and Mr. Swanson handles them with episodic elan (Cotter).

* JAMES WELLING, "Los Angeles," Gorney Bravin & Lee, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-8372, through tomorrow. Looking at Mr. Welling's melancholy, beautifully composed and printed photographs of scenes in Los Angeles, including images of battered parked cars, industrial buildings tarted up with bright new paint and a ghostly seaside amusement park, you might feel as if you were seeing through the eyes of a burned-out movie detective on a hopeless case (Johnson).

HEADLINE: REVERBERATIONS; 
Opening Night: Glamour, Grumbling and Even Opera

BYLINE:  By John Rockwell

 BODY:
Even with air-conditioning and year-round union contracts and summer festivals under every tree, a new season stirs to life every fall. For culture mavens nothing -- not the first blockbuster exhibition opening at the Metropolitan Museum, not the first television shows or post-summer semi-serious films -- symbolizes that new beginning like an opera opening.
 Two of the country's grandest and most venerable companies, the San Francisco Opera and the Metropolitan Opera, began their new seasons recently, and they made an instructive contrast. Even though San Francisco's opener by tradition was actually in late summer, on Sept. 6, while the Met procrastinated until Monday night. 
 Before the contrasts, however, some similarities. Opening nights are an occasion for social display: social more than big-star glamour, although the Met is trying this year to pump up the glamour quotient by hiring an outside public relations firm to reach television and the gossip columnists. San Francisco opening nights have usually been shorter on glamour (except when Sharon Stone was still married to the executive editor of The San Francisco Chronicle) but longer on flamboyance, since along with the penguins sporting tuxedos in their boxes comes all manner of flamboyant display by the more flamboyant members of the community.
San Francisco's finest (or at least some of its richest; not much flamboyance here) partied in a big tent set incongruously in a parking lot but looking inside like a harem fantasy of Araby. The Met confined its post-opening gala diners to the (formerly Vilar) Grand Tier, with 69 tables around which New York's finest/richest were packed elbow to elbow.
Both companies need their patrons more than ever, since both, along with nearly every other major opera company in the United States, have suffered in the wake of terrorist jitters and the current recession or slow recovery or whatever it is. Donations are down, and so is attendance. Using a not entirely original metaphor, Joseph Volpe, the Met's general manager, suggested last season that during the week a cannon could be fired in the parterre and kill not a soul. He blamed the situation on a dearth of Japanese tourists, but surely it's more complicated than that.
What was instructive was how each company responded to the downturn. San Francisco had intended to open with a new production of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Coq d'Or." That wouldn't have fulfilled conventional wisdom, which is that high society likes its opening-night operas short and familiar. "Le Coq d'Or" is at least short and peppy and accessible, and would have answered to San Francisco's much-trumpeted desire, under the still-young regime of Pamela Rosenberg, to attract new audiences through boldness and innovation.
But budget crunching forced the cancellation of "Le Coq d'Or" and its replacement with Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein's "Mother of Us All." This was presented in the Christopher Alden production familiar to New York operagoers from Glimmerglass and the New York City Opera, although in San Francisco it was deftly recast (with Luana DeVol as a Susan B. Anthony both imperious and maternal) and lushly conducted by Donald Runnicles.
There are those of us who think of "The Mother of Us All" as the great American opera. That opinion was not shared by the dominant local music critic, Joshua Kosman of The Chronicle, or by a good portion of the company's monied patrons. Grumbling at the intermission and the dinner was loud, and the next day came threats of suspended donations and worse. All the fuss seemed odd for an opera that speaks to American themes in a quirky but eminently accessible American folk idiom. But opening-night audiences want their operas to be as smoothly palatable as their post-performance dinners.
On Monday night the Met gave them what they wanted, what they expected from the Met and more. The opera was that seeming chestnut, Verdi's "Traviata." But the singers, along with Valery Gergiev's fleet conducting, made the hoary old drama pulse with life.
In recent seasons the Met has shown signs of frisky spirit in its repertory and production choices, but the terror-recession nexus seems to be driving it back into its old, conservative ways: comfortable operas in comfortable productions with the best singers around. Of course there are still innovations forthcoming this season; Berlioz's "Benvenuto Cellini" and Halevy's "Juive" are among the new productions. But mostly it's tried and true, and on Monday night it was true indeed.
One hopes that not too much of the audience's evident rapture was sparked by Franco Zeffirelli's production, which combines handsome period decor with his trademark gigantism. But with endemic laments about a lost golden age of Verdi singing, Renee Fleming and the rest of the cast made a pretty persuasive counterargument.
For all her current fame, Ms. Fleming has had uneven success in her recent Met roles. Sometimes her singing sounds brittle or uneasy. (An Arabella two years ago comes to mind.) But one might have anticipated her success with Violetta from the way she attacked the "Libera me" from Verdi's Requiem at Carnegie Hall in April 2001. On Monday her line was firm, and her tone was beautiful, but what stood out was her passion: the way this basically demure and light-voiced soprano dug chestily into the notes.
There is something thrilling about a singer who stretches beyond her natural capacities without distorting her basic gifts: I still remember how Elisabeth Schwarzkopf tore into the role of Elisabeth in Wagner's "Tannhauser" in Vienna decades back. Ms. Fleming brought the same kind of intensity to "La Traviata."
Singing this intelligent and gifted and impassioned justifies the Met's conservatism. You can't rely on it all the time. But when it appears onstage, it creates a link back through generations of great singers to the composer's original inspiration. Monday's audience seemed to recognize it was in the presence of something special. Even on opening night.

HEADLINE: Treasures of the Russian Evolution 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LOURIE; Richard Lourie is the author of "Sakharov: A Biography."

 BODY:
Russians are like New Yorkers. Their own world is so vast and fascinating that very little of what happens outside it can compete for their attention.
 For example, in November 1988 I was in Moscow at the time of the American presidential elections. The cold war was still on, the missiles were still aimed and Americans were still not sure what to make of Gorbachev. So you'd think who would be occupying the Oval Office for the next four years would be a matter of more than passing interest. But on Election Day no Russian I asked had heard anything. Finally I ducked into a hotel bar, but neither the clientele nor the bartender could tell me who had won. Overhearing me, an old cleaning woman pushing a wide broom across the floor looked back over her shoulder and said impassively: "Boosh." 
 But Russians are like New Yorkers in the exactly opposite sense as well. Both are open, expansive, susceptible to international influence. The Russians took Christianity from the Greek Orthodox Byzantines, the novel from Western Europe, Communism from a German Jew. Like any great living enterprise, Russia is a bundle of contradictions. No one put it better than Will Rogers: "Russia is a country that no matter what you say about it, it's true." 
The New York Public Library's exhibition "Russia Engages the World, 1453-1825" deals squarely with Russia's emergence from subjugation and obscurity to become a presence and a power in the world. Running from today through Jan. 31, the show also includes a companion book, a Web site, a lecture series, symposiums and a film series that features the classic "Alexander Nevsky" and the new cult film hit "Russian Ark," shot in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg in one continuous take.
But the centerpiece is the exhibition: tasteful, intelligent, lively, even a touch witty at times under the curators Edward Kasinec and Robert H. Davis Jr. of the library's Slavic and Baltic division and Prof. Cynthia Hyla Whittaker of Baruch College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The show does not just explicate history; both its contents and sponsorship were shaped by history. The library's surprisingly diverse and copious Russian collection was amassed in the 150 years since the founding of the Astor Library.
Acquisition was particularly intense after the 1917 revolution, when the Bolshevik government was in sore need of ready money and placed little value on relics of the religious and imperialist past. Among those at odds with the Bolsheviks were the family of Boris Jordan, who fled to the United States. Mr. Jordan returned to Russia in the 1990's and to its hurly-burly capitalism. Fittingly, some of the fruits of his success have been used to pay for this exhibition.
"Russia Engages the World" makes ingenious use of the library's physical space by housing the show in two rooms. The first, the Sue and Edgar Wachenheim III Gallery, is small and enclosed, physically suggesting the Russia of the 15th century where few foreigners ventured and from where few travelers went forth to explore. The room, full of the beautiful a cappellas of Russian Orthodox liturgical music along with icons and bibles both hand-lettered and printed, is a reminder that in the Russia ruled by the Mongols from 1240 to 1500 it was the church that kept the nation's soul and culture alive.
This exhibition will provide pleasure and instruction to aficionados and the uninitiated alike, though some background knowledge of Russia before 1453 does help. Russia accepted Eastern Orthodox Christianity in 988 from Byzantium, largely because of political and economic advantages. Legend has it that Judaism and Islam were also considered but Islam was rejected because, as Grand Prince Vladimir put it: "The Russian cannot bear to think/of life devoid of all strong drink." (This section has an elegant, typically Russian drinking vessel called a kovsh that held a fearsome amount of liquor and was presumably not to be sipped.)
The earliest civilization, Kievan Russia, was vibrant and progressive; when a Kievan princess married King Philip of France, she proved the only literate member of the royal family and signed all France's state documents. Russia's happy childhood came to an end when Genghis Khan's Mongol horde arrived, sacking cities and celebrating victory by covering Russian princes with planks and feasting to their death cries.
Mongol rule was waning in 1453 but was not over when Constantinople fell to the Turks. The spiritual capital of Eastern Orthodoxy was in the hands of the Muslim enemy. During the reign of Ivan the Terrible a new doctrine would be promulgated, that of Moscow as the third Rome, the third and last capital of Christendom. Expansionism now had the highest justification. Ivan created the first secret police to help coerce reluctant principalities into the new aggressive Russia of which he became the first czar.
Russia was more visited now, the English among the first to penetrate the Slavic hinterlands. Some of the books on display, like that by Giles Fletcher, the English ambassador to Russia, "Of the Russe Common Wealth," and "The Reporte of a Bloudie and Terrible Massacre in the Citty of Mosco" by William Russell, remain valuable source materials to this day. Ivan took advantage of the English contacts to propose marriage to Queen Elizabeth. Nothing came of it, of course, but the marriage night of the Virgin Queen and the Terrible Czar might yet make great Monty Python material.
Among other oddities and rarities in this room is "A Brief History of Moscovia" by John Milton. This book, a mere compendium, the curators note, "leaves much to be desired." Curiously, centuries later, the great Soviet film director Sergei Eisenstein made "Alexander Nevsky" and choreographed the famous battle scene on the ice based on Milton's description of the war in heaven in "Paradise Lost."
Engravings were the photojournalism of an unimaginably slower time that was even slower in Muscovy than in Western Europe. It took a hundred years for Gutenberg's invention to reach Russia. Images of audiences with Ivan the Terrible and with the new dynasty of the Romanovs hardly differ at all. Travelers leaving Muscovy in the 16th century were glad to escape its gloom and gravity. And it is with a similar feeling of release that one leaves the enclosed world of the Wachenheim Gallery and enters the D. Samuel and Jeane H. Gottesman Exhibition Hall, which feels appropriately expansive and imperial.
At the entrance the visitor is arrested by a large copy of "The Sacrifice of Isaac" by Rembrandt. Abraham's hand has been stayed by an angel, his other hand still covers his son's face. The knife falls through the air. Violence has been averted, sacrifice sublimated. This picture was chosen, says Mr. Kasinec, one of the curators, because it was so "magnificently ecumenical." The work of a Dutch master bought by a Russian empress, Catherine the Great, from the Walpole collection of England, the original is now in the Hermitage. All the same, something bothered me about the choice, though I couldn't say exactly what.
No one hated medieval Muscovy with its superstitions and Kremlin intrigues more than Peter the Great. Three hundred years ago he founded a new city, St. Petersburg, named for his patron saint, to be both Russia's "window on the West" and an aperture through which it could fire cannon at its enemies, principally Sweden.
As the exhibition's lithographs show, the city was beautiful from the start, though there was always something paradoxical about it: a "Western" city modeled on Amsterdam and Venice that was the product of one man's command and the forced labor of thousands. It's also known as a city "built on bones." Some of the best early engravings of St. Petersburg were made by foreigners like John Augustus Atkinson while at the same time Moscow was being lovingly rendered by Francesco Camporesi of Bologna. A great deal of what we take as quintessentially Russian, from St. Basil's on Red Square to the Winter Palace, was designed by Italians and recorded by them in lithographs.
Russia was now an empire, Peter its first emperor and St. Petersburg its capital. After centuries of subjugation and stagnation, the Russians were exploring, conquering and annexing with a vengeance. All of Siberia fell to Russia, then Alaska. The conquest of those territories resulted in some of the most lovely and startling images in the exhibition, like those of the aborigines of Alaska and the South Sea Islands, which the Russians in their passion for expansion also reached.
The conquest of Siberia was relatively easy, but Russia soon bumped up against China, no pushover. Some of the exhibition's more intriguing images are of the fabled city, half Chinese (called Maimachen), half Russian (Kyakhta) on the Mongolian border, one of two where trade between the countries was allowed. As late as the 19th century, travelers were amazed by the place, passing from the Russian side of log houses and golden cupolas to the Chinese side of paper lanterns, pigtails and black silk clothing. This section of the exhibition includes not only objects like Chinese porcelain vases but also reflections of the Russia in Chinese and Japanese eyes. The show also contains equally rich cultural artifacts from Russia's intersection with Muslim lands and India.
What Peter began, Catherine completed. She linked their names forever on the base of the statue of Peter known as the Bronze Horseman: "To Peter I from Catherine II." An engraving by Jacobus van der Schley depicts the delivery of the 2,000-ton "Thunder Stone" for the base of the monument as Catherine looks on. Peter built the city, Catherine made it a glittering capital, buying the libraries of Diderot and Voltaire, with whom she corresponded, though she failed to entice Voltaire to her court.
Many artists were, however, attracted by St. Petersburg for its exotic splendor and as a market hungry for culture. Those German and French artists not only portrayed court life but also created invaluable images of the time -- dancing peasants and caviar vendors. (Caviar was a staple in those days, not a luxury.)
The exhibition quietly reminds us that not all was progressive in the realm of the "Adorable Catherine." When an English writer, William Coxe, described Russia's oppressive government and the nearly successful peasant uprising of 1773-74, his book was banned in Russia. The French Revolution of 1789 put the fear of free thought into Catherine. But she knew how to distract herself from her imperial anxieties. Her entourage included the sexual equivalent of a food-taster. One sly watercolor of guarded palace doors opens to show Catherine and Potemkin (he of the villages fame) exchanging more than opinions.
It was in the reign of Catherine's grandson, Alexander I, that Russia most fully engaged the world and its literature began its astounding flowering. Russian literature had a certain international quality from the start. The poet Mikhail Lermontov was the descendant of Scottish mercenaries, and Aleksandr Pushkin, Russia's Shakespeare, had African blood, spoke French at home and was taught Russian by his nanny.
In 1812, the year the Russians founded Fort Ross in Northern California, their easternmost point of expansion, they were attacked from the west by Napoleon. Illustrations of the time depict Napoleon as small, sinister and ridiculous as he watches Moscow go up in flames. Two years later Russia's Army entered Paris as conquerors. The army was composed of a great variety of peoples, as one of the exhibition's stronger images, that of a Kalmyk horseman, makes clear.
The Don Cossacks were so taken with Paris that upon their return to Russia they built their own Arc de Triomphe and Place de l'Etoile in their capital, Novocherkassk. The glory was short-lived. By 1825 Alexander I was dead, and in the interregnum Russian officers revolted, calling for constitutional monarchy and the end of serfdom. Russia was on the road to revolution.
Emerging from the show's engravings, maps, proclamations and frontispieces that somehow miraculously recreated nearly four centuries of Russia, I take another look at "The Sacrifice of Isaac," still wondering why it disturbs me. Then it comes to me. Russia is the land where the father kills the son! Both Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great were directly involved in the slaying of their own sons, whom they suspected of treachery. (Stalin carried on the tradition by refusing to exchange a German general for his son, who was a P.O.W., saying, "I have no son.")
The march from the isolation of 1453 to the engagement of 1825 was epic and heroic. The price paid in blood, lives and suffering was immense, perhaps incommensurate. And the hope now for the sons and daughters of Russia is that all that is part of the past.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Weekend on Oct. 3 about the New York Public Library's exhibition "Russia Engages the World, 1453-1825" misstated the relationship between an 11th-century Kievan princess and King Philip I of France. She was his mother, not his wife.

HEADLINE: Measuring Poverty 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "Who's Poor? Don't Ask the Census Bureau" (Op-Ed, Sept. 26), Jared Bernstein sends a helpful message about the woeful inadequacy of the United States definition of poverty. 
The adjustments he proposes would come much closer than we do now to measure the true, and shocking, poverty rate. 
 But even an adjusted measure, based on better budget studies, would fall short. Poverty is best measured in relation to the incomes of other Americans. Economic growth should translate into rising incomes across the income scale. A poverty definition that captured whether this was occurring, such as a percent of median income, would be a good beginning.

HEADLINE: JOURNEYS; 
When 'Welcome' Doesn't Mean Junior

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE EGAN and ANNA BAHNEY

 BODY:
NOT long after Gil and Liz Riviere checked into their richly appointed room at the Inn at Ocean's Edge near Camden, Me., the phone started ringing. But it wasn't housekeeping offering turn-down service. It was the front desk saying they would have to leave immediately and that a state trooper was coming to make sure they did. 
 Their offense: They had brought along their 21-month-old son to the "adults only" hotel. 
 Mr. Riviere, a mortgage broker in Waialua, Hawaii, and his wife, a teacher, were in Maine for the wedding of Ms. Riviere's sister two years ago. "I couldn't believe that an innkeeper could throw me out for having a child," Mr. Riviere said in a telephone interview. "We had paid for the room. We were going to use it." 
No one tracks just how many hotels have added "no children" policies in recent years. But the practice has become so common that the latest edition of the Zagat Survey of hotels, spas and resorts in the United States has a new category, "Children Not Recommended," with more than a dozen listings, from the Kenwood Inn near Sonoma, Calif., to the tiny Point resort on Upper Saranac Lake in New York. "If parents brought children, they'd be tiptoeing around ordering the kids not to touch this or that," said Tim Zagat, the co-publisher of the guides. "These probably aren't places where kids would feel comfortable."
The hotels say the adults-only policy is a way of maintaining their sophisticated atmosphere, with three-hour dinners and well-stocked wine cellars, and of cutting down on upkeep (no sticky handprints to clean up). Safety may also be an issue when there are swimming pools without fences and balconies with widely spaced balusters. 
Besides, the hotels say, the guests -- parents among them -- like it, too. "Seventy-five percent of our guests are New Yorkers looking to escape their kids," said Philip Wood, the chief operating officer of the Garrett Hotel Group, which owns both the Point and the nearby Lake Placid Lodge, which recently increased its minimum age from 12 to 14. 
That's fine with Sheila Addis, a Philadelphia singer and actress and the mother of two. While she is happy to take the children along on family vacations, when it comes to a quick getaway with her husband, Andy, she looks specifically for adult-friendly resorts. "I choose a property where there's not an overwhelming family scene," she said. "I don't mind one or two kids around -- as long as I'm not in charge of them."
Many of the hotels say that children wouldn't like them much, anyway. The Twin Farms resort in Barnard, Vt., has a 28,000-bottle wine cellar, art by Jim Dine and David Hockney and a spa offering facials and massages (all for $950 and up a night). "These kinds of things require an adult appreciation," said Beverly Matthews, the resort's vice president. "The Twin Farms experience would be somewhat wasted on children." The hotel does not allow guests under 18.
At the Soniat House in New Orleans (no children under 10), Frances Smith, an owner, said that the biggest issue is maintenance. When children were allowed, she said, the hotel staff found baby-food stains on the $1,000 bedspreads and crayon marks on the custom-made tablecloths. 
"A couple with a child once stayed five nights and paid $2,400 for their suite," Ms. Smith said. "After they checked out, we paid $3,000 to repaint the walls, all of which were covered with black fingerprint smudges."
But not all adults-only properties, are protecting the expensive artwork or Pratesi linens. At the trendy Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, Calif., the bungalows resemble treehouses and the hotel offers seemingly child-friendly touches like nightly stargazing sessions and outdoor showers with big buckets of rainwater. But the hotel, which cantilevers 1,200 feet over the Pacific Ocean, says that its guests must be 18 or older.
"Our clients go to great lengths to leave their own children with someone else so that they can get away alone," said Nikki Baker Nusbaum, the assistant general manager. "To be able to see and hear someone else's children is a problem."
What happens when a couple turns up at a "no guests under 18" property with (surprise!) children in tow? Most hotels said that they would not go as far as the owners of the Inn at Ocean's Edge and actually evict anyone. But they won't exactly be welcomed, either. At the two Adirondack resorts, for instance, Mr. Wood said that offenders are encouraged to dine in their cabins. And when a family recently showed up at the Post Ranch Inn with a nanny and children, "they made a wise decision and canceled," said Mrs. Nusbaum, who added that the hotel refunded their money and found them a more family-friendly place nearby.
There is no federal law prohibiting discrimination against children at hotels. But some states like Maine take a dim view of age restrictions, said Patricia Ryan, the director of the Maine Human Rights Commission, which earlier this year ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Rivieres had been discriminated against by Ray and Marie Donner, the owners of the Inn at Ocean's Edge.
After an hour of discussions with the trooper and the Donners, Mr. Riviere said, he and his wife and son left the inn, forfeiting the $470 they had paid for the two nights they had booked. They have since filed suit against the inn in Maine Superior Court, Mr. Riviere said, and the case is still pending.
Mrs. Donner declined to comment on the incident.
For many hotels, the age limits are suggestions, not hard-and-fast rules. At the 1940's-modern Orbit In motel in Palm Springs, Calif., anyone under 21 is discouraged from checking in. "We have found that children can have a really serious negative impact on the serenity and the vibe here," said Patrick Richardson, the general manager. "Same goes for pets."
Still, he said, "there is a lot of gray area there -- we just try to dance around it as much as possible."
A "no children" policy may not be good for business, either, especially given the continuing travel industry slump, with occupancy rates running at just slightly over 60 percent this year in the United States. "In this day and age, I'm a little surprised that anyone has a no-kids policy," said John Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, a travel research group based in San Francisco. "With everyone trying to get any business, I'd think that they'd be open to any kind of guest." 
Economics can sometimes bring a little flexibility to no-children policies. For most of the year, Ballantines Original, a 1950's-era hotel in Palm Springs, is child-free. But in August, usually the desert resort's slowest month, David Smith, the owner, decided to open the hotel up to parents with children, and the 13 rooms sold out. (They still had cocktail hour, but by written request.)
Still, Mr. Smith is not contemplating changing the policy for the other 11 months of the year. "There are a lot of great hotels that have fantastic programs for kids," he said. "We don't discriminate. Just no kids."

HEADLINE: They Spent the Tax Rebate. Now What Will Consumers Do? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IF you send it, they will spend it.
 The third quarter was a phenomenal one for the American economy, which probably grew at an annual rate of above 5 percent. Corporate profits soared. 
 As that growth occurred, economic optimism grew both in this country and overseas. There was talk that the American engine was again pulling the world back into acceptable growth patterns. Even American business leaders began to seem a little more optimistic, with capital spending plans starting to edge up. Only the negative job market outlook put a shadow on the sunny picture.
Overlooked in some of the analysis at the time was the most obvious fact of all: checks totaling $13.7 billion were being mailed out by Uncle Sam to millions of families. The checks, for the child tax credit, did not go to the poorest Americans, a fact that outraged liberal legislators who learned of the details only after the bill passed. And they did not go to wealthier Americans, who would have been more likely to save the money anyway. They went to the parents in between the two groups.
Now comes the aftermath. The checks were in the hands of Americans in July and August, and clearly lifted spending in the back-to-school season. We don't have September numbers yet, but there was probably some stimulative effect then. But it's over now.
It was fun while it lasted. Personal income was growing slowly on a pretax basis, but after-tax disposable income rose more rapidly in July and August than at any time since early 2002, when tax cuts were also helping the economy along.
For business, that created a bonanza. Revenues leaped, but payrolls, the biggest part of most companies' expenses, stayed the same. A result was a surge in profits.
It would be nice to think the profit surge would lead to more investment and more hiring. There has been a gradual increase in capital spending, which was cut after the 1990's bubble burst. And there are reports of retailers stepping up Christmas orders after being favorably impressed by the back-to-school season. But hiring continues to lag and a big increase in Christmas orders could lead to a blue Christmas as retailers deal with excess inventory.
Another big tax cut seems unlikely, with the federal budget deficit ballooning and the costs of the Iraq occupation rising. So we may be left with what we had before: slow growth and an economy gradually recovering from the overinvestment of the bubble era, particularly in telecommunications and technology.
"The fading of the tax-cut impact means consumption growth will slow significantly in coming months," said Greg Jensen of Bridgewater Associates, an institutional money management firm. "There is some chance this decline will be muted if corporations start hiring, but there are no signs they are doing that yet. Without a significant increase in labor compensation, spending growth will decline significantly and we could be in the early stages of a renewed dip in the economy."
Such a dip need not be severe. The economic recovery lives on, but it will be a gradual one, not the rapid one that some saw in the summer numbers. Monetary policy is likely to remain easy for a long time to come, and as Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG/Hoenig, notes, the very strong productivity numbers, even after the bubble burst, are a good long-term sign. But the big engine of summer spending is gone, and the economic news may get worse before it gets better.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Claims Rose Last Week 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose last week, while factory orders fell sharply in August, the government said Thursday in reports showing a wobbly economic recovery. 
 The Labor Department said filings for state unemployment benefits rose by 13,000, to 399,000 in the week ended Saturday. The level was slightly above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. 
 The increase was partly attributed to Hurricane Isabel, which caused many claims-processing offices to close the previous week, preventing people from filing. 
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that factory orders dropped a larger-than-expected 0.8 percent in August, led by a 2.3 percent drop in transportation-related orders.
Orders for durable goods, which are items meant to last three or more years, were revised to a 1.1 percent decline in August from the 0.9 percent drop reported last week. 
In Thursday's factory report, orders for July were revised up slightly, to a 2.0 percent gain. 
The August decline was the first since April, when orders slid 2.6 percent, and was steeper than Wall Street forecasts for a 0.2 percent decline. 
Manufacturing has been among the sectors most affected by the sluggishness in the economy. Companies have been slow to invest in plants or equipment, or hire new workers, because they have excess production capacity. 
The manufacturing sector has given off conflicting signals about itshealth in recent weeks. The Federal Reserve said industrial production gained a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in August, while a closely watched monthly survey released on Wednesday by the Institute for Supply Management showed factory activity grew in September but at a slower pace. 
Referring to the Labor Department's payroll report scheduled for release on Friday, Gary Bigg, an economist with Banc of America Securities in New York, said: "Today's report continues to indicate that labor markets have stabilized. We expect to see a small decline of 20,000 in payrolls this Friday with the unemployment rate rising to 6.2 percent."

HEADLINE: M.T.A. to Include 19th Century Building in Downtown Transit Hub 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The gateway to Lower Manhattan's 21st-century transit hub may be through the Renaissance Revival arches of an ornate 19th-century office tower.
 In planning the enormous Fulton Street Transit Center on Broadway, between Fulton and John Streets, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has agreed to preserve the 115-year-old Corbin Building at 11 John Street and, if it proves possible, incorporate it into the station. 
 "Our new transit center and downtown's historic architecture are both important to the future success of Lower Manhattan," Peter S. Kalikow, the authority's chairman, said yesterday in a statement. "So we are pleased to work with preservationists and the community to design the transit hub in a way that can preserve the Corbin Building." 
Besides saving a notably handsome work by the inventive architect Francis H. Kimball, the decision signals that historical structures will be seriously considered in downtown redevelopment. Preservationists and neighbors have worried that the push to rebuild Lower Manhattan might claim many of the smaller and older buildings that give the area its distinctive character.
Bernadette Castro, the state parks commissioner and historic preservation officer, called the Corbin Building an outstanding example of Renaissance Revival architecture and praised the M.T.A.'s effort "to recognize and incorporate it into the overall design" of the Fulton Street station.
The nine-story Corbin Building has stood in particularly high profile because it occupies part of the site on which the M.T.A. is planning a transit hub intended finally to bring some order to the ganglia of subway platforms serving the A, C, J, M, Z, 2, 3, 4 and 5 subway lines.
The Corbin Building was highlighted by the World Monuments Fund in its recently released list of the 100 most-endangered cultural heritage sites around the world. It was also identified as being at risk by a coalition called the Lower Manhattan Emergency Preservation Fund in its list of some 300 historical sites, most of which are unprotected by landmark status.
"It didn't take long to see Corbin as No. 1 on that list," said Robert B. Tierney, the chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Because it is not a landmark, he said, the question was how to save it.
Mr. Tierney said he decided to forgo the process of a formal landmark designation because of the time involved and the fact that the M.T.A., as a state agency, could demolish a structure with landmark status anyway.
Instead, he initiated discussions, negotiations and site visits that led up to a meeting about a month ago with Mr. Kalikow.
Working with Mr. Tierney and Ms. Castro and in doing its own research, the M.T.A. concluded that the Corbin Building was architecturally significant, William M. Wheeler, the agency's director of special project development and planning, said yesterday.
Only 20 feet wide on Broadway, but 160 feet long on John Street, the Corbin Building looks something like a Roman aqueduct with French Renaissance flourishes, arches over arches over arches. Though the ground floor has been badly altered, the upper floors, except for a chiropractor's sign, are remarkably intact. Under a sooty blanket are russet-colored bricks and terra cotta. Crouching griffins and grotesque masks greet visitors at the entrance.
The building's developer, Austin Corbin, also consolidated several insolvent rail lines into the Long Island Rail Road, a slight but intriguing transportation connection that preservationists emphasized to the M.T.A.
"The historic community has said to us that there are places all around the world where old and new have been mixed successfully," Mr. Wheeler said, "where you can balance meeting transportation needs in a modern way and at the same time respect the historic nature of the area you're working in.
"They're right."
The architect of the Fulton Street Transit Center is Nicholas Grimshaw & Partners, a British firm whose projects include the Waterloo International Terminal in London. The engineers are Ove Arup & Partners.
Mr. Wheeler said there was not yet a design for the Lower Manhattan transit center because the project is still going through an environmental impact study. He said that document should be complete this winter.
"We won't have a picture of the project until sometime next year," he said. 
But he added that it was possible that the Corbin Building might be incorporated into the transit center and not simply stand alongside it.

The Bush administration's tax experts are properly skeptical about an eye-popping new windfall Congress is trying to create for multinational American corporations that already escape taxes on billions of dollars they earn abroad.
 Legislation before the Senate Finance Committee would grant a supersweet tax amnesty to companies that agreed to bring their accumulated foreign profits back to the United States in the mere hope -- and without a firm guarantee -- that the money would be spent at home to create badly needed jobs. The proposal, part of an important global trade bill, would give the prodigals a special 5.25 percent tax rate on an estimated $400 billion in profits now sitting overseas because of a law that shelters money earned abroad if it stays abroad. This would be in contrast with the 35 percent rate theoretically paid by the domestic corporations fighting through hard times without overseas shelters. 
 The Treasury Department is rightly critical of this gilded welcome mat. It feeds the average taxpayer's perception that Capitol insiders too often and too easily circumvent the tax system's supposed fairness. And there is no certainty that the windfall would be spent as intended; indeed, Senator John Breaux's amendment to require that the money be reinvested in job-creating incentives was defeated by Republicans on the committee. He intends to offer it again in the floor debate, scoffing at proponents' insistence that the measure would provide a one-time-only tax holiday.
There is "no such thing," says Mr. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, envisioning an ongoing shelter-plus-forgiveness boon that would invite even more companies "to make their widgets overseas."
The larger bill, rated vital by most lawmakers, would replace the current tax breaks for exporters that the World Trade Organization has declared an illegal subsidy. The bill is needed to head off retaliatory tariffs. Honest taxpayers should demand that the shelter provision be amended to direct the windfall at job creation, not corporate enrichment.

HEADLINE: REVISED ADMISSION FOR HIGH SCHOOLS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
New York City education officials have quietly instituted a new mandatory high school admissions policy that allows students this year to apply to as many as a dozen schools but will admit them to only one. 
 The changes are intended to re-engineer a system that for decades has given the city's brightest students multiple offers to attend some of the most popular schools while others ended up assigned to schools they never wanted. 
 Officials said their plan would ensure that far more students are accepted to one of their top choices, and that any student who applied to 12 was virtually guaranteed a seat in one of them. Some parents said they feared that it would limit choices, especially for better students.
The new system will not affect admissions at the six prestigious high schools that accept students based on an entrance exam, or at La Guardia High School, which judges applicants by audition or a portfolio of artwork. 
But admission to more than 200 other high schools will be decided by a computer using a complex formula intended to match student preferences with the schools they are qualified to attend. Schools will retain their admissions criteria, be it grades, an audition or simply a lottery, and will prepare a ranking of the students they want. Final assignments will be decided by computer. 
Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said in an interview yesterday that the new system, modeled on the method used to assign medical school graduates to residency programs, was the most efficient way of matching students to high schools while distributing opportunities as fairly as possible. 
"I have a chronic shortage of good high schools," Mr. Klein said. "I am trying to maximize what's good for 80,000 kids in the system. That's my obligation." 
He added, "The City of New York has gone to the model that is recognized by virtually any economist as the welfare-maximizing model." 
The city's Department of Education, which often holds news conferences to announce big changes, did not publicly announce the new admissions formula, which will determine placement of about 100,000 incoming ninth and tenth graders. 
Applications will be distributed to students in mid-October and must be returned by mid-November. In January, students will get a confirmation sheet, allowing them to adjust their choices. 
Under the old system, students received their admissions results in March, and students on waiting lists were given final decisions in April or May. This year, some students will get admission offers in March, along with acceptances to the exam schools. The remaining students will get results in April, and those that are still not matched to a school will be asked to submit another application. There will no longer be any waiting lists. 
Peter Kerr, a spokesman for Mr. Klein, said yesterday that officials felt that efforts to publicize the changes within schools and at recent high school fairs in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island had adequately spread the news. 
City officials insisted that the new process would give students more choices than ever before. "They can now apply to up to 12 programs," said John Lee, executive director of student enrollment, planning and operations. "That's seven more than they were able to apply to last year." 
Some parents and guidance counselors who are just beginning to hear about the changes said they feared that the new system would restrict choice for many students, who have until now applied to high schools much in the way students apply to colleges. 
"You can choose to put 12 down, but when push comes to shove, they have placed you in just one school and you don't have a choice anymore," said Pamela Wheaton of InsideSchools.org, a Web site run by a nonprofit group, Advocates for Children.
Alvin E. Roth, a Harvard economist and one of the leading experts on such matching systems, said he agreed with the chancellor's assessment that the school system as a whole would benefit from the new admissions process, but, he said, some people were bound to be disappointed. 
"What I can't say is that it would be absolutely better for everyone," he said. "I think it's going to be better for many people. It's going to be better for the city. But I can't say that everyone will be better off because some people benefit from the private dealing, some people benefit from the inefficiencies."
The new application process is described in a high school directory that was distributed to students last month, Mr. Kerr said, and a flier answering questions about the program was sent home to parents by junior high school principals. 
"We felt that all these activities were sufficient and that it was not necessary to make a general announcement to the public because this was after all a narrow-cast announcement to eighth and some ninth graders and their parents," Mr. Kerr said.
Education officials pointed to a number of flaws in the old admissions process. In many cases, a high school would simply not consider applications from students who did not rank it as their first choice. 
Officials said that would cause some parents and children to list false preferences so as to remain in consideration by more schools. Under the new system, schools will not know how the applicants rank them. 
As a result, some schools will consider substantially more applicants, which will increase fairness but also increase the workload for those evaluating applications. Some schools already get thousands of applications for perhaps as few as 250 seats.
Another major problem with the old system, officials said, was that each year tens of thousands of 13- and 14-year-olds were subjected to painful rejections, or an agonizing process of hoping to be lifted from waiting lists.
"What I have seen too often is kids getting in nowhere and being absolutely, abjectly depressed and humiliated," said Ms. Wheaton of InsideSchools.org. "And I'm talking about kids who have 90 averages."
Professor Roth of Harvard, who attended Martin Van Buren High School in Queens, said that as a parent he would prefer the new admissions system. 
"I can now actually put down my first choice as my first choice," he said. The old system might force him to say to his child, "You are unlikely to get into your first choice and it's too risky to try," he said. 
He added that a system that asked him "to put down my true choices" and assured him of getting "the best one I can" would be "a lot better than maybe not putting down my choices and maybe never getting one."
Many parents said the problem was the shortage of good schools, and some complained yesterday that they found it difficult enough to come up with five schools where they would want to send their child and would not even try to find a dozen. 
"Being able to apply to 12 and only be accepted to one is not better from my perspective," said Roberta Segal-Sklar, whose daughter, Rachel, is an eighth grader at Middle School 54 on the Upper West Side.
After considering academic rigor, student diversity and extracurricular programs like sports and music, Ms. Segal-Sklar said her family was left with few options. "I don't have 12 choices in Manhattan," she said. "I don't have five choices in Manhattan." 
In some cases, education officials said, the old system allowed for back-room deals and special favors because principals could easily understate the number of seats available for incoming students. 
After most students had made their selection, officials said, the principals could then make the previously "hidden" seats available to children who might otherwise not have been accepted to that school.
Under the old rules, many students were assigned to their local zoned school, by default, which is an unpopular result in many neighborhoods. To avoid this, the new rules require that students actually apply to the zoned school. But in some neighborhoods, particularly in Queens and Staten Island, the local zoned schools remain popular. Officials said students in those neighborhoods would be assured a seat in their local school if they were not admitted elsewhere. 
Professor Roth said that creating the best admissions policy would require long-term research and understanding the flow of information about schools and choices. 
Many large school districts are grappling with similar problems and looking to matching models as a solution. But he said: "None of these guys have time to do careful surveys. They are always doing things at the last minute."

Re "The Iraq Reconstruction Bonanza" (editorial, Oct. 1) and "Who's Sordid Now?," by Paul Krugman (column, Sept. 30): 
 When an opportunity exists to provide employment for Americans in the worthy cause of helping a country in need (Iraq), why should that be dismissed as "profiteering" or something "sordid" because of a Republican connection to the companies involved? 
 The use of American companies, like Halliburton and Bechtel, in the rebuilding of Iraq is good for Iraqis and good for (the jobs of) Americans in general. The alleged excessive benefit to a few is in fact a benefit to many in need of jobs.

HEADLINE: Mongolia Is Having a Mine Rush 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: BORNUUR, Mongolia 

 BODY:
A single-lane dirt road winds through rolling hills, past a herd of wild horses, past flocks of sheep, and past white felt gers, the traditional homes of nomads of the steppes. Then the road crests a bluff and the view jumps forward by centuries: the blue walls of a new $75 million Canadian-owned gold mine.
 The Cameco Corporation's Boroo mine has advanced the farthest of a dozen foreign mining projects in Mongolia -- its mill is expected to start pouring gold bars by December. Victor Collinge, the Saskatchewan native who supervises the new mill, showed off its huge rock crushers and grinders, imported from Nevada and Western Australia. "I see nothing but good in Mongolia's future," he said. 
 For most of the 20th century, Mongolia, a landlocked expanse of Asian prairie and desert twice the size of Texas, was trapped and isolated -- a Communist buffer state wedged between the Soviet Union and China with little economic development and less contact with the rest of the world. Now a mining boom is beginning, fueled by a free-market economy, investor-friendly mining laws, new mineral discoveries, and the rapidly spreading realization that Mongolia can become China's Canada: a close-at-hand supplier of raw materials to the world. 
 "Last year, China surpassed the U.S. as the No.1 consumer and importer of copper, and the holy grail in our business is to be the low-cost supplier to China," said Robert M. Friedland, chairman of Ivanhoe Mines, over breakfast at Millie's, one of several American-style restaurants that have sprung up in Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital, 50 miles south of Bornuur.
Mr. Friedland, one of Canada's wealthiest businessmen, is investing $5 million a month to develop an immense copper and gold deposit in the Gobi Desert, about 50 miles north of the border with China. His name is familiar in the mining world for the discovery of one of the world's largest nickel deposits, in Labrador, and for a leaking dam that led to the cyanide pollution of a 17-mile stretch of the Alamosa River in Colorado. 
 His copper project in Mongolia, known as Oyu Tolgoi or Turquoise Hill, is tentatively scheduled to start production in 2006. Right now, 13 drilling rigs are busy probing and mapping the ore deposits, about a quarter-mile below the desert surface. Geologists estimate that there are some 21 million ounces of gold and 17 million tons of copper there.
 These estimates, audited by an outside company, AMEC, make it one of the largest copper finds in the world, ranking with major mines in Argentina, Chile and Indonesia. The release of the estimates last July caused Ivanhoe's stock to double, and eased Mr. Friedland's task of lining up financing for the $900 million cost of developing the mine. Its potential output of $1 billion a year would double Mongolia's gross national product.
 "Ivanhoe remains poised to take advantage of the single most important theme in mining today: China," HSBC analysts wrote last month in a report on the company. 
 Mongolia has gone from being the middle of nowhere to an epicenter of prospecting attention because of the rapid rise of Chinese manufacturing. To supply its factories, China stepped up imports of copper concentrate, needed for all kinds of electrical wiring, household plumbing, motors, computer parts and other uses, by 40 percent in the first half of 2003, and there is no sign of slowing.
 "There are 500 million people in southern China who want an air-conditioner," Mr. Friedland said. "Mongolia is in the catbird seat."
 In Soviet times, Mongolia was closely aligned with Moscow, and it has long been historically skittish of its immense neighbor to the south, so there were few major trade links between it and China until recently. This year, though, Mongolia agreed to allow a Chinese-gauge railroad to be built to Oyu Tolgoi. By December, China is to finish a 140-mile highway to the border near the mine.
 Hoping to put Mongolians at ease, China's new president, Hu Jintao, visited Ulan Bator in June, stressing that China has no territorial claims on Mongolia and announcing $300 million in aid for more infrastructure projects.
 Mr. Friedland also thinks Mongolia can relax.
 "We come from Canada, a big cold country that exports raw materials to a southern neighbor," he said. "We are showing the Mongolians they don't surrender their sovereignty by being a major supplier to China."
 As mining companies see the advantages of proximity to China, exploration is soaring. In the last two years, the number of prospecting licenses has tripled, to 3,000. Mining production licenses have jumped from a few dozen last year to about 650 today.
 "In the seven years since I have been here, the land under exploration licenses has gone from 8 percent to 35 percent" of the country, said Douglas J. McGay, an Australian mining consultant who researched the situation for a major mining conference in Ulan Bator in late September. Called Discover Mongolia 2003, the conference attracted 60 exhibitors and 400 participants, filling meeting rooms in the capital's most modern hotel, the Chinggis Khaan.
 In the last two years, Cameco and Ivanhoe have been joined here by the Western Mining Company of Australia, AngloGold of South Africa and a half-dozen Canadian "juniors" -- smaller companies that hunt for deposits and then sell the rights to the big operators that can afford to develop them. The Northern Miner, a trade publication based in Ontario, recently wrote, "Exploration circles are buzzing that Mongolia could possibly be the next Peru." 
 Christopher Johnstone, Canada's honorary consul in Mongolia, said of the juniors: "They come into Mongolia all the time to pick up new ground." Mr. Johnstone is a local executive for QGX, an Ontario mining company, which has the second-largest amount of land in Mongolia under exploration license, after Ivanhoe. Referring to interest in Toronto for Mongolia projects, he said: "We just raised $5 million, and very easily."
 Chinese companies are also hunting in Mongolia. A subsidiary of China Nonferrous Metal Industry said it was investing in a zinc mine at Suhbataar. And Mongolia is reaching out to other mining countries for expertise: its president, Natsag Bagabandi, signed a cooperation agreement with the Chilean government on Sept. 25 during a state visit that included a tour of a Chilean copper mine.
 While minerals account for half of Mongolia's exports and most of its foreign direct investment, oil also figures in the picture, with a 500-million-barrel discovery by Soco International this summer in eastern Mongolia. 
 Finding the goods in the ground is one thing; doing business in what can still be a backward, bureaucratic and corrupt place is another, executives and diplomats said. 
 "The investment climate is good, but the Mongolian government has to do better at ensuring openness and transparency and making sure regulations are published," said Pamela J. Slutz, the United States ambassador, in an interview. Local and central government officials, she said, "would stimulate more investment interest were they to cooperate to create a one-stop-shop licensing process, by eliminating overlapping authorities and requirements." 
 Enforcing contracts in Mongolia can also be problem. John Karlsen, a Denver native who is Mongolia's dealer for Ford heavy trucks and Caterpillar bulldozers, said in an interview that his business had doubled this year, but that the country can be a minefield for someone trying to make a living leasing and selling equipment. 
 "The court system is totally, unbelievably corrupt," Mr. Karlsen said. "The judges get bribed. There is no ability to execute judgments."
 One often-cited cause for corruption is high taxes. Mongolia's corporate tax rate is 40 percent; Russia and the Inner Mongolia region of China stop at 15 percent. 
 "Private companies are handing bribes to government officials to get out of paying taxes," said Chuluumbat Nergui, leader of an anticorruption committee in the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a private group. 
 Mongolia's government has said it wants to simplify its tax code and reduce the top rate to 28 percent by 2005. "We are setting up a working group to look at the tax environment, so foreigners feel more comfortable," Prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar said in an interview. 
 But environmental advocates fear that Mongolia is becoming too miner-friendly. A decade ago, the government set aside about one-eighth of the country as strictly protected. "But now there is a lot of talk in the legislature of de-gazetting protected areas," said T. Layton Croft, the local representative of the Asia Foundation, an advocacy group based in San Francisco.
 Seeing Mr. Friedland in Mongolia worries many environmental advocates. A man with American and Canadian passports who lives in Singapore, Mr. Friedland first came to international attention in 1992 when cyanide-laced tailings washed out of the abandoned Summitville gold mine in Colorado, killing all aquatic life in the Alamosa River for 17 miles downstream. In the late 1980's, the mine was operated by Galactic Resources of Vancouver, and Mr. Friedland was Galactic's principal shareholder.
 Mr. Friedland cut all ties with Galactic in 1990 after five years of losses at Summitville. But federal officials pursued him to pay for cleaning up the cyanide, and in 1996 they persuaded Canadian judges to freeze $152 million of his assets. To settle the case, Mr. Friedland agreed to pay $27.75 million over 10 years.
 Mr. Friedland's pockets were deep because of a big stroke of mining luck. In 1993, prospectors working for his company, Diamond Fields Resources, found an immense nickel deposit at Voisey's Bay, Labrador. Diamond Fields sold the reserves to Inco in 1996 for $2.8 billion, a transaction that has some Mongolians concerned about his plans for the copper and gold deposit at Oyu Tolgoi.
 "We want to be the builder of Turquoise Hill, not the auctioneer," Mr. Friedland said Sept. 8 in a release for the Mongolian news media. "This is not Voisey's Bay all over again."
 Mr. Friedland's company has licenses to prospect in a swath of Mongolia larger than Florida. 
 And he is used to operating in countries where others fear to tread. He has mines in South Korea, where militant unions and nationalist sentiment make the going hard for foreigners; in Myanmar, where a repressive military government is isolated by global opprobrium and sanctions; and now in Mongolia.
 Steven R. Saunders, president of the North America-Mongolia Business Council, a group based in Virginia, said: "Half of every plane from Beijing is full of mining engineers from Finland, from Canada, from Australia. It is largely because they say Friedland is no fool." 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 18, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Oct. 3 about a mining boom in Mongolia misstated the terms of a legal settlement reached in Colorado in 2000 by Robert M. Friedland, the chairman of a company that is developing a copper and gold deposit in the Gobi Desert. He agreed to a one-time payment of $20.7 million, not $27.7 million over a decade, to settle state and federal accusations that the Summitville gold mine, run by a company in which he was a large shareholder, contributed to pollution of a nearby river. (The government paid Mr. Friedland $1.25 million for costs in related litigation, and he has recovered about $17 million from others involved in the Summitville mine.)
The article also misstated the source of the contamination of the river, the Alamosa. It was water laden with heavy metals caused by past and current mining in the area and natural acidic runoff, not cyanide-laced tailings spilled from the Summitville mine.

HEADLINE: World Bank Inaugurates Oil Pipeline In Africa 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
The World Bank announced the inauguration of a new Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline on Thursday and promised to help prevent this project from leading to poverty and corruption as such projects so often have in other poor nations.
 In one of its biggest gambles, the World Bank broke precedent and put money into the high-risk $3.7 billion private oil project in an effort to prove that its development experts could reverse history and ensure that the new oil money could work for the benefit of all citizens of Chad and not just the elite. 
 The pipeline represents the World Bank's single largest investment in sub-Saharan Africa. By supporting the project, the bank said it had helped ensure that oil companies did not abandon the pipeline, which crisscrosses some of the poorest and least stable countries in the world. 
 Ali Khadar, the director for Central Africa at the World Bank, said, "We have put into place components to channel earnings from oil to poverty reduction, for health, education, the rural sector and to protect the environment."
 In an elaborate news conference connecting reporters and experts in Washington, London, Paris and Ndjamena, Chad, World Bank officials said that they would break the curse of oil that has brought misery to nearly every other oil-producing African nation. An oil consortium including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco and Petronas, the state oil company of Malaysia, built the 665-mile pipeline and oil facilities on the Atlantic Coast and will reap more than 60 percent of the estimated $13 billion revenues over 25 years, according to World Bank estimates.
 But environment advocates and human rights groups have yet to be convinced. They said the project had failed to protect labor rights and human rights and had needlessly damaged the rain forest that the pipeline traverses through Cameroon on its way to the Atlantic Ocean. Indeed, the government of Chad spent some of its signing bonus from the private oil consortium on military needs before the World Bank interceded and stopped the spending on arms.
 Jon Sohn, the international campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said: "Chad and Cameroon are failing on environmental, social and poverty alleviation grounds. Why is the World Bank using public funds to promote the oil business?"
 Chad, which has a poor human rights record and is one of the world's poorest countries, will receive an estimated $2 billion over the coming years and that is expected to double the average annual income to $550 from $250 in the next three years, according to World Bank officials. 
 "The whole issue of good governance is essential," said Rashad Kaldany, the director of oil for the International Finance Corporation, which is part of the World Bank group. "It was unprecedented that we got involved, but we wanted to see that the government created a revenue-sharing plan that was transparent with sufficient checks and balances -- if we didn't take some risks we'd never get anywhere."
 In this first venture in an oil project, the World Bank lent $92.9 million to the Chad and Cameroon governments and helped arrange another $200 million in other loans.
 In return for its help, the bank worked with the Chad government to set up committees including all parts of the Chad government as well as local labor unions, human rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations charged with deciding how the oil revenue is spent and then ensuring that the revenue reached the intended beneficiaries. If the project succeeds, the officials said it may prove a model for other oil-producing countries, especially Iraq.
 African oil has taken on strategic importance in the Bush administration as it looks for alternative sources of energy. The Chad project won approval from President Bill Clinton in 1998. 
 Susan Rice, who was then assistant secretary for African affairs at the State Department, said the administration was won over by the World Bank's plan to transform oil from becoming an instrument of corruption and exploitation into one to improve human rights and reduce poverty.
 "After a lot of examination and study, from the humanitarian and economic points of view, we were intrigued with the notion that there was a way to come up with a structure that would prove to be a new and more enlightened way to do business," said Ms. Rice, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 Digging wells and building the pipeline may prove to be the easy steps. Now the World Bank experts must ensure that the money will lead to the construction of schools and health clinics as well as the reduction of poverty.
 "We're not encouraged that this will work," said Ian Gary, Africa policy director at Catholic Relief Services and author of the group's report on the pipeline "Trying to insert a technocratic solution into a country like Chad, with its fragile, corrupt regime, isn't an obvious solution." 
 In the report, Mr. Gary and his co-author, Terry Lynn Karl, said that the World Bank had offered the political cover the oil companies needed to go ahead with their project and had immediately triggered easier access to financing.

HEADLINE: ART IN REVIEW; 
Ele D'Artagnan

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
K.S. Art
73 Leonard Street, TriBeCa
Through Oct. 9
 Like Henri Rousseau, Ele D'Artagnan (1911-1987) was a self-taught artist who lived near the center of things, an outsider on the inside. Good-looking, dapper, slightly mad (especially about women), for a while he was a regular bit actor in postwar Italy, in films and on radio and television. His life was an unraveling Felliniesque mixture of fantasy and reality that began in an orphanage and included extended bouts of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, as well as the continued reliance on the kindness of strangers who often became friends. 
 He spent his last years living on the streets of Rome. His innate instability was worsened by an obsessive quest for recognition from a birth family that refused to acknowledge him; this ended in his belief that Toscanini, whom he resembled, was his father.
These ups and downs are reflected in the photographs in the catalog to this stunning little show, the first in New York devoted to D'Artagnan's work. In one, he is holding an umbrella in the closing scene of Fellini's "Amarcord." Elsewhere he stands cozily beside de Chirico, then with Dali -- wearing a Dali mustache. Toward the end, he vamps gamely for the camera from the door of his tiny shanty, which was eventually bulldozed; finally, we see him in a bar looking disheveled and old. 
Along the way, D'Artagnan began to draw and paint and occasionally exhibited his work, while also refusing to sell it. His vagabond lifestyle destroyed untold artworks. Those surviving were salvaged mostly by Pietro Gallina, a music critic and teacher whose family boarded D'Artagnan in the 1950's.
But hope as well as desire spring eternal in D'Artagnan's joyful, frazzled, somewhat desperate art. His mixed-media drawings throw forth a teeming cosmology in fabulous colors and patterns, structured by jabbing marks and raw pencil lines. There are fecund, tropical landscapes, spangled harpies, phalluses both anchored and free-ranging, exotic birds and delightful gingerbread houses and villages. There are symbols within symbols, signs of the extended narrative that pulsed through D'Artagnan's mind. 
Visually, these works evoke artists as diverse as Warhol, Dubuffet, Chagall and Twombly. They are also part of the rich tradition of European outsider art, operating somewhere in the gap between Madge Gill and Friedrich Schoder-Sonnenstern. But their fervent, exquisite wildness is surely D'Artagnan's own, sustained through thick and, mostly, thin.

HEADLINE: Shaking The House Of Cards 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
No wonder the sky-high poll numbers for President Bush have collapsed. The fiasco in Iraq is only part of the story. The news on one substantive issue after another could hardly be worse. It's almost as if the president had a team in the White House that was feeding his credibility into a giant shredder.
 Despite the administration's relentlessly optimistic chatter about the economy, the Census Bureau reported that the number of Americans living in poverty increased by 1.7 million last year, the second straight annual increase. During those two years, the number of poor Americans has grown by 3 million. 
 Belt-tightening is also in order for the middle class. The median household income declined by 1.1 percent, a drop of about $500, to $42,400. It was the second straight year for a decline in that category as well.
Per capita income decreased, too. It dropped by 1.8 percent, to $22,794 in 2002, the first decline in more than a decade.
Boom times these ain't.
On Monday we learned that there had been a steep increase last year -- the largest in a decade -- in the number of Americans without health insurance.
The international outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas is reporting that job losses in the U.S. have resulted in a sharp decline in the number of dual-income families, particularly for those with children under 18.
And so on.
With the federal government piling up massive deficits and local governments struggling to provide the most basic of services (some areas are closing schools; others are releasing prisoners prematurely), Mr. Bush is asking the nation to go much further into debt in the service of some vague notion of a civic renaissance in Iraq.
Even Republicans are beginning to ask what the heck is going on.
Contributing to the growing sense of unease in some quarters and outrage in others is the blatant war profiteering in Iraq by politically connected firms like Bechtel and Halliburton -- profiteering that is taking place with the scandalous encouragement and connivance of the Bush administration.
A front-page article in The Times on Tuesday said: "A group of businessmen linked by their close ties to President Bush, his family and his administration have set up a consulting firm to advise companies that want to do business in Iraq, including those seeking pieces of taxpayer-financed reconstruction projects."
Iraq is proving to be a bonanza for the Bush administration's corporate cronies even as it is threatening to become a sinkhole for the aspirations of ordinary Americans.
The vicious release to news organizations of the identity of an undercover C.I.A. officer could serve as a case study of the character of this administration. The Bush II crowd is arrogant, venal, mean-spirited and contemptuous of law and custom.
The problem it faces now is not just the criminal investigation into who outed Valerie Plame, but also the fact that the public understands this story only too well. Deliberately blowing the cover of an intelligence or law enforcement official for no good reason is considered by nearly all Americans, regardless of their political affiliations, to be a despicable act.
According to an ABC-Washington Post poll, nearly 70 percent of Americans believe a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the leak.
Now that so much has gone haywire -- Iraq, the economy, America's standing in the world -- the tough questions are finally being asked about President Bush and his administration.
Perhaps foreign policy was not Mr. Bush's strength, after all. And even diehard Republicans have been forced to acknowledge that the president was surely wrong when he insisted that his mammoth tax cuts would be the engine of job creation. And nothing has ever come of Mr. Bush's promise to be the education president, or to change the tone of the discourse in Washington, or to deal humbly and respectfully with the rest of the world.
Americans are increasingly asking what went wrong. How could so much have gone sour in such a short period of time?
Was it incompetence? Bad faith?
Loud warnings were ignored for the longest time. Now, finally, the truth is becoming more and more difficult to avoid.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: CHANGE OF COMMAND; 
Orderly and Civil Transition Likely? Well, 'Chaotic' Comes to Mind

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2 

 BODY:
The last time power changed hands in the governor's office in California, in early 1999, it was an orderly and largely civil two-month affair. 
 Aides to the departing governor, Pete Wilson, a Republican, cooperated willingly in the handover to Gray Davis, a Democrat who was then lieutenant governor. As the Wilson staff left the governor's suite of offices in the Capitol, they left pennies stuck to the doors, the likenesses of Lincoln serving as gentle reminders to the incoming Democrats of whose party had held sway there for the previous 16 years. 
 This time, particularly if Arnold Schwarzenegger is elected to replace Governor Davis in the state's unusual recall election, the transition could be anything but orderly and civil. 
The new governor would not have the customary two months to prepare to take over the sprawling California state government, with its 13 major agencies, hundreds of boards and commissions and 311,000 employees. State election law provides for the new governor to take office as soon as the election results are certified. That would take at most 39 days and possibly far less time.
"It is going to be chaotic," said Steven Maviglio, Mr. Davis's press secretary. "There will be very little time. There is certainly animosity. It has the potential of really disrupting the state's business."
Mr. Maviglio said that anger at the recall election was palpable among the governor's aides and senior cabinet officials, and not just because they were in danger of losing their jobs. They believe, he said, that they are serving a governor who was duly elected to a second four-year term less than a year ago and do not deserve to be tossed out on a wave of public pique.
"I don't think anyone would take the equivalent of the W's off the keyboards," Mr. Maviglio said, referring to what aides to George W. Bush said they found when they moved into the White House in 2001. "But it's likely to be difficult, especially if the new governor is of a different party."
Still, he added, there is no planning under way for a change of power in Sacramento. "We don't think it's going to happen," Mr. Maviglio said. 
Sean Walsh, spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger and a former aide to Mr. Wilson, said that there has been no formal transition planning, although aides to Mr. Schwarzenegger have begun to think about moving from campaigning to governing.
"We have had people working on an economic recovery plan and on the budget throughout the campaign," Mr. Walsh said. 
He said that Bill Simon Jr., who dropped out of the governor's race in August, was working on fiscal matters and Richard J. Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles, was preparing a plan of action on education.
The Schwarzenegger team includes numerous veterans of the eight-year administration of Mr. Wilson, who is co-chairman of the campaign. Among them is Bob White, Mr. Wilson's gubernatorial chief of staff, who is extremely knowledgeable about the inner workings of Sacramento. Many political professional here, in fact, are referring to a possible Schwarzenegger governorship as a third term for Mr. Wilson, who was denied a chance to extend his tenure by term limits.
Despite their experience, the Wilson veterans will confront major headaches if they take over after the Oct. 7 election. Democrats hold all eight statewide elective offices, including lieutenant governor, attorney general, treasurer, controller and insurance commissioner, and control both houses of the Legislature by wide margins.
There are also more than 3,000 appointees of the governor in place, including department heads and their deputies and the governor's personal staff of nearly 200 people. It takes weeks to recruit and vet candidates for these posts.
"It's hard enough to do it in 10 weeks, let alone 10 days," said Barry Munitz, who led the Davis transition team in 1998 and is now president of the J. Paul Getty Trust in Los Angeles. "It is a very complicated process under normal circumstances. It's compounded if there's a change of party and dramatically magnified if there's an acceleration of the timetable."
Mr. Munitz described a takeover of government after a recall as a "pseudo-assassination scenario."
"Imagine if Kennedy were shot and Johnson were a Republican and he had to take over the entire government overnight," Mr. Munitz said.
He said that if Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected, he did not expect active resistance from the Davis cadres in government or the career civil servants, many of whom served under Mr. Wilson or his predecessor, George Deukmejian, also a Republican.
"But even if you assume benign indifference," Mr. Munitz said, "it's still a real challenge."
One of the first challenges any new governor would face is a budget, which must be submitted to the Legislature in January but which goes to the printer in mid-December. A new administration would have only a matter of weeks to prepare a $70 billion general-fund budget, which starts with an $8 billion shortfall from the current budget year.
One agency official involved in his department's budget preparations, who demanded anonymity , said his task would change very little if Mr. Schwarzenegger or Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante was elected governor.
"These are all known players," the official said. "People who do most of the work here are civil servants, and many were here when Wilson was governor."
Mr. Bustamante would face somewhat fewer problems than Mr. Schwarzenegger, because he is a Democrat and familiar to most Davis appointees. He is also a former speaker of the State Assembly and has working relationships with many lawmakers.
But that does not mean there would not be change. The governor and lieutenant governor run separately in California and Mr. Davis and Mr. Bustamante do not get along well.
Mr. Bustamante intends to make significant shifts in personnel and policy if he wins the governorship, said his chief adviser, Richie Ross. The overhaul might even be more sweeping than those made by Mr. Schwarzenegger and his team of Wilson veterans, Mr. Ross said.
"Oh, it'll be just as dramatic," he said. "And far more interesting."
Timothy Hodson, executive director at the Center for California Studies at California State University at Sacramento, said that the success of the transition depended on the attitude of the person taking office. 
"If Arnold understands that he was elected governor, not prince, I suspect a lot of people on the Davis side will respond, if for no other reason than self-interest," he said.
"That's not to say a few S keys won't be missing," he added.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Drop in Confidence On Bush Skill in Handling Crises 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
The public's confidence in President Bush's ability to deal wisely with an international crisis has slid sharply over the past five months, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll has found. And a clear majority are also uneasy about his ability to make the right decisions on the nation's economy.
 Over all, the poll found, Americans are for the first time more critical than not of Mr. Bush's ability to handle both foreign and domestic problems, and a majority say the president does not share their priorities. Thirteen months before the 2004 election, a solid majority of Americans say the country is seriously on the wrong track, a classic danger sign for incumbents, and only about half of Americans approve of Mr. Bush's overall job performance. That is roughly the same as when Mr. Bush took office after the razor-close 2000 election. 
 But more than 6 in 10 Americans still say the president has strong qualities of leadership, more than 5 in 10 say he has more honesty and integrity than most people in public life and 6 in 10 credit him with making the country safer from terrorist attack. 
By contrast, the Democratic presidential contenders remain largely unknown, and nearly half of Americans -- and a like number of registered voters -- say the Democrats have no clear plan of their own for the country. 
A summer of continuing attacks on American soldiers in Iraq, the failure so far to find weapons of mass destruction there and Mr. Bush's recent request for $87 billion to pay for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken a toll on public support for his administration's Iraq policy and on views of his ability to handle such issues in general.
The poll found that just 45 percent of Americans now have confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to deal wisely with an international crisis, down sharply from 66 percent in April, and half now say they are uneasy about his approach. Nearly 9 in 10 Americans say the war in Iraq is still going on, and 6 in 10 say the United States should not spend as much on the effort as Mr. Bush has sought. Three-quarters of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, say the administration has yet to clearly explain how long American troops will have to stay in Iraq, or how much it will cost to rebuild the country.
"I am very uneasy because of the war," said Joyce Austin, 69, a retired nurse's aide in Readstown, Wis., who was reinterviewed after the poll was conducted. "I don't think the Bush administration had a good plan for ending the war, and for what was going to happen afterward. I don't think they realized how much it was going to cost." Mrs. Austin paused and added, "Maybe they knew and just didn't tell us."
The nationwide telephone poll of 981 adults has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The poll, taken Sunday through Wednesday, was in progress when the Justice Department announced that it would investigate accusations that someone in the White House may have leaked the name of an undercover C.I.A. officer.
As the week progressed and news coverage of the investigation intensified, respondents were somewhat less likely to credit the Bush administration with bringing heightened honesty and integrity to the workings of the White House, compared with past administrations. In the end, just over one-third of the respondents said the administration had brought more honesty and integrity, while 18 percent said it had brought less and 43 percent said it was about the same as other administrations.
For months, Americans have been critical of Mr. Bush's handling of the national economy, and they remain so, with just one in five saying the administration's policies have made their taxes go down and a near-majority saying the policies have had no effect on them personally. Half of the respondents said the federal tax cuts enacted since 2001 had not made much difference in the economy, and the rest were about evenly divided on whether the tax cuts were bad or good. Just 40 percent of voters expressed confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to make the right decisions about the economy, down from half in April, while 56 percent said they were uneasy, up from 42 percent in April.
During Mr. Bush's tenure, a majority of Americans say, jobs have been lost and not created, there has been no easing of the high cost of prescription drugs and schools have not improved. Six in 10 Americans -- and 4 in 10 Republicans -- say the economy is worse than it was when Mr. Bush took office. Four in 10 of those polled were worried that someone in their household would lose his job in the next year.
Even worse news for the president was that Americans have also become critical of his handling of foreign policy, which had been been seen as his strength for most of his presidency. The latest survey found that 44 percent of those polled approved of Mr. Bush's overall handling of foreign policy, down from 52 percent in July, and that 47 percent approved of his handling of the situation in Iraq, down from 58 percent in July.
Polls last winter showed that public support for the president's decision to go to war in Iraq was sharply divided along partisan lines, with broad indications of reluctance. Now there are growing doubts about whether the results were worth the loss of life and other costs involved. Only 41 percent said it was, while 53 percent said it was not. When the question was asked using Saddam Hussein's name, the results were almost reversed, with about half those surveyed le saying it was worth removing him from power, and 41 percent saying it was not. 
Over all, 51 percent of the respondents approved of Mr. Bush's performance. That is down from the high 80's after the Sept. 11 attacks, and from the high 60's at the beginning of the Iraq war. Just over 4 in 10 voters now have a favorable opinion of the president, compared with more than 6 in 10 in mid-2002, and just over 3 in 10 now have an unfavorable opinion compared with 2 in 10 in July 2002.
Nearly half said they believed that removing Mr. Hussein from power was the main reason for taking military action in Iraq. About a quarter said the main reason was to protect the oil supply, and one-fifth said the goal was to stop Iraq from manufacturing weapons. But only about 4 in 10 said they now believed that Mr. Hussein was personally involved in the Sept. 11 attacks, compared with about 5 in 10 who said so in April.
More than half of Americans said relations between the United States and its European allies were worse than when Mr. Bush took office, and fewer than half said leaders of other countries around the world had respect for Mr. Bush.
Mary Preble, 46, a registered nurse and a Republican in Sugar Land, Tex., said: "I don't feel George W. Bush has a grasp on what the public is really interested in." She added: "I wasn't happy about the invasion in Iraq. We shouldn't have attacked before anything was proven. There seem to be no nuclear weapons.
"Right now he is trying to rally everyone around to the cause and give money to rebuild Iraq. But why should other countries kick in cash when he didn't wait until the U.N. said we're behind you? The other countries don't believe he has the leadership skills he should have."
The poll showed an electorate that remains narrowly divided. When all registered voters were asked whom they would vote for next year, 44 percent said Mr. Bush and 44 percent said the Democratic candidate. But regardless of how they intend to vote, half of registered voters said they expected Mr. Bush to win.
While Mr. Bush's standing has fallen, the poll showed that the Democratic presidential contenders are still largely unknown, and a majority of those who are planning to vote in their states' Democratic primaries or caucus next year have not formed opinions of the candidates. 
Opinions of Democratic primary voters are so unformed that the mere mention of a person's title changes the dynamic. When voters were asked which candidate they would choose, without mention of titles, 17 percent said Gen. Wesley K. Clark, 11 percent said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and 10 percent said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. The other candidates were all in single digits.
"I think the Democrats have a plan, but I'm not sure what it is," Laurel Halsey, 34, a personnel manager in Oakland, Calif, said. "The Democrats' plan is never as clear as the Republicans' because the Republicans focus on the very narrow goal of laissez-faire government and capitalism. The Democrats try to incorporate a broader base of social issues."

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday through Wednesday with 981 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: 4 Exchanges Settle Lawsuit Over Options 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The American Stock Exchange and three other options markets have settled a lawsuit by three traders who contended that market makers ignored orders or filled them at prices other than those advertised, according to court documents. 
 The American Stock Exchange settled the case on Sept. 3 along with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange, court documents show. Settlement terms were not disclosed. 
 The agreement came after the Securities and Exchange Commission told the Amex in June that the exchange failed to police options trading. The commission imposed sanctions on the Chicago Stock Exchange this week for failing to maintain adequate trading oversight during the Internet bubble. 
"All the exchanges are having their problems, as we all know," Richard F. Syron, an American Stock Exchange board member, said in an interview. Mr. Syron, a former Amex chairman and chief executive, is also executive chairman of the Thermo Electron Corporation. 
An Amex spokesman, Robert Rendine, declined to comment on the settlement or on the lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. 
Lynne Howard-Reed, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and a Philadelphia exchange spokeswoman, Barbara Sorid, also declined to comment.
A spokesman for the Pacific Exchange, Dale Carlson, said exchange lawyers "at a certain point just decided to rid themselves of a nuisance" by agreeing to settle. 
The traders claimed that the exchanges refused to execute transactions, changed option prices, failed to confirm trades and cancellations, and voided transactions after confirming them. 
Court papers include a list of dozens of transactions in which the exchanges are accused of having acted improperly in 2000 and 2001. Some of the individual transactions cost the traders thousands of dollars, according to the suit. 
The commission's report said the Amex surveillance methods understated trading violations, rarely referred violations to disciplinary committees and did not punish violators when cases were referred.

HEADLINE: Recessions and Incomes 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The income and poverty data for 2002 released last week by the Census Bureau were hardly surprising; the continuing monthly disappearance of jobs led to a rise in poverty and a drop in family income. 
However, contrary to some of the comments in "More Americans in Poverty in 2002, Census Study Says" (front page, Sept. 27), this is not at all the historical norm during a year when the economy is growing. 
 In fact, the first year of economic growth after a recession has historically seen a corresponding improvement in incomes. The current jobless recovery and the similarly weak recovery of the early 1990's are exceptions rather than the rule.
In these recoveries, economic growth has simply been too weak to generate jobs. The data released last week are yet another reason for us to be concerned about the effects of the jobless recovery on working families.

HEADLINE: Gold Plunges 3.6% on Report Of Rising Employment in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Gold tumbled 3.6 percent in New York yesterday as the first rise in payrolls in eight months lifted anxiety about economic growth and undermined the safe-haven case for bullion days after it hit seven-year highs.
 Volume neared a record in gold. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, December gold fell below the psychologically important $380-an-ounce level to its lowest in five and a half weeks after the Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose 57,000 in September, the first increase since January -- surprising financial markets looking for another decline. 
 The unemployment rate remained at 6.1 percent. The dollar went up, stocks soared and investors fled from perceived safe havens like gold and Treasury bonds.
"I think the story there is fund liquidation," said Bernard Hunter, a vice president at ScotiaMocatta, a bullion dealer in Toronto. "The dollar is a little stronger after this morning's figures, but that certainly wasn't the driving force in gold." 
December gold closed down $13.70, to $370 an ounce, bottoming at $367 just after midday -- its lowest price since Aug. 27 and off a session high of $387 before the jobs data release.
Estimated turnover was 165,000 contracts, which, according to the New York Mercantile Exchange, would be the most active since 187,427 lots changed hands in a violent short-covering rally on Sept. 28, 1999.
The September employment report was among the most anticipated of the year, coming after a week of mixed data cast doubt on the durability of the summer economic recovery.
"This is one of the few signs of encouragement we've seen in a long time," said Ian MacDonald, head of bullion trading at Commerzbank. "We're going to see a lot of gyrations in the market. Right now, with the dollar strengthening, gold is going to be under pressure."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Climb on Enthusiasm Over Employment Figures

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, completing their biggest weekly gain in more than four months, as the government reported the first increase in jobs since January, bolstering confidence that growth is accelerating enough to warrant higher share prices. 
 "Today's numbers are going to tilt a few more people into the bullish camp and pull more money into the market," said David Briggs, head of trading at Federated Investors Inc., which oversees $200 billion in Pittsburgh. "Everybody said employment was a lagging indicator, and we finally have some proof that things are picking up." 
 Retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores, advanced in anticipation of higher consumer spending. Monster Worldwide, the online job site, and Robert Half International Inc., the provider of specialized staff services, climbed on expectations of higher demand for workers. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 9.61 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,029.85. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.51 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9,572.31. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 44.35 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,880.57. 
For the week, the S.& P. 500 gained 3.3 percent, the Dow added 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq is up 4.9 percent. The advance was the biggest for the S.& P. 500 since the week ended May 2, while the Dow and Nasdaq had their largest gains since the week of May 30. 
Stocks surged after the Labor Department said the economy added 57,000 jobs last month. The unemployment rate held at 6.1 percent. 
Reports over the last two weeks showing rising initial jobless claims and falling consumer confidence fueled speculation that mounting job losses might restrain consumer spending and curb economic growth. Yesterday's report alleviates some of that concern. 
"This could well be an inflection point toward more steady growth in coming quarters," said Kevin Logan, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York. "If we want a sustainable expansion, you have to have gains in employment and income. It's about time." 
An industry report showing the service economy expanded at the second-fastest pace on record in September added to evidence that the economic is picking up. The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index was 63.3 last month, the six consecutive month of expansion. 
Wal-Mart advanced 42 cents, to $57.48, after climbing as high as $58.22. Best Buy rose $2.08, to $51. Lowe's increased $1.49, to $55.49. Twenty-eight of the 29 stocks in the S.& P. 500 retailing index gained. 
Monster Worldwide jumped $2.61, to $28.50, and Robert Half surged $2.14, to $21.60. Manpower, the temporary-employment company, added $2.43, to $40.23. 
Siebel Systems, the maker of customer-service software, jumped 45 cents, to $11. The company reported third-quarter profit, excluding some costs, that matched analysts' forecasts. Some investors were concerned the results would be worse, said Charles Di Bona, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. 
Microsoft rose 58 cents, to $29.08. 
3M gained $1.75, to $73.03. Robert Cornell, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc., said 3M's earnings might exceed expectations as new products drive growth. He increased his recommendation on the stock to overweight from equal weight.
Intel advanced 99 cents, to $29.61. Novellus Systems, whose equipment builds circuits in computer chips, gained $2.21, to $36.34. 
Treasury prices plunged yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 1 18/32 to a price of 100 14/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.2 percent from 4 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2 13/32, to 104 5/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.1 percent from 4.94 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Criminal Inquiry Into Russian Oil Company Is Renewed 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Criminal investigators conducted a new round of searches on Friday, focusing on Russia's richest oil company, Yukos, in a sign that the investigation that has shadowed the company since July is far from over.
 The searches -- at an orphanage the company finances and at a business club in a Moscow suburb -- were under way even as Yukos announced that it had completed its merger with a smaller rival, Sibneft, and its chairman, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, batted away questions about selling a stake in the new company to ExxonMobil. 
 After appearing with ExxonMobil's chief executive, Lee Raymond, at the World Economic Forum here, Mr. Khodorkovsky would say about the possibility of another merger only, "When there is a deal, we will make you happy by telling you." 
The swirl of events created an impression of parallel universes here: armed agents searching corporate offices and charities while crisply suited foreign executives discussed the potential for lucrative investment deals. The new searches also underscored the uncertainty that still shrouds Yukos despite its recent successes, including the completion of the Sibneft merger.
An official in the prosecutor general's office, Vasily A. Glushchenko, said in a telephone interview on Friday evening that investigators had seized a computer server at the orphanage in the town of Zvenigorod and what he characterized as "a large amount of documents" at the business club, which is in the elite suburban region of Zhukovka.
He said the searches stemmed from the investigations that was begun on July 2 with the arrest of Platon Lebedev, the chairman of the financial group Menatep and one of Yukos's major shareholders. At least eight investigations have opened into Yukos and its subsidiaries on charges including fraud, tax evasion, murder and attempted murder.
Mr. Glushchenko declined to discuss the investigation in detail, but said the computer server contained the archives of Menatep and Yukos and that the documents would "help to establish the amount of tax payments Yukos and its structures had to pay" since 1997.
The investigations, which Mr. Khodorkovsky has called politically motivated, battered Yukos's stock prices over the summer, bringing down the broader market as well. Since then, however, Yukos's stocks have rebounded sharply, buoyed by the latest reports of merger talks with ExxonMobil. The Russian stock market has also reached new highs this week.
In a statement on Friday evening, Yukos responded to the searches by pointedly suggesting that they were an attempt to intimidate the company despite the fact that prosecutors had so far failed to give details of any wrongdoing. "Given the obvious absence of any logic in the actions of law enforcement officials, one is compelled to assume that the attempt was to intimidate company shareholders and employees," the company's statement said. The statement called the investigation "shameful to our country."
In an interview with American journalists two weeks ago, President Vladimir V. Putin portrayed the investigations into Yukos as an isolated criminal matter and not a broader attack on the company or on the wild privatization schemes that helped Yukos and its affiliates amass vast assets in the 1990's. He also expressed hope that the matter would be resolved soon, a desire that seemed dashed with the new searches on Friday.
Addressing the economic conference earlier in the day on Friday, Mr. Putin said his government was determined to reduce its interference in business and open the country to greater foreign trade and investment after decades under the Soviet Union of looking inward.
"We have launched an administrative reform for this goal," he said, according to the Interfax news agency. "One of its main objectives is to orient the state apparatus toward satisfying the needs of the business sector."
The merger completed on Friday, valued at $45 billion, creates Russia's largest oil and gas company and the world's fifth largest private oil company. The new company will be called YukosSibneft Oil Company, and Mr. Khodorkovsky will remain its chairman.
For several weeks there have been reports that the new company was seeking deals not only with ExxonMobil but also with ChevronTexaco, underscoring growing foreign interest in investing in Russia. Another senior Yukos executive, however, said the company was focused first on completing its merger with Sibneft.
"If they want to make offers to us, of course we'll listen, but as far as a deal being imminent with either one of those two companies, that's not true," the executive said.

HEADLINE: Afghan Blast Stirs Debate on Canadian Military Spending 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: EDMONTON, Alberta Oct. 3 

 BODY:
The deaths of two Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan from an explosive device that blew a huge hole through their aging all-terrain vehicle has set off new debate in Canada over military spending after years of slashed budgets.
 Opposition politicians and some military experts have suggested that Sgt. Robert Alan Short, 42, and Cpl. Robbie Christopher Beerenfenger, 29, who were killed while on patrol on Kabul's outskirts on Thursday, might have survived had they been in a more modern, armored vehicle like those used by American forces. 
 They were the first Canadian military deaths in a combat zone since four Canadian soldiers were mistakenly killed in Afghanistan in April 2002 in an attack by an American warplane. Canada currently has 1,950 troops in Afghanistan, where they constitute the largest allied force protecting Kabul. 
The two soldiers were riding a 20-year-old Iltis all-terrain vehicle, which offers no protection against land mines and is far smaller, lighter and slower than all-terrain vehicles used by the American, British, German or French militaries. Three other soldiers were wounded.
Canadian military requests to replace the Iltis with a heavier and more powerful vehicle have been delayed during years of budget cuts since 1993.
"The real question is, why were our soldiers sent out into the foothills, into self-described bad-guy country, in unarmored, rusted-out dune buggies, rather than lightly armored vehicles," Jay Hill, a member of Parliament from the conservative Canadian Alliance Party who specializes in military affairs, said in the House of Commons on Friday.
Canadian newspapers werefilled with vitriolic criticisms of the Iltis from retired military officers. One unnamed soldier in Afghanistan was quoted in The Edmonton Journal as describing the all-terrain vehicle as "a bit of an albatross around our neck." Soldiers are known to sit on their flak jackets when riding in the Iltis when driving through combat zones to give them a modicum of protection.
"This jeep should have been replaced a decade ago," said David Bercuson, director of the Center for Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary. "The complacency in this government over defense is extremely thick."
Several parliamentary conservatives said they would wait until the soldiers were buried before launching a concerted attack on what they call the Liberal government's insufficient military spending. 
Canada currently spends $9 billion on its 52,000-member armed forces, about 20 percent less than it spent in 1993. At 1.1 percent of gross domestic product, Canada's defense spending is among the smallest of any NATO country. 
Shortages in equipment forced Canada to rent Russian Antonov personnel planes to move troops during the 1999 Kosovo peacekeeping mission, and to depend on American transport planes to carry Canadian troops to Afghanistan. Critics say the overstretched troops are suffering morale and family problems because of little rest between training and deployment in various international peacekeeping operations.
Former Finance Minister Paul Martin, who is expected to replace Prime Minister Jean Chretien in the next few months, has said he thinks the military needs new resources. The Bush administration has been pressing Ottawa to increase military spending considerably to bolster North American security against possible terrorist attacks.
Maj. General Andrew Leslie, commander of Canadian troops in Afghanistan, said today that not even a tank would have guaranteed the survival of the two soldiers. But he added that he would welcome the replacement of the Iltis with the Mercedes-Benz utility vehicles that Canada has contracted for manufacture with Daimler-Chrysler.

HEADLINE: Permutations Push Oreo Far Beyond Cookie Aisle 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Finding old-fashioned Oreo sandwich cookies on supermarket shelves is no easy task these days. 
 The toothsome snack's progeny, like the flashier Fudge Mint Covered Oreo, the heftier Oreo Double Stuf and the bite-sized Mini Oreo, now crowd the cookie aisle, leaving the 91-year-old original wedged into the tiniest of corners. 
 Marketing experts call it extending the heritage brand. Rather than spending millions to develop and market new brands, food marketers are stocking the shelves with new twists on old, familiar names. Snickers, for instance, flavor Edy's ice cream. Nestle candies are sprinkled on Chips Ahoy cookies. Trix cereal has migrated into Yoplait yogurt. And Reese's Pieces have become a cereal called Reese's Puffs. 
But few foods are as ubiquitous as the humble charcoal-colored Oreo, which has a basketful of spinoffs, from candy bars to ice cream to pie crusts. Such versatility has helped to more than double the sale of all things Oreo over the last decade -- close to $1 billion. Not bad for a brand that is older than the automobile assembly line.
There are, for instance, Oreo O's breakfast cereal, Oreo ice cream, Oreo Jell-O, Oreo pudding crust, cake mix, frosting, brownies, granola bars, and, just in time for Halloween, Oreos with pumpkin-colored cream fillings.
Marketing experts say Oreo is not just a cookie anymore, it's practically a flavor. But, they warn, there are dangers in tinkering with valuable brands. Chiefly, they worry about saturating the market, and there are some signs from Kraft Foods Inc. that cookie sales are slowing.
Still, they marvel at how Kraft and Nabisco have found so many new ways to use Oreos and to get people to buy them. Nabisco, the creator of Oreos, merged with Kraft in 2000 and Kraft was spun off from Philip Morris a year later. 
"The industry term for this phenomena is line extension," says Alan Brew, a marketing expert at Addison, a corporate branding consultant in San Francisco. "This widens the franchise. And it's defensive. To stop a micro-product from coming in, you attack yourself, all the time, before someone else attacks you."
Yet close comparisons are hard to come by. Coke evolved into Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, Diet Cherry Coke, and even Vanilla Coke. But that was nothing like the hyper-evolving, perpetually repackaged, category-migrating Oreo.
There is the Double Delight Oreo, the Uh-Oh Oreo (vanilla cookie with chocolate filling), Oreo Cookie Barz, Football Oreos, Oreos Cookies & Creme Pie, Oreos in Kraft Lunchables, for kids, and Oreo cookies with a variety of cream fillings (mint, chocolate, coffee) and sizes (6-pack, 12-pack, snack pack and more).
According to the latest Oreo promotions, there is even an Oreo cookie that, when liberally dunked in a glass of milk, will turn the milk blue and win some lucky Oreo dunker a $1 million prize.
"Every year we talk to consumers and Oreo lovers," says Daryl Brewster, Kraft's president of the biscuits, snacks and confections. "And what we found is tremendous amounts of desire for the next Oreo experience."
These days, food companies like to talk of eating "experiences." Ketchup isn't just ketchup, it's jazzed up with green food coloring and made into a kind of finger paint for finger food -- for children to play with and squirt on mashed potatoes.
Kraft approaches the Oreo in the same way. Eating an Oreo isn't just eating an Oreo, they say, it's the experience of dunking it in milk, twisting it apart and licking it clean.
Believing as they do in the Oreo experience, the issue for Kraft executives boils down to this: Why introduce a new cookie brand when you can just keep reinventing the Oreo?
"It's much more economical to extend a brand rather than create a new one," says Judy Hopelain, a brand strategist at Prophet, a consulting firm in San Francisco. "It's also probably a lot easier to get shelf space for a well-known brand."
The strategy seems to have worked, analysts said. 
"Between 1998 and 2001, the Oreo had annual compound growth of 13 percent," says John McMillin, a longtime food analyst at Prudential Securities. "These days, few things in the food industry even grow 3 percent."
But Kraft's most recent profit report suggests the Oreo gravy train may be slowing. The company said that cookie sales over all have weakened, but some of that weakness was offset by a strong introduction this year of the Uh-Oh Oreo.
Some Wall Street analysts are now warning of trouble ahead because cookie sales generally are forecast to continue to fall. Kraft officials declined to say whether Oreo sales were declining, or whether the drop was in other brands, like Chips Ahoy or Ritz crackers.
"The Oreo line extensions have been successful," said William Leach, a consumer analyst at Neuberger Berman, an investment firm based in New York, "but the whole line is getting soft."
There are other problems, as well. The Oreo, like most mass-produced cookies, gets some of its texture from trans fatty acids, which raise the level fat and cholesterol in the blood, may lower the level of high density lipoproteins, often called good cholesterol. Last year the National Academy of Sciences said the level of trans fats in the diet should be as low as possible.
Kraft and Nabsico have responded to the controversy in a familiar way, by introducing yet another kind of Oreo, a reduced-fat variety to join the double-filled and the fudge-covered.
Kraft executives say that for the last few years, focus groups and market research shows that consumers want more and more varieties of the Oreo, which was created in 1912 by the National Biscuit Company, later known as Nabisco.
But there is a concern that too much tinkering could tarnish the brand. The lesson of New Coke -- introduced and then withdrawn by the Coca-Cola Company after complaints from faithful customers -- has not been lost on Kraft.
That is not to say that Oreo fans will not test the limits on their own. Just ask those people who delight in making deep-fried Oreos by soaking them in pancake batter before frying them in cooking oil.
Is Kraft, which has already blanketed the world with its billion-dollar cookie, running out of ideas?
Nope.
"There are some places we won't go," Mr. Brewster, at Kraft, says. "But there are still a lot of places. As long as we continue to listen to consumers, we'll be O.K."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "Piling On The Cookies"In the Oreo's first eight decades, Nabisco tried only a handful of variations on the original. But in recent years, it has stretched the line to more than two dozen by varying the size, the filling, the biscuit recipe nearly everything but the brand name. Here are some examples now on store shelves.

 BODY:
U.S. Adds 57,000 Jobs In First Rise Since January
The job market in September showed its strongest signs of revival since the start of the year as a government report suggested that the economic recovery might finally be powerful enough to help workers.
 Employment rose by 57,000 last month, the first increase since January, and the unemployment rate held steady at 6.1 percent, the Labor Department reported. The increase in jobs, however, was still not large enough to match the growth of the population, and the percentage of adults with jobs fell to the lowest level in 10 years. Page A1. 

The service sector added 74,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain in eight months. But factories shed 29,000 positions. C3.

Stocks were bolstered by the increase in jobs. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 44.35 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,880.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 9.61 points, to 1,029.85, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.51 points, to 9,572.31. C4.

Russia Continues Inquiry Into Yukos
Criminal investigators conducted a new round of searches, focusing on Russia's richest oil company, Yukos, in a sign that the investigation that has shadowed the company since July is far from over. A3.

Questions Raised on Iraq Contracts
As Congress seeks to examine how the American occupation authority and the military are spending billions of dollars in Iraq, Iraqi officials and businessmen say that millions of dollars in contracts for rebuilding Iraq are being awarded without competitive bidding. A6.

Jury Is Chosen for Kozlowski Trial
Lawyers completed jury selection for the trial of two former Tyco International executives, L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive, and Mark H. Swartz, the former chief financial officer. They are accused of stealing $600 million from the company. C14.

Shares of Collins & Aikman Plunge
Shares of Collins & Aikman, the auto parts supplier run by David Stockman, left, plummeted on a report that its contracts with Chrysler are in jeopardy. The stock fell more than 30 percent after an article in The Detroit Free Press said that Chrysler had decided to put most of its business with Collins & Aikman, which amounts to $850 million a year, up for bid by other suppliers.

Justice Department Names Monitor
The Justice Department named a former federal prosecutor, George Stamboulidis, to monitor Merrill Lynch's compliance with changes it accepted to avoid prosecution tied to the collapse of Enron. B4.

Price of Gold Plunges 3.6%
Gold tumbled 3.6 percent as the first rise in payrolls in eight months lifted anxiety about economic growth and undermined the safe-haven case for bullion. The price of gold closed down $13.70, at $370 an ounce. C2.

US Airways Forecasts a Loss
US Airways, which emerged from bankruptcy protection this year, forecast a loss for its third quarter because revenue failed to increase as much as expected and storms forced cancellations of some flights. C4.

HEADLINE: New Policy for Admissions Is Bringing New Headaches 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Elaine Davidow was already a battle-scarred, two-time survivor of the New York City public high school admissions process when her youngest child started eighth grade last year. But that did not make applying to schools any easier.
 "It was nerve-racking," said Mrs. Davidow, who had the advantage of being a leader of the President's Council in School District 26 in Queens. 
 "There were problems when they sent out the preprinted applications," she said. "There were numerous, numerous mistakes. To look and see your child has been marked as 30 days absent is hair-raising, to say the least, when you are looking to get into one of the better schools." Her son had been absent only five or six times, she said. 
Parents describe the process of getting a child into a popular New York City high school as complicated, tension-filled and frustrating under the best of circumstances. And with city education officials instituting a new admissions policy this year, anxiety and confusion are rising, parents say. 
"The frustration of parents who have eighth graders is you can't get the same answer twice," said David Pinzon, a PTA co-president at Middle School 172 in Floral Park, Queens. "We just kept sending requests for information and we get dribs and drabs."
The new system will allow students to apply to as many as a dozen schools, but will admit them to just one, using a complex formula meant to match their preferences to the schools they qualify to attend. It is based on the method used to match medical school graduates with residency programs. 
Education officials and economists say the new system will increase fairness and efficiency as well as the likelihood that students will be accepted at one of their top choices. It is also intended to reduce the number of students -- 13,000 last year -- who are not accepted by any of their choices.
But schools will retain their admissions criteria, in many cases a dense tangle of regulations and requirements. And the new system does not address the biggest problem -- the shortage of good high schools. For the best students, who were often accepted to multiple schools under the old system, the new process may actually limit choice, parents say. 
"The previous system was so appalling that one parent called it legalized child abuse," said Clara Hemphill, the author of "New York City's Best Public High Schools" (Teachers College Press, 2003). "It caused thousands of really good students to burst into tears when they got rejection letters from every place." 
But Ms. Hemphill said the new system does not solve the problem. "It doesn't increase your chance of getting into a good school," she said.
Ms. Hemphill and other experts on the system said they feared that it would also further weaken the city's neighborhood schools. 
"If anything, the choice process has drained good students from the neighborhood schools," Ms. Hemphill said, contributing to their perceived decline. 
Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein said that he is working as fast as he can to increase the number of good high schools, but that in the meantime the new formula is a major improvement. "I can't grow these schools overnight," he said. 
City Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz said that regardless of the new admissions process, parents still face huge obstacles in learning about schools. High school fairs are often crowded and provide limited information. And it can be difficult to visit schools for a tour. 
Ms. Moskowitz said that a system that works for medical school graduates may not be right for high school students. "The people who are applying to the residency program have incredible knowledge about the rankings of these schools," she said. "There is an overabundance of information. We're dealing with the exact opposite."
Students looking for schools face a barrage of rules. Only 120 of the city's 230 high schools accept applications from students in all five boroughs. But some give preference to students who live in a particular borough or a particular school district. 
Only 43 high schools follow the traditional model of the neighborhood school, drawing students from a particular geographical zone. But under the new system, students will actually have to apply to their neighborhood school. 
A common target of some parents' complaints is a city requirement that forces schools with so-called educational option programs to accept 16 percent of students who score above grade level on the standardized English Language Artstest, 68 percent who score at grade level, and 16 percent who score below grade level. The city guarantees admission to these schools to students who score in the top 2 percent on the test and who rank the school as their first choice. As a result, students who fall in the next 14 percent have a much slimmer chance of being accepted. 
"That really hurts the students that are even in the top 5 percent," said Myra Leffel, whose daughter, Dana Stein, is an eighth grader at Middle School 51 in Park Slope.
Ms. Leffel, a graduate of Canarsie High School, said that she was now reluctantly considering private schools. "There just aren't many choices in Brooklyn for high quality high schools," she said. "I believe in public school education, my daughter has been in public school through middle school, and we're strongly thinking about applying to private high schools because what happens if she doesn't get into the schools she likes." 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 6, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 4 about revisions in the high school admissions process in New York City misstated the number of students who did not get one of their choices last year. It was 31,000, not 13,000. A letter from the city's Department of Education pointed out the error on Tuesday.

A Full Ride Can Have Its Bumps

BYLINE:  By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
After a 15-hour day of classes and football and a tiptoed goodnight kiss for his sleeping 2-year-old son, John Square organizes his bills: the $880 a month he pays for his off-campus apartment; the electric, phone and day care that quickly add up to $1,200. And that does not include groceries or laundry detergent or an increasingly rare night out for a hamburger with his wife, Shavon.
 Unlike some of his University of Miami teammates, Square, a 6-foot-5, 210-pound defensive end, is not a certain National Football League prospect. So Square, a redshirt junior, takes his studies seriously and he will graduate in May with a degree in sports administrationand a minor in business. He is grateful for his full scholarship, which Miami officials say includes tuition, room and board, fees and books, and is worth approximately $35,000 annually. 
 But the $1,000-a-month in room and board that Square receives for 10 months of the year still leaves him scrambling to pay his bills.
 "I know why you see and hear about players taking money around the country," Square said in a recent telephone interview. "Because none of us have any. Between school and football, it's impossible to have a part-time job, and it's really a hustle to make ends meet."
 Decades of college scandals have led to the demise of the Southwest Conference; have resulted in the National Basketball Association star Chris Webber pleading guilty to criminal contempt in connection with thousands of dollars he received as a student at the University of Michigan; and, most recently, have ensnared Maurice Clarett, the ineligible Ohio State running back. Now sports administrators and educators are finally addressing the central question of what constitutes a fair free ride for college athletes.
 Legislators in several states, along with an activist group of former and current college athletes, maintain that, under the current system, college athletes cannot afford the so-called "cost of attendance" -- the real cost of a college education, which includes the incidentals and expenses of everyday campus life. They say that athletes are not being fairly compensated for the millions in revenue they generate for their universities.
 "On our campus, 70 percent of the student body is working to go to school," Donna E. Shalala, the University of Miami president, said in a telephone interview. "A football player can't work because he is essentially working on his sport. Is he getting the proper financial reimbursement? We should give them enough to have as good a college experience as possible."
 Myles Brand, the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, recently endorsed the idea of giving athletes an additional $2,000 to $3,000 a year so that their scholarships would reflect the complete cost of a year in college. But that initiative could be expensive. 
 In 2002, Division I institutions allocated 48,892 full scholarships in all sports, which in many cases were split among athletes, according to the N.C.A.A. Adding $2,000 to each scholarship would mean nearly $100 million more annually.
 No one disputes that athletes invest a great deal of time into their sports.
 The N.C.A.A. limits a player's contact with coaches to 20 hours a week, but daily weight training and studying film and playbooks often extend the commitment to as much as 30 hours.
 On Tuesdays, for example, Square begins his day with a 7 a.m. meeting of the defensive line. He lifts weights from 8 to 9 a.m., then attends classes until a 2 p.m. team meeting. The Hurricanes practice from 3:20 to 5:30 p.m., leaving Square a few minutes to eat before a three-hour class that begins at 6.
 And no one disputes the vast revenues that major college sports generate. Miami, for example, received about $9 million from the Big East Conference when it won its national title in football in 2001. 
 In other recent seasons, its payoff has been about $7 million, a number the university says it hopes will increase next year, when it joins the Atlantic Coast Conference. The A.C.C. has a more lucrative television contract.
 T.K. Wetherell, the president of Florida State, says the economic impact of adding Miami and Virginia Tech to the A.C.C. goes beyond sports. 
 "Ourmembers will now have exposure to student-rich populations like South Florida, and it gives us greater access to federal funds for academics and research," said Wetherell, who played wide receiver for the university in the 1960's. 
 He supports a review of the current athletic scholarship system. "When a fraternity guy can make more money by busing tables for the brothers, then there is something wrong," Wetherell said by telephone.
 Legislators in several states agree. Nebraska has adopted a law that would allow the payment of a cash stipend to college athletes. The law will go into effect only when three other states with Big 12 universities adopt similar measures.
The California State Senate approved a bill in May that calls for the extraordinary step of expelling the N.C.A.A. from the state unless universities contribute more than they do now to the welfare of college athletes. 
 Beyond the financial strain that fatter scholarships would put on universities, many educators worry about the impact on the culture of college athletics. 
 "To pay more money is the wrong direction to go," said Scott Cowen, the president of Tulane, who recently was named to the board of the N.C.A.A. "It not only increases costs, but it increases the perception that these athletes are playing for money. 
 "What we should be doing is improving the infrastructure so our athletes are leaving campus with a degree, and if that means reducing the amount of time they spend on athletics, then we should do that."
 Even if the N.C.A.A. were to increase the value of a scholarship, it would be too late to help Square. His wife, Shavon, also attends Miami; she has a partial academic scholarship and a stack of student loans. With the help of their parents and a frugal lifestyle, they and John Jr. are getting by.
 But Square says he will not be surprised to hear about more players from around the nation taking extra money or being involved in gambling scandals. 
 He knows about the challenges, and the temptations, that are out there between Saturdays.
 "You got to be tough and determined off the football field, because something or someone is always trying to stand in your way," he said. "For sure we need more help than we're getting."

HEADLINE: Chancellor Schroder Strives To Increase His Word Power 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said Friday that Germany had been right to oppose the American-led war in Iraq, driving home his defiant message by repeatedly using the German word for power, which leaders here have long eschewed because of its associations with the Nazi era.
 In a speech marking the 13th anniversary of German reunification, Mr. Schroder described the country as a "civil power" and an "economic power," responsible for fueling the growth of the European Union. 
 The word macht, or power, has been laden with meaning since Hitler used it to describe a Germany bent on dominating its neighbors. But Mr. Schroder talked about Germany's "civil power," which he said manifested itself in a peaceful foreign policy that could be spread throughout the world.
"German peace polices are policies for Europe and beyond," he said in a nationally televised speech in Magdeburg. "I think we can be proud of the way Germany has accepted growing international responsibilities in recent years."
The chancellor's remarks came a week after he and President Bush exchanged a hearty handshake at the United Nations in a bid to mend ties that had been strained over the war in Iraq.
Today, though, Mr. Schroder won thunderous applause by reaffirming Germany's decision to sit out the war, a stance seen by many here as a bold assertion of German independence in foreign affairs.
"When we were convinced that the assumed threat did not justify the dangers and consequences of war, we had the courage to say no," he told a crowd of 1,400.
Mr. Schroder's speech, delivered in his country's east, was clearly aimed at a domestic audience. His antiwar stance has been particularly popular among eastern Germans, helping to lift him to a razor-thin victory against a conservative challenger last fall.
Abroad, the German government has taken a more modulated approach, offering to train Iraqi police officers but refusing to send troops to Iraq. Germany has joined France and Russia in calling for a quick transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi people.
Much of Mr. Schroder's message was calculated to win support for his campaign to reform Germany's calcified economy. The unemployment rate in eastern Germany is close to 20 percent, after a decade of subsidies from the west that have failed to bring prosperity.
Whatever Germany's current weaknesses, Mr. Schroder left little doubt that he viewed the country -- with Europe's largest economy and the world's third largest -- as the linchpin of the Continent's economic future.
"As the greatest economic power in the European Union," he said, "we carry a special responsibility for growth and progress in Europe. Europe rightfully expects us to utilize our economic, social and cultural potential."

HEADLINE: Are More People Cheating?; 
Despite Ample Accounts Of Dishonesty, a Moral Decline Is Hard to Calculate

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chairman of Tyco International, is on trial, accused of looting his company and investors of $600 million. Schoolchildren are pirating music and films online. Renowned historians like Doris Kearns Goodwin and Stephen Ambrose have plagiarized colleagues' work. 
 "You have almost an acceptance that humankind cannot resist the pressure to cheat, whether it's Sammy Sosa in a slump or Kobe Bryant cheating on his wife," said Michael Josephson, president of the Josephson Institute of Ethics, a nonprofit organization in Los Angeles that works with schools and businesses to advocate ethical behavior. 
 Mr. Josephson is among many Americans who have heard about Mr. Kozlowski's trial and the corked bat used by the Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa and may believe that America is in the midst of a new cheating epidemic. It is nearly impossible to turn on television or pick up a newspaper or magazine without hearing someone lament the current decline in morals. But is there any hard evidence that more people are more dishonest now than in the past? 
For the most part, no. A number of historians and ethicists say there is simply not enough data on cheating to draw conclusions; nor is there any way to make empirical comparisons about cheating over time. Rules, laws and mores constantly change in areas like finance, professional sports and politics.
The Securities and Exchange Commission regulations intended to keep accounting honest, for instance, were not created until the 1930's. Random drug tests are relatively new to sports competition. As for sexual mores, surveys are notoriously unreliable and reflect changing moral standards.
Even David Callahan, a political scientist with a forthcoming book titled "The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead" (Harcourt, 2004), concedes that "by its nature cheating is intended to go undetected, and trends in unethical behavior can be hard to document."
If there is one place where the moral flagmen have a case, it is student cheating, because studies have documented its rise in recent years. And there is broad agreement that the Internet has certainly made it much easier to plunder other people's work. Yet even in this area educators, ethicists and lawmakers warn that the Internet has created a murky territory of outdated laws and shifting standards. 
"Law, technology and ethics are not in sync right now," said Senator Norm Coleman, a Minnesota Republican who on Tuesday held a hearing on illegal file sharing and privacy. 
Ann Fabian, an associate professor of American studies and history at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., agrees. "The Web has changed notions of intellectual property, and we don't have the norms to deal with it," she said. "The language of cheating -- which we think of a stable, moral point -- has to evolve, too." 
As for most other areas, previous ethical lapses can certainly compete with today's. Sports? Even the very first game of baseball's first modern World Series, in 1903, was tainted with rumors that the Boston Americans threw the game. Politics? Between Tammany Hall's electoral fraud and Watergate's dirty tricks, some historians have argued that politics is cleaner now than ever. Business? How do you think the robber barons got their name?
More recently the 1980's featured spectacular financial scandals starring Ivan F. Boesky and Michael R. Milken, and enough cases of scientific fraud and plagiarism that Congress felt compelled to hold hearings on that problem, too.
To some historians the current outcry about increased cheating is not surprising. What is known as the declension view of history -- dating back at least to the Puritans -- always has one generation bemoaning the morals of its successor, said Louis P. Masur, a cultural historian and a chairman of the history department at the City College of New York. 
"It's a meditation, a debate, a discussion that goes way back," he said. "Now what's changed is the amount of coverage. It's not that kids didn't cheat at Yale 30 years ago, but now it's easier to do so. The media coverage follows and inundates us and changes our sense of it, the pervasiveness of it." 
Zachary Karabell, a historian who writes about American culture, agrees. "We go through these cycles where we've found the formulas for social cohesion and then cycles where we've gone to hell in a handbasket," he said. "We're in a hell-in-a-handbasket phase." People have had to deal with the sudden economic insecurity that followed the 1990's bubble, he said, and "cheating touches a chord that we've lost something."
Like Mr. Karabell, some experts argue that the alarm about more cheating is tied to wider anxiety about social changes, like those that came after 9/11 or the new global economy. Transitional periods -- a war, a recession, an economic boom -- have historically caused people to pay more attention to their souls.
From the moment Massachusetts Bay preachers in the 1680's warned against vice and moral turpitude, Americans have fretted about a growing lack of morality and virtue. The rise of the market economy and big cities in the 1820's through the 1840's added to that perception. A pervasive fear of confidence men gripped city dwellers, said Jackson Lears, a professor of history at Rutgers. 
The Gilded Age, those decades immediately following the Civil War, were marked by prosperity and growth but also by wretched excess and scandal of all kinds. In the Credit Mobilier Scandal of 1872-73, for instance, the Union Pacific Railroad sold or gave shares in its construction to influential congressmen, who approved federal subsidies for railroad construction. 
Some of the New Deal legislation was spurred by bank and brokerage fraud in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the Securities and Exchange Commission finally established in 1934. 
"The distrust of Wall Street has been there from the beginning, as the distrust of unearned wealth," Mr. Lears said. That distrust has long been a constant anxiety in Americans' moral and commercial lives, he said, adding, "This anxiety built through the 19th century as we went though periods of boom and bust, and there was little government regulation." 
Those who argue that cheating is more pervasive now are familiar with this history, but they counter that now there are more practitioners and less guilt.
Donald L. McCabe, a professor of management at Rutgers in Newark, has become known as a "cheating guru" for his widely reported surveys in the last 10 years of how and why high school and college students cheat. He has also looked at data going back to the 1960's. 
Not only is cheating significantly up since then, Mr. McCabe has found, but many students do not consider it a big deal, saying it was just a modern fact of life. His study this year of 16,000 undergraduates at 23 colleges and universities found that 38 percent had taken material from the Internet and passed it off as their own. Forty-four percent of all the students surveyed said it was no big deal. In a 2000 survey only 10 percent of students admitted to Internet cheating.
Some ethicists argue that student cheating -- whether using the Internet to plagiarize or finding a rogue way to ace a classroom exam -- is the "canary in the mine," about the extent of wider cheating now and in the future. 
"There is no question that students point to things in the larger society as rationale and justification for their cheating, whether its Michael Milken, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Bill Clinton or Enron or their parents cheating on taxes," Mr. McCabe said. 
Mr. Josephson said his institute surveyed 12,000 high school students in 2002 and found that 74 percent admitted cheating on an exam at least once in the past year, compared with 61 percent in a 1992 survey. In 2000, 34 percent of high school students agreed with the statement that "A person has to lie or cheat sometimes in order to succeed," compared with 43 percent who agreed in a 2002 survey. 
To Mr. Callahan, whose book is one of the first scholarly attempts to evaluate the current bout of cheating, new economic pressures for those at the bottom and more goodies for those at the top is partly responsible. He writes, for example, about Sears auto-repair workers who cut corners because their jobs were at stake. He based his argument on interviews, surveys and studies in fields like accounting and law.
Rushworth M. Kidder, president of the Institute For Global Ethics, a nonprofit think tank in Camden, Me., points to Americans' increasing disillusionment with public institutions as one reason for more cheating. "You've got a pervasive decline in trust," he said. Since established institutions can no longer be relied on to behave honestly or set standards, everything -- including ethics -- becomes "individual and negotiable," he said.
As for Mr. Josephson, he acknowledges that the question of whether there is more cheating cannot be definitively answered. But he is grim nonetheless. "Whether there's more cheating or not, it's bad enough," he said.

HEADLINE: About New York; 
Giuliani Razed Roller Coaster, And the Law

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
ONE morning in the fall of 2000, Horace Bullard answered the telephone at his home in the Bronx. It was an employee of his, Andy out in Coney Island, imparting information that few of us could ever imagine uttering or receiving.
 Hey, Boss, the caller said. The city is tearing down your roller coaster. 
 This was not some kind of figurative code. The city was tearing down Mr. Bullard's roller coaster: the historic, rusted and long-silent Thunderbolt, prominently featured in "Annie Hall" and in the memories of many. 
"It's impossible," Mr. Bullard, a developer, recalled thinking. "How could they do it?" With a heavy hand, it turns out. And without any legal right.
A couple of weeks ago, a federal jury in Manhattan ruled that the city had no justification for tearing down the Thunderbolt, and in doing so had trespassed on Mr. Bullard's property. It also determined that one city official, who was integral in the decision to demolish, had acted with "deliberate indifference."
To understand what happened to the Thunderbolt, one must recall another time: the time of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose vision for the city included a call for civility, a restoration of pride -- and the construction of two minor-league stadiums at taxpayer expense, including one directly beside a 1920's structure called the Thunderbolt. The Thunderbolt last rumbled in the early 1980's. Mr. Bullard bought the dormant amusement in 1985, and for the next 15 years tried to get simultaneous city approval and bank financing to develop the property. Maybe the development would include the roller coaster; maybe it would not.
Over the years the roller coaster became a discolored Calder-like remnant of the past, looping over a plot of weeds and wildflowers. Depending on whom you asked, it was an eyesore or a thing of beauty, and for the first several years of the Giuliani administration, its grand decay caused no particular concern. The Thunderbolt was just part of the Coney Island panorama.
But in 2000, when plans for a Brooklyn ballpark were being finalized, Jeff Wilpon -- a top New York Mets executive and the man whose minor-league team would play in the new park -- mentioned to Mr. Giuliani that the Thunderbolt was an eyesore that looked dangerous. 
Say no more. Whether by coincidence or design, the Thunderbolt was now squarely in City Hall's sights. Many of the whens and wheres have been lost in the blur of time, but at some point a deputy mayor called the city's Economic Development Corporation, which was overseeing the ballpark project, to express concern about the Thunderbolt's condition. That call rippled through several city agencies, whose minions were all too familiar with the unpleasantness that could arise when City Hall's desires -- whether directly expressed or just merely hinted -- were not heeded.
THE message was passed on to the Department of Buildings, which dispatched a couple of inspectors to Coney Island. They examined the coaster from a distance of 50 feet because a security fence prevented them from getting closer. They took photographs that were soon misplaced, never to be found.
Based on this cursory examination, Tarek Zeid, the Building Department's Brooklyn commissioner at the time, issued an emergency declaration to demolish without the benefit of a personal visit or any engineer's report on the structure's integrity. 
The order languished for a couple of months -- perhaps, as Mr. Bullard's lawyer, Barry Gedan, suggested, "because no one really wanted to demolish the Thunderbolt." Then someone from the Economic Development Corporation goosed the process by asking why the coaster hadn't been razed yet, and the demolition date of Nov.17, 2000, was set.
Before the demolition, some police officers took their friend Andy to a diner so that he wouldn't do something rash, like throw himself in front of the bulldozers. City officials watched as the rusted girders began to come down, along with an old building that was not included in the demolition order.
The Thunderbolt case is not over. Motions and countermotions continue to be filed, and a new trial to determine monetary damages is in the offing. Whether the roller coaster deserved to be torn down may be an open question, but how it was torn down continues to rattle Mr. Bullard, who remembers arriving on the scene -- too late.
"It was just craziness," he said later. "They were tearing down the coaster, and they were telling me: 'The city owns this property. You can't come in.' "

PERSON: John T. Dunlop 

HEADLINE: John Dunlop, 89, Dies; Labor Expert Served 11 Presidents 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
John T. Dunlop, a Harvard economics professor who was considered a foremost labor relations expert and served every president from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, died on Thursday at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 89.
 President Harry S. Truman turned to Professor Dunlop to help prevent steel prices from soaring. President Dwight D. Eisenhower called on him to end rail strikes, and President John F. Kennedy asked him to prevent labor disputes at missile construction sites. President Richard M. Nixon also looked to him to help figure out wage and price guidelines. 
 In 1958, Professor Dunlop wrote "Industrial Relations Systems," a basic text for industrial and labor relations classes in the United States, Europe and Japan. Far better than previous books, it explained the distinctive nature of industrial relations in various industries, examining the interplay of technology, market forces and organized labor. 
"He's one of those people who moved back and forth between the world of ideas and the world of doers," said George P. Shultz, a former secretary of state and treasury secretary who met Professor Dunlop when they were young labor economists in the 1940's. 
Professor Dunlop, a tough-minded, often gruff, man was famous for knowing how to push disputing sides to reach a solution. He was President Gerald R. Ford's first labor secretary. He resigned when Mr. Ford did not sign a bill that would have made it easier for unions to picket construction sites, a signature that Professor Dunlop had promised to organized labor. In exchange, the construction unions had promised to moderate their wage demands. 
President Jimmy Carter's labor secretary, Ray Marshall, said, "I don't know of many people who resigned cabinet positions over a matter of principle, and John did it."
Mr. Clinton named him chairman of a commission that came to be known as the Dunlop commission, with the task of recommending ways to improve relations between corporate America and organized labor.
Professor Dunlop, who began teaching labor economics at Harvard in 1938, was part of an elite group including Mr. Shultz, Arnold Weber, Clark Kerr and Derek Bok who became experts in labor relations in the 40's and 50's, when unions were a fast-growing and prominent part of the industrial landscape.
He was known for a sharp tongue, willingness to argue a point and frequent airplane trips, often flying between Boston and Washington 50 times a year. His consulting, mediating and arbitrating made him a millionaire. But he also drove a secondhand compact Ford and lived in a modest house in Belmont, Mass. 
"John was almost totally not interested in creature comforts or the trappings of prestige," said Mr. Bok, a former Harvard president who wrote a book with him in 1970, "Labor and the American Community." 
John Thomas Dunlop was born on July 5, 1914, in Placerville, Calif., the oldest of seven children. His parents, John Wallace and the former Antonia Forni, were Presbyterian missionaries who reared him in Cebu in the Philippines. 
After finishing high school there, he entered Marin Community College in California because prestigious four-year universities were reluctant to take a student from such a little-known high school. He transferred to the University of California at Berkeley, where he received a degree with highest honors in 1935. He received his doctorate in economics from there four years later.
In 1937, he married Dorothy Emily Webb, who died last February. They had three children, John Barrett of Palo Alto, Calif.; Beverly Claire Donohue of New York; and Thomas Frederick of Belmont, who survive him, along with six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. 
In 1938, he began teaching economics at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1950. From 1943 to 1945, he was research director for the National War Labor Board, which worked to maintain labor peace, moderate wages and increase productivity for the war.
After the war, Mr. Truman named Professor Dunlop to the Atomic Energy Labor Panel, and from 1948 to 1957 he was chairman of the National Joint Board for Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes in the Building and Construction Industry. From 1950 to 1952, he was a public member of the Wage Stabilization Board, and from 1960 to 1962 he was on the presidential railroad commission. 
From 1940 to 1970, Professor Dunlop was working on respected books on industrial and labor relations, as a writer, a co-writer or an editor of nine books. 
"Until he wrote 'Industrial Relations Systems,' most studies of collective bargaining and labor relations were just a long list of facts in search of some underlying way of understanding it," Thomas Kochan, a professor of management at M.I.T., said. "He brought a structure to it."
From 1970 to 1973, Professor Dunlop was dean of arts and sciences at Harvard. In 1973, Mr. Nixon named him director of the Cost of Living Council, succeeding Donald H. Rumsfeld. It was a decade when inflation sometimes exceeded 10 percent, and anxious presidents named various commissions that either froze wages and prices or issued guidelines to follow.
Decade after decade, Mr. Dunlop juggled responsibilities in government, academia and private business as a mediator and arbitrator.
In 1979, Mr. Carter named him chairman of the Pay Advisory Committee. Labor experts said women's groups and black groups blocked him from becoming Mr. Carter's labor secretary because he did not support affirmative action strongly enough.
From 1981 to 1984, Professor Dunlop was on President Ronald Reagan's National Productivity Advisory Committee. He took emeritus status at Harvard in 1985 and continued to teach there occasionally. From 1989 to 1991, he was also on President George H. W. Bush's Social Security advisory council. 
Last year, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, John J. Sweeney, asked Professor Dunlop to be a mediator to help persuade the International Brotherhood of Carpenters, to rejoin the labor federation after it had pulled out of the organization. Those negotiations are continuing.
"John was someone who was trusted by labor and management," Mr. Sweeney said.
Professor Dunlop often reminded friends and interviewers that his father was a missionary who had him read and re-read Calvin's collected works. For enjoyment, he said, he took long walks while carrying a notepad so he could jot down his thoughts.
Professor Dunlop could be acerbic and impatient, friends said, especially when a crisis was impending, because two feuding sides appeared to be dug in.
"Unless you can work out a consensus on a problem," Mr. Dunlop told Fortune Magazine in 1973, "it's not a very good solution."

HEADLINE: Handcuffed to the Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Aides to President Bush say he is willing to make big bets on policies he believes in. When it comes to the economy, Mr. Bush has been like a gambler, pushing through one tax cut after another despite early signs that his policies were not stopping big losses of jobs. 
 On Friday, Mr. Bush was finally able to point to evidence that his approach had results. The news that the economy had added 57,000 jobs in September and that during the summer it had not lost as many as previously estimated was the first sign since January that the so-far-jobless recovery was giving way to a slowly improving employment situation. 
 Still, in the time since Mr. Bush took office and the three tax cuts were passed, the economy has lost 2.8 million jobs. That fact remains an uncomfortable obstacle to his claims of progress in recovering from the recession, which started two months after he moved into the White House but ended nearly two years ago.
"Things are getting better, but there's still work to do," Mr. Bush said on Friday in a speech here, his first stop on a visit to Wisconsin that included a fund-raiser that drew $800,000 for his re-election campaign.
In tying tax cuts to prosperity, Mr. Bush has to overcome voter skepticism. Half of the respondents to a New York Times/CBS News poll this week said the federal tax cuts enacted since 2001 had not made much difference in the economy. (The rest of the respondents were about evenly divided on whether the cuts were bad or good.) But Mr. Bush showed no sign on Friday of losing faith in his economic philosophy. The most important next step to help the economy, Mr. Bush said here, is to make permanent those elements of the previous tax cuts that are scheduled to expire over the next eight years.
The political benefits of the new job figures may prove limited for Mr. Bush. One month of job gains hardly insulates him from attacks by Democrats on the presidential campaign trail and on Capitol Hill.
As Congressional Democrats pointed out, the economy would have to add more than 160,000 jobs a month each month through the end of Mr. Bush's term, in January 2005, for him to avoid being the first president since World War II to preside over a net decline in employment.
Employment is only one of the economic issues that Democrats are using to try to put the administration on the defensive. The rising budget deficit and the growing costs of rebuilding Iraq are giving them a new opportunity to portray the tax cuts as unfair, unaffordable as well as ineffective in creating jobs.
The tax cuts, Democrats said, are also eating up money needed in the short run to deal with health, education and other issues while saddling the nation with an increasing debt that will cripple its ability to pay the long-term costs associated with an aging population.
"The Bush administration tax cuts have not provided the short-term stimulus the economy needed," said Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who is seeking the Democratic nomination. "Instead, the Bush tax cuts have rewarded the president's wealthy contributors at the expense of the economy, and furthered an extreme, ideological agenda that aims to destroy Social Security, Medicare and public education."
At the same time, the steep and continued decline in manufacturing jobs has created a particular challenge for Mr. Bush. Those losses have been pronounced in the Midwestern industrial states expected to be battlegrounds in the 2004 race. Among them is Wisconsin, which Mr. Bush lost by just 5,708 votes in 2000. To appeal to workers watching industrial jobs go abroad, most of the Democratic candidates are using the problems in manufacturing to argue for changes in trade policy, suggesting that Mr. Bush has exposed workers to unfair competition.
Democrats are trying to bring all the themes of their economic arguments together in one message. While the candidates differ on some of the specifics, they generally agree that the tax cuts have not lived up to administration promises that they would create millions of jobs and that the revenue they represent would be better used to pay for the war in Iraq and the broader fight against terrorism.
In particular, Democrats said, Mr. Bush's request for $87 billion to continue military and reconstruction operations in Iraq and Afghanistan has made clear the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of waging an expensive fight against terrorism, cutting taxes and addressing pressing domestic issues simultaneously.
"Iraq is the catalyst for a reconsideration of the fiscal course the nation is on," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a research group for centrist Democrats. He added that Democrats had an opportunity to make a compelling case that the government could not afford big tax cuts if it also wanted to assure national security.
Without naming any of his Democratic opponents, Mr. Bush struck back on Friday at their call to roll back some or all of his tax cuts. Raising the top income tax rate in particular, he said, would hurt job creation because it would take money from small-business owners, many of whom file individual tax returns subject to the highest rate.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: DIPLOMACY; 
Opposition Is Deepening to a New U.N. Resolution on Iraq

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER and JOHN TAGLIABUE; Felicity Barringer reported for this article from the United Nations and John Tagliabue from Paris.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 3 

 BODY:
Bush administration officials reacted with dismay on Friday to Secretary General Kofi Annan's reluctance to play a supporting role in the Iraqi political transition. His position emboldened critics of the United States' approach and jeopardized the draft of a Security Council resolution on Iraq's future. 
 Mr. Annan spoke once Friday with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and twice with John D. Negroponte, the United States envoy here. 
 Mr. Powell later told reporters that he had tried to assure Mr. Annan that Washington's approach would lead to a quick transfer of authority back to Iraqis. "We are anxious to remove the burden from ourselves," Mr. Powell said. 
One State Department official, speaking on condition that he not be named, said: "We're concerned about the impact of the secretary general's view on this resolution as it's under negotiation. It's causing some problems for us."
Indeed, Mr. Annan's hesitation to take part, born of two bombings and 22 deaths at the United Nations' offices in Baghdad, had an electric effect on the negotiations over the resolution, charging up delegates who were already dissatisfied and generating new doubts among those wavering. 
United Nations officials said Mr. Annan was not aiming to be obstructionist or to lead a charge against the United States, but to weigh carefully the safety and viability of any new United Nations mission.
Others echoed those concerns. France and Russia reiterated that the latest draft resolution was unacceptable. 
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said, "We are not satisfied with the draft by our American partners, though we see a desire on their side to compromise."
Mr. Putin's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said any resolution had to include the quick transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi people, a leading role for the United Nations, a mandate for an international security force and a transparent oversight of the economy of Iraq.
The draft resolution, which is co-sponsored by Britain and Spain, would keep political and military control over Iraq with the occupying authority until a constitution was written and approved, and an election held. It makes no mention of any international oversight for Iraqi finances.
As a senior United Nations official put it today, Mr. Annan wants to see the transition process "inverted," with authority transferred in a few months to some sort of provisional government that would spend the necessary time, perhaps two years, writing a constitution, carrying out a census and holding elections.
That said, the official added, "this is not a bargaining process." 
"It is not axiomatic that the United Nations has to play a political role in every crisis there is," the official said. "It's perfectly O.K. if the United Nations doesn't play a political role in Iraq." 
The State Department official said that talks still had a long way to run, and that Washington could be somewhat flexible but needed to see specific proposals from other capitals.
Another State Department official said, "No one is saying we won't get nine votes," enough for passage of the resolution in the Security Council (provided there is no veto). Some United Nations envoys said, however, that passage was not assured. 
Speaking of the current text of the resolution, the Spanish ambassador, Inocencio Arias, said: "It won't pass like that. And if it passes, what's the use of having nine votes and six abstentions? It won't be dead, but it will be wounded."
In Paris, Herve Ladsous, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the French government would "continue to study the American proposal with care." 
But he added, "This revised draft does not incorporate the changes in approach that we were advocating," referring to France's call for an early transfer of power and an enhanced United Nations role.
As one United Nations official put it, "Either the Coalition Provisional Authority is in charge, in which case it should do the political work, or you have" an Iraqi provisional government asking for United Nations help.

HEADLINE: EMPLOYMENT RISES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN MONTHS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The job market in September showed its strongest signs of revival since the start of the year, as a government report suggested that the economic recovery might finally be powerful enough to help workers.
 Employment rose by 57,000 last month, the first increase since January, and the unemployment rate held steady at 6.1 percent, the Labor Department reported yesterday. But the increase in jobs was still not large enough to match the growth of the population, and the percentage of adults with jobs fell to the lowest level in 10 years. 
 "The labor market showed a little bit of life," said Drew T. Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers. "However, one month does not erase all of the pain we have seen." 
The jobs increase gave the White House a welcome piece of good news, after a difficult few weeks filled with questions about its handling of the economy and the war in Iraq. Democrats candidates pointed anew to the large job losses over the last two and a half years.
President Bush, speaking in Milwaukee to owners of small businesses, said: "Things are getting better, but there's still work to do." Page A11. 
The economy has been growing since late 2001 but slowly enough that companies have been able to increase production without adding employees.
Last month, the employment gains, though small, swept across much of the economy. Retailers added more jobs than they had since March 2002, and temporary-help agencies -- one of the first sectors to cut workers when the economy weakened in 2000 -- added to their payrolls for the fifth consecutive month. Manufacturers cut another 29,000 jobs, but the loss was the smallest since the summer of 2002.
Adding to the sense of momentum, the Labor Department also announced that the economy had lost only 98,000 jobs in July and August, 44,000 fewer than initially estimated. But job losses last year and early this year were larger than first reported, it said yesterday.
Stocks rose after the report's release and held most of their gains. The Standard & Poor 500-stock index closed just below 1,030, up 10 points, or almost 1 percent. Bond prices fell, meanwhile, in another indication of investors' growing optimism about the economy. 
"This changes the mood of the market," said Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. 
For all of the hints of a turnaround, however, the report also showed how the length and depth of the jobs slump continued to weigh on workers. With the economy having shed 2.8 million jobs since the start of 2001, employees have continued to lose bargaining power and unemployed people are struggling to find new work. 
Average weekly earnings for rank-and-file workers -- who make up about four-fifths of the work force -- fell last month for the first time since April, by 33 cents, to $520.67. The number of people who have been out of work for at least 27 weeks and continue to look for a job jumped to 2.1 million, from 1.9 million in August. Almost five million people were working part time because they could not find full-time work, up from 4.4 million.
Demonstrating the job market's continuing troubles, the Ford Motor Company said on Tuesday that it would lay off 1,700 workers and eliminate 1,300 vacant positions. On Wednesday, Verizon Communications offered voluntary buyouts to all 74,000 of its managers in hopes of trimming its payroll, too.
The weak economy has also helped cause a rise in both the number of people without health insurance and the number living in poverty, according to the Census Bureau.
Polls have shown that Americans are growing increasingly concerned about the economy and about Mr. Bush's policies, even if their pessimism has not reached the levels it did in the aftermath of other recent recessions. Fifty-six percent of people disapprove of the president's handling of the economy, up from 33 percent at the start of last year, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted this week.
"The conditions of the labor market are still not as strong as we'd like them to be, but this news is very positive," said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, referring to the jobs gain. "The signs here are good."
Democrats responded that the current jobs slump was the longest since the 1930's and that Mr. Bush had done little to help the economy beside cutting taxes for the wealthy.
"I don't blame the president for all of what's happened," Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and a presidential candidate, said in a telephone interview. "There are certain cyclical components. The problem is that the president hasn't done the things the president can do." Mr. Kerry added that the budget deficit had risen more than necessary during the economic slump and that the administration should have a tougher trade policy to prevent jobs from moving overseas. 
Economists do credit the recent tax cut, along with the boom in mortgage refinancings, with lifting consumer spending and persuading some businesses to begin hiring again. Car dealers, department stores, airlines and broadcasters all added workers last month, after having cut positions over the summer, according to the Labor Department's numbers, which are adjusted to account for season variations.
Across the vast service sector, the net hiring of 74,000 workers last month morethan offset declines in the payrolls of government agencies, many of which are cutting their budgets, and manufacturers.
Companies have also begun making moderate increases in their investments in new factories, equipment and technology, after more than two years of sharp cuts. In September, for example, makers of computers and other electronic equipment eliminated 3,800 jobs, their 32nd consecutive monthly cut. The reduction was the smallest since the streak began, however.
Most forecasters expect the economic recovery to continue gaining strength and the unemployment rate to fall next year. At 6.1 percent last month, the jobless rate was below the high of 6.4 percent it hit in June but well above the 30-year low of 3.9 percent in late 2000.
After the jobs report, "we can now believe in a more sustainable recovery," Mr. Shepherdson said. "Another increase next month would really solidify the change."
But forecasters -- on Wall Street, at the Federal Reserve and in the Bush administration -- have been surprised time and again over the last two years by the duration of the job slump. Employment also began to rise late in 2002, more strongly than it did last month, only to turn down again early this year. 
Some economists blamed the uncertainty created by the war in Iraq; others said the late-90's bubble in stock prices and technology spending was proving to have long-lasting effects. For the coming months, some analysts remain worried that the post-bubble hangover could re-emerge after the effect of recent tax cuts begins to wear off.
With only moderate job growth in September, the number of people outside of the labor force -- those neither working nor looking for a job -- increased to 75.2 million, from 75 million in August. The percentage of adults not in the labor force has risen more sharply over the last three years than at any point since the early 1960's.
The portion of people older than 16 who were working last month fell to 62 percent, down from a record high of 64.8 percent in 2000. Employment must grow by roughly 150,000 to 200,000 jobs each month to keep pace with the population.
Earlier this week, the Labor Department reported that while the number of layoffs had fallen during 2002, hiring had remained too slow to keep employment growing. For 2003, it has released numbers only on net changes in employment -- like September's gain of 57,000 jobs -- not on the job creation and destruction that combine to produce the net change.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 7, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page headline on Saturday about employment data for September misstated the number of months since the last increase in the number of jobs. As the article noted, it was eight, not seven.

 BODY:
Campaign aides to Arnold Schwarzenegger, responding to a growing controversy over comments Mr. Schwarzenegger made about Hitler 25 years ago, released a 33-page transcript of the interview that included a fuller version of the comments as well as remarks about everything from his use of body oil to his views on power, America and Germany during World War II.
 The comments, which included admiring statements about Hitler's speaking abilities, were part of interviews conducted for the filming of "Pumping Iron," the 1977 documentary that helped propel Mr. Schwarzenegger to fame. 
 Although the campaign releasedthe transcript, aides deferred releasing the outtakes of the documentary that included the comments, citing the difficulty of locating the relevant footage in about 100 hours of film. 
In an interview yesterday as he campaigned in California, Mr. Schwarzenegger said he did not know precisely where the outtakes were and that aides were trying to find them.
"I don't know where they are now but I'm sure we have them," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. "I've never held them in my hand."
In the transcript, Mr. Schwarzenegger responded to the question, "Who are your heroes?"
"In many ways I admired people ---- It depends for what," he answered. "I admired Hitler for instance because he came from being a little man with almost no formal education, up to power. And I admire him for being such a good public speaker and for his way of getting to the people and so on. But I didn't admire him for what he did with it. It is very hard to say who I admired and who are my heroes. And I admired basically people who are powerful people, like Kennedy. Who people listen to and just wait until he comes out with telling them what to do. People like that I admire a lot." 
Elsewhere in the transcript, Mr. Schwarzenegger said, "We can't live without authority. Because I feel that a certain amount of people who were meant to do this and control, and a large amount, like 95 percent of the people who we have to tell what to do and how to keep order. That is why I am all for it."
Mr. Schwarzenegger also reflected on the use of power in Germany during the war. "Yes, in Germany they used power and authority but it was used in the wrong way," Mr. Schwarzenegger said. But he added, "I feel if you want to create a strong nation and a strong country you cannot let everybody be an individual, because everybody has his own opinions and you can't just stick together as a strong nation. Then you have to tell people what to do and you can't just let them float away. In Germany there was a lot of unity. The German soldiers were the best, and with the police force and everything." 
Still he said, "It was misused on the power. First, it started having, I mean, getting Germany out of the great recession and having everybody jobs and so on and then it was just misused. And they said, let's take this country, and let's wipe out this country, and let's wipe out whole Europe, and let's get America, and so on. That's bad."
Asked what system of government he preferred, Mr. Schwarzenegger said, "America," but he continued: 'Except there's only one thing I don't like here and that people go on their own little trips too much. The unity isn't there anymore. And I don't think it's too much the people's fault. I think it's because we don't have a strong leader here."
Mr. Schwarzenegger's admiration for Hitler came to light this week when The New York Times and ABC News obtained copies of a 1997 book proposal prepared by George Butler, the producer of "Pumping Iron." In an interview this week, Mr. Butler said he sold the film rights and outtakes to Mr. Schwarzenegger in 1991.
Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Mr. Schwarzenegger, confirmed that Mr. Schwarzenegger's staff was in possession of about 100 hours of footage unused in the film. 
The campaign appeared to refine its position on release of the footage from Mr. Schwarzenegger's initial statements on Thursday, when he said he was prepared to release the outtakes to the public but was not sure where they were. "I don't know if I have them now," he said in an interview on Thursday afternoon. "If I find them, I would."
Late Thursday night, Mr. Butler located a fuller transcript. Yesterday, the campaign distributed a statement from Mr. Butler saying that statements attributed to Mr. Schwarzenegger in the proposal "were not in context and not even strictly accurate as it turns out." With the statement, the campaign distributed short excerpts from the interview, and yesterday evening campaign aides provided Mr. Butler's transcript.
Mr. Butler said the book proposal had erroneously dropped a few words from a quotation attributed to Mr. Schwarzenegger and repeated in early editions of yesterday's issue of The New York Times. According to Mr. Butler's transcript, Mr. Schwarzenegger followed his comments about Hitler's public speaking by adding, "But I didn't admire him for what he did with it." He did not say, "I admire him for being such a good public speaker and for what he did with it," as he was quoted in the book proposal and early editions of The Times. 
Mr. Butler contacted The Times early yesterday morning to correct the quotation and later editions reflected the change.
Mr. Butler's book proposal also described Mr. Schwarzenegger clicking his heels and pretending to be an SS officer or playing Nazi marching songs at home. In an interview, Mr. Butler attributed Mr. Schwarzenegger's antics to immaturity and the context of the outrageous bodybuilding culture.
Yesterday, Douglas Kent Hall, a writer and photographer who co-wrote Mr. Schwarzenegger's autobiography, "Arnold: The Education of a Body Builder," said that on two occasions around 1980, he, too, had watched Mr. Schwarzenegger imitate Hitler for laughs. Mr. Hall provided a photograph of Mr. Schwarzenegger clowning around in a barbershop, pulling his hair down over his forehead, employing the end of a comb as a short mustache, and raising his fist. 
"To some people that is funny and to some people it is not funny," Mr. Hall said, adding that Mr. Schwarzenegger was entering his acting career at the time.
In 1991, Mr. Butler agreed to sell the rights to "Pumping Iron" and the unused footage to Mr. Schwarzenegger for $1.2 million. The purchase agreement was made public in court papers when Mr. Butler's partners filed suit against him and Mr. Schwarzenegger for agreeing to the sale without their consent. 
The agreement included a provision entitling Mr. Schwarzenegger to destroy all copies of the footage. 
In 1997, Mr. Butler first began circulating his proposal for an unflattering book about Mr. Schwarzenegger, including references to his comments about and mimicry of Hitler. St. Martin's Press acquired the proposal for about $500,000. In March of that year, Mr. Schwarzenegger resolved the lawsuits against him and Mr. Butler by paying the other partners in "Pumping Iron" for their stake in the rights.
Mr. Butler never completed the book. He said this week that he decided against it on further reflection. But executives at St. Martin's said that in early 2001 he sought unsuccessfully to dissuade them from canceling the project.

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING; 
A Presidential Candidate Eyes the Auto Body Politic

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Leaning on a white stock car sponsored by her parents' tanning salon and driven by her 23-year-old son, Elaine Vollmoeller surveyed a garage area at Riverhead Raceway in Long Island that was teeming with Republican family men. She proclaimed it unlikely that any of them would make a political conversion just because a Democratic presidential candidate was sponsoring a racecar.
 "But I will say we have brand loyalty," Vollmoeller said. "My husband buys Tide even when it's more expensive than Wisk because he likes the driver Ricky Craven. We have friends who don't like Bud but drink it because of Dale Jr. When my Sprint contract is up, I'll probably switch to Nextel. So, yeah, I do think that could translate to voting for a candidate -- if we think he really loves my sport and recognizes me." 
 The red, white and gold Bob Graham for President truck competing in Nascar races this season is an obvious attempt to express a love and recognition that Democratic strategists claim overdue and essential in this election campaign. 
It has also attached the candidacy of Senator Graham, Democrat of Florida, to the accelerating theories that stock car racing is the new hot center of American sports and that its estimated 75 million fans contain a swing vote -- the so-called Nascar dads -- that can elect the next president. 
"I hate that term, Nascar dads; it's narrow and patronizing, but it's about time Democrats showed some sensitivity to the stock car culture," said David Saunders, who is Graham's rural consultant. "Once we connect, then we can tell them we're not trying to change them. We can say, 'We understand you hunt because you are environmentalists, that you care about your kids' education and health care and your jobs going to Mexico and China, and so do we."'
Nascar dads have been described by Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, as "middle-to-lower-middle-class males who are family men, live in rural areas, used to vote heavily Democratic but now usually vote Republican." Most political experts more or less agree with that description, although their opinions about it vary widely. 
Celinda Lake, a Washington-based Democratic consultant who this year coined Nascar dads as mates for waitress moms, the term she coined in 1998, thinks her party could drive to victory lane in 2004 on the stock car track. 
"This gives Democratic politicians the chance to bracket the country," she said, "to get to the South and Midwest, where racing is huge. And it's generational. If we do our job right, we'll have all these kids growing up Democrats as Nascar gets bigger and bigger."
A Republican consultant in Washington, Whit Ayres, laughed at that. "It's delusional," he said. "Go back to the infield and ask how many of those Nascar dads -- we used to call them southern white men -- are voting for Bush. Soccer moms had some claim to being a swing vote, but Nascar dads have no legitimacy. The Democrats are desperate. It would be like us looking for votes at the NOW convention," referring to the National Organization for Women.
Nascar seems delighted with the attention. It is the most unselfconsciously mercantile of major sports in its quest to cover every scrap of a racecar's body and a racecar driver's body suit with sponsors' logos. The skinniest strip on a car, the B pillar or ribbon of metal between the two side windows, can cost an advertiser $200,000. No wonder the term Nascar dads is simultaneously regarded as a welcome advertising soundbite and a misnomer.
 "Forty percent of our fans are women -- lots of soccer moms, I'll bet," said Jim Hunter, Nascar's vice president for corporate communications. "The average income is $50,000 a year or more. New York and Los Angeles are tied as our second-biggest TV markets after Atlanta. But I have to tell you we're very happy to be seen as a player in American politics. Should get us more recognition and more sponsors."
Nascar's recent growth spurt -- it is second only to the N.F.L. in television sports ratings -- began on February 18, 2001, with the most dramatic single event in the sport's history. On the first broadcast of a new national television contract, Dale Earnhardt, American racing's most celebrated active star, died in a wreck on the final lap of the Daytona 500. 
It is conventional wisdom that in the states that voted for President Bush in 2000, the Intimidator's death was a national tragedy, while in the states that went to Al Gore, it was a revelation; who knew that every weekend more than 200,000 people showed up in one place to watch cars go around? 
Even greater growth is expected next year when the premier race series changes its sponsorship from Winston Cup (cigarettes) to Nextel Cup (telecommunications.) Nextel's 10-year, $750 million deal should open the way to more cross promotions and direct marketing to families and children, and thus a greater attraction for mainstream corporations, which must spend $12 million to make a top car competitive. That doesn't include millions more to promote that sponsorship. 
Politicians have targeted Nascar fans before, vying to be the grand marshal of prerace parades or to work the infield and grandstands. Most famously, President Ronald Reagan, running for re-election on July 4, 1984, called, "Gentleman, start your engines," while flying over Daytona in Air Force One. Richard Petty, the sport's icon, went on to score his 200th victory that day, considered a very good omen by Nascar and the Republican Party.
 But until now, direct campaigning has only been on the local level, such as when Mark R. Warner, a Democrat, sponsored a car in one race at Martinsville Speedway in the early stages of his successful 2001 campaign for governor of Virginia. That same year, supposedly boosted by a promise to bring West Virginia a Nascar track, Robert E. Wise Jr. defeated a Republican incumbent for governor. But it is a new tactic in national politics.
 "Barry Goldwater and then Bob Dole felt me out on this when they were running for president," said H.A. Wheeler, president and general manager of the Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C. 
"Takes you one nano-second at the track to figure it out, a couple of hundred thousand people spending a lot of money on something that's their college football. But I wouldn't call them angry white men or Nascar dads or even necessarily rural. 
"They vote Republican, but would vote Democrat if the candidate sounded Republican," added Wheeler, a Nascar elder and a deal-maker known as Humpy. "They liked the President's 'Top Gun' performance, but they're not so gung ho anymore on Iraq because this is the crowd that joined the National Guard that's being extended. They hope we find those weapons of mass destruction, because they are losing patience. 
"They're not dumb and they won't be patronized, and those 'waitress moms' they are married to are more likely to be dental hygienists or real estate agents."
At Riverhead Raceway, a hardscrabble quarter-mile track in the semi-rural eastern end of Long Island, drivers, crew members and fans tended to agree with Wheeler's characterization of them as Bush Republicans who could be won over if a Democratic man's man came along, someone who seemed as if he could get his hands dirty, who was conservative and talked bluntly. Despite the Bob Graham car, they seemed more interested in Gen. Wesley Clark, and most interested in local politicians.
"We're not stupid, " said Roger Oxee, a 51-year-old salesman who races in a competitive but basically recreational class called Late Model Stocks. "Showing up once a year at a track isn't recognition of my culture. I'll vote for the candidate who promises that he won't let them shut down this track to make room for a shopping mall or a housing development."
 Elaine Vollmoeller and her family may not be around that long. A corrections officer, she is considering early retirement and a move south because of the economy. 
"There's no way my kids can own their own homes up here," she said. "Is a Democrat going to fix that? I don't know. I know I don't like these labels. Too many free spirits here to call people conservatives, even Republicans. I think we'll vote for somebody who can make things better for us. And the first thing is to understand what we're going through. That would register with me."
Saunders, Graham's rural consultant, better known as Mudcat, is quick to spin such sentiments as the reason why his candidate will burst out of the Democratic pack. The Graham logo on the No. 50 Ford (basically a car gussied up to resemble a pick-up truck) in the Craftsman Truck series cost a reported $500,000. Although No. 50 hasn't won a race since its first outing on July 5 in Kansas City, Kan., it has consistently finished well and is fifth overall in the standing
It will certainly get its money's worth in TV time, according to David Yott, managing editor of Joyce Julius and Associates, an Ann Arbor, Mich. research firm that tracks the commercial worth of sports broadcast exposure. As of Aug. 20, the truck had logged sightings worth $405,305. 
 "We needed a sponsor for that truck," said John Miller, the Roush Racing director of new business development, who made the Graham deal. "I didn't see it as any different from a newspaper or television station selling commercial space, but I was excited to get to see retail politics up close and to do something new and unique that would get us a different kind of exposure. And it did. I was able to get Superchips, that's an engine-tuning product, to sponsor our other truck."
 Not to mention getting the Graham campaign tobuy 12,500 die-cast models of the truck to be sold for $80 each as a fund-raiser. 
Jon Wood, the 21-year-old driver of the Graham car, found himself answering political questions at the shake-and-autograph sessions that are part of the job.
Wood said: "I've never considered myself political, so this broadened my horizons. In the beginning, fans asked, 'Who's Bob Graham?' and I'd tell them how he'd never lost an election and he was behind saving the Everglades and was a real cool guy like us.
"Nowadays, after so much publicity, fans ask me how the car's running and how's Bob doing in the polls."

HEADLINE: The Darkest Night 

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Mahler; Jonathan Mahler is writing a book on New York and baseball in the 70's. His last article for the magazine was about the Lubavitch Hasidic sect.

 BODY:
Officer Wilton Sekzer was in the living room of his apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, on the night of July 13, 1977, when his lights went out. On the way to check his fuse box, he peeked out the window. The whole block was dark. Sekzer ran up three flights to his roof. He looked to the west, across the East River, to Manhattan. The familiar shapes of the world's most famous skyline were all blotted out by darkness. "Holy cripes," Sekzer muttered to himself. "There's no lights anywhere." Figuring he'd be needed, minutes later he was in his car, heading for work.
 Sekzer's command, the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick, Brooklyn, was five miles away from the cheerful streets of Sunnyside. Driving in the darkness, the heavy air pushing through the open windows of his Chrysler Cordova, he remembered where he'd been in 1965, the last time the city was blacked out -- the Mekong Delta, as a 21-year-old helicopter door gunner. 
 Sekzer had been sent to the 83rd from Emergency Services in the summer of '75, when the city's fiscal crisis forced the Police Department to lay off thousands of officers. He had only narrowly escaped being "indefinitely furloughed" himself. Instead, he was transferred, as were most cops working in specialty-crime divisions like Emergency Services. Down 5,000 officers at a time of soaring crime in New York, the city's undermanned precincts, particularly those that served the roughest neighborhoods, needed all the beat cops the department could muster.
The turreted, Victorian-era station house of the 83rd Precinct was surrounded by buckling tenements and seedy bodegas, its red-brick facade buried beneath layers of grime. Sekzer checked in with the desk officer, who was still waiting for a callback from Police Headquarters about whether off-duty cops were going to be activated. He went down to the tin-ceilinged basement, the "lounge" -- a couple of old sofas and a black-and-white TV -- to kill time. When he came back upstairs a few minutes later, the word had come down: all officers were to report for duty. He was now on the clock. "The desk officer told me to stay loose," recalls Sekzer, a barrel-chested man of about 5 feet 10 inches, with jowly cheeks and rheumy hazel eyes. "He said I might be going over to Manhattan to protect the big money."
A little while later, the owner of a big furniture store in Bushwick burst through the station-house doors in a rage. What the hell is going on? They're looting my business on Broadway, and you bastards are standing here?
"This guy is screaming and screaming and I don't blame him," Sekzer tells me on a Friday night last fall at a reunion of the Eight-Three in an American Legion Hall on Long Island, where I spoke with a dozen police officers who worked the 1977 blackout. "Then the precinct captain walks up right behind him and says: 'All right, everybody in four-man cars. Go forth and do good."'
The 83rd precinct was not exactly a desirable assignment in 1977. The neighborhood it served was in the grip of extreme poverty. Some 40 percent of its roughly 100,000 residents were on public assistance; 80 percent were unemployed. Half of Bushwick's families were living on less than $4,000 a year, and its infant-mortality rate was the highest in New York City. Yet somehow its problems had gone largely overlooked. The South Bronx, Harlem, Brownsville -- these were New York's ghettos, the symbols of a city in distress, not Bushwick.
The neighborhood's decline had been as sudden as it was steep. In the 1950's and early 60's, as postwar optimism began to give way to white flight and urban blight all over Brooklyn, Bushwick remained predominantly Italian and stubbornly working class. The majority of its housing stock, yellow-brick or three-story wood-frame row houses built for German immigrants before 1910, was handsome, if not fancy, and between its 11 breweries, knitting mills and other light manufacturing plants, Bushwick was less dependent on the dying Navy Yard for jobs than much of the borough.
But Bushwick could postpone its fate only for so long. By the late 1960's, a time of increasing unemployment, the Italians had started to move out, and Hispanics and blacks, many of whom were on public assistance, had started to move in. Sensing an opportunity, local real-estate agents began calling white homeowners to stoke their fears about the influx of minorities, warning them to sell before it was too late. The houses were often snapped up on the cheap by real-estate "speculators," who stuffed them full of families on welfare, exploiting their housing subsidies to drive up rents for working people. Local banks soon stopped granting mortgages and home-improvement loans for the area. After demolishing several blocks' worth of homes in 1968, the city delayed for nearly a decade its plan to build four housing projects, an elementary school, a community center and a park, leaving a yawning hole in the heart of Bushwick.
Amid all of this, an ongoing epidemic of arson was laying siege to the neighborhood. Over the previous two years, there had been 4,000 fires in Bushwick. Some were set by landlords who were tired of trying to evict delinquent tenants; some were set by vandals who intended to return for the plumbing system, which was easier to extract and resell once the firemen had knocked down the walls; some were set by families who knew that Social Services was obligated to provide new housing and moving expenses to victims of disastrous combustions. In most cases, the fires were unstoppable. Half of Bushwick's houses were made of wood, and many were designed with air shafts over their stairwells, meaning that once they started to burn, they went up like furnaces. Not that the dying neighborhood didn't have its own haunting beauty. "You'd be out fighting a fire until dawn," remembers one local fireman, "and riding back to the firehouse you'd notice that there were fewer and fewer buildings. Then you'd start noticing the churches. Bushwick had a lot of churches. And the houses weren't blocking the view anymore." 
Bushwick's crime rates were soaring, too. Both the number of robberies and the incidents of grand larceny doubled in the early 70's. Many truck drivers insisted on police escorts while making deliveries in the neighborhood; some store owners wore firearms on their hips. In 1976, the Eight-Three had confronted more criminal activity than any other precinct in central Brooklyn. One block was so bad that two radio cars were required to respond to any call there. One cop would stay behind to protect the cars, the other three would enter the building in question -- their guns always drawn. The neighborhood was now mostly Hispanic and black, while the police force was predominantly white. As one veteran of the Eight-Three put it, "Our job was about arresting minorities."
Rookies were taught a few important lessons when they reported for duty at the Eight-Three. Don't walk too close to buildings, lest someone drop a brick on you. Don't let neighborhood kids wear your hat (lice). Always check the earpiece on call boxes before using it (dog excrement). 
Unlike Sekzer, Officer Robert Locklear was already on duty when the lights went out. A heat wave had descended on New York, and he remembers that people were hanging out on Broadway, Bushwick's main strip, playing cards, drinking beer, trying vainly to catch a flutter of breeze. Now and then, a train would rumble across the elevated tracks overhead, momentarily drowning out the sounds of salsa and disco emanating from the boom boxes below. Locklear, one of a small group of minority cops in the Eight-Three, and his partner had collared a murder suspect earlier in the evening -- they found the guy frying chicken with his door open at the top of a tenement stairwell, the dead body in plain view at the foot of the stairs -- and were hoping the rest of the shift would be relatively quiet. 
Locklear can't remember what he heard first, the sound of shattering glass or the store alarms. But he'll never forget what he saw when he looked down the block moments later -- what seemed to be literally thousands of people materializing in the darkness. A local woman called the Police Department in a panic: "They're coming across Broadway like a herd of buffalo."
Cops gathering at the Eight-Three station house found it dark; the batteries were missing from the emergency floodlights that were supposed to kick in the moment power went out. "Hats, bats and jeans" -- riot helmets, billy clubs and dungarees -- were the norm. 
Officers were assigned to "combat cars" of four men, using every marked and unmarked vehicle at the precinct's disposal. They were ghetto cops; no one had to tell them to expect the worst. "This wasn't Park Avenue," Sekzer says. "This was the jungle. You could bet there was going to be gunfire."
Still, they were not prepared for what greeted them on Broadway. According to one police report, the looting started at 9:40, only six minutes after the onset of darkness. Marauding bands were sawing open padlocks. They were taking crowbars to steel shutters, prying them open like tennis-can tops, or simply jimmying them up with jacks. They were punching through plate-glass windows to grab the clothed mannequins inside. They filled cars, vans, trucks, U-Hauls, or simply carried their loot -- sofas, television sets, refrigerators -- on their backs or in their arms. 
The most expensive shops were hit first: jewelry, electronics and furniture stores. A teenager attached a chain to the bumper of a stolen truck and tore off the gates of a luxury-item shop called Time Credit. He pitched a garbage pail through the window and filled the truck with TV's, air-conditioners and a rack of watches. After helping a fellow looter load a couch onto the roof of his station wagon, the teenager sped off.
The elevated tracks that ran above Broadway obscured the scant moonlight. In the dark, the cops started wading into the thick knots of people and making arrests. "You just grabbed 'em," says Locklear, who was patrolling the streets in a beat-up gypsy cab. "There were plenty of them to grab."
Often, the looter would drop the merchandise and run the moment he saw a cop approaching. The cop would give chase. If he managed to catch up with the looter, he'd tackle him, handcuff him and go back to pick up the evidence, if it was still there. Now he had to get his prisoner, and the stolen property, back to the station house. Short on vehicles and long on perps, it was necessary to improvise. "I saw cars pull up at the station house," says one Bushwick cop on duty that night. "They'd pull four prisoners out of the back, open up the trunk and pull two or three more out of there."
Robert Curvin and Bruce Porter, co-authors of "Blackout Looting!" a Ford Foundation-sponsored study, divided the looters into three categories: the professional criminals who were the first to start pillaging, the "alienated adolescents" who soon joined in and the poor and not so poor who either got caught up in the excitement or were motivated by "abject greed."
Off-duty cops were slowly rolling into the Eight-Three. They were aided by the nearby 81st Precinct, which shared responsibility for Broadway. Officers who didn't have riot helmets were given air-raid helmets and sent out into the streets. Some cops, like Sekzer, just assumed they'd be needed. Others were responding to the call-up order from Police Commissioner Michael J. Codd, who had gone on the radio shortly after darkness descended on the city to instruct all officers to report immediately for duty. Codd had told them to head to their nearest precincts, which were often miles away from the areas where they were needed most. Many cops were eventually bused to so-called high-hazard precincts, but plenty of others simply pretended not to have heard Commissioner Codd's order. Morale in the department had been plummeting since the '75 layoffs, and Mayor Abraham Beame's recent threat to put one cop in each patrol car in half the city's precincts as a further cost-cutting measure had only made matters worse. When the looting peaked between midnight and 4 a.m., some 10,000 cops, 40 percent of the force who were neither on vacation nor on sick leave, had yet to check in. 
At the station house, there was no time for paperwork. All the stolen merchandise was initially piled up in the property room. When that was full, it was redirected to a designated area outside the station where an officer stood guard. Polaroids were snapped of the cop with his collar. Information relating to the crime was scribbled on the back. The perp was shoved into a holding cell, and the arresting officer headed back out into the mayhem. Ordinarily, prisoners were taken to downtown Brooklyn for processing, but the message had come down that all suspects were to be detained in the precincts in which they were arrested in order to conserve manpower on the streets and relieve pressure at Central Booking.
During the civil disturbances of the 1960's, rioters spared black merchants with the foresight to mount a "Soul Brother" sign in their windows. During the blackout looting of '77, being black-owned offered no protection. As the night wore on, some merchants started turning up to defend their property, but because most of them had moved out of the neighborhood years earlier, everything was already gone by the time they got to their stores.
At one point, Sekzer and his partners followed a group of looters into a furniture store. It was pitch-black inside. The cops walked through with their flashlights but saw no one. There was a staircase leading downstairs in the back. Walking down to the basement, Sekzer heard voices. A lot of voices. There were at least 30 people down there. "We're all thinking the same thing," Sekzer recalls. "I'm not shooting anybody over this. If they come running at us to try and get out, then take care, send me a postcard."
The officers told the offending mob that they were under arrest. Now the question was how to get them back to the station house. Sekzer and another cop went upstairs to commandeer a city bus. They managed to flag one down. The bus stopped, the door opened and a police captain leaned out. "What the hell is your problem?" he asked.
The bus was filled with a detail of cops on their way to Brooklyn's Central Command for reassignment. Unable to find a vehicle large enough to transport the mob of looters, Sekzer went back to the furniture store to confer with his partners. They decided to bring the women and children upstairs and let them go and then called for squad cars to come and pick up the men. 
Bullets, as well as bricks and bottles, were now raining down on the officers from rooftops. Many of the cops remember using their guns repeatedly, usually with the intention of clearing hostile crowds and scaring off snipers, though in the following days there was an unspoken understanding among both the officers and their superiors that no one would claim to have fired his pistol. (For the record, the city reported that only two officers discharged their weapons that night, in one case accidentally.) Some cops recall that Emergency Services vans combed the streets of Bushwick, tossing out extra boxes of ammunition to officers in need. One cop says that he and his partner shot on the order of 130 rounds into the air. Another recalls talking to a shaken transit cop who had defended a token booth at an elevated subway stop by running back and forth between the two entrances, firing his pistol to keep the looters at bay.
At a little after midnight, word spread that John and Al's, a sporting-goods store on Broadway that sold firearms, was under siege. Just about every officer in Bushwick headed straight for it. They showed up in time to arrest 17 looters, but dozens of guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition were already gone. At least some baseball bats had been left behind. One cop tells me that he grabbed a Louisville Slugger to replace his nightstick, which he had already broken on a looter. The cops secured the location and turned it over to one owner, who remained the rest of the night with a high-caliber rifle. 
In the Bushwick area, the arrests peaked at about 1:30 a.m. By then, there were two shifts' worth of cops -- 4 to midnight and midnight to 8 -- out on the street. The Eight-Three's holding cells, which were designed to accommodate one prisoner, had upward of 10 in each. When they couldn't squeeze in another body, cops handcuffed prisoners to radiators, to benches, to tables, to one another. (One preferred method was to cuff five prisoners in a line, then cuff the last guy to the first guy's ankles.) The rest were stuffed into a small courtyard next to the station house. 
By 2 a.m., the dispatcher was only reporting 10-30's and 10-13's -- robberies in progress and officers needing assistance. Several cops remember being instructed to stop arresting looters. Even though they weren't hanging around to process their collars, the arrests were taking them off the streets for too long. Besides, the station house was running out of room for prisoners.
So instead, cops cracked shins or gave looters "turbans" (cop-speak for a bloody head wrapped in a towel or bandage). "You just wanted to stop the riot, so you beat up the looters with ax handles and nightsticks," recalls Robert Knightly, a bearded veteran of the Eight-Three who is now a defense attorney for Legal Aid. "You beat 'em up and left them in the street. You catch them looting, you just smacked them down and left them."
Knightly chased one looter who was carrying a love seat. He caught up to the perp and knocked him down. The looter popped right up, as if attached to a spring. "I'm not like these people: I've got a job," he barked. "Oh, yeah?" Knightly answered. "Is today your day off?" 
The station house was in chaos. When cops needed a breather, they'd drive a few blocks toward the Queens border, which was eerily quiet.
Several officers recall being told to remove their shields and nameplates. The shields gave the looters a target to shoot at in the darkness. As for the nameplates: "They wanted this thing over as quickly as possible, and they didn't want anyone worrying about being identified," one cop says. The cop who had taken the Louisville Slugger broke it on a looter and yanked a metal riser out of the stairwell of an abandoned building to use as his new nightstick. It got him through the remainder of the night.
One officer remembers seeing a looter running around under a building like an outfielder trying to get under a fly ball. "We were saying, 'No, no way he's going to do this."' He did. A love seat came crashing down on top of him from above. The looters were attacking one another, too. According to one police report, a man was loading a van full of stolen merchandise on Broadway. He offered an onlooker $100 to help. The onlooker declined. But as soon as the van was full, the onlooker stabbed the driver, took the keys to the van and drove off.
Officer Frank Cammarata remembers chasing another looter up to the roof of a six-story furniture store with a few other officers. One thing led to another, and the looter went over the edge. A tree broke his fall. He looked up from the pavement, gave the officers the finger and hobbled away.
By 3 a.m., the only hospital in the precinct, Wyckoff Heights, was a madhouse. A police administrator was stationed at the registrar's desk, filling out police reports while the registrar did intakes. So many people had cut themselves on broken glass that cops were told that the emergency room was running out of suture material. When officers came by to drop off the injured or simply to wash up and rest for a few minutes, nurses gave them packets of suture threads to keep in their pockets for later, in case they were the ones who needed to be stitched up.
When the pricier shops and shoe stores were cleaned out, the looters moved on to the supermarkets and bodegas. J. Walters, a local barber who had just rented out an empty store on Broadway where he intended to put a grocery store, had $40,000 in uninsured meat-slicing equipment stolen. Even a taxidermy store on Broadway was hit, leaving a trail of eyeballs in the street.
After five hours, there was little left to steal, but the worst was not over. Some of the looters, caught up in the insanity of the night, driven by the desire to destroy their neighborhood or maybe just bored, starting torching stores. After a thorough examination of the 31 neighborhoods that had suffered considerable damage during the blackout, Curvin and Porter determined that the character of the chaos in Bushwick was unique. "The crowds on Broadway in Bushwick seemed to possess a special kind of hysteria as the evening wore on," they concluded in their Ford Foundation report. "This spirit appeared to lead them as much toward destruction and burning as toward looting."
Orange flames pierced the darkness; Bushwick was burning. At one point, two solid blocks of Broadway were in flames. As fire trucks sped along the avenue, looters pelted them from the el tracks above with rocks, bottles, bags of Goya beans. Cops tried to disperse the crowds at the various fire sites and to protect the firemen so they could do their job. After the firemen abandoned one truck to seek cover from the objects raining down on them, a few cops climbed aboard and turned the water cannon on the crowd. The force of the stream sent looters skipping as far as a half a block. Later the cops tried clearing the street by fastening a metal chain between two patrol cars and driving down either side of Broadway.
As dawn approached, exhaustion, as well as a growing sense of futility, had set in. A group of cops looked on as all the vehicles in a used-car lot were torched. The ad-hoc bazaars had already begun: a $500 color TV set was going for $135, Pro-Keds basketball shoes for $5 a pair, a $200 Peugeot 10-speed for $40.
The sun finally rose, revealing endless piles of broken glass. Disembodied mannequins littered the streets like battlefield debris. Locklear sat on a curb in a daze, as streams of blackened water pooled up in front of him and a police helicopter buzzed overhead. Not only had the crowds on Broadway not diminished, they were larger than ever. "Ain't you guys have wives or girlfriends at home?" he asked a group of men busy picking through the rubble. "Ain't you tired of being out here?"
In all, more than 30 blocks of Broadway -- a distance of a mile and a half -- were devastated overnight. One-hundred thirty-four stores were cleaned out; 45 of them had been burned as well. "I remember a merchant on Broadway whose place was looted all to hell," Knightly says. "He was standing there wondering why the police didn't stop them. I didn't have an answer. I guess because there weren't enough of us to go around." On reflection he adds: "There was also a reluctance to be perceived as coming down hard on the black population. The police were afraid of a race riot." 
One black store owner, a pharmacist, managed to protect his drugstore on Broadway without the help of the police. He stood guard all night with a loaded gun. When he finally left the store to go get something to eat, he returned a half-hour later to find nearly everything gone. 
More than 20 fires were still burning along Broadway come Thursday morning, 10 hours after the blackout began. The stifling heat was made more oppressive by the thick black smoke that hovered over the neighborhood. "Seeing the destruction," says Thomas Creegan, a redheaded veteran of the Eight-Three, "what was most upsetting was that you'd worked with these people; you had taken care of them. And here they were, burning their own stores down. Where are you going to go come Friday? Where's that nice old lady in the tenement going to get her food?"
New York's long night of looting was followed by another hot day, with temperatures climbing into the high 90's. The power still wasn't back. The streets were littered, the skyscrapers empty, the subways idle. Con Ed had to first disconnect the entire system so that all of its component parts could be inspected for damage. Then, once everything was reconnected, the juice would need to be restored slowly in order to avoid any surges that might cause another failure. High-density areas were the first priority, which created a perverse situation: the depleted slums would be among the last to get their power back.
The looting had not been citywide. In some of the tonier areas of Manhattan, a "party atmosphere" (as WINS radio had put it) prevailed. Restaurants moved tables outside to escape the heat; drivers angle-parked their cars to enable diners to identify their food. At the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway, the cast members of "Beatlemania" picked up their acoustic instruments and led the audience in a sing-along of Beatles hits. At the Metropolitan Opera, where the National Ballet of Canada was performing, the orchestra's harpist did an impromptu solo of the old standard "Dancing in the Dark." But not a single poor neighborhood escaped damage. The 1977 blackout looting was the first and only civil disturbance in the history of New York City to simultaneously encompass all five boroughs.
By Thursday morning, the city was reckoning with another problem: what to do with all the suspected looters. As The Village Voice chronicled, early every cell in the city's 73 precincts was overcrowded, as were the jails. At a few hours before dawn, with nowhere else to house prisoners, paddy wagons and squad cars had started delivering them to criminal-court buildings. Officers signed the accused in by flashlight and then went about packing them into detention pens meant to hold prisoners for an hour or two before their arraignments. Before long, at 100 Centre Street, Manhattan's House of Detention, prisoners were being stuffed into the windowless basement, where a gasoline-generated spotlight had made the already uncomfortably hot room unbearably so. Soon it was full, too. By late morning, the city's commissioner of corrections, Benajmin Malcolm, had no choice but to petition a judge to reopen the Tombs, a prison ordered closed in 1974 for its inhumane conditions.
A total of 3,076 people were arrested, a figure that dwarfed those from the city's previous two civil disorders: the 1964 rioting in Harlem and Brooklyn following the shooting of a black teenager by an off-duty white cop (373 arrested) and the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (465). Taken together, the arrests from these two disorders amounted to one-quarter of those arrested during the blackout of '77. It was the largest mass arrest in the city's history -- and surely it would have been much larger if more cops had heeded Commissioner Codd's call-up order.
As Thursday progressed, the bottleneck continued to build. Arraignments were stalled by missing paperwork and missing officers, many of whom were still out in the streets trying to prevent further damage. Evidence and witnesses able to make identifications from the dark, chaotic night were in short supply. So were the rap sheets and fingerprint records necessary for judges to set bail. The power outage knocked out communications with the central computer in Albany, where everything was stored.
As of late afternoon, with the power still out, the Bronx had worked through two cases, which was two more than Brooklyn could claim. The office of the Manhattan D.A. had prepared 250 felony complaints over the course of the day, but without lights, the judges couldn't read them. At 4:30, the courts at 100 Centre Street closed down on account of darkness. 
Like the rest of the station houses in Brooklyn, the Eight-Three was told to hang onto its 133 accused looters until Central Booking was ready for them. For Sekzer it was just as well; it was going to take him days to complete the paperwork for the 30-odd men he'd collared. Most of the precinct's prisoners were wedged into the property room and an open courtyard between the cells awaiting their arraignment. "We had them so packed in they couldn't even sit down," Officer Kevin Cox says. "We went to McDonald's and threw hamburgers down to them from the second floor." Another cop from the Eight-Three remembers urinating on the prisoners.
Bushwick's cops were put on a "12 on, 12 off" work schedule. The blackout fires continued to rage through Thursday; most of the officers who weren't too busy typing up arrest reports were out protecting the firemen. Cox doesn't remember doing any additional paperwork for his three collars, whom he'd knocked down and cuffed outside a store on Broadway. It wasn't until close to a week later that he heard they were about to be arraigned. "All of a sudden I get called to go to court," he says. "They all pled guilty and were sentenced to time served, and I left."
The logjam in the criminal-justice system caused severe overcrowding in the court-detention pens. By Saturday, civil rights groups had been alerted to the squalid conditions. Not only was there no bedding to cover the steel benches; hundreds of accused looters who sported nightstick abrasions and lacerations from broken glass were in desperate need of medical attention. Thirty-six men were in a holding pen 20 feet long and 9 feet deep in downtown Manhattan. The president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association warned that if something wasn't done soon, "our prisons will explode and lives will be lost."
Over the weekend, Corrections Commissioner Malcolm and a few fellow Corrections officials toured Brooklyn's criminal-court building, which was housing 510 detainees, roughly five times its capacity. The temperature outside was inching its way toward 100 degrees; the temperature inside was easily 120. There were puddles of urine and vomit on the floor. Malcolm, who had seen some grim prison conditions in his day, called this situation "the worst I've ever seen" and then promptly barred the press from entering. One of his aides compared the pens to the galley of a slave ship.
The Legal Aid Society urged the courts to grant the accused parole until their arrest records were located. When that failed, they drafted a statement calling attention to the "abhorrent conditions" in the cellblocks. The suspected looters, a Legal Aid lawyer charged, were victims of "extreme misery caused by extraordinary unemployment . . . and massive cutbacks in services." Hundreds of protesters marched in front of Con Ed headquarters on Irving Place, waving placards that read PUT CON EDISON UNDER MARTIAL LAW, NOT THE POOR AND HUNGRY. The implication was clear: the looters were heirs to the urban rioters of the 60's, victims of the city's financial fumblings, participants in what one columnist dubbed "the most significant class uprising in this decade."
Or were they simply hoodlums? For most New Yorkers -- conservative and liberal alike -- it was hard to square the images of rampaging mobs that were now playing in an endless loop on local TV with some abstract notion of social protest. Some of the most unequivocal denunciations of the looting were already coming from black leaders. "When you see a black florist on Nostrand Avenue wiped out," asked Woodrow Lewis, a black assemblyman from Brooklyn, "and a supermarket on the same street suffer the same fate, both black-owned, how can I buy excuses that no jobs and poverty motivated this mob action?"
In the days after the blackout, a damp, acrid smell permeated Bushwick. Fire-damaged buildings sloughed off big chunks of debris. In the rubble-strewn streets, people filled shopping carts with abandoned packages of meat.
At first, many merchants hadn't even bothered returning to their cleaned-out shops. Very few of them had insurance; nearly all of those who did had "civil disobedience" clauses in their policies, which precluded claims for losses incurred during riots.
On Sunday, July 18, four days after the looting started, two teenagers and a 12-year-old started a fire in the basement of an old knitting factory. A few years earlier, the Fire Department had urged the city to demolish the five-story building, which had already been the site of two three-alarm fires. Instead, it was to be converted into a low-income apartment complex. But the fiscal crisis arrived before renovation could begin, and the abandoned building was now being used as a bingo hall as well as a hangout for local junkies.
Fires, of course, were nothing new to Bushwick. Local firemen spray-painted signs on abandoned buildings. Two intersecting diagonal lines, an X, meant the structure was unsound; don't go in. They were like tombstones for the doomed residents of a town confronting a deadly epidemic.
The fire in the abandoned knitting factory spread with startling speed. Before long, it had progressed from a three-alarm fire to a full-borough-alarm fire, the equivalent of 10 alarms. Flames were literally jumping across the street. A fire truck's windshield melted. Brick facades tumbled and wooden houses collapsed, burying cars underneath them. More than 55 fire companies, including 13 from Manhattan, were summoned to help, as were the cops on duty at the Eight-Three. All of the neighborhood's fire hydrants had already been opened by neighborhood kids looking for some relief from the unrelenting heat, which drastically reduced the water pressure for the firemen. 
Cox and his partner were among the cops told to drive down the center of the street looking for survivors. Through their windshield, they could see the flames above their heads. When they emerged, having found no one, the paint on their car had blistered.
Firemen managed to get the blaze under control in about three hours, but by then it had destroyed 23 buildings in a four-block area, including a Methodist church. It was the city's biggest fire since 1963. As night fell, the Salvation Army was serving coffee to cops, the Red Cross was trying to find temporary housing for the 200 newly homeless and scavengers were picking through the rubble left behind.
A decade earlier, the rioting that nearly destroyed Detroit and Newark awakened America to the need to address the dire condition of its ghettos. But New York's 1977 blackout looting only seemed to confirm the country's worst suspicions about the beleaguered city. After declining to visit post-blackout New York, President Carter denied its request to be declared a major disaster area. The Washington Post called the looting "an indictment of the state of the city, its government and its people." The magazine Christianity Today suggested that God had sent his judgment on a city that had turned away from him. "The lack of electricity lit up the reality of people's minds and hearts," the magazine wrote. "That's what people are like when separated from light and the light."
Yet even as the nation was busy heaping scorn on New York, the city's regeneration was already under way. In the weeks after the blackout, a parade of columnists paid their respects to battered Bushwick. "It is here, in the dirt and the smells and the heat," Jimmy Breslin wrote in The Daily News, "that New York must struggle to keep a crucial part of its city from falling apart." Martin Gottlieb and a team of reporters produced a moving series in the same newspaper on Bushwick's woes, and the neighborhood became a requisite campaign stop for New York's 1977 mayoral candidates.
The 1980's and 90's brought block associations, urban planners, social workers and successful experiments in community policing to Bushwick. Charred storefronts slowly disappeared, and the lower middle class started creeping back. Gradually, the neighborhood's identity began to change. Several hundred two- and three-family homes, apartments and a day-care center are now rising on the abandoned site of the old Rheingold brewery. Once a metaphor for the city's self-destructiveness, Bushwick has become a quiet emblem of New York's halting yet determined rebirth.

 BODY:
As anyone who has ever moved here knows, New York is famously tough on its newcomers. For most of us -- whether born in Lubbock or Laos -- it is, at first glance, a source of endless intimidation, as indecipherable and unattainable as a well-bred East Coast lover. But time somehow collapses in New York, and within a decade the unattainable becomes commonplace, the love you feel for an impossible mistress turns into something like the love of a middle-aged child for an ailing parent. "She has good days and bad days," we can say of the city, shocked that a figure that once lorded over us with such a mixture of authority and indifference can, in her weakened state, bring about our compassion and swift allegiance.
 New York is currently having one of her bad days: attacked by lunatics, drained of revenue by corporations decamped across the Hudson and quickly forgotten by a Congress and an administration that have never much cared for her superior ways. And it seems there are even bigger difficulties ahead; problems that are, as the social scientists would say, structural in nature. 
 The New York century -- the 20th century, that is -- was based on the idea that the city was the center of finance, media and art, the aggregate of American talent and vitality, the flagship of the world's most powerful economy. "NYC . . . Capital of the World," the Giuliani-era signs proclaimed. In this context, the nation's love affair with New York in the rapacious 90's made sense. TV shows, mass-market magazines and a mayor with decidedly provincial tastes all combined to present New York, once the 800-pound gorilla of cities, as a cuddly chimp. 
As a writer fascinated with New York above all else, I found myself at a loss. Amid the Nasdaq uptick, the hordes of emigres from Ontario and Ohio, the easy blandishments of beef carpaccio and tuna tartare, New York was no longer the city of stories, but rather, to borrow the buzzword of the Internet age, a city of "content." That New York is gone now. Two years of tragedy was all it took to wipe out the image of the World City nonpareil. But in its place, once again, we find a city deserving of our love and grace. We live again in a city worthy of narration. 
My own Manhattan narrative begins circa 1980, the city still reeling from the economic turbulence of the 1970's, the "Ford to City: Drop Dead" era. One summer day, my mother and I timidly venture out of our apartment in Kew Gardens, Queens, to shop for cheap clothes around Delancey Street. I am 7 years old. We are less than a year in America, having emigrated from the Soviet Union. We are poor, relying on my parents' minimum-wage salaries, food stamps and handouts from resettlement agencies, and yet we know that all points west of eastern Queens are no-go areas filled with people who are emphatically different from us -- violent, unhappy people who for some reason do not strive as all Americansshould. 
Emerging from the dirty subway, I have my first view of Manhattan, suffused by a strange combination of colors reminiscent of a Soviet newscast -- washed-out industrial reds, tawny yellows, celery greens. I spend most of the day rooting around vast Orchard Street clothing bins like a young pig, pulling out underwear and belts, socks and slacks, a winter jacket with a hood designed to cover a monstrously big American child, not a little milksop such as myself. Indeed, everyone is big in Manhattan; even the poorest citizens stride along with an inexplicable brio notably absent in Leningrad. We turn off Orchard Street onto Delancey, where the steel caldron of the Williamsburg Bridge overwhelms the cityscape, leaving me worried for the cars disappearing between its vast girders. And then -- a loud pop. Gunfire! I grab my mother's hand and pull myself into her coat. The violent, unhappy Americans are shooting at us! We hear a few yelps from passers-by, but soon the halfhearted terror gives way to laughter and exclamations in Spanish. What happened? A car backfired, that's what. 
We cannot afford a television set and so are not privy to the 11 p.m. cavalcade of violence on Channel 4, but the graffiti on the subway trains alone inform us that we are no longer in Leningrad, a city that was (back then) safe at almost any hour, kept in check by a totalitarian police force. After six hours in Manhattan, I want to go home to the farthest reaches of Queens, to the vast air-conditioned archipelago of our Waldbaum's supermarket, to the empty sidewalks and overfed squirrels. And with the exception of a few school excursions and several more expeditions on Orchard diving for underwear, I successfully avoid Manhattan for most of the next decade. As an adolescent, I dream someday of moving to the most suburban of suburbs, where I will never have to look into another unfamiliar face, or indeed any faces at all. I see myself as a prosperous Republican left to his own devices in a backyard that stretches over a hill, swallows up a public lake and ends in a fierce bramble of barbed wire festooned with a Private Property sign. It's an appropriate way to spend the 1980's. Young immigrant to city: Drop dead.
My next rendezvous with Manhattan takes place in 1990. I have been accepted to Stuyvesant High School, a public magnet school symbolizing prosperity for the thousands of immigrants who have never heard of Dalton or Nightingale-Bamford (and who couldn't afford their dues anyway). On my first train rides into the city, I turn my back to the skyline, afraid of all forms of nonsuburban vice that I imagine take place in the dark corridors between the towers. Only gradually do I begin to claim the seats that allow an unimpeded view of the city. Before long, I will be able to catalog the cityscape, not just the familiar markers of the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center, but the vast valley that runs between them, that audacious low-rise stretch of concrete where the real life of the city takes place.
At Stuyvesant, I am surrounded by 3,000 young strivers, many of whom, brimming with immigrant ambition, are trying to work their way out of their parents' grocery stores. Crammed into a small building on East 15th Street, a kind of educational tenement, the school's hallways are filled to bursting: central hallways form their own crowded Broadways, smaller hallways are the equivalent of major crosstown streets. The students latch onto others who look like them; they travel in packs. Here is Tiny Taiwan, Mini-Macao, Petite Port-au-Prince and Lesser Leningrad. 
Amid this multicultural jostle, I retreat to Stuyvesant Square Park, a small oasis dotted with elm trees that reminds me of Little Neck, the nearly suburban part of Queens where my family eventually settles. There I meet the school's bad element, a loose coalition of hippielike boys and girls who, much like me, lack the work ethic and will to compete with the fierce academic warriors of Stuyvesant. We buy paper coffee cups and fill them with Kahlua and milk, pretending we're young go-getters drinking the day's third cup of coffee. My new friends, stinking of Indonesian clove cigarettes and unwashed hair, talk about the streets of Manhattan with a kind of evangelism. Each Greek diner is sacred, each rat-infested gutter a cause for quiet contemplation. "Come with us," they say to me. "Let's take to the streets."
The streets are in rough shape. New York has been hit hard by the Wall Street crash of 1987, and its poorer neighborhoods feel blighted and worn, like the streets that scared me so much a decade earlier. But now they're a cause for celebration. We hit the especially rumpled Alphabet City, making our way past the detritus of Tompkins Square Park, recently cleared of its shanties by the police but still home to garbage, stray needles and an active drug bazaar. Then we head west to the shattered warehouses in farthest Chelsea, with its dysfunctional bodegas and creepy garages. No matter which edifice we enter in downtown New York -- school, hospital, tenement or seafood shack -- we seem to walk out with a dime bag of marijuana, the hard currency of the young middle class. 
Walking down Second Avenue on a Friday night, I pass a man and woman in cheap tight clothes, standing in the middle of the sidewalk crying in each others arms. Crowds of teenagers gingerly walk around them, not exactly stunned by this display but respectful of the unabashed emotion. Everyone around me is silent for at least a block. I double back to take another look. The woman's face is barely visible, but as she leans back I notice her slightly Persian cast, the parabola of her long lashes, her coarse red lips. She is beautiful. But so is everyone else. It is hard to walk from the L train on 14th Street to the school on 15th without falling desperately in love. 
"Are you the New person drawn toward Me?" Walt Whitman asked of the passing crowd, and similarly on these battered, flirtatious Manhattan streets I find, as would any teenager, bottomless erotica. Men and women, in various sex combinations, are exchanging small bits of sexual information with their eyes, then rounding the next corner as if they had never met. Yes, my eyes say to nearly every woman who passes, but they only scowl and avert their eyes (No) or smile and look away (Not now). Finally, on a soupy summer day, a young woman walking ahead of me lowers her shorts so that the curve of her posterior is visible. She turns around and flashes a brief, gaptoothed smile. She starts to walk faster. I can barely keep up. There are now several men on her trail, most of them young professionals, all of us silent and needy. Every few blocks, she lowers her shorts a bit more, evoking chortles of disbelief from her followers. Suddenly she runs across the street and disappears into a doorway, laughing at us before slamming the door. We look around to discover we are on Avenue D, in the shadow of some fierce-looking projects. This is the farthest I have been from Little Neck, and I am never going back.
Despite the vow, I do leave for college for four long years, not returning to New York until the mid-90's. In my absence the city has become a booming all-American metropolis. Even the dingiest parts of Manhattan are putting on pomade and lipstick, its new inhabitants -- toothsome geeks in pleated slacks -- ready to cash in on anything remotely technological. In a city that once celebrated alienation and anonymity, the most unremarkable wallflower can get himself invited to a noisy dot-com party that he will later chronicle in his online journal. 
The writers I meet are more interested in writing the filler that goes beneath Internet banner ads than the New York novels they dreamed of in college. The city is under siege by prosperity. People are less strange. You aren't afraid of being attacked on Avenue C at 4 in the morning, but neither do you expect to be surprised or touched or fall in love. Artists who can no longer afford to live even on Avenue C spit through their smoke that Manhattan is nothing but an island of millionaires. The homogenization of Times Square becomes another cocktail-hour topic. Fellow Russian immigrants recall how our fathers would visit the peep shows on Eighth Avenue after taking computer classes in skyscrapers nearby; we sigh over the sleaze and wonder of the New World, our parents' brief introduction to a nation's glorious underbelly. 
Not only Times Square falls to the developers. Entire communities from Hoboken to Long Island City change into local Ann Arbors and Chapel Hills. I stumble along with the other former Manhattanites, computer-map printout in hand, negotiating blocks of Brooklyn filled only with other industrious young folk on their way to a party in some banged-up duplex or recently anointed bar. While the streets are quiet, the newly renovated flats above us are lighted up with members of the solitary young population leading their virtual existence, e-mailing one another and Googling prospective partners until the sun comes up. Dawn Powell wept. 
And then everything changes. Attacks, recession, forces of gravity. 
Last week, while waiting for the C train at the Clinton-Washington station in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, my benchmate and I play Spot the Biggest Rodent. There are many fine specimens to choose from, mounting their assault on a pile of loose refuse from a series of convenient holes alongside the platform. The dot-commers have gone home, wherever that may be. Ersatz hipster communities like Williamsburg are starting to lose their populace. Downtown Manhattan, still overpriced and relatively well kept, has nonetheless begun to stink again of garbage and humanity. Despite the boom years of the 90's, or perhaps because of their seemingly instantaneous demise, New York is back. It is gritty, of course, in scary ways -- services cut to thousands of people who desperately need them, a safety net torn wider, a large chunk of the population made more desperate -- and no one should romanticize human suffering. But for those of us who arrived, literally or existentially, in a city that our new one seems to be recalling, it is something like going home. The interlopers who crashed our house have left. The city belongs again -- or feels like it could belong again -- to the neighborhoods, the boroughs, the margins, the places we learned to navigate and master and love. Urbanism isn't always pretty. But the broken porticoes and cracked pavements, the walls of garbage and zaftig rats, the constant recall, ironically or otherwise, of the city that scared us and made us -- this is the stuff of true New York stories. They're out there now, in abundance. Take a train, walk to the grocer, look around you. You'll find a ready-made tale -- a real one, with a beginning, middle and an end. The city is yours again.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-5-03: PHENOMENON; 
(Not) For His Eyes Only

BYLINE:  By Shaila K. Dewan; Shaila K. Dewan is a reporter for the Metro Section of The Times.

 BODY:
Even on a Friday night in summer, Coney Island snaps shut like a clamshell when it rains. The stalls selling frozen daiquiris in tall plastic beakers are shuttered, and the old-timers disappear from Ruby's boardwalk bar. But walk past Astroland, and you'll find one place lighted up with carny promise, where paintings of a bearded lady and a tattooed man practically reach out and grab the money from your pocket. Inside the Sideshows by the Seashore, the bleacher seats are packed. The crowd is mostly people in their 20's and 30's who are in thrall to Coney's seedy charm or older folks who grew up coming to the boardwalk and have discovered the show on nostalgia trips. Onstage, a woman dressed as a portly man abuses a plastic blow-up doll in unseemly ways. Suddenly, the blow-up doll comes alive, slowly unpeeling her plastic layer, and a woman whose stage name is MsTickle steps out, wearing -- ba-da-boom! -- pasties and a G-string. This is Burlesque on the Beach. 
 It is not surprising that there is an old-time burlesque revival in New York. Like tiki bars and the jitterbug, the striptease had to come back sometime. What is impressive, though, is that it has come back with such a vengeance. Suddenly, women in very scanty clothing are everywhere, or at least on every bijou stage in every hipster neighborhood, introduced by languid gay M.C.'s instead of the straight male impresarios of the 40's and 50's. You can see a burlesque revue, or two, on almost any night of the week: Mondays in Williamsburg; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays in the East Village; Fridays on Coney Island; Saturdays on the Lower East Side. In May, the Knitting Factory staged a sold-out show during a burlesque festival. 
 Part of the vengeance is that burlesque is not just for gentlemen anymore, and performers need not look like mud-flap girls. The women are shaped like hourglasses, pears or licorice sticks, teasing enthusiastic audiences from behind ostrich-feather fans or hubcaps. They decorate their breasts with pasties of swinging tassels, peppermint candies, electrodes, plastic vampire bats or googly eyes. Miss Dirty Martini, who looks like a party-going housewife with fake eyelashes long enough to rake leaves, is both ample and sculptured, a trained dancer whose body is a dazzling array of powder-pale shapes. The audiences love her -- in fact, they seem to love any woman who struts her stuff with a certain aplomb.
Late one night at the Slipper Room on the Lower East Side, an all-star show is in the works with Scotty the Blue Bunny, who stands more than seven feet in his blue unitard, platform heels and bunny ears, as the M.C. The performers are Bunny Love, a makeup artist who has a number in which she sits on a cake; Julie Atlas Muz, a theater director and former stage electrician who has been known to take a bite of the cake afterward; Jo Boobs, who sometimes eats fire or wears a monkey mask; Miss Saturn, an actor resembling Carly Simon who undresses while hula-hooping; and the World Famous Bob, a self-described "female female-impersonator" who, despite the fact that she is a biological woman, once made a living as a drag queen.
One of Bob's numbers involves using her F-cup breasts to shake a martini and pour it, after which she garnishes it with olives fished out of her underpants and serves it to an audience member. One person who has drunk such a martini is Will Clegg, a 23-year-old freelance photographer who discovered the show at the Slipper Room one night and keeps coming back. "I appreciate the humor a little more than the sexy," Clegg says. "It's not like a real strip club. It's sexy, but it's not erotic. It's exhilarating to some degree." 
So-called low forms of entertainment like burlesque have always been an escape in hard economic times, and New Yorkers dealing with a recession and still recovering from a terrorist attack need a refuge. But traditionally, burlesque was aimed at men as a respite from the job, the wife and the screaming kids. This time around, if burlesque is for men, it is done with a very big wink at the women in the audience. At a show at Galapagos in Williamsburg, Jami O'Rourke, a 26-year-old mortgage underwriter, has a quick answer to why she is there: naked breasts. "And tassels," she adds quickly. Although at heart burlesque is an art of the sendup, neither the performers nor the audience approaches it with any more than low-level irony. They are earnest, and they will tell you unhesitatingly how much fun it is. 
With a bit of encouragement, O'Rourke launches into a riff on the reasons for burlesque's revival, including her opinion that its peek-a-boo ploy restores some mystery and playfulness to public sexuality. "We're totally saturated with vulgarity," she says. 
Burlesquers tweak what often seems like society's monolithic idea of what is sexy. Anna Curtis, a photographer who performs under the name Lady Ace, does one act in Western wear called "The Farmer's Daughter," riding a broomstick with a horsy head. At the end of the song, she undoes the bandanna tied over her face and grins shyly, showing off a mouthful of crooked dentures. World Famous Bob does a striptease while a voiceover repeats things that have been said to her throughout her life. When it comes to "We just want different things from a relationship," Bob gives a yawn and puts her hand to her mouth.
A friendly one-upmanship drives the scene, ensuring that performers invest a staggering amount of energy into costumes, wigs, stilettos and routines, despite the fact that for most of them there's no money in it and little hope of fame beyond what a personal Web site provides."I'm devoted to it," says Miss Saturn, 28, who was encouraged to try burlesque by a friend involved in the Va Va Voom Room, a weekly burlesque show at Fez in the East Village. "I get more artistic satisfaction out of this than I ever did acting. There's none of that weird actor insecure stuff. It's more like fearless."
At the Slipper Room, Scotty the Blue Bunny is ready to start the show. "Welcome to Mr. Toad's variety burlesque upstairs downstairs whatever extravaganza," he tells the audience, and Julie Atlas Muz takes her place behind the curtain. Muz, who occupies a lofty position in the vaudeville firmament as co-host of "This or That," Coney Island's burlesque game show, is also one of the deftest performers around. She begins with a Spanish-style fan dance, wearing a black Zorro hat with red balls dangling from the brim at a rakish tilt. Muz's facial expressions are always half the story, and for this dance she punctuates a half-asleep expression with snarling, teeth-bared lion yawns. In the second set, Muz begins as an ice-cream man in a white coat, curly wig and mustache, tossing Good Humor cones to the audience. Then she strips down to pigtails and a G-string, jumping up and down for ice cream. For a finale, she turns her profile to the audience, tilts up her head and downs an entire cone in one slow go, rivulets of vanilla running out of her mouth as the crowd chants, "Julie, Julie!"
Little Brooklyn, named in deference to Little Egypt, a famous early burlesquer who attracted scores of imitators, is relatively new to the stage. By day, she is a 29-year-old flash animator who lives in Midwood (Brooklyn, of course), close to her parents. "I'm kind of like a homing pigeon," she says. By night, she has developed a sweet, working-class burlesque: a housewife doing dishes who gets her dress wet and a klutzy magician whose pesky magic balls end up (oops!) inside her bra or underwear. A Rosie the Riveter number is in the works.
Such is the state of culture today that burlesque is regarded as innocence embodied. When people talk about the reasons for the revival, they mention not only the movies "Moulin Rouge" and "Chicago" but also nostalgia, Norman Rockwell and picket fences.
"I consider myself pretty G-rated as far as a performer," Little Brooklyn says. She is big-boned, not in the euphemistic way but actually, and pretty, with a comic intelligence and a practical air. "I never feel like my body is the selling point of what I'm doing," she says. "But I do like putting it out there, a body that's not the norm." She reconsiders. "Actually, it is the norm."
If anything, burlesque has become a siren call to other women. Seasoned performers like World Famous Bob get frequent e-mail messages and calls from people who want advice getting started. The World Famous Pontani Sisters, a curvy trio who dance in handmade showgirl costumes, even teach a class. But the appeal of being sexy onstage has little to do with winning suitors. I ask Miss Dirty Martini if dancing is a good way to attract men, and she laughs: "Are you kidding? I'm the most intimidating thing they've ever seen.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 10-5-03; 
Back to the Future

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Nineteen seventy-seven. I remember it well. It was the year Son of Sam stalked the streets of New York before he was finally arrested. It was the year of the blackout, when looters rampaged in the face of an overwhelmed New York Police Department, its ranks depleted because of the city's budget cuts. And it was the year I moved to New York.
 I had seen an apartment -- one bedroom, $250 a month -- on 91st Street between First and Second Avenues, and I visited the block at 11 one night to see if it felt safe. It was late summer, maybe a month after the blackout, and two girls were chatting on a stoop -- an encouraging sign, I thought. They agreed that it was a fine place to live, no fear, no hassles. Just then, a taxi pulled up, and another girl emerged. "Did they get him?" asked one of her friends on the stoop. "Yes!" This girl, it turned out, had been mugged on the street, and her attacker had just been convicted. 
 That was the 70's for me. New York's brush with bankruptcy had already passed, but the larger sense of an urban crisis was everywhere. At the tabloid where I worked (the one that famously announced "SAM SLEEPS"), it was the Year of School Violence, with weekly articles about teachers assaulted in hallways. The force of chaos seemed to boil just an inch beneath the pavement. Think of "Taxi Driver," released in 1976. Travis Bickle, his head throbbing, drives his cab through the nightmare world of New York City, where 14-year-old hookers cruise the streets and dealers fence everything from automatic weapons to stolen Cadillacs. "This city here," he mutters furiously to himself, "is like an open sewer." Or think of Saul Bellow's Artur Sammler, followed back to his Upper West Side lobby by a resplendent black pickpocket who pins the old man down against a wall and brandishes before him the unanswerable might of his immense penis. And it wasn't just New York. New York served, as it often does, as the incarnation of a larger urban mood. Chicago and St. Louis and Cleveland and Detroit seemed to be sliding into the same pit. 
Yes, children, it was a low era and a very bad time to be around unless you happened to be rich. In recent months, we have had some nasty reminders of that time, including another blackout, another mayor announcing deep cuts in city services, growing unemployment and, of course, the deep background jitteriness that remains from 9/11. Significant numbers of both people and businesses are leaving the city, and a recent New York Times poll found that only 30 percent of city residents believed that New York would be a better place to live 10 or 15 years from now. Things fall apart; the center cannot hold. . . . 
Well, wait a minute. The center is holding. The blackout of '03 will be recalled as the time when people neither panicked nor looted, and not only in New York but also in Detroit, of all places. The fundamental problems of cities, which is to say the problems that come with entrenched poverty, have not been solved and, in fact, will not be solved by the cities themselves. But the sense of helplessness and doom that once hung over the old metropolises has lifted. And while a $6.4 billion deficit is a terribly grave problem that is bound to cause very real pain, an orderly city with a disorderly budget is immensely to be preferred to a chaotic city with a balanced budget. Orderliness is not success, but it is the precondition to success. 
I went back to 91st Street on another warm night last month. It was still pretty picturesque, at least by the standards of the Upper East Side. The old tenements, with their scrolled concrete stoops, still lined the block. An aging hippie sat on a stoop a few buildings away from the dump I once lived in. "How's the block?" I asked. "Yuppified," he said, an almost archaic term of derision. The evidence was everywhere. A knot of young people stood out in front of a pub on the corner with Second Avenue, talking about how great L.A. was. A vacant lot had been filled in with an apartment building, and an abandoned building had become the Playhouse 91. Another old veteran of the block laughed when I reminded him of the empties that people used to toss out the window to crash into the courtyard below. The only noise problem now, he said, came from the late-night parties staged by a bar on 92nd. If that was Yuppified, I'd take it.
Indeed, the central demographic fact of New York life since I moved here has been the tremendous influx of young people and immigrants, renewing, and even Yuppifying, abandoned neighborhoods with astonishing speed. The bourgeois bohemians, in David Brooks's pungent phrase, have turned areas that were no-go zones when I first came to New York into outposts of boutiquedom. And immigrants have revitalized the outer-borough regions from which the white ethnics who formed the city's old middle class fled. Asian and Hispanic immigrants are rapidly becoming New York's new middle class. 
It's remarkable how radically our sense of urban possibility has changed. In 1976, Roger Starr, the housing and development administrator, proposed a policy of "planned shrinkage" to encourage citizens to leave New York's most beleaguered neighborhoods. In the early 90's, Mayor David Dinkins made a point of how little of the city's budget he could control. Rudy Giuliani, by contrast, insisted that nothing was beyond reform: if New Yorkers would stop "defining deviancy down" -- a phrase he took from a speech by Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- they could restore the standards of safety New Yorkers had taken for granted until the 60's. And thanks to a combination of mayoral policies and a mighty flood of Wall Street profits, New York in the late 90's came to be seen for the first time in almost 40 years as the symbol of successful urbanism -- crime way down, welfare way down, tourism way up. 
In those last years of the millennium, New York got its swagger back: Giuliani rode high in the saddle, the Yankees won the World Series on cue and Wall Street brokers lined up to blow $400 on a bottle of Beychevelle at the fabulous Franco-Cuban fusion restaurant du jour. Times Square, that old emblem of urban pathology, became instead the epicenter of the new global city, with megastores and glam hotels and Disney and Viacom, Reuters and Morgan Stanley. And the mayor presided over the New Year's Eve ball drop as the toastmaster of the self-proclaimed greatest city on earth. If Martin Scorsese was the cinematic poet of New York in the 70's, then Neil LaBute, with his muscled-up champions in the Darwinian struggle for sex and money, pitiless with the confidence that a day of reckoning would never come, was the laureate of the Wall Street boom.
It takes a certain amount of amnesia to think that we are being cast back into the depths of the 70's, and yet the comparison crops up because we have been so abruptly dropped from the heights of the late 90's. Perhaps we were foolish enough to think that the good times would go on forever; of course, they never do. A lot of those Neil LaBute characters are out of jobs now. The securities industry lost 20 percent of its jobs between the end of 2000 and the end of 2002; overall, the city has lost 200,000 jobs, or 6.4 percent of its total, since the start of the national recession in March 2001 -- triple the pace of job loss nationally. The reverberations of 9/11 are continuing to harm the city's tourist industry. 
The boom era spawned a "global city" theory that, in various forms, rapidly became conventional academic wisdom. In her 1991 book, "The Global City," the scholar Saskia Sassen argued that cities like New York or London or Tokyo would serve as the "command posts" for a "spatially dispersed" but "globally integrated" economy. "Business services" required by giant businesses, like accounting, advertising and law, would continue to be concentrated in the global cities. At their uppermost levels, the argument went, corporations could no more dispense with urban density than artistscould. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be true. Major firms, and the high-end business services they depend on, have been leaving New York for less expensive, and less dense, suburban regions. Joel Kotkin, an author who has written widely on the future of cities, predicts that "the basic trend is going to continue to be declustering and decentralization." And of course 9/11 has profoundly changed the corporate calculus by making density seem perilous. The Center for an Urban Future report, of which Kotkin is a co-author, cites a real-estate analyst to the effect that "terrorism demolishes agglomeration economies."
What, then, are New York's prospects? The answer may well be, Not so hot. James Parrott, chief economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, argues that the "financial debacle" provoked by our most recent recession was much deeper than it was the last time around, in the late 80's and early 90's, and adds, "I think it's very unlikely that you'll see some sort of resurgence on Wall Street that will come close to what we saw in the 1990's." Few economists say that New York can become less dependent on the marketplace any time soon. 
It seems, then, that the bombastic moment, the moment of premier grand cru, is behind us. So is the moment of heroic suffering, when even Le Monde could write, "We are all New Yorkers." We have come back to earth, and it is very difficult from down here to make out the trajectory of our fate. Is New York's underlying dynamic basically positive or negative? The question really comes down to whether the city can not only attract but also keep all those bright, eager, ambitious people who flock here, despite the high taxes, the restrictive regulations, the sky-high real-estate prices, the poor schools, the deteriorating services. Kotkin, for example, argues that New York is in danger of becoming "a way station for immigrants, a temporary sojourn for the upwardly mobile and a permanent home for the profoundly neurotic." (An ex-New Yorker, Kotkin has apparently spent so much time in California that he uses "profoundly neurotic" as a term of abuse.)
It may turn out that filling the budget gap, which Mayor Michael Bloomberg has done so effectively, is the easy part. The hard part will be countering the centripetal forces pulling people and capital out of the city. New Yorkers can't imagine why anybody would leave; every place else is Dullsboro, as the columnist Franklin P. Adams used to call the hinterland. But the fact is that you can get a good cappuccino practically everywhere nowadays, and even pretty good theater. What's so inevitable about New York?
Maybe the real danger is not that the city will fall back into the old chaos, but that it will lose its grip on the world's imagination -- not that Times Square will become dangerous but that it will become boring. Perhaps what New York needs is not more corporate headquarters but more theater, more cafes, more bookshops. Let the bankers leave for Stamford; we'll make do with the radio-car drivers, the bartenders and the graphic designers.

 WAR AGAINST THE WEAK
Eugenics and America's Campaign
to Create a Master Race.
By Edwin Black.
Illustrated. 550 pp. New York:
Four Walls Eight Windows. $27.
 EUGENICS -- the idea of manipulating human genes to the end of improving individuals, groups or entire populations -- is strongly associated with the Nazi programs of sterilization, euthanasia and genocide. But during the first third of the 20th century, eugenics movements flourished in many nations, including the United States. In the last few years, newspaper articles have called attention to -- and prompted official apologies for -- state-mandated sterilizations done legally to rid society of its alleged human trash, the "weak" in the title of Edwin Black's new book, notably in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon and California. 
Black is the author previously of "IBM and the Holocaust," a work strongly suggesting that the company, with its punch-card machines, knowingly assisted Hitler's brutalities. His "War Against the Weak," apparently written with similar intent, is a muckraking book about a subject incontestably awash in muck. In the vein of the genre, it is a stew rich in facts and spiced with half-truths, exaggerations and distortions. The most pungent ingredient is its central thesis: eugenic doctrines and policies favoring "Nordic superiority" were in fact invented in the United States, were developed in alliance with American wealth and power, and were then exported, inspiring Hitler and achieving their ultimate realization in the Holocaust. 
Black pursues his thesis across largely familiar ground -- the eugenic theories that attributed costly physical conditions and socially deleterious behaviors to genetics, accounting for many of them as expressions of "feeble-mindedness"; the claims in the United States that such deficiencies occurred with particularly high frequency among African-Americans and immigrants from eastern and southern Europe; the respectable standing of eugenic science at leading universities, state agencies and institutions, public interest organizations and research installations, notably the Eugenics Record Office, which was part of what became the department of genetics at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and which was financed in the main by the widow of the railroad magnate E. H. Harriman and in part by grants from the Rockefeller philanthropies. Black rightly observes that eugenic research into heredity combined "equal portions of gossip, race prejudice, sloppy methods and leaps of logic, all caulked together by elements of actual genetic knowledge to create the glitter of a genuine science."
The eugenics movement provided a biological rationale for the Immigration Act of 1924, which discriminated against immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, and for laws in a number of states that restricted interracial marriage. It scored a major victory with the case of Buck v. Bell in 1927, in which the United States Supreme Court, by a vote of 8 to 1, upheld the constitutionality of Virginia's eugenic sterilization law, with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. writing for the majority that the principle that upheld vaccination for the good of the community's physical health could sustain cutting the fallopian tubes for the benefit of its social health. 
Black has used the considerable work on eugenics, assiduously checking sources, including my own, and drawn on original published and archival materials in the United States and Europe, collecting some 50,000 documents, he tells us, with the aid of numerous volunteers working in several dozen repositories. If he covers what is in the main a well-known story, he adds to it substantial new detail, much of it chilling in its exposure of the shameless racism, class prejudice and cruelties of eugenic attitudes and practices in the United States. Some American eugenicists argued for killing the "unfit," and a few indeed practiced it by subjecting newborns to euthanasia (not a merciful death for those in pain, Black points out, but a painless death for those "deemed unworthy of life"). 
In support of his main thesis, Black stresses that European eugenicists were linked with their American counterparts through international organizations, meetings, correspondence and visits several made to the United States, some to work at the Eugenics Record Office. German eugenicists praised American policies, research and writings and incorporated accounts of them into their works. In "Mein Kampf," Hitler himself praised America's sterilization laws and immigration restriction act. Black also emphasizes that beginning in the 20's and continuing well into the Nazi period, the Rockefeller Foundation provided sizable funds for research at three eugenically oriented research institutes in Germany. All, he writes, would "make their mark in the history of medical murder."
True enough, eugenic actions were pioneered in the United States, and a number of American eugenicists praised the Nazi sterilization law, noting it was devoid of racial intent and robustly consistent with Buck v. Bell. But it greatly oversimplifies matters to say that the American example pointed Nazi Germany down the road to the Holocaust. Many American eugenicists opposed the Nazis outright, and even the most avid enthusiasts of sterilization turned against them after the proclamation of the Nuremberg Laws. Black basically argues that because the mad beast had some American markings, its chief features must have all been bred in the United States. But as he himself acknowledges, the nations of Europe had their own, indigenous eugenics movements. Notions of Nordic superiority had strong, independent roots abroad, and so did ideas of racial improvement through measures like sterilization. The Nazis did draw on American precedents, but Black neglects to weigh the impact of the imports against the force of native impulses. 
Black writes that in the 30's refugees were denied entry to the United States "because of the Carnegie Institution's openly racist anti-immigrant activism," ignoring the far more powerful forces, including anti-Semitism and economic fears, that kept the gates closed. While some Rockefeller Foundation money did go, at least indirectly, to some anti-Semitic scientists and racially oriented research in Nazi Germany, the foundation increasingly aimed at supporting individuals engaged in objective investigations of the genetics of nonhuman organisms as well as of human beings, part of a broad trend then beginning elsewhere in Europe and in the United States to liberate human genetics from socially prejudicial eugenics. Black deals with these efforts dismissively, writing that the Rockefeller Foundation, for instance, remained committed to the goal of "creating a superior race." 
More important, the fundamental dynamics of the eugenics movement are only partly illuminated by compilations of its cruelties, its philanthropic patronage and its institutional footholds. Eugenics was an insidious doctrine, unabashed in its aim of deploying up-to-date science to solve social problems, even if that meant writing the ostensible dregs of society out of the American social compact. It nevertheless attracted many adherents among the white middle class, not only conservatives but also a number of disparate progressives, including, for example, Theodore Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger and Rabbi Stephen Wise. Despite its imperfections, Black's book does prompt us to wonder what in medical genetics and biotechnology we are taking socially and morally for granted today that our descendants might indict us for tomorrow.

 THE DISCOVERY
OF GLOBAL WARMING
By Spencer R. Weart.
228 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $24.95.
 EUREKA moments are rare in science. Achievements like thededuction of DNA's structure etch our imagination precisely because they are exceptional. In most fields, research is more akin to climbing a mist-shrouded mountain of unknown dimensions. Climate science, perhaps above all, has been a perpetual ascent toward understanding. A major achievement so far is a broad consensus that beginning in the industrial era humans, by burning ancient buried stores of carbon-rich coal and oil, have liberated billions of tons of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, warming earth.
Debate persists over the extent of human-driven warming and what to do about it. But recognition that in a short span our species has nudged the thermostat of a planet remains a momentous, and sobering, finding.
"The Discovery of Global Warming" describes the intellectual journey toward that conclusion, with all of its false starts, flawed hypotheses, inventiveness and persistent uncertainties. It reveals the effort as one of the great exercises in collective sleuthing, with pivotal insights provided by experts in fields as varied as glaciology, physics and even plankton paleontology. Charting the evolution and confirmation of the theory, Spencer R. Weart, director of the Center for the History of Physics of the American Institute of Physics, dissects the interwoven threads of research and reveals the political and societal subtexts that colored scientists' views and the public reception their work received.
In many instances, he writes, researchers were pursuing knowledge for other purposes and only later were their data used to determine if humans had influenced the climate. He notes that much of the oceanographic and polar research that eventually helped point to human-driven warming was paid for by the United States Navy and other government agencies that were eager to exert American hegemony during the cold war.
The narrative starts with the 150-year-old notion that some trace gases are transparent to sunlight but opaque to infrared radiation, the radiant energy that pulses from a sun-warmed sidewalk long after dusk. This insulating property of the atmosphere prevents the planet from turning into an iceball. Weart uses excerpts from pivotal papers to let us glimpse the thinking of climatology's pioneers. Thus, in 1862, John Tyndall, a British researcher, wrote about infrared radiation, "As a dam built across a river causes a local deepening of the stream, so our atmosphere, thrown as a barrier across the terrestrial rays, produces a local heightening of the temperature at the earth's surface."
As the Industrial Revolution accelerated, scientists soon figured out that emissions of heat-trapping gases from burning coal and other fossil fuels might intensify that natural "greenhouse effect." Chief among these gases was carbon dioxide. One omission from Weart's book is a prescient phrase written in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius, a pioneering Swedish chemist: "We are evaporating our coal mines into the air."
Still, the human contribution to climate was presumed to be far outweighed by the great cycles of ice ages revealed in fossil and geological records. The puzzle of those cycles remained the prime quarry of Arrhenius and others and has still not been completely solved.
A warm period in the 1930's brought the first specific predictions that humans could alter the climate, but then things cooled down for a few decades and the possibility of a human influence remained a fringe notion. (Later, Weart explains, it was shown that the temporary cooling could also have been caused by humans -- through the release of vast sun-reflecting plumes of sulfates and other tiny pollution particles in the industrial boom after World War II: one human emission was canceling out another until clean-air laws began removing the cooling veil.)
Weart next focuses on the great burst of geophysical research starting in the 1950's, when data started showing for the first time that humans were indeed changing the atmosphere. He describes how individual scientific obsessions, like Charles David Keeling's preoccupation with creating a precise record of carbon dioxide concentrations, produced vital puzzle pieces.
Increasingly, scientists working in the field began to express unease. In a 1957 paper noting that the oceans could not act as a perpetual sponge for carbon dioxide, Roger Revelle, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography near San Diego, summed things up: "Human beings are now carrying out a large- scale geophysical experiment." Other experts noted an unnerving aspect of the situation: the experimenters were inside their test tube. According to Weart, however, all that had been proved then was "the possibility of global warming." It took another 40 years of data gathering, computer simulations and debate before an international panel of climate experts concluded in 2001 that "most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations."
He describes how the battle between environmental groups and industries dependent on coal and oil intensified steadily as climate science became more conclusive. But that science, he emphasizes, will never offer a perfect forecast; the atmosphere, with complex links to the sun and oceans, will long remain a source of surprises. In fact, climate science will probably remain easily misconstrued by alarmists of all stripes -- both environmentalists eager to stoke public fears and antiregulatory activists and politicians fearful of any impediment to unbridled enterprise.
"The Discovery of Global Warming" does cut through much of the persistent hype surrounding the issue. Weart has also set up a Web site, www.aip.org/history/climate, that adds many layers of detail to the scientific chronology.
In a short final chapter called "Reflections," Weart offers his personal ideas on the best course of action to limit risks from warming while avoiding big economic disruptions. But he leaves a deeper discussion of the politics of global warming to others, sticking with his strengths as a historian. 
He warns that society should not expect science to answer the biggest question of all: how much should be invested now either to curb emissions or gird for change. Like a flickering compass needle, science offers a trajectory toward truth, but not a recipe for dealing with it.

 QUICKSILVER
Volume One of the Baroque Cycle.
By Neal Stephenson.
927 pp. New York:
William Morrow. $27.95.
 "I LOVE reading novels," Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz exclaims in Neal Stephenson's new novel. "You can understand them without thinking too much." Would Leibniz change his tune if he had to read "Quicksilver," rather than act as a character in it? To the co-inventor of the calculus (or co-discoverer, if you take a more Platonic view), making sense of 927 pages of fictional complexity devised by a single mischievous intelligence should be child's play. But ordinary readers may find themselves longing -- as I did -- for a hypertext version, with clickable links to characters' earlier appearances, family trees, timelines, bibliographies and mathematical diagrams.
The dizzying effects of too much information are nothing new to aficionados of cyberpunk, the variety of science fiction closely identified with Stephenson (and vice versa). Its practitioners like to throw their readers headlong into a dense, distracting future that makes Times Square look like a cloister. In their worlds it's impossible to know where bodies end and brains begin, or where brains end and computers begin. In Stephenson's "Snow Crash," for example, a computer virus leaps the species boundary between silicon and flesh, infecting people. In "The Diamond Age," a powerful artificial intelligence designed to program leaders falls into the hands of a girl from the wrong side of the modem.
But "Quicksilver" isn't cyberpunk. Of course, it could turn out to be the daydream of a massively parallel, artificially intelligent supercomputer, or a complex formula used to encrypt a complex formula used to encrypt a complex formula used to encrypt itself, or something. I wouldn't put that sort of thing past Stephenson, and "Quicksilver" is just the first book in a projected trilogy; the night is still young. But barring any future tricky stuff, a better term for its genre would be history-of-science fiction. In "Quicksilver," far from inventing a future, Stephenson borrows his setting from the past, the late 17th and early 18th centuries in Europe and Northeastern America.
Stephenson isn't the first writer in the genre to visit the past, of course. H. G. Wells's "Time Machine" traveled backward as well as forward, and in their novel "The Difference Engine," the cyberpunk giants William Gibson and Bruce Sterling imagined what the 19th century would have been like if the computer had been invented before electricity. Stephenson himself looked backward through time in his previous novel, "Cryptonomicon," which takes place partly during World War II and features the pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing as a character. But unlike "The Time Machine" and "The Difference Engine" -- and "Snow Crash" and "The Diamond Age" -- Quicksilver" does not rely on fictional technology to drive its story. Instead, it feeds its engine with philosophy, court intrigue, economics, and the wars, plagues and natural disasters of the era. In many ways, Stephenson's new novel has more in common with the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett than the science fiction of Gibson or Sterling.
The book opens in 1713 in Boston, where a spooky European named Enoch Root has gone to find Daniel Waterhouse, the only man alive who might be able to reconcile Leibniz and his rival, Isaac Newton. "Cryptonomicon" readers will find all those names familiar, not just the last two: "Quicksilver" serves as a prequel to the earlier novel, with the same families interacting in both books. A useful feature of that longed-for hypertext version would be a "Cryptonomicon" crib, linking the new characters to their counterparts in the older book. (And don't call it cheating -- you use a calculator to do your taxes, don't you?)
Book 1 of "Quicksilver" narrates Daniel's early days in England as the son of a prominent Puritan during and after the Cromwell period. Daniel is a scientist, a member of the newly formed Royal Society, a university buddy of Isaac Newton's and a protege of the ecclesiast and philosopher John Wilkins -- the man who wrote a book called the "Cryptonomicon," which functions as principal McGuffin in the novel of the same name. Young Daniel has the dubious luck to live through the plague year of 1665-66 and to see his childhood home burn in the Great Fire of London. He's a man torn apart in a time of dualities, which Stephenson takes as his themes for this section of the book: reason versus faith, freedom versus destiny, matter versus math. Another theme, of course, is the cyberpunk's delight -- information and how it moves through minds like a fire, or a plague, or quicksilver.
Book 2 drops Daniel and moves ahead a decade or two to take up the story of a con artist named Jack Shaftoe and Eliza, the woman he loves. Jack starts his childhood as a Dickensian mudlark, then moves up in the world when he finds he can earn a good living from the families of men condemned to hang, yanking on the prisoners' legs during their executions so that they die more quickly. As an adult he becomes a soldier, choosing his battles according to his prospects for loot. At the siege of Vienna -- where a coalition of European Christians is fighting to defend the city against the Turks -- he captures an ostrich and a virgin concubine, Eliza. (Kidnapped by pirates as a little girl from her home on the fictional island of Qwghlm, off the coast of Scotland, Eliza wound up in the harem of a vizier too busy to deflower her.) The quest to sell the ostrich's plumes takes the pair to the great cultural and mercantile centers of Europe -- Paris, Versailles, Amsterdam, Leipzig -- where Eliza develops her genius for economics and political intrigue. Book 3 combines the two threads of the story, bringing Daniel's concerns and Eliza's together.
Stephenson clearly did a great deal of research for this book, and he seems reluctant to let a crumb of it go to waste. Everyone who's anyone in late-17th-century or early-18th-century Europe and North America shows up in the story: the list includes Newton and Leibniz, of course, but also John Locke, Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, Christiaan Huygens, Blackbeard, a raft of royalty and even the 7-year-old Ben Franklin (who talks like a man in his 40's). Stephenson bundles much of his research into conversations, packing his characters' mouths with favorite details, such as the derivation of the words "guinea," "dollar" and "sabotage." Much of the dialogue is painfully clunky. His characters tend to inform one another of facts they probably already knew but readers don't, and every few pages somebody spouts a philosophical treatise.
Given the apparent depth of Stephenson's research, it seems clear that the anachronisms with which he seeds the novel are deliberate. Some are playful, as when a guard throws Daniel a letter with the words, "You've got mail," or when the 17th-century Venetians succumb to "Canal Rage": "They insist that gondoliers never used to scream at each other in this way. To them it is a symptom of the excessively rapid pace of change in the modern world, and they make an analogy to poisoning by quicksilver, which has turned so many alchemists into shaky, irritable lunatics."
Other anachronisms are more consequential. For example, Leibniz has invented a digital computer, with the ultimate goal of translating "all human knowledge into a new philosophical language, consisting of numbers. To write it down in a vast Encyclopedia that will be a sort of machine, not only for finding old knowledge but for making new, by carrying out certain logical operations on those numbers -- and to employ all of this in a great project of bringing religious conflict to an end, and raising Vagabonds up out of squalor and liberating their potential energy -- whatever that means." 
Stephenson clearly never intended "Quicksilver" to be one of those meticulously accurate historical novels that capture ways of thought of times gone by. Instead, it explores the philosophical concerns of today -- or at least, the philosophical concerns of Stephenson. At its best, the novel does this through thrillingly clever, suspenseful and amusing plot twists. My favorite example is a section toward the end, when Eliza travels east on a spying mission and writes letters to one ambiguous ally in a many-layered code, knowing they will be intercepted and partly decoded by an ambiguous enemy, then further decoded by someone else.
But the novel is so swollen and overloaded that these delightful Stephensonian offerings are hard to follow -- and even hard to identify. And "Quicksilver" suffers from a problem common in parts of trilogies: it feels unresolved. Will it turn out to be the first third of a carefully constructed meta-novel, or a messy chunk of a bigger mess? Is it complex, or merely random? Only the next couple of thousand pages will say for sure.

 WILLIAM McKINLEY
By Kevin Phillips.
Times Books/Holt, $20.
 Focusing on the last election of the 19th century, Kevin Phillips offers a vigorous reassessment of the neglected 25th president, William McKinley. Phillips portrays a "surprisingly modern McKinley" who honored Booker T. Washington and competently directed the Spanish-American War by cable and telephone; "the egalitarian who ran with the Grangers and promoted women's rights, the 'people's candidate' who beat the Eastern bosses, the man who wouldn't have a lobbyist in his cabinet, the cautious reformer who was on the verge of leading a fight to curb the trusts, reform the tariff system and reenact a progressive income tax." Phillips, whose books include "The Emerging Republican Majority," persuasively argues that McKinley quietly masterminded three epochal shifts in American politics: a domestic sea change in which a Protestant establishment welcomed churchgoing immigrants and embraced labor, creating a long-lived Republican coalition; an economic initiative that favored the global gold standard while shielding local industries and high industrial wages behind a protective tariff; and an international realignment that allied the United States with Britain and entangled the country in its first Asian wars. Phillips maintains that McKinley's personal role was crucial; only a campaigner who knew the Midwestern middle ground could have beaten William Jennings Bryan, and only a statesman of vision would have packed his administration with future Nobel laureates and chosen for his running mate the volatile Theodore Roosevelt.+Rather than a narrative of McKinley's life, this is a study of his strategies and successes, a subtle and relevant political parable.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
Greater Environmental Awareness on Golf Courses

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND'S newest golf courses are following practices of decades ago and creating layouts that require less irrigation and chemicals than the extensively manicured and heavily fertilized courses that players have come to expect in recent years, according to professionals in the business.
 The change is happening nationwide, they say, but it is especially pronounced on Long Island because of the need to protect the critical underground water supply and fragile environment. 
 "There has been a trend in the golf industry, since the mid-90's, to go from standard parklike courses with tree-lined fairways to the links style, which is more wide open, similar to the old Scottish golf courses," said Ray Holohan, the president of the New York State Golf Course Owners Association, a nonprofit trade group. "On Long Island it is even more so because the courses are being built on wide open properties of farmland that is over our groundwater."
There are 130 golf courses on Long Island, said Mr. Holohan, who is an owner of the 40-year-old Middle Island Country Club, a public 18-hole course in Middle Island. Since 1992, 12 new public courses and eight private courses have opened in Suffolk County, and more are under construction. 
The environmental consultant Jeffrey Seeman, owner of Coastal Environmental in East Quogue, said that to ensure town approval, golf course developers are incorporating environmental components suggested by conservation groups like Audubon International, a nonprofit group based in Selkirk, N.Y., which is affiliated with the Audubon Society of New York State. The group offers guidelines and services to help new developments protect natural resources. New Long Island golf courses that are using Audubon plans include the public North Hempstead Harbor Links and private Golf at the Bridge in Bridgehampton. 
The Audubon plan "is an holistic approach," Mr. Seeman said. "It protects the environment" and "economically you could reduce the operational costs by 30 percent if you reduce the chemical requirements."
Mr. Seeman, who has been the consultant for six Long Island golf courses, said the plans' components include "no-mow zones" in wetland areas. Instead of mowing the grass right up to the banks of a pond, for example, an area is left natural within a six-foot-wide perimeter. This zone acts as a sponge and absorbs chemicals that might have run off into the water. 
Another segment features a $30,000 concrete area, where maintenance equipment is washed and chemical runoff is collected in a small drain and is treated. 
"The newer courses are taking these considerations into the design," Mr. Seeman said. "They are making a natural landscape but with a scientific purpose." 
An important area of a golf course is the out-of-play areas, like the woods and the high rough, he said. "If it is more environmentally friendly, this area can combine wildlife habitat and reduce the amount of turf chemicals and irrigation required," he said. "This involves putting in mixes of fine fescue and wildflowers that don't require a lot of nutrients, have good drainage and are good nesting areas for songbirds."
An irrigation system would be designed that could be turned off in those areas once they are established. Then only the greens and fairways would be irrigated, "not the old wall-to-wall way that was done not too long ago, or with those older clubs that have not really begun to make the changes," said Mr. Seeman. "This is the old style: build it in the land that was there," he added. 
MR. SEEMAN planned the program for Old Vines Golf Club, which is being constructed on 125 acres of a former farm off Reeves Avenue in Riverhead. Town approval for the development was based on its using the Audubon plan, Mr. Seeman said. 
The development, which includes 75 housing units, will have an 18-hole private golf course. A working vineyard will be created as a satellite operation of a Cutchogue vineyard on approximately four acres at the entrance to the club, according to Bruce Barnet, a principal.
While not all builders use a full Audubon program, they are more conscious of the environment and are taking measures to preserve the groundwater, said Rick Jurgens, an owner of the 38-year-old Spring Lake Golf Course, a 27-hole public course in Middle Island. "There is a trend toward using organic fertilizers that are free of pesticides," he said. "In the long run, being organic is cheaper as well as healthier." 
Two 18-hole public courses in Riverhead -- the Woods at Cherry Creek, which opened last year, and Cherry Creek Golf Links, which opened in 1996 -- are being managed with environmental programs, according to Vincent Sasso, the owner with Charles Jurgens, of both courses. 
"We had to be careful," Mr. Sasso said. "We were only permitted by the town to take down a certain number of trees and when we created wetlands, we had to add the particular plants that grow in them. We are on an organic program, with mostly organic fertilizers and a little spray in the woods. It's hard to be organic at first, it takes a while to build up. We are about 50 percent organic now," he said.
Cherry trees line a part of the road leading to the clubhouse at Cherry Creek Golf Links, which was built on 166 acres of open land that had been potato and sod farms. 
The Woods at Cherry Creek, which has a 4,500-square-foot $1 million clubhouse with an upscale restaurant, is across the road on 140 acres that is 80 percent woodland. It was designed by the Riverhead surveyors Young & Young. 
Rates at both courses are $35 for 18 holes on weekdays and $60 on the weekends, according to Peter Quaresima, the general manager. 
A short distance east, on Main Road in Laurel, the $40 million Laurel Links Country Club, an 18-hole private club on 226 acres, also opened last year. The developer, David J. Saland, said that he went directly to the North Fork Environmental Council, a nonprofit environmental group, and asked for support before going to Riverhead's planning board for permits.
"I had learned my lesson," he said, explaining that a project he had proposed back in the 1980's for 80 homes on a 160-acre property in Aquebogue was defeated when the environmental group won a fight to protect the property, which had a kettle hole -- a hollow formed by a melting glacier.
LAUREL LINKS, which includes 29 building lots, was approved with restrictions, he said. The number of house lots, covering about an acre each, was reduced to 29 from 60, and of the total property only 50 acres could be used for the golf course. The rest is fescue and 40 acres of woodland, "for the wildlife," he said. 
Mr. Saland added: "There were many concerns about chemicals and how much of the woods we would use. We put four test wells on the property to monitor the underground water. We use as much organic as possible right now, but occasionally we have to treat the turf when necessary. If you get a fungus, you could lose a green in 48 hours if you don't."
Kelly Blake Moran, a golf course architect from Reading, Pa., who builds courses throughout North and South America, designed the Laurel Links course.
Currently, 13 houses are under construction and four of the remaining lots are on the market for $440,000 each. The 3,000- to 5,000-square-foot New England-style houses are priced at $1.2 million to $1.6 million, said Mr. Saland, who owns Saland Real Estate in Jamesport. 
A 14,000-square-foot, wood-shingled clubhouse is under construction and is expected to be completed by spring. There will be a restaurant, Olympic-sized outdoor pool and two tennis courts.
The golf course, which is private, has two types of membership plans. There are 325 full family memberships, under which pay a $90,000 initiation fee, of which $70,000 is a bond that will be returned when they leave. "I needed their money to buy the land," Mr. Saland said. 
Those members also pay an annual $6,000 family fee that entitles them unlimited use of the golf course and all club facilities.
With another plan, called a house membership, members pay a nonrefundable $20,000 initiation fee and have full use of the clubhouse, pool and tennis courts but limited golf privileges.

Saving Private Lynch From Misinformation

 BODY:
IN November, NBC will broadcast "Saving Jessica Lynch," a made-for-TV movie about one of the best-known episodes in the war in Iraq. Private Lynch, who signed a $1 million book deal with Alfred A. Knopf and promised her first interview to Diane Sawyer (both of which will also appear in November), did not participate in the making of this film. Instead, it is based on the recollections of Mohammed Odeh Al- Rehaief, the Iraqi lawyer who tipped off American soldiers to Private Lynch's whereabouts. Starting with the 507th maintenance company's ambush in Nasiriyah, the movie follows Private Lynch's capture by Iraqi forces, her removal to Saddam Hussein General Hospital, her rescue by a Special Operations unit known as Task Force 20, and her return home to a hero's welcome.
 When it happened, Private Lynch's rescue seemed like the one thing all Americans, no mattertheir politics, could agree on: a shining example of 21st-century military precision that went off without a hitch. In the intervening months, however, questions have arisen as to how she was wounded, whether she shot her assailants, why a unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction was diverted for her rescue, and why the incident was filmed by a cameraman working for the Department of Defense, among other issues. 
 The New York Times recently obtained a copy of the teleplay's eighth draft (one of the drafts used for shooting). An account from its author, John Fasano, appears at left; an analysis of some of its finer points appears in the chart on the right.
 Last month Steve Young, a Los Angeles-based writer, spoke to John Fasano about what he went through while writing the screenplay of "Saving Jessica Lynch." Here are excerpts from Mr. Fasano's remarks.
 WHEN I started "Saving Jessica Lynch," I got ahold of every article that had been written about her. Then I had NBC send me every transcript of everything said about Lynch on the wire services. At that point we didn't have rights to anybody. I was entirely going off news reports. 
 The Washington Post was reporting the Rambo version. It was all about how she emptied her rifle, emptied her handgun, went for her survival knife, stabbed three more guys, and then they brutalized her. And a week later, against all odds, we rescued her. The first draft of my script was based on the Washington Post story. It was about as accurate as I was right for my first full-length film job.
At first everyone was after Lynch to get her rights, which weren't even allowed to be sold until she was out of the Army. Once we realized that she couldn't sell the rights we went and got the rights of Mohammed al-Rehaief, the Iraqi lawyer who saw Lynch in the hospital. He saw her being slapped by an Iraqi colonel and went out into the desert until he ran into some Marines. Remember, this is Mohammed's version. I interviewed him in person.
Why would he do what he did? When I heard that Mohammed's wife and daughter were now in the States with him, I started to get it. That's what this movie became about for me -- an Iraqi civilian risked his life to save an American because he had a daughter and when he saw this young woman in the hospital, he had to save her. If I couldn't find the thing that humanized the story and made it apolitical, I wouldn't have taken the job. I have to write a film where the character works for me dramatically, regardless of whether he was telling the truth.
It's also the story of a girl who, because the economy is so bad, can't even get a part-time job at Walmart when she graduates from high school. So she joins the Army, believing she's selected a military occupation that will protect her: supply clerk.
I wrote the first draft of "Jessica" in 10 days and got it to the NBC entertainment president Jeff Zucker and the producer Jeff Gaspin. Gaspin's notes said to start with the ambush and flash back to how she joined the army. The film became more about her being rescued and less about how she joined the Army.
I had to give the network attorneys the information in every scene as to what exact magazine, what exact article, what page I got the content from. That went to the legal department with a photocopy of the articles. They then would double- and triple-check what version could be O.K. to use. In actuality, I was never influenced by anybody in terms of the truth, because the truth, as we knew it, changed every day. For the first three months I was handing in a rewrite every two days. An article would come out and the network and the legal department would have me rewrite it based on the new truth.
With "Jessica," when we had to go to the Department of Defense to ask if it would be O.K. if we could rent some of their tanks, the generals at Centcom, where they ran the war in Iraq, took a look at the script. The only notes they gave us were on military protocol; saluting or how a soldier would refer to a first sergeant. They just didn't want it to be inaccurate in terms of propriety.
There was an article that said that this was just going to be a press release for the Army. Would the Army send out a press release saying it sends out its people with inadequate maps and dysfunctional G.P.S. machines into a sand storm, and they end up driving on the wrong road right through the middle of an occupied city? And this was a maintenance company that was supposed to show up after the battle and give everyone coffee. At the end of the day, if this ends up being about the Army, it's pretty much about an enormous Army screw-up.
Will this be the truth? Well, the ambush is as depicted by the report put out by the Department of Defense and interviews with the actual survivors, which is not favorable to the Army. So, maybe it's the truth. The part about Mohammed and what he did was told to me by Mohammed. I believe there may be a certain amount of him wanting to make himself sound more heroic than he was, but I've toned down his own story. It's more a sense of someone who placed humanity over his race or country.
We're shooting the movie now, but if we got the rights to Jessica's story today, there are things that I could still change. Her book may come out and contradict everything in this film. I can only say that at this point, this is the closest to the truth we can get.
If there is one point I want to make to viewers, I want to make it very clear: Please . . . don't shoot the messenger.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 5, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, excerpts on Page 26 of Arts & Leisure today from an interview with John Fasano, the writer of the television movie "Saving Jessica Lynch," misstate the position of Jeff Gaspin, an executive who read the first draft of the script. He is executive vice president for alternative series, longform and program strategy at NBC Entertainment; he is not a producer of the film.

Idyllic Zanzibar Languishes Unvisited

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: ZANZIBAR, Tanzania 

 BODY:
EVEN the name has a certain magic: Zanzibar, an island of idyllic palm-fringed beaches and architectural wonders set at the cultural intersection of Africa and the Arab world.
 For years Zanzibar has been promoted as the next great travel destination in the developing world, waiting to take its place as Africa's answer to Bali or Patagonia, capable of luring adventurers and luxury travelers alike. But to the dismay of Zanzibar's political and business leaders, the wait is likely to continue indefinitely. 
 The tourism industry of this lush Indian Ocean island has been devastated over the last year, first by terrorist attacks last November in neighboring Kenya that were blamed on Al Qaeda, then by a series of alerts issued this spring by the United States, Britain and other Western nations about terrorist threats in Tanzania and the rest of East Africa. 
While this reporter and his Western friends recently found the island to be tranquil, the latest State Department advisory on Tanzania, issued on Aug. 28, warns of special safety threats in Zanzibar, which has a conservative Muslim society and where Al Qaeda is believed to have supporters, if not full-fledged members. "Travelers should maintain a high level of security vigilance at all times," the advisory says.
Government figures show that foreign visits to the island peaked in 2000, with 97,200 arrivals, mostly Europeans. The number dropped to 76,300 in 2001, climbing back to 87,500 last year. This year, tourism revenue may fall by nearly 30 percent from last year, according to the local government tourist office, representing the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars each month for the island's hotels and restaurants, as well as jobs.
The economy was already in trouble because of a global decline in the price of cloves, the main export of this 640-square-mile island; tourism is its No. 2 industry.
Emerson D. Skeens, the American proprietor of the Emerson and Green Hotel here, undoubtedly one of the most romantic and eccentric hotels in Africa, sees Zanzibar as a special haven. "It's not like other tourist destinations, where the people are friendly because they want to see your money," he said. "Here, it's genuine warmth and a genuine welcome. " 
Mr. Skeens, a choreographer by training, and an American partner, Thomas Green, have converted a former Swahili Empire mansion into a 10-room hotel, each of the antiques-packed rooms with its own name and distinct atmosphere. The rooftop South Room, for example, is reached by a small wooden bridge, with a garden veranda separating the bedroom from a bathroom that is partly open to the skies. Rooms are priced at $150 a night, which includes tax. 
The mansion, the home of one of the powerful Arab merchants who controlled the island's economy in the 19th century, has special significance in African history. After the British abolished slavery in Zanzibar in 1883 and agreed to pay off slave owners, the British colonial authorities used the mansion as a staging point for the transactions -- and for freeing the slaves.
The Emerson and Green has continued to thrive, thanks largely to American and European honeymooners who packed the hotel this summer.
But down the street at the waterfront Zanzibar Serena Inn -- the other luxury hotel in Stone Town, the island's historic center -- the lobby and restaurants have been largely empty of foreign visitors for weeks at a time. "It's terrible that people are staying away from this beautiful place," a front-desk receptionist said. "I don't think there are terrorists here. There are no terrorists, and there are no tourists."
While the signs of a strict, devout Muslim society are everywhere, including veiled women and mosques every few blocks, residents say they take pride in the island's history as a meeting place of cultures. Street crime against foreign visitors is almost unheard of. 
Yet the terrorist alerts issued half a world away in Washington and London are keeping thousands of visitors away and threatening to do lasting damage to the island's economy. "Everybody is broke," said Mr. Skeens, the transplanted American hotelier. "This whole society has been devastated."

HEADLINE: On Sakhalin, the Cold War Is Ending 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE is a correspondent in the Tokyo bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
EVERY year, about 50 million Japanese tourists visit Hokkaido, Japan's northern playground of skiing and wildlife watching. Last year, just 5,000 ventured one island north on the geological chain, to Sakhalin.
 Only 25 miles across La Perouse strait from Japan, Sakhalin has long loomed as a scary place, slumbering out of sight across the northern horizon. Anton Chekhov visited Czarist penal camps here in 1890 and pronounced the island "a hell." Twenty years ago on Sept. 1, a Soviet fighter pilot took off from Sakhalin and shot down KAL 007, killing all 269 passengers aboard the South Korean commercial jet. 
But now, this long-closed island, the size of Maine but with less than half Maine's population, is opening up. Three of the world's largest oil companies, Shell, BP and ExxonMobil are investing billions of dollars, making Sakhalin the largest target for foreign investment in Russia's history. 
 Old control habits die hard though, as in April local conservatives imposed an internal travel permit system for foreigners and Russians from the mainland. But last summer's flood of foreign workers forced authorities to drop the system, in effect opening up Sakhalin for tourism.
 Tourism pioneers will most likely fly to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the capital, from Sapporo, Japan, on the 90-minute prop-plane flights of Sakhalin Aviastrassy. Known as SAT, the island airline is vastly improved from the old days. Competing against Asiana for the lucrative Seoul route, SAT stewardesses all seem to be graduates of the New Russian smile school. Although there is talk of flights from Houston and Anchorage for the summer of 2004, alternatives are three-hour flights from Seoul or a nine-hour flight from Moscow.
 On an island that is 85 percent covered with taiga forest of fir and birch, hiking and bear watching are summer activities, best done with guides. With the oil up north and the mountains and the capital down south, there is little clash between industry and outdoor recreation. Sakhalin is surrounded by some of Russia's richest fishing grounds and the island itself is cut by as many as 60,000 rivers and streams. This means excellent salmon fishing by day and good seafood eating by night in the capital's rapidly improving restaurants.
 Unlike western Russia's big cities and Japan's megacities, the outdoors is as close in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk as the bus route that stops in front of the municipal ski area, Gorni Vozdukh, or Mountain Air. As in much of the Russian Far East, life here at the end of the line, is generally slightly funky, slightly charming.
 "The T-bar costs 50 cents a ride, but if you give the guy beer and cigarettes, you can ride for free," said Ben Warner. An American, Ben came to Sakhalin for the Peace Corps, married Natasha, and now runs an oil company supply business. Mountain Air is much like a 1950's New England ski hill, with plentiful snow by Christmas covering its only two runs down Bolshevik Mountain. 
 For more excitement, skiers and snowboarders often meet Saturday mornings at the Mountain Air parking lot for heli-skiing. For 1,000 rubles ($33) a ride, a local pilot on his day off, but presumably with his company's permission, flies snowboarders and skiers to Mount Chekhov, a nearby summit. (Riding helicopters in Russia's wild, wild east can be hit or miss. Igor Farkhutdinov, Sakhalin's suave modernizing governor, and 19 traveling companions were killed when their MI-8 helicopter crashed Aug. 20 in the neighboring region of Kamchatka.)
 With wild nature as close at hand here as in cities in the Canadian Rockies, the Warners drove an hour down to Aniva Bay in April to watch the annual spring migration of swans heading north up the Sea of Okhotsk. In the summer, the Warners returned to the shore to shrimp in salt water lagoons with hand nets, and went to the nearby hills to pick cranberries, blackberries and blueberries.
 Outsiders interested in fishing or exploring bubbling formations known locally as mud volcanoes can tap into a small group of guides who developed their English guiding oil company workers during the 1990's. Their ads usually are found in the competing, free English fortnightlies that the island now supports: The Sakhalin Independent and The Sakhalin Times. 
"There's salmon fishing, fly-fishing, paragliding off a mountain, seal watching, visits to reindeer farms," said Aleksandr L. Dashevsky, a guide. "Last weekend, I took two guys fishing and they caught big char."
 One icon of this wildness is the Dr. Zhivago Inn, a wooden gingerbread structure, 17 miles west of town on the highway to Kholmsk, a scenic new road that curves down through the mountains to the Tatar Straits. Supplied largely by hunters and fishermen, the Dr. Zhivago claims that it is the only restaurant on the island to serve bear -- bear dumplings, bear cutlets, fried bear and bear in a pot. 
 In the cutesy interior, a bit like Goldilocks's cottage, it might be best to take a seat by the door. According to The Sakhalin Times's review, "In the 10 years of its existence, the inn burned down nine times." Sabotage by a bear liberation group?
 Sakhalin's mountainous southern half seems destined to get wilder. The vast oil investments are taking place offshore or in the north, which is a pancake-flat river delta, lined with old seismic lines cut through the forest for oil exploration. Last fall's census showed that Sakhalin's population had dropped almost by a quarter since 1990, to 546,000. The rural population is now only 13 percent of that, with about one-third of Sakhalin's people now living in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, which has the only international airport. But with apartments renting for $3,000 a month, mainlanders think twice before seeking their fortunes in Sakhalin.
 In summer or winter, the best orientation for the capital is to go to the end of Kommunistichesky Prospekt and take the trail from Gorky Street that winds for half an hour to an overlook. From there, visitors can see the rectangular city grid, with boxy apartment blocks set on a north-south axis to catch the rising and setting sun.
 Immediately below is Gagarin Park, a 220-acre expanse of green, with a pond, walking trails and a children's railroad. Deep in the park is the island's most expensive hotel, the Santa Resort Hotel, which charges as much as $400 a night. The food and rooms don't live up to the London prices. But the tennis courts are set in a forest bowl worthy of any private summer club in the Berkshires.
 At the base of the mountain, work started this summer on a cross-country ski center, the start of a multimillion project to turn the ski hill into a ski resort, with new trails, condominiums, a conference center and lift attendants who are not swayed by packs of cigarettes. 
 From this mountain aerie, the black bronze Lenin statue offers the best point of urban reference. To the left is the Sapporo Hotel, where I have stayed twice over the last year. The prices are reasonable, although phone calls to Moscow doubled my bill. The decor is 1970's suburban American, with shag rugs, brass fittings and stained doors. But the kitchen offers the best Okhotsk seafood in town. And with its central location, the bar is a major meeting spot. 
 A few steps away is Furusato, a chic new Japanese restaurant at a prestige downtown address, the corner of Karl Marx and Lenin Streets.
 With oil companies booking the city's 12 hotels months in advance, an option is to try a home stay. A year ago, I spent a night in the home of Bae Kan Sun, an elderly retired Korean-Russian seamstress who served me kimchi and other Korean staples as we communicated in broken Russian and Japanese. She grew up in Sakhalin, unable to travel to South Korea for decades because of the cold war. But a recent trip to her ethnic, if unfamiliar, homeland fulfilled her curiosity. 
 Good restaurants seem to open monthly in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Slavyanka, widely known as Russian Cuisine, serves the city's most extensive menu of traditional fare, with 74 starters ranging from beetroot salad to black caviar. An accordion and balalaika duo start around 7 p.m., warming up this cozy, wooden chalet. 
 Nihon Mitai offers New Age music, bamboo sculptures and a novelty for this side of La Perouse strait, sushi on a conveyor belt. For masochists who missed the Soviet period, Bermudski Triugolnik (Bermuda Triangle) offers deliciously retro sullen service. 
 Near the Sapporo Hotel are travel agencies and cellphone rental companies. Services are still bumpy. On a recent day, it was impossible to buy an international airline ticket with dollars or a credit card. Only rubles were accepted, in cash.
 BACK on Bolshevik Mountain, sharp-eyed climbers can spot a charming green-gabled two-story house, the Chekhov Museum on Kurilskaya Street. "The only museum for a single book," claims Nina Aleksandrovna Dvorkina, the director of the museum, which is devoted to "The Island of Sakhalin," Chekhov's expose of Czarist labor camps on the island, written in 1890. 
 On the first floor are photos of the first European colonists, gaunt men who carried their iron shackles in wheelbarrows. They have few descendants, as most prisoners died fighting in the Russian-Japanese War, which Russia lost in 1905, along with the bottom half of Sakhalin.
 From the mountain side, looking behind the bronze Lenin, stands the capital's railroad station. This is not Vladivostok, with its Beaux-Arts terminus for the Orient Express. But the lifeline of this long spine of an island is its railroad, built to a narrow gauge during Japan's occupation of the southern half of the island, from 1905 to 1945.
 Last year, I joined a boatload of Japanese tourists for a 90-minute ride on the train, pulled by a coal-burning locomotive and announced by a steam whistle. (Twice a week during the summer, a tourist boat, heavily subsidized by Japan, makes the five-and-a-half-hour trip from Wakkanai, on Hokkaido to Korsakov, on Aniva Bay.) This spring, I took the serious train, a 14-hour overnight trip to Nogliki, 350 miles north of the capital. The round trip, in a first-class a semi-private sleeper cabin, was $144.
 At night, as the train ambled up the island at about 25 miles an hour, we passed the 50th Parallel, which until the summer of 1945 was a tectonic fault line between two great empires -- Soviet and Japanese. In mid-August 1945, Soviet troops moved south, killing as many as 2,000 Japanese soldiers in battles down the railroad line. From the air, this 1930's-era DMZ is still visible as an east-west scar across the island.
 At the base of Bolshevik Mountain, Victory Square contains a sobering list of the names of hundreds of Soviet soldiers who died fighting this obscure coda to World War II. Obscure or not, the Soviets went on to take four small islands in the Kuril chain from Japan, a seizure that has kept Japan and Russia from signing a peace treaty nearly six decades after the end of World War II -- Japan still claims the islands, which Russia administers out of Sakhalin. 
 For more history, human and natural, the regional history museum on Kommunistichesky Prospekt, about one block from Gagarin Park near downtown, is in a lovely building with pagoda-style red tile roofs, one of the last major Japanese buildings still standing in the south. There are displays on reindeer cultivation, and the native Ainu and Nivhki peoples, who lived here before the Europeans.
 Back on the train, time passed easily, with the hours spent drinking beer in the bar car and snoozing with the rocking ride. In the morning, endless stands of white birches could be seen behind cheery yellow curtains, printed with the word "solntsa," or "sun." From czarist gulag to World War II battleground to cold war outpost, modern Sakhalin seems to be finally emerging from its hibernation in history, blinking in the Pacific sun. 

Not for casual tourists

Getting There and Around
 The easiest access to Sakhalin is by air from Japan or South Korea to the capital, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Asiana Airlines, (800) 227-4262 and on the Web at us.flyasiana.com, flies twice a week from Seoul; the round-trip fare is $795. 
 Sakhalin Airlines, (81-3) 5408-3263 (in Tokyo; English speakers) and www.satairlines.com, flies there from Seoul and Pusan in South Korea, and from Sapporo and Hakodate, on Hokkaido, Japan. Sakhalin is reducing its flights to three times a week from Oct. 26 to March 27. From Sapporo, an economy round-trip ticket is $718, at 116 yen to the dollar; from Seoul, $840, at 1,190 won to the dollar.
 From May through October, a passenger ferry leaves twice a week from Wakkanai, Japan's northernmost port, to Korsakov, Sakhalin's southernmost port, covering the 125 miles or so in five and a half hours. The round-trip fare is about $175.
 As for guides, Aleksandr L. Dashevsky now leads trips only part time; his e-mail address is trio@sakhalin.su. 
 Sergei V. Vostorgov's Sakhalin Travel Group, 31 KommunisticheskyProspekt, 693000, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia; phone and fax (7-4242) 72-72-88, is a largely bilingual agency that specializes in nature tourism for foreigners. Its Web site is at stg.sakhalin.su. 

Where to Stay
 Finding lodging in an oil boom town means planning, looking for home stays and being prepared to spend the night on a friend's sofa.
 The most convenient hotel is the much-sought-after Hotel Sakhalin Sapporo, a six-story white shoebox with 128 rooms at 181 Lenin Street, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk; (7-4242) 72-15-60, fax (7-4242) 72-38-89. A single with a big bed, private bathroom, phone, international television and breakfast is $126, at 31 rubles to the dollar.
 The most expensive hotel on the island is the Santa Resort Hotel, in Gagarin Park, about 15 minutes from downtown Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Built by a Japanese company, the Santa has 14 suites, 75 standard rooms ($200), Continental and Japanese restaurants, a bar, a spa, a gift shop and two outdoor tennis courts. Reservations: (7-50985) 65-550 or (7-4242) 46-28-24, fax (7-50985) 65-555; or by e-mail: santa@sakhalin.ru.
 A more moderate option is the newly renovated Natalya, at Chekhov and Anton Bujukly Streets, two blocks from the Sapporo, (7-4242) 73-95-63, fax (7-504) 41-62-701, e-mail: santa@sakhalin.ru. Some of 16 singles and 16 doubles have limited kitchenettes ($90). There is a small cafe.

Where to Eat
Japanese Cafe Nihon Mitai, on Pobeda Prospekt, (7-4242) 55-19-01 or (7-4242) 42-94-62, with a spare, styled decor that would fit in Tokyo and Sakhalin's only sushi conveyor belt, offers lunch for four for about $85. It has a full bar and is open daily, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 Slavyanka, known locally as Russian Cuisine, 45 Sakhalinskaya Street, offers 74 coldstarters as well as a wide selection of seafood and other main courses and salads in a piney wood dacha decor. Two dinners that included scallops with mustard, salmon with nuts, fish with a crackly nut shell, and two beet salads, came to $33. Live folk music with accordion and balalaika starts at 7 p.m. Open for lunch and dinner daily. JAMES BROOKE

HEADLINE: Q & A; 
The Amount of a Co-op's Flip Tax

 BODY:
 Q -- If a co-op adopts a flip tax, which is not really a tax but a fee for the sale of a co-op unit, how is the amount determined? Is it the same for all shareholders or is it determined by the number of shares? Would elderly shareholders who get protection against tax increases get a similar benefit? . . . Amie Tatem Araaya, Staten Island, N.Y.

A -- Richard Siegler, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that under New York's Business Corporation Law, the basis for organizing most co-op housing corporations in the state, each share is equal. But, Mr. Siegler said, an exception provides that "variations in fees or charges payable to the corporation upon sale or transfer of shares" do not mean that shares are being treated unequally.
 The exception, he said, was enacted in 1986 to reverse a court decision that held that flip taxes had to be equal on a per-share basis. The law now permits flip taxes based on criteria other than number of shares.
"The most popular form of flip tax today in the New York City area is a percentage of the gross selling price," he said. "The percentage is usually between 1 and 3 percent, payable either by the seller or buyer of a co-op apartment." It is usually the seller, he said. Mr. Siegler said that other formulations for the flip tax include a flat fee per apartment, a percentage of the seller's profit, or a straight per-share assessment. 
"A properly enacted flip tax could provide an exemption or special treatment for some types of shareholders or transfers," he said. It is not uncommon for transfers between family members, between an estate and beneficiaries, and on occasion between shareholders to be exempt. But, he said, he has never seen an exemption for the elderly.
If the proprietary lease does not provide for a flip tax, Mr. Siegler said, it would be necessary to amend the lease. Doing so, he said, typically requires approval by two-thirds or three-quarters of the shareholders.

Accessibility For the Disabled

Q -- I am renovating a one-family, four-story town house in a landmark district. I plan to convert it to a three-family building. In applying for a certificate of occupancy, however, I have been told that I may have to make the building accessible for people with disabilities. Must I make my 19th century town house accessible, and wouldn't this conflict with the landmark requirement to maintain the historic exterior? . . . Nathaniel Frank, Brooklyn.

A -- Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, said that while one- and two-family buildings are automatically exempt from Local Law 58-87, which provides requirements for making certain buildings accessible to people with disabilities, three-family buildings are not. But, she said, if a one- or two-family building is being converted to a three-family, the resulting three-family is also exempt if the renovation cost does not exceed 50 percent of the building's replacement value.
She said that even if the cost is more than 50 percent of the replacement value, a waiver may be possible. Under the building code, the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities may grant a waiver if, for example, it is physically or legally impossible to make the changes, if making them places an economic burden on the owner or if they produce only a negligible benefit. 
Mark Silberman, counsel to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said that if waivers are not granted, the commission will work with the office and the building owner to figure out the "least intrusive solution" to bring the building into compliance. Waiver application forms are available from the office at (212) 788-2830 or at its Web site at www.nyc.gov/html/mopd/.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
After the Blackout, Greater Interest in Backup Power

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
JUST as the Sept. 11 attacks forced major financial institutions to confront the need for backup data and disaster recovery sites, the August power blackout compelled all kinds of businesses to consider the need for backup power sources and emergency work space.
 New Jersey real estate specialists say some companies had been rather hesitant about investing in backup operations during an economic slowdown -- at least until the approval of federal regulations requiring resumption of business by financial institutions "crucial to the national economy" within 24 hours of any disaster. Since those regulations were put in place last spring, followed within a few months by the widespread blackout, interest in backup capabilities has again surged, brokers and developers say. 
 A few companies established "fail-safe" backup operations well before terrorists attacked the World Trade Center; Bear Stearns, the investment bank, for instance, set up secondary offices in New Jersey in the early 90's. Companies are generally secretive about their disaster recovery operations, but one real estate industry professional with knowledge of Bear Stearns's capacity in its Morris County office said there are three turbine generators that could provide enough power for an entire small city.
The recent blackout spurred renewed concern among some companies affected by the Sept. 11 attack and wider concern among smaller and medium-size companies and property owners, commercial real estate specialists say. 
Citicorp, based in Manhattan, is searching for a large backup data center in New Jersey, said CB Richard Ellis's managing director in Paramus, Geoffrey L. Schubert, but it has yet to find a site with enough emergency power to meet its capacious needs. State Street Bank is also looking in the state, Mr. Schubert said.
Some New Jersey companies and building owners are adding backup power sources to their existing buildings, according to several brokers and builders. Other companies from Manhattan and elsewhere in the New York metropolitan area are leasing disaster recovery space where workers could go in the event of an emergency and where computers mirror all the data generated at their home offices.
Matthew B. Jarmel, a principal with Jarmel Kizel Architects & Engineers in Livingston, said his firm had recently developed a specialty in emergency power systems. "We have worked with a number of large financial institutions that are required to have disaster recovery and redundant systems since 9/11," he said. "But now we're also seeing small companies outfitting basic office buildings with generators."
Mr. Jarmel said that while each company has specific needs, they all look for "power and fiber, the infrastructure in place to the building."
THERE are various ways to insure a building will not lose power, Mr. Jarmel said. "Uninterrupted power supply" service is available from power companies, which involves installation of a transfer switch to change the building over to battery power in the event of a power failure. Batteries can keep elevators running, lights shining and computers going for a time, depending on the size of the batteries and the power demands, he said.
In addition, Mr. Jarmel said, a building's power source can be rigged to switch automatically to generators when electrical service is lost. Smaller generators can be powered by natural gas, he said, and larger ones by diesel fuel.
In some cases, companies decide that it is more efficient or economical to lease space from companies providing backup office space equipped with backup power.
A 172,000-square-foot facility in Carlstadt was released leased in its entirety to SunGard, a company that provides backup work space to all types of enterprises -- including 47 of the 50 largest financial services companies, said Edward Russo of Russo Development, the Hackensack company that handled the deal. "The blackout made the type of service they provide increasingly sought after," Mr. Russo said.
New Jersey is a prime backup-data center locale, Mr. Russo said, because of its proximity to Manhattan's financial center and its position on the fiber-optic "infrastructure backbone" for the entire Northeast. Mr. Russo said that for a data center and its backup to operate in synchronous fashion, they must be within 62 kilometers -- about 38 miles -- of each other. "It's basic physics," he said.
The first draft of the federal regulations would have required backup data centers to be 100 to 250 miles from Manhattan, he noted, but many companies argued this was farther than the optimal distance technologically.
Last spring, months before the blackout, a 108,355-square-foot building in Somerset that was a former office of WorldCom, telecommunications giant, was leased in its entirety to the Bank of New York as a backup data center. Somerset, which is 60 miles southwest of New York City, has "excellent wiring," Mr. Jarmel said, is well situated on power grids and is equipped with up-to-date fiber-optic capability. 
Since the blackout, noted Barbara Martinez, senior vice president for asset management with Alexander Summer property managers, some office building owners are at least contemplating the purchase of backup generators and other emergency power equipment.
"Some tenants are also installing their own backup power," Ms. Martinez said. "We have a tenant like that in Ridgefield Park -- a financial services company. During the blackout, the tenant never had a disruption. First, the building's backup generator kicked in, and then the company's own generator kicked in for its individual floors."
Because of security concerns, she would not identify the tenant. SunGard also has a policy against identifying any tenant of its facilities, which are set off from downtown areas, and protected with armed guards -- inside and out. Likewise, the Bank of New York's name was not disclosed in the announcement of its real estate deal, although its participation has been widely reported. 
Ms. Martinez said she believed that building codes are likely to be changed to add requirements for backup generators. Also, landlords may increasingly find that they must install backup generators to maintain their properties' marketability. "I think this is going to become a 'must,' " she said.
In Paramus, which Ms. Martinez described as "prone to blackouts and power surges," the Atrium office building had to be closed in the summer of 2000 during extensive "brownouts." In the August blackout, she noted, an employee was trapped in the elevator for an hour, and the fire department had to be summoned. 
"In some cases, what is needed is maybe something less than full backup power," she said, "for emergency lighting and services, so tenants can at least work by daylight, and people can be evacuated if there's an outage."
Mr. Jarmel said many smaller companies that would have to shut down in a general emergency choose to have just enough battery power in place so computer systems do not crash when the power goes out, and they can shut down smoothly.
A STANDARD emergency battery power system can keep basic lighting and computer systems operating for up to an hour, he said.
Paul Giannone, managing principal of Newmark Real Estate of New Jersey, said his company was working with a Manhattan paper distributor that is currently looking for a warehouse building with a diesel generator -- or the potential for installing one -- for use as backup office space.
The Carlstadt building leased to SunGard was built as "flex space," Mr. Russo pointed out, meaning it could also have been used as a warehouse. However, SunGard, a leading company in the field of disaster recovery providers, immediately leased 100,000 square feet when the building was completed last year and recently signed a lease for the rest of the facility.
The building is single-story -- which is somewhat unusual in the realm of disaster recovery facilities, according to Mr. Russo -- with brick veneer, energy-efficient glass and abundant landscaping.
"The idea is you don't want to stick a displaced worker from Manhattan in some standard Jersey warehouse," he said.
Then again, Mr. Jarmel pointed out, "All this backup is very expensive."
"There are a lot of cases," he said, "where it could be better to focus on making sure the primary power source is reliable."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Ozone Park; 
Changing Faces, Enduring Values

BYLINE:  By DIANA SHAMAN

 BODY:
LUCILLE FOSTEL, the president of the Ozone Park Residents Block Association, has lived in Ozone Park for more than 45 years and has no intention of ever moving away if she can help it.
 "It's from here to the nursing home," she said, not admitting to any age other than to say she is a "senior citizen." "I have all the stores I need close by; I have the library and churches and all conveniences," she said. "I never feel isolated here." 
 Even though an influx of immigrant families has brought major demographic changes to this south Queens community, old-time residents and newcomers have blended almost seamlessly and no one talks of moving away because of ethnic changes. 
"It's a great community," said Councilman Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., who represents Ozone Park and lives there with his wife, Dawn. "What makes it great is a very central location minutes from the airport and great beaches, with good transportation. It might have changed slightly ethnic-wise, but the residents of Ozone Park will always be hard-working, middle-class families who care about their homes, which for many of them is their first home. That's what it has been traditionally, and that's what it is now."
The boundary on the west is the Brooklyn border; on the east, it is 110th Street and the westerly section of Aqueduct Race Track. On the north and the south, the boundaries are Atlantic and North Conduit Avenues. 
Ozone Park is home to many civil servants, and residents say that is one of the glues that hold the community together. "This has always been a hard-working, blue-collar neighborhood and the only thing that's changing is the ethnicity," said Msgr. Robert J. Thelen, the pastor of the Roman Catholic Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church on 91st Street and 101st Avenue. "We're moving away from Italian and Irish to Spanish-speaking families and a lot of Filipinos who take pride in their own culture but at the same time are very happy to be here." His parish, which extends from Cross Bay Boulevard to the Brooklyn border, has 2,500 families. 
A draw for minority groups is that Ozone Park still offers relatively low-priced housing compared with other desirable neighborhoods. Its modest detached and semiattached one- and two-family houses were built mostly in the 1920's and 30's.
"This is not a move-up neighborhood, but primarily a first-time-buyer situation, with families moving here from Brooklyn and the Bronx," said Glen Calderon, an associate broker with Prudential Action Real Estate on Rockaway Boulevard.
HOUSES on the market in Ozone Park that are listed by Multiple Listing Service brokers show prices starting at $267,000 for an attached three-bedroom house on Linden Boulevard and up to $459,000 for a five-bedroom dwelling on 95th Street. The median asking price is $339,000. Two-family houses start at $299,000 and go to $800,000. 
According to recent data compiled by Comps Inc. of Glen Cove, N.Y., a real estate data collection service, the average selling price of a one-family house in the quarter ended June 30 was $283,964. Last year, the average during the same period was $235,751, and five years ago it was $159,180. 
Some families rent out their basements to afford the higher prices, Mr. Calderon said. 
"Illegal apartments are putting a strain on the community," said Frank Dardani, president of the Ozone Tudor Civic Association, which represents Tudor Village, an enclave of 388 Tudor-style houses built in 1929 in the southwest section of Ozone Park. "Everything is impacted. There are too many cars, there is too much garbage and we don't have enough classroom space." 
But on the whole, newcomers are having a positive impact, said Mary Ann Carey, district manager of Community Board 9, which covers the northerly section of the community. The area south of Liberty and 103rd Avenues falls within Community Board 10. 
"There was a period 10 to 15 years ago when Ozone Park had started to go downhill," she said. "What happened was that we got a new influx of immigrants that were very interested in community and family, and they took homes that were getting older and renovated them." 
Although signs of owners sprucing up their houses abound, there is little new construction because of a lack of vacant lots. An exception is the 48-unit Magnolia Court condominium being completed on 2.5 acres at the intersection of 150th Road and 95th Street. The two-bedroom apartments in town house-style buildings, to be in a gated community, will come on the market this month at $299,000 to $575,000.
The developer, the Ervolino Partnership of Howard Beach and Manhattan, also plans to build a 34,000-square-foot commercial and retail building on Cross Bay Boulevard adjacent to the new housing. 
Cross Bay Boulevard south of the Belt Parkway, in Howard Beach, has already attracted chain stores that are patronized by Ozone Park residents. Ozone Park itself primarily has mom and pop stores along its major retail thoroughfares: Atlantic, Liberty and 101st Avenues and Cross Bay and Rockaway Boulevards. 
An exception is a shopping center anchored by Pathmark that was completed in 1985 on a site extending along Atlantic Avenue from 89th to 93rd Streets. 
Shoppers can also find everything from discount perfumes to electronics offered by dozens of vendors at the Aqueduct Flea Market at Rockaway Boulevard and 110th Street in one of the racetrack's parking lots. It is open year-round every Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday. Fruits and vegetables and baked goods are part of the fare, along with freshly cooked ethnic foods.
"I come here three times a week," said Edna Dobkowski, 64, who lives nearby on 107th Street. "Where else can one buy seven bananas for $1?"
RESIDENTS say quality-of-life issues like cars blocking driveways, graffiti and overcrowding because of a proliferation of illegal rentals are more of an annoyance here than major crime. "We don't worry about street crime and that is one of the great reasons for living in this neighborhood," said Ricky Pistone, president of the Ozone Park Civic Association.
"We all watch out for each other," said William Hintze, a retired Long Island Rail Road conductor who lives with his wife, Rosemary, in a three-bedroom brick semiattached house in Tudor Village they bought 38 years ago, raising six children there. 
At the foot of the tree-shaded enclave, which stretches from North Conduit Avenue to Pitkin Avenue and from 81st to 87th Streets, lies the 2.8-acre Joseph P. Addabbo Park, named after Representative Addabbo, a lifelong resident of Ozone Park who served in Congress from 1960 until his death in 1986. His son, the city councilman, lives in Tudor Village. 
Although five public elementary schools, three middle schools and John Adams High School are within the Ozone Park boundaries, much more classroom space is needed because of the large number of families with children that are moving in. In the last five years, the city has added more than 1,700 seats through additions to the elementary and middle schools. Also, the opening of Middle School 137, with Grades 6 through 8, in September 2002 added 1,252 seats. In the planning stages are a high school to be at 94-02 104th Street, and another school, whose grade level is not yet specified, on Albert Road. 
In addition to overcrowding, the public schools face the challenge of serving large numbers of students for whom English is a second language. In most of the schools, more than 70 percent of pupils are Hispanic or Asian. 
Of fourth graders in the elementary schools who were tested this year, an average of 51 percent were at grade level in reading and 52 percent were at grade level in math. The schools are P.S. 63, 64, 65, 100 and 108. About 30 percent of eighth-grade pupils at M.S. 202 and 220 read at grade level, and 22.8 worked at grade level in math. At M.S. 137, 29.7 percent of seventh graders read at grade level and 22.3 were at grade level in math.
John Adams has more than 3,600 students and is operating with double shifts because it is at 173 percent of capacity, Ms. Carey of Community Board 9 said. On last year's Regents exams, 50.4 percent of students achieved a passing grade of 65 percent or higher in English and 48.4 percent achieved that level in math. Last year, 30 percent of graduates planned to go on to four years of higher education and 12.5 percent for two years.
The neighborhood also has several parochial schools offering kindergarten-through-eighth-grade classes, where crowding is less of a problem and where test scores are higher. Sister Francis Marie Wystepek, the principal of the St. Stanislaus School at 90-17 101st Avenue, where 200 children are enrolled, said that because of the downturn in the economy many parents could no longer afford private education, which averages $3,000 a year in the area for the first child. 
Despite its name, Ozone Park has no major parks. But many playgrounds and playing fields are scattered throughout the community. The 2.1-acre Centerville Playground at 96th Street and Albert Road is named after the Centerville Race Track, which was on the east side of Cross Bay Boulevard south of Rockaway Boulevard. It is a reminder that racetracks featured prominently in the area's early development. Union Course was the first, established in 1821. Centerville opened in 1925. Ozone Park's racing tradition continues at Aqueduct. 
Housing development dates to the late 19th century, when two partners, Benjamin W. Hitchcock and Charles C. Denton, began carving farmland into building lots after the New York, Woodhaven & Rockaway Rail Road opened service in 1880 from Long Island City to Howard Beach. The developers chose the name Ozone Park to lure buyers with the idea of refreshing breezes blowing in from the Atlantic Ocean to a parklike community.
Elevated train service from Manhattan to Jamaica began in 1915, further spurring development. Buyers were attracted for the same reasons they are now: the desire to leave the inner city and to buy a house they could afford close to good transportation. As house prices escalate, however, some fear that Ozone Park is in danger of losing its traditional first-time buyers. "Prices are going up because this neighborhood has so many pluses," said Moheed Oasman, an associate broker with Re/Max Metro Real Estate Associates in Jamaica.

The terminals simulate the New York State Lottery's scratch-off games and advocates say could raise up to $400 million annually for the state. The plan is temporarily on hold pending a tax-fraud investigation of NYRA by federal prosecutors. If implemented, however, it might allay local fears that Aqueduct would close because of dwindling attendance. Part of that fear is based on the fact that zoning would allow high-rise construction on what is now the track grounds. The track opened in 1894 on 24 acres bought from the Brooklyn Water Works. It now covers 192 acres, has a million-square-foot grandstand on 23 acres, parking for 8,000 cars and its own subway station. Famous horses like Man o' War, Secretariat and Seabiscuit once thrilled crowds of up to 73,000. Now only 5,000 to 7,000 attend daily on the weekends during season, which runs from late October to early May. Map of Queens highlighting Ozone Park.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut; 
Builder of Upscale Homes Is Active in Several Cities

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
LAST February, Annette Mostato, an insurance investigator who works in Manhattan and had been commuting an hour and a half from her home in Carmel, N.Y., moved even farther out. Now she commutes two hours from her new two-bedroom town house in Danbury. "There's a price you have to pay for good living," she said. "I live alone, and it's wonderful to know I'm coming home at night to a country club and the birdies chirping."
 She is part of a growing army of nontraditional home buyers that the Ginsburg Development Company, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., caters to in luxurious fashion at prices below those charged in lower Fairfield County. Two years ago, it opened an office in Danbury to oversee its portfolio of eight Connecticut projects, worth $347 million, some completed, others in various stages of development. Its entry into Connecticut consisted of 32 single-family clustered homes in Georgetown called Redding Ridge, which sold out rapidly. 
 Summing up Ginsburg's marketing strategy, Joseph Novella, president of the Connecticut operations, said: "We have blown away the concept of town houses as an entry type of housing. Some of it still is, but the luxury town homes and luxury multifamily communities that we develop meet the requirements of well-to-do nontraditional buyers. They are coming from multimillion-dollar homes; they are singles, gays, empty nesters, active older adults -- in a range of lifestyles." 
A certain synergy is developing with the company's Westchester projects in part because of the favorable price differential of Fairfield homes compared with Westchester. A home that costs about $325,000 in Danbury, for instance, costs about $540,000 in Greenburgh, the company said. 
"We get a fair amount of people coming from one of our homes in Westchester to one in Connecticut," said Martin Ginsburg, president and chief operating officer. According to Tom Gissen, vice president of development, "last year Westchester led in numbers of units" under construction. "This year it will be Connecticut," he said.
In 2004, he said, the company's plans are for six projects in Westchester County with 1,008 units, and in Connecticut it expects to build seven developments with 1,038 units.
Woodland Hills, the 65-acre Danbury project where Ms. Mostato lives, is the largest. Of 252 town homes that will eventually be clustered on winding roads surrounded by dense forest, 157 units are occupied. Two-thirds of the 80 buildings will have four units per building and the rest have two, but each building is designed to look like one spacious semi-Victorian home with bay windows, porches and gables. 
"We like Danbury," said Mr. Ginsburg. "It was already going through downtown revitalization with a lot of improvements that other communities could look to. It's well located and has had a good, professional governmental presence."
It is also in the middle of a housing boom, which Mayor Mark Boughton welcomes. "Most of the development does not generate a lot of school children and overcrowded schools, and it does provide more ratable properties," he said.
Eight Woodland Hills models of 1,578 to 1,991 square feet, with two or three bedrooms, two and a half baths and one- or two-car garages, are priced in the low $300,000's to the low $400,000's, or $100,000 more than they initially cost a year ago. Six furnished models are replete with options and upgrades that elevate the price for some buyers by $30,000 to $100,000. The attractions include lofts that can be expanded or turned into additional rooms, standard 9-foot ceilings, stylish architecture, and landscaping that appears to have been there for years.
Monthly common charges of $192 cover maintenance of the landscaping, building exteriors and roads, and use of adult and children's outdoor pools, a tot lot and tennis court. An 8,000-square-foot clubhouse has a fitness center, basketball court, men's and women's lockers and showers, kitchen and large room for meetings and parties. 
Michael Timan, 50, who works in the Danbury office of PTM Technologies, a circuit board manufacturer based in Washington, D.C., and Betsy Taylor, 45, an import-export specialist at Vanderbilt Chemical in Norwalk, moved into a Woodland Hills town house in July 2002, after extricating themselves from a contract to buy a unit in another less attractive development. "In comparison to other builders," Mr. Timan said, "the quality of workmanship and materials and choice of options are the difference between night and day. The price point is a bit higher, but my property value has gone up dramatically." 
The 39-year-old development company, which was founded by two architects, the brothers Martin and Sam Ginsburg, has developed and built 4,000 homes. In addition, it has built mid- and high-rise apartments in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida as well as office buildings and commercial shopping centers. It also owns and manages 3,500 apartments in three states.
Besides cosseting the nontraditional buyer, the company is paying attention to the older generation. Upscale housing is to open in December at Liberty of Newtown, where one adult in the household must be 55 or older and no one 18 or younger may live there permanently. 
ON 37 wooded acres, 12 three-story buildings will hold 92 units, with six or eight units per building. Four models of about 2,000 to 2,300 square feet have twobedrooms, two and a half baths, two-car garages, a library, a den or both, and large storage areas off common hallways. Monthly charges of $306 cover use of the clubhouse, pool, fitness center and party room and maintenance of landscaping, roads, building exteriors plus common hallways. 
In Farmington, outside Hartford, Ginsburg Development has town approval to build 44 single-family detached homes for adults 55 and older called Chimney Hill. Clustered on 36 acres, the 2,200 to 3,200 square foot units will be priced from the low $500,000's to low $600,000's. Construction will begin as soon as state traffic commission and engineering permits are issued.
The most challenging of the current ventures is the $20 million redevelopment of the 1903 Goodwin Estate, a National Historic site in Hartford's West End, home to high government officials and professionals. The company has been working for months to repair heavy damage to the mansion from assaults by vandals and a fire in 1996. Facing Asylum Avenue on a 17-acre parcel, the property was given to the state by the Goodwins in 1953, then bought by the city for $1.9 million in 1989 as a temporary outpost of the University of Connecticut. The Ginsburgs acquired it in distressed condition last year for $409,500. 
A waiting list of 30 buyers includes a former speaker of the state House of Representatives and a number of physicians, lawyers and professors, eager to move into the development, believed to be the first luxury housing offered in Hartford in 20 years. The mansion will have seven uniquely designed flats and penthouses accessed by elevator, and 56 attached and semiattached town homes will be built on the property at prices of $300,000 to the mid-$500,000's. Delivery of the first units is scheduled for January. 
Plans have been approved in West Hartford for Quaker Green, where 64 new high-end town homes will be built on the former Talcott Junior High School property. The school itself will be redeveloped as 24 condominium units, a community meeting room and fitness center. An outdoor pool will also be installed. Prices are expected to be in the $200,000's to low $300,000's range. Construction is begin within two weeks, contingent on a decision by the Superior Court in Hartford on whether an objector to the development has standing to appeal the approvals. 
An unusual situation in Bloomfield arose when Cigna, which is gradually vacating its campus there, provided Ginsburg an opportunity to reconfigure some of the buildings into 158 single-family homes and duplex town houses on 72 acres. Most units will face the Arnold Palmer golf course that Cigna is developing. The housing is approved under Cigna's master plan and prices are expected to open in the mid-$500,000's. 
Plans for 103 typical Ginsburg town homes in Litchfield were reduced from 138 units to comply with the town's wishes, but it still denied the developer's applications for wetlands and site plan approval. Two appeals filed by the company in Litchfield Superior Court are pending. 
Like many buyers, Beth Chandler, an actress, and her husband, Sterling Rome, found Woodland Hills, the company's Danbury project, online. They like the mix of people, the sense of community, the golf outings, brunches, barbecues and holiday parties -- the urbanity. Former New Yorkers, they note that their common charges are the equivalent of monthly gym membership in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: For Rental Buildings, A Rising Market 

BYLINE:  By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
PERSPIRING in his shirt sleeves on an August afternoon, Frank Pecora directed the workers completing his new Italian restaurant in a building he bought on First Avenue near 73rd Street. It opened on Labor Day as the new Delizia, next door to the old Delizia, which was in space he had leased in 1983. 
 But Mr. Pecora, 52, is more than a restaurateur and no novice as a real-estate investor. With a brother and other family members, he owns 23 buildings in Manhattan, most of them purchased since 1990. This year he bought four of them, three in East Harlem. 
 They put him in the ranks of those who have been active buyers of modest-sized rental buildings lately, a group that includes everything from hands-on owner-managers like himself to nationally oriented real estate investment trusts. Most of the buildings have fewer than 60 apartments, and often they have commercial as well as residential space. 
The buying comes at a time of favorable interest rates, if weaker rent levels than owners had grown to expect before the events of Sept. 11. But lower rents have not fazed buyers. They complain about a paucity of offerings. In New York City, sales offerings are abundant mainly in hard times, when owners or their lenders are driven to unload inventory. 
Nevertheless, the buyers keep looking. The philosophy that drives them differs, but Mr. Pecora's is a familiar one. "For me, it's always a good time to buy when I have the money," he said. "I buy it and forget about it. In the long run it has no way to go but up."
Interviews with sales brokers and buyers themselves reveal that this underlying faith is common. Since total rents in regulated buildings are usually below market levels, some buyers are willing to forgo any return at all in the early years of their investment, in the conviction that higher rental income will eventually justify the prices they paid. Building improvements and other changes in operations or occupancy may be needed to bring this about.
With certain properties producing incomes far below their potential, some buyers have been willing to pay as much as 12 or 14 times the current rent roll in Manhattan. That is not the norm, however. The more typical range in recent sales in Manhattan is 9 to 12 times the annual rent, brokers and investors say.
To some extent these multiples reflect favorable mortgage-interest rates, about 5 percent in recent years, but 6 percent or a more lately. As interest rates decline, prices typically rise. 
The concept of "multiple of the rent roll" is a standard way of speaking of sale prices in rental buildings in New York City. It means, for example, that if the average rent is $1,000 a month in a 60-unit building -- or rent of $720,000 a year, assuming full collection and full occupancy -- the building would sell for $5.76 million at eight times the rent roll. At 10 times the rent roll the same building would sell for $7.2 million.
"It's counterintuitive," said Robert Knackal, a principal in the sales brokerage firm of Massey Knackal Realty Services. In general, he said, "The lower the rents the higher the upside, and the higher the upside the greater the multiple of price to rents."
Another factor in the current market, active buyers say, is that in recent years some wealthy individuals have found real estate more appealing than the stock market as a place to invest. "Equity financing is easy to come by," said Eric S. Margules, principal in Margules Properties, which has bought four Manhattan buildings in the last two years.
Massey Knackal was the broker in the sale of a portfolio of 12 West Side elevator buildings with 786 apartments this year. They sold for $109 million, or 11.28 times their total rents. These buildings had been held by the same family for 80 years, Mr. Knackal said, and because of long-term occupancies, about 40 percent were renting at less than half of what they would rent for if vacant. The new owner is Acquisition America L.L.C., in which Fred Shalom, president of Empire Management, is a principal.
"We bought them for the long term," Mr. Shalom said. "In 20 or 30 years down the road, they will be valuable."

Manhattan Sales Trends
Prices Have Risen For a Decade
The Massey Knackal firm keeps statistics on sales of multifamily buildings. One measurement has tracked sales of buildings under 100,000 square feet in Manhattan south of 96th Street, with 27,300 buildings in the survey, since 1989.
Using rolling averages over a 12-month period, the firm found that the average price rose to $465 a square foot in the 12 months that ended on June 30. The rise has been consistent since a low of $115 a square foot in 1993. 
Based of sales volume so far, the firm projects sales of 638 buildings this year, or 2.3 percent of the 27,300 buildings. This would be a rise from 510 sales last year.
Prices, too, have risen markedly, although thefigures suggest that since the year 2000 the averages have hovered within consistent ranges: for elevator buildings in Manhattan, between 10 and 12 times the rent roll; in Queens, between 8 and 10; and in Brooklyn, between 6 and 8.
Walk-up buildings have lower average multiples -- between 9 and 10 in Manhattan over the last three years, 7 to 9 in Queens and 5 to 7 in Brooklyn. Elevator buildings are more sought after, Mr. Knackal said, since buyers usually perceive a greater upside in them, so they will pay more.
The report has no information on the Bronx. One broker active in northern Manhattan and the Bronx, Robert Chambre of Chambre & Company, said multiples had risen to a range of 6 to 7.5 times the rent roll in the Bronx and to 7 to 8 times in Washington Heights.
The New York City Finance Department also has numbers. They show increases in values citywide. For example, in 2000 the average sale price of a residential unit in rental buildings with 4 to 10 apartments in all Manhattan was $217,200; last year the comparable figure was $223,000. In 1995 the figure was $86,000.
In these buildings the buyer is often planning to occupy one or more units, or otherwise alter the property for personal use. Since considerations other than pure investment are involved, the sale prices tend to be higher per unit than they are in larger buildings. Finance Department figures show, for example, that the average sale price per apartment in Manhattan buildings with 11 to 20 units last year was $115,600. In 1995 it was $40,800.
Other boroughs have also experienced increases in sale prices, but not of the magnitude of Manhattan's. In Queens, for example, the average price per apartment rose to $67,300 in 11-to-20-unit buildings last year, from $27,500 in 1995. In Brooklyn the comparable figures were $50,200 last year and $25,100 in 1995.
The buildings that are sold in any given year are only a tiny fraction of the whole inventory. There were only 106 sales last year of 11-to-20-unit buildings in Manhattan out of a total inventory of 5,500 such buildings. Citywide there are 10,000 such buildings; only 250 of them were sold.
None of these figures take commercial space into account in mixed-use buildings, so they somewhat distort true residential values.

Effect of Regulation
Building Owners Rely On Steady Rent Rises
Many sales are of buildings that are fully rent-regulated and are likely to remain so even after vacancies occur. Tenancy turnovers in units rented below their market value may run as low as 2 or 3 percent a year, and in very small buildings owners may wait years for any turnover at all.
What the buyers are mainly relying on, they report, is the steady rise in overall rents. Some believe these will average 6 to 7 percent a year over the next few years, taking both vacancies and lease renewals into account. This assumes that most of the apartments are currently renting well below vacancy value.
Buyers and brokers say that the opportunity to deregulate an apartment once it is vacated and the rent that a new tenant can legally be charged reaches $2,000 has little effect on the sales market. However, under a law passed this year, owners can achieve deregulation even if the owner is unable to get a rent that high.
When a regulated tenant moves out or dies, an owner may achieve a legal rent of $2,000 a month via the new-lease guideline increase, a vacancy allowance and the rent increase permitted for apartment improvements. If significant investment is needed to bring this about, it will be made if the owner believes the unit isactually worth that much on the market, or soon will be.
At one time after the enactment of the Rent Regulation and Reform Act by the State Legislature in 1993, regulations of the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal freed the apartment from regulation only if the incoming tenant actually paid $2,000 or more. But the law change allows deregulation even if the tenant pays what the rent-stabilization code calls a "preferential" rent below that amount. Owners are required to inform incoming tenants of the status of apartments that have become deregulated.
Mr. Knackal said that buyers of the buildings he sells in Manhattan often assume their rent rolls will increase by an average of 10 percent a year in the first few years of their ownership. This will come from a combination of guideline increases, lease renewals, vacancy rent increases, major capital improvements, more efficient operations and the new owner's ability to put a stop to illegal occupancy. "A lot depends on how neglectful the prior landlord was in running the property," Mr. Knackal said.
But the range in building values is wide. Robert Shapiro, vice president of Manhattan Property Investor Group L.L.C., said that in 13 deals in the last 16 months in which he was either a buyer or a seller prices ranged from 6 to 10 times the annual rent. The company is a short-term holder of properties, a deal maker whose buyers include Mr. Pecora. "The biggest factor in price is the location of the property," Mr. Shapiro said. 
Buyers also have to take into account the weakened rental market of the last three years. Many owners told of a need to reduce vacancy rents from the levels of three years ago. At the higher end of the market in particular, the vacancy rate has risen. It is about 5 percent now in apartments that rented for upward of $1,800 a month three years ago, estimated Nancy Packes, president of Halstead/Feathered Nest Leasing Consultant. It was about 2 percent then, she said. 
But, as Martin Newman, a recent buyer on the West Side and East Side, remarked, "The juice in the sales market is the low-rent apartments." 
Mr. Newman, who buys property in partnership with Nathan Halegua, owns 33 buildings with 700 apartments and 46 stores in Manhattan, almost all south of 96th Street. He said that over the last 18 months he has profitably resold 11 buildings that he acquired between August 1999 and January 2001. He was able to raise their rental income by an average of 30 to 35 percent through a combination of rerenting vacancies, evicting or making settlements with low-rent or illegal tenants, normal increases in stabilized rents and higher commercial rents. 
"There's a limit to how many buildings like this are available," Mr. Newman said. "And there's a limit to how much we would pay. I would not pay more than 10 times the gross rent -- maybe 11 in an elevator building."
Tenant turnover is not necessarily what creates value, he said. At 589-593 First Avenue, at 34th Street, purchased three years ago, there has been little turnover. But the rent roll has risen to $67,100 from $35,000 a month, largely because he was able to cancel three store leases and rewrite them, he said. The tenants stayed.
Another successful recent investment involved a property on the southwest corner of Second Avenue and St. Marks Place in the East Village -- three contiguous six-story walk-up buildings with 64 apartments and 11 stores, three of them little more than kiosks. The property was purchased for $7.6 million in 1998, when the total rents were $1.07 million. The buyers projected arent roll of $1.35 million in five years.
After five years, rents have actually reached $1.54 million, Mr. Newman said. The rise in residential rents was the principal reason in this instance. The turnover of 12 apartments, through a combination of deaths, buyouts and eviction, accounted for roughly half the growth in the residential portion of rent roll, which itself accounts for about half of total rental income.
"We still have tenants paying $300 a month and a couple are using toilets in the hall," Mr. Newman said. But once vacated and upgraded, a typical one-bedroom apartment will rent for $1,500 to $1,800 a month, he said.

Dealing With Tenants
In Shared Spaces, Owners' Opportunity
In Manhattan buildings, a significant percentage of newly arriving tenants are sharing, and the rents are coming from two, three or four individuals. Many sharers have gone into buildings owned by Baruch Singer and his partners. Mr. Singer, who operates 2,500 apartments in moderate-rent locations, says he has bought 20 buildings in the last three years. More than 40 percent of the new arrivals in his buildings are apartment sharers, he said. Of the rest, half are one-person households.
One recent purchase was the 55-unit building at 894 Riverside Drive, at 160th Street, near Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.
He paid 10 times the rent roll there, he said, because the average rent was much lower than what would normally be expected. He suspected a high degree of illegal activity.
"From my experience, 10 to 15 percent of the tenants are illegally renting out rooms," Mr. Singer said. It is not unusual for the tenant to be collecting $1,200 a month in an apartment in which the landlord is collecting $400, he said. On some occasions the tenant has "sold" the apartment and moved out. The new "tenant" pays the rent with money orders using the name of the tenant on the lease.
Mr. Singer's efforts to evict these tenants keep his lawyers in Housing Court, where he estimates he initiates about 100 actions a year. The outcome is mixed, he said. Some tenants leave, some settle and some are evicted.
But most buyers appear unwilling to pay prices predicated on their ability to gain possession of low-rent, possibly illegally occupied, apartments. There are other ways to add value. Mr. Margules, who owns 43 buildings with 800 apartments owned through various partnerships, said that there was little illegal occupancy in the buildings he had bought in the last two years, but considerable opportunity for adding value.
In one case he was able to negotiate a settlement of a harassment complaint against the former owner that was impeding rent collections, he said. In another case he was able to change the status of a single-room-occupancy building to a rent-stabilized building.
At 43 Clinton Street, on the Lower East Side, he bought a dilapidated 18-unit building with two stores four years ago. It had six vacancies and a need for $100,000 in structural and apartment improvements. Now he is able to get $1,500 a month for vacant one-bedroom apartments, usually from two sharing tenants, he said.
Many of the new owners know at least some of their tenants personally. But that is not likely to be the case with the executives of the Denver-based Apartment Investment Management Company, a publicly listed real estate investment trust known by the acronym Aimco, a recent buyer of residential property in Manhattan. 
Last March Aimco bought 311-313 East 73rd Street, two 1920's walk-ups with 35 apartments, a sale that pointed up the interest of a national real estate company even in a Class B property in the city if it is well located. Aimco's 2002 annual report says that its portfolio includes 1,800 properties with 318,000 housing units.
This year Aimco bought 181-199 Columbus Avenue, a strip of older buildings on the east side of the avenue between 68th and 69th Streets, with 12 stores and 88 walk-up apartments. The price was $37.5 million.
"When rents are down in a lot of cities," said Georgia J. Malone, who represented Aimco in both purchases, "national companies like New York properties, because the rents are stable in regulated buildings even when market rents weaken."
But competition from large buyers does not worry hands-on owners like Frank Pecora, the restaurant owner who buys small buildings in Manhattan. "I have an advantage on them," Mr. Pecora said. "I don't depend on contractors. I don't depend on other people. I depend on myself."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME; 
Sidewalk Liability Hits Home

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
UNTIL last month, the strip of concrete between the curb and the front of most commercial and multifamily residential buildings in New York City was essentially the city's turf and ultimately the city's problem. While property owners -- including co-op corporations and condominium associations -- have long been responsible for keeping the sidewalk in front of their buildings in good repair, the ultimate liability for injuries sustained in "slip and fall" cases has always rested with the city.
 That changed, however, on Sept. 15, when three amendments to the New York City Administrative Code took effect. The changes not only make property owners responsible for keeping the sidewalks that abut their properties "in a reasonably safe condition," but also require them to carry insurance to cover injuries sustained on those sidewalks and make them legally liable for monetary damages that arise from such injuries. 
 That, real estate lawyers say, is likely to have a significant impact on property owners throughout the city. "The new laws are legally sound and logical," said Paul F. Clark, a former assistant New York City corporation counsel who is now a partner in a Manhattan law firm. "But their provisions are unwieldy and leave lots of gaps that courts and lawyers are going to have to deal with over the next few years." 
Before Sept. 15, Mr. Clark said, property owners had a legal duty to maintain the sidewalks in front of their buildings in "safe repair" and "free of all snow and debris" even though the sidewalk itself was owned by the city. Notwithstanding that obligation, the city remained civilly liable for any damages sustained by people who were injured as the result of defects or unsafe conditions.
As a practical matter, the laws requiring the owners to keep their sidewalks clean and in good condition basically had no teeth. For example, Mr. Clark said, if there was a crack or other unsafe condition in a sidewalk in front of a building, the city would send a notice to the owner requiring him to address the problem. If the owner failed to do so, the city itself would make the repair and then bill the property owner for the cost of the repair.
"A lot of property owners would just sit back and let the city do it," Mr. Clark said. In addition to getting the repair done at a reasonable price, the property owner, by waiting for the city to take care of the problem, would avoid having to deal with private contractors, he said. "And if the owner was lucky, the city might never get around to billing him for the work."
A similar situation existed with regard to snow removal. "The building owners were legally responsible for snow removal, but the only real penalty was a fine," Mr. Clark said. Since the city was ultimately liable for injuries sustained by people who fell on a slippery sidewalk, he said, it was safer -- from a legal liability perspective -- for property owners to let nature take its course after a snowstorm. 
"If the owner tried to clear the sidewalk and did it negligently, he could be legally liable for someone's injuries," he said. "But if the owner did nothing at all, he might get a fine, but he wouldn't be responsible for damages. That would be the problem of the city."
Now, however, the city's problem is also the owner's problem. "The new laws," Mr. Clark said, "put the responsibility for the sidewalks in the hands of those who are in the best position to take care of them: the owners."
Basically, he said, the law requires property owners to "install, construct, reconstruct, repave, repair or replace" defective sidewalk components. The law also requires the owner to remove "snow, ice, dirt or other material from the sidewalk." (Mr. Clark noted that the law does not apply to one-, two- or three-family properties that are at least partially occupied by the owner and used exclusively for residential purposes.)
While many provisions of the new law basically mirror the current state of sidewalk law, one new provision is a dramatic departure from the status quo. "Property owners are now going to be the prime target of most slip-and-fall litigation in the city," said Eva Talel, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer. "This is going to have an economic impact on the owners, and it's not going to be a positive one."
In addition to shifting the liability for damages directly onto property owners, the new laws also require building owners to carry liability insurance to cover such exposure.
Ms. Talel noted that most large co-op and condominium corporations and associations generally already have liability insurance coverage. However, she said, insurance companies that insure commercial buildings have been well aware that when the lawsuits start flying in New York City, the city itself was probably going to ante up for the damages. In the past three years, in fact, the city paid $189 million in such claims. With the owners -- and their insurers -- now primarily liable, that money will have to come from somewhere else.
"We're talking about increased insurance premiums and that means increased maintenance charges," Ms. Talel said, adding that when exposure increases, so do premiums, sometimes unexpectedly.
Moreover, she said, it is likely that carriers will require sidewalk repairs to be made as a condition of coverage, thereby imposing an additional expense on the property owner. "In the end, the money is ultimately going to come out of the shareholder's and unit owner's pockets," she said. 
Ms. Talel noted that while the new laws require building owners to carry liability insurance to cover "slip and fall" cases, they do not indicate just how much coverage there must be. Moreover, she said, the law does not specify what the penalty will be for failure to obtain such coverage. 
As a result, Ms. Talel said, it is possible that some owners may have too little coverage and others may not have any coverage at all. But, she said, the law allows the city to pay an injured person who obtains a judgment against a property owner up to $50,000 in uninsured medical expenses and then go after the property owner for reimbursement. 
Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan lawyer who is also president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said the change in the law would have far-reaching impact on co-op and condominium boards and their managing agents.
"What it means is that every time somebody slips and falls in front of your building, the building is going to get sued," he said. "And that means that managing agents, superintendents, doormen and board members are all going to end up being witnesses in litigation."
In addition, Mr. Luxemburg said, the change in the law now clearly puts the responsibility on boards to identify damaged sidewalks and then do something about the damage. "Now the board and the manager has to go and put out specifications for the job, hire a contractor and then make sure the job was done correctly," he said. 
Susan Lipp, legal editor of the Apartment Law Insider, a newsletter for property owners, agreed.
"Building owners should inspect their sidewalks at least once a month," Ms. Lipp said. "Look for any defects that might cause a hazard. And if a sidewalk slab rocks or seesaws or if one slab is higher than the one next to it, make a note of it, repair it and then document that the repair has been made."
Since property owners are now specifically liable for any injuries caused by a defective sidewalk, they should not wait for the city to identify problems and order the necessary repairs. "You have to keep track yourself," she said. "You have to be proactive."

Don't Overconsume Natural Resources

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
NATURAL resources mutual funds can be used in two distinctly different ways, analysts say. They can be short-term speculations by traders who think that commodity prices are ready to climb, or they can be a long-term hedge against inflation.
 "One goal is to get a little bit of pop in your portfolio, the same way another investor might use a limited portion of a technology fund or an emerging-markets fund," said Langdon Healy, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.who covers natural resources funds. "The other goal is, ironically, a conservative play." 
 Investors looking for an inflation hedge should choose a fund that is less concentrated in oil-and-gas stocks than the typical natural resources fund is now, he said. He cited the Jennison Natural Resources fund or the T. Rowe Price New Era fund.
Lewis J. Altfest, a financial planner in New York, listed several reasons for using the category to counter inflation: Most commodity prices tend to rise with inflation; a weaker dollar lifts the value of oil and base metals produced overseas; and some investors hoard precious metals if they think that inflation is getting out of hand.
Morningstar advises investors not to devote more than 5 to 10 percent of their portfolios to natural resources. But Mr. Altfest said he might put as much as 20 percent of a portfolio in natural resources if he expected an inflationary period. 
While the economy is not inflationary now, he said, the dollar's decline and spikes in commodity prices over the past year are classic early warning signs. He expects higher inflation to return sometime over the next two or three years, because "the rise in defense spending and tax cuts will by themselves result in inflation over time."
Even without runaway 1970's-style inflation, natural resources funds can smooth out the rough edges of a portfolio, Mr. Altfest said, because "natural resources zig when the portfolio zags." The fund category's movement differs significantly from that of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, according to Morningstar. 
After a year of rising energy prices, many funds with "natural resources" in their names are almost pure energy funds. State Street Research Global Resources, Putnam Global Natural Resources and Fidelity Advisor Natural Resources, among others, hold 75 percent to 85 percent of assets in energy, according to Morningstar. A fund manager who tends to diversify across natural resources might be 60 percent invested in energy today.
Even after considering the current lofty state of oil prices, energy investments are less risky today than some investors might think, said Karl E. Bandtel, manager of the Vanguard Energy fund. Over the past year, energy prices have risen faster than the shares of oil and natural gas producers, largely because many investors doubted that prices would stay high.
Over the long run, Mr. Bandtel tends to agree. He expects oil prices to fall over the next three to five years, possibly to $21 to $22 a barrel, roughly the 10-year average. Oil is now close to $30 a barrel. But even if oil drops, he said, certain stocks should do well.
FOR instance, he said he thought the market had underestimated the growth potential of two foreign oil companies that the fund owns. Total FinaElf, based in Paris, is poised to increase production in West Africa, Latin America and the North Sea, and Petrobras of Brazil is revving up production, just as the country's macroeconomic situation is improving, Mr. Bandtel said.
"We look for stocks with good value now and growth opportunities in terms of production," he said. 
Leigh R. Goehring, manager of the Jennison Natural Resources fund, is decidedly more bullish on energy stocks. He predicts that oil prices will remain high and that the gap between the commodity and stock prices will narrow over the next year. The portfolio he manages has a 60 percent weighting in energy stocks, which he says is high for him. Historically, energy stocks have accounted for 35 percent to 65 percent of the Jennison fund.
"Oil is drying up outside of OPEC and Russia," Mr. Goehring said. "Everywhere else, production growth is basically zero. This gives OPEC pricing power." Some of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend will be oil services companies, he said, citing BJ Services and Smith International, both of Houston.
Mr. Goehring is largely optimistic about commodities like base and precious metals, but not about forest products. "The world is still wrestling with a massive expansion in pulp-making capacity in the 1990's," he said, and demand will take a few years to catch up.
But Charles M. Ober, manager of the T. Rowe Price New Era fund, sees opportunity even when pulp prices are falling. The fund was introduced in 1969 to buy stocks that might do well during periods of inflation. Because it has a broader charter than many other natural resources funds, Mr. Ober is free to invest in companies that might benefit if commodity prices drop. 
"I'm less inclined to exit a sector completely," he said. All else being equal, low pulp prices should benefit paper companies, and falling natural gas prices should help fertilizer companies, because natural gas is a raw component of fertilizer, he said.
Mr. Ober said he was becoming relatively enthusiastic about base metals, because "the Chinese transition from an agrarian society to an industrial power will stimulate demand for more than 10 years." 
For example, when the Chinese used 17 percent of the world's copper last year, that amounted to only 2.9 pounds a person, compared with about 23.5 pounds per capita in Western Europe and Japan. 
Despite the fund managers' optimism, Mr. Altfest cautioned that investors should expect volatility in natural resources funds. These funds tend to be more erratic than general stock funds, he said, so anyone investing in them "had better be prepared to close their eyes to short-term fluctuations."

Higher Interest Rates Could Crimp These Muni Funds

BYLINE:  By ILANA POLYAK

 BODY:
FOR more than three years, leveraged closed-end municipal bond funds have had a good run, delivering year after year of double-digit gains. But that ride may be coming to an end.
 While the funds have continued to perform well this year, their momentum may be slowing. In the first nine months of 2003, leveraged closed-end muni funds returned 5.8 percent, according to Lipper Inc. In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned 14.7 percent, including dividends. But when interest rates move higher, as is expected in a recovery, the funds could be in for losses. 
 "When short-term rates go up, these funds get hit pretty hard," said Jeffrey Margolin, senior closed-end fund analyst at Ryan Beck & Company, a brokerage firm in New York. "And it happens very quickly."
In early September, Mr. Margolin downgraded several leveraged closed-end muni funds. Positive economic data, like faster growth in gross domestic product and improving equity prices, indicates that a turnaround is under way, Mr. Margolin said. When the economy heats up, interestrates generally move higher. In the first nine months this year, rates on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 3.95 percent percent from 3.82 percent. Additional increases could hurt the leveraged funds more than other bond funds.
Unlike the more common, open-end variety, closed-end funds issue a limited number of shares. These can trade at a premium or a discount to the funds' net asset value, depending on investor demand. Traditional open-end mutual funds can create as many shares as investors want to buy, and they can buy back shares that are redeemed. The share price and net asset value are always virtually the same. 
The impressive gains of closed-end leveraged muni funds have not been lost on shareholders. Since the beginning of 2001, when the Federal Reserve enacted the first of 13 rate cuts, 93 of the funds were started, according to Lipper. Investors put almost $14 billion into closed-end bond funds in the first six months of 2003 alone, accounting for nearly 10 percent of their overall bond assets.
There are now 225 closed-end municipal funds; 87 percent of these use leverage to amplify returns, according to Lipper. That could set the stage for a fall when interest rates move higher.
Thomas J. Herzfeld, president of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, a Miami firm that specializes in closed-end funds, said, "The funds will have to reduce their dividends amid heavy selling pressure, and funds will flip over from trading at premiums to trading at discounts. 
"It's a very expensive lesson to shareholders," Mr. Herzfeld said.
The risk to leveraged funds is even greater. They have been borrowing money at low short-term rates and reinvesting the proceeds at higher long-term rates. The funds profit from the difference, adding it to the yield that is paid to shareholders as dividends. The strategy is well suited to an environment of low and falling interest rates, which is why it has been popular over much of the last three years.
The median dividend yield of a closed-end municipal bond fund that uses leverage was 6.55 percent at the end of the third quarter, compared with 3.91 percent for a fund that does not.
"It's a great strategy unless the market goes against them," said Donald L. Cassidy, a senior research analyst at Lipper.
Just as leverage magnifies gains, so, too, can it make losses more painful when rates start to rise. The funds typically borrow money at very short terms, usually 28 days; they can buy bonds that do not mature for 10 years or longer. So when rates rise, the funds must repay their debts at increasingly higher costs, while the income they receive is locked into an older, lower rate. To deal with that situation, they often cut the dividend. In addition, if long-term rates were to increase significantly, the value of the funds' investments would fall because bond prices move in the opposite direction of their yield.
"It's an example of the principle of 'there's no free lunch,' " Mr. Cassidy said. "If you are getting extra return, you are probably taking on extra risk."
Mr. Margolin added that a leveraged fund could fall by 50 percent more than one that does not use this strategy. "Clearly, there's more volatility in the leverage," he said.
The last time that funds faced such a predicament was in 1999, when the Fed was worried about an overheated economy and raised rates. As a group, closed-end leveraged muni funds fell by 18 percent. 
In 1994, the funds also declined, by 15.8 percent, amid rising rates. Open-end municipal funds that do not use leverage fell 5.7 percent. 
Many investors may not realize that similar losses may be in the offing, Mr. Margolin said. "A lot of the money that's gone into the funds lately is people looking for safety," he said. "They hear the words 'municipal bond fund' and they want to invest. They're not looking for risk."
Fund managers have some tools to dull the blow of a sharp climb in rates, but their prospectuses typically do not allow them to rein in leverage completely. Thomas Spalding, manager of several portfolios at Nuveen Investments in Chicago, said he planned to sell some longer-dated bonds and to buy shorter ones to bring down his funds' overall duration. But for the most part, the funds are at the mercy of the market. If rates go up, their performance suffers; if rates fall, they excel. 
"Deleveraging is not something that could be done without approval of the funds' board of directors," Mr. Spalding said, "and the only reason they would grant something like that is if there was a major change in the federal tax code or something."
DESPITE occasional blips, leveraged closed-end muni funds have proved to be sound investments over the long term. In fact, in the last decade, they have declined in value in just two calendar years, 1994 and 1999. 
"If you go through a whole cycle, you will have gotten the extra yield because of the leverage," Mr. Cassidy said. "But does the average individual investor have the staying power to stick with the funds when things get rough?"

HEADLINE: A Diaspora of Young Israelis, Decompressing 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
IN an art gallery converted from an auto repair shop in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a few dozen young people milled about in chic black eyeglasses and designer sneakers. They laughed and swirled wine in plastic cups. Some dipped into a Brie wheel. The artist whose opening was being celebrated, a lanky 26-year-old with disheveled hair and ponderous eyes, darted around explaining his installation.
 The recent scene was no different from many others in the neighborhood -- except that virtually everyone was chatting in Hebrew. The artist, Uri Aran, glanced around at his friends, an amalgam of Israeli designers, musicians, students and filmmakers who had recently emigrated. "A lot of us want a normal life, where we don't have to read in the newspaper about explosions and make phone calls to see if everyone's O.K.," he said. 
 His sister, Tal, 27, a dancer, moved to New York from their Jerusalem home four years ago. "I miss home," she said, "but it's too much right now." She shrugged. "I feel guilty about not being there. We're young, and we need to take care of ourselves." 
The Aran siblings and their friends are part of a subculture of young secular Israelis transplanted to New York's bohemian precincts. They have left behind political conflict, violence and a depressed economy.
At sleek bars like Pianos on the Lower East Side, at places like Cafe Orlin and Cafe Mogador on St. Marks Place in the East Village and at the Grand Cafe and Anytime, both in Williamsburg, they are as much purveyors as consumers of youth leisure.
"The East Village is so full of Israelis," said Mr. Aran, with a wry smile. "Sometimes you hear so much Hebrew you want to avoid it." Citywide, Israelis are not a new phenomenon. The Department of City Planning counted around 20,000 Israelis living here in 2000 as authorized residents, a number that has changed little from 1990. They have long been noticeable in parts of Queens and south Brooklyn, and to anyone hiring a moving company in Manhattan. (Los Angeles and Miami also have sizable Israeli populations.) There is no way to tell how many are here on student, artist or tourist visas.
"They're definitely here -- their impact is out there," said Ido Aharoni, a spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in New York. He observed that with many younger Israelis here on nonresident visas and a minor number here illegally, the population is difficult to quantify, though he estimates it in the tens of thousands.
Whatever their numbers, the image of young Israelis living in New York has apparently improved in their homeland.
"People who left in the 70's were considered losers who couldn't hack it," said Daniel Bailey, 34, an architectural welder and furniture designer, at Mr. Aran's opening. Back then, Mr. Bailey recalled, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin denounced Israelis who left as cowards. Even the Hebrew word for those who move away -- yordim -- translates as "those who descend," a phrase that connotes treason. "Now, things have changed," Mr. Bailey said. "Today, people say, 'You're so smart that you left.' "
Many expatriates wrestle with inner conflicts. "My friends and I worry that we are yordim," said Vardit Gross, 30, an administrator of a nonprofit arts organization, who, like many contemporaries, participated in the peace movement in the 1990's. But, she emphasized, "We're not just here because it's bad in Israel; we're here because it's good for now, and it's fun."
Daphna Mor left Tel Aviv seven years ago to study at the Boston Conservatory. After graduation she made a beeline to New York. "Boston is boring," she said. "We're used to living in a rough environment. New York is chaotic, dirty, people are rude -- just like home." 
Ms. Mor, 29, has woven a successful life as a musician and educator, with a band that plays at Joe's Pub in the East Village and the Knitting Factory in TriBeCa, and with regular gigs teaching at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She has a SoHo-born-and-bred boyfriend, a network of friends and a stream of Israeli guests crashing on her couch.
Ms. Mor's best friend, Yael Cohen, 31, joined her two years ago and now goes to a community college, does freelance interior design and works as a waitress at a Williamsburg haunt not far from where they both live. The two seem utterly at home, as if they have spent their entire lives sipping cappuccino and chain-smoking in cute Brooklyn cafes. On weekends, Ms. Mor says, "sometimes we don't even go into Manhattan." 
They talk on the phone nightly and have the keys to each other's apartments. Being in New York together makes them feel closer to home. Still, they are never far from "the situation," as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is called. They served in the army, and their feelings about the conflict -- passionate, contradictory, exasperated -- illustrate how inseparable it is from their lives.
Ms. Mor grew up in an urban left-wing household, and, like Ms. Gross, is a former peace activist. "I'm disturbed on a daily basis with our struggle," she said intensely. "I love Israel because it's my home, but it's like a family -- sometimes you're ashamed of your parents' view."
Ms. Cohen grew up in an agricultural moshav in the Jordan Valley, in the West Bank. A classmate was killed in a terrorist attack, as were several other people there, she said. "Some things I just choose to avoid," she added. "It's too emotional. It's a tragedy, and I cannot deal with tragedies in my daily life." 
Ms. Cohen sounded despondent, but Ms. Mor is optimistic, at least about incremental change. Living in Tel Aviv, she hardly ever met Palestinians, she said. In New York, the people running the delicatessen below her Williamsburg apartment are Palestinian, and she and Ms. Cohen have become friends with them. "None of us talk about politics, but there's something so similar about us," Ms. Mor said. "Sometimes you have to go outside your country, I guess, to see the similarities."
Like many compatriots, they do not show hipness the way American counterparts do. Among those who stroll on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg in trucker caps and white belts, they look a little less ironic and a little more European. But as is customary in the neighborhood, they're enjoying an extended adolescence, postponing what Ms. Cohen called "the dogma of life."
For Israeli women, she said, that means high school, the army, traveling for a year, college, getting married and having a baby, all by the age of 26 or so. "I needed more time," she said. "Maybe because I'm curious. Or immature."
At a trance party last month in Hell's Kitchen, hundreds of Israelis bounced around all night to a relentless beat, with a smattering of Japanese, Americans and Europeans among them.
"It's a lot of young, progressive-minded people who just want to live a peaceful life and have fun," said Shai Raban, 26, one of four D.J.'s working. A mix of Eastern mystic and downtown cool, Mr. Raban finished his army service three years ago and because of "bad vibes" in Israel came to New York, diving head first into a scene that closely resembled the one at home. "There's this whole Israeli trance community here -- D.J.'s, promoters, musicians," he said. "People come here for decompression."
Indeed, there's a trance party just about every weekend -- some celebrating Jewish holidays like Purim and Rosh Hashana (New Year), though not the more solemn Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, which begins tonight. 
The music -- a lush, psychedelic, upbeat genre of electronica -- attracts huge Israeli crowds, mostly in their early 20's. At 1 a.m. on a Friday, a line had formed outside a trance party in Chelsea. Friends welcomed each other with European-style kisses on two cheeks. They waited patiently, knowing that the main set -- two Israeli D.J.'s spinning for the first time in the United States -- would not start until 2 or 3 a.m.
Unlike the more artsy, sophisticated Israelis in Brooklyn, the trance crowd is younger, wilder and fresher from the army. They work as movers, retailers and waitresses. Some say they are here just to make money and are eager to go home. Others say they are here as a temporary stop on their global wanderings, planning to head to India or South America next. Still others say that they love it here and would like to stay.
Many say that they are having fun but just cannot imagine what the future holds -- a sentiment that does not necessarily change with age. 
Oren Kaplan, 37, who came in 1996, plays with Gogol Bordello, a band that has performed its mix of gypsy music, Russian punk and cabaret at the Whitney Museum. Mr. Kaplan has the chill, laconic demeanor that is de rigueur on the Lower East Side, where he lives. Sipping tea at a cafe, he perked up to consider whether he would ever return to live in Israel. "I would go back there one day when I'm older, if there's peace and quiet," he said. "The weather's great. The food is great. It's beautiful." He paused. "Or maybe Barcelona."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; 
Deep-Value Investing, Now Back in Style

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE investment procedure at First Eagle Funds sounds simple enough.
 As Jean-Marie Eveillard, the lead manager of First Eagle, the five-fund value boutique, explained, "We are trying to figure out what a somewhat knowledgeable buyer expecting a reasonable return would be willing to pay in cash -- no paper, please -- for the entire business." 
 If the price of the stock is a lot less, say 30 percent, it is a buy candidate.
Though the strategy proved ineffective during the technology boom of the late 1990's, it has been especially sound over the last three years. The bear market left plenty of bargains for Mr. Eveillard and his deputy, Charles de Vaulx, to choose from. 
The flagship First Eagle Global fund rose by 15.6 percent, annualized, during the five years through September, according to Morningstar, handily beating the 6.1 percent return of the average global equity fund.
First Eagle's Overseas and Gold funds show similar five-year outperformance. U.S. Value, which was introduced in September 2001, has also beaten its sector average comfortably during its short history.
Global, Gold and Overseas, which invests solely in foreign markets, have five-star ratings -- the highest -- from Morningstar and Standard & Poor's. U.S. Value, being somewhat new, is unrated by either company.
First Eagle Fund of America, the remaining offering of the fund family, is the only one that has done worse than other funds of its type. Morningstar and S.& P., however, still give it a respectable four-star rating. 
The fund is also the only one that is not managed by Mr. Eveillard and Mr. de Vaulx. Its managers are Harold Levy and David Cohen. The family of funds is owned by Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder Inc., the 200-year-old New York investment bank.
FIRST EAGLE'S managers covet companies and sectors that others avoid. From early 2000 until very recently, that was almost the entire stock market. At the bottom of the market's decline, they were finding value just about everywhere they looked.
"In the second half of 2002 and the first three months of 2003 we thought there were attractive valuations in the United States, Europe and Japan," Mr. Eveillard said. "We were buyers practically every day."
Now that the markets are recovering, the managers say, acquiring cheap companies is more challenging. 
"As prices for securities go up, the number of opportunities is reduced," said Mr. Eveillard, who has managed First Eagle Global since 1979.
That is particularly the case in the United States, which is "much more expensive than foreign markets," said Mr. de Vaulx, who began working for Mr. Eveillard in 1987, fresh out of business school. 
"As a result, we are struggling to find anything of decent value in the U.S., especially since we tend to focus on small and midcap stocks," Mr. de Vaulx said. "They lagged tremendously in the late 1990's and have recovered in the last three or four years."
Knowing what a company is worth is harder than it may seem. The French bank Societe Generale might have discovered this after it sold its American fund management arm, the Societe Generale Asset Management Corporation, to Bleichroeder. The acquisition included the Overseas, Global and Gold funds and the services of Mr. Eveillard and Mr. de Vaulx. 
The sale was completed in January 2000. That was just two months before global stock markets topped and the popularity of momentum investing -- buying more of whatever was rising fastest -- ended abruptly on Wall Street and Main Street, and value investing came back into vogue.
Mr. Eveillard said: "Societe Generale decided they didn't love me anymore, so they decided to sell me and my operation. In the late 90's, in less than three years, shareholders in our Global and Overseas funds abandoned us. One said I was half senile."
Mr. Eveillard conceded that shareholders had reason to be disillusioned. "I'm a one-trick pony," he said. "Between the spring of 1995 and the spring of 2000, we made money for shareholders in our funds, but less -- sometimes much less -- than people who were willing to buy new-economy stocks." 
Gregg Wolper, an analyst at Morningstar who covers First Eagle, said that this strict adherence to a deep-value style would leave the funds prone to weakness again should growth stocks enjoy another run of lopsided outperformance. "The managers would not adjust their approach to try to fit in," he said.
But over the long haul, First Eagle's hit-them-where-they-ain't strategy has done more good than harm, Mr. Wolper said. The managers have achieved success by seeking securities that are out of favor "and being willing to wait a long time for their market values to rise," he said.
As other investors were deserting Japan, First Eagle was buying stocks of insurers like Mitsui-Sumitomo. 
Calling insurers "disguised investment companies," Mr. Eveillard said their core business was not appealing but share prices were so low that buyers could pick up the companies' ample investment portfolios at deep discounts.
The funds also own Japanese drug stocks like Ono Pharmaceuticals, which are much cheaper than their American equivalents, he said. Another holding, one of the largest in the global and overseas funds, is Shimano Inc., a Japanese maker of high-end bicycle parts.
The funds own several stocks in Korea, where the managers "went back in last year when the market fell back sharply," Mr. de Vaulx said. Among its holdings there are Samsung Electronics, the office furniture maker Fursys and Lotte Confectionery.
One of Mr. Eveillard's favorite European stocks is Robertet, a French producer of flavors and fragrances. 
"We figure the business is conservatively worth 150 euros per share and the stock is selling at 90," he said. "We already have a fat profit, but as long as we believe the stock is worth 150, we'll continue to hold it."
First Eagle's American stocks include Hawaiian Electric Industries, a power generator that "happens to own a savings bank," Mr. de Vaulx said. The stock, which recently yielded nearly 6 percent, has been depressed by disdain for utilities among investors, who seem to be ignoring the fact that much of the business is tied up in the bank. 
When Mr. Eveillard describes Rayonier Inc., an American forest products concern, it is hard at first to see why it is First Eagle Global's largest holding. "The processing of wood into pulp and paper is a terrible business, very capital intensive," he explained. 
What makes the company appealing, he said, is that "Rayonier moved away substantially from processing and became almost entirely focused on ownership of timberland," a much more lucrative enterprise.
"You could see a year or two ago, when the stock was lower, that the market failed to consider that Rayonier was almost entirely in timber ownership," Mr. Eveillard said. The share price valued the land at nearly a 30 percent discount, he said.
MR. EVEILLARD is no slave to investment fashion, but time is another matter. He is 63 and due to retire in January 2005, although he will stay as a consultant for two additional years. 
Mr. de Vaulx will take over, and both managers say that the funds will continue to be run according to the same philosophy -- but not necessarily at the same speed.
"Stocks do not stay cheap as long as they used to, so I guess I would have a tendency to acquire positions faster than Jean-Marie would," Mr. de Vaulx said. "But he and I happen to have the same aversion to risk. We're not gamblers. We hate the idea of losing money."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; 
For 3 Funds, Fireworks in Small Stocks

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
FUNDS that focused on stocks of small companies generally did well in the third quarter, and those that held small, fast-growing companies did particularly well.
 Managers of three of the top-performing funds talked about the reasons for their strong performance and about their expectations for the stock market. 

Risk Was Rewarded
Strong sales growth among its portfolio companies helped the $105 million Henlopen fund, up 23.8 percent, take first place for the quarter.
"We look for companies with growing revenues," Michael L. Hershey, the fund president, said from his office in Kennett Square, Pa. "Growth starts on the top line." The fund is named for a cape on Delaware Bay where Mr. Hershey has a vacation home.
His investing strategy did not change during the third quarter, he said, but after the market lows in March, investors willing to take more risk began to be rewarded.
Among his winners was Igen International, a biotechnology company in Gaithersburg, Md. Its stock advanced 83.8 percent in the quarter. On July 25, Igen and Roche Holding jointly announced that they had reached a definitive agreement to resolve a long-running dispute over the rights to Origen, Igen's electrochemiluminescence technology, which is used by Roche's diagnostics division. In electrochemiluminescence, certain chemical compounds emit light when electrochemically stimulated.
Igen's share price surged on the day of the announcement, closing at $59.25, up from $37.20 the day before. Before the settlement was announced, Igen was losing money, much of it because of legal expenses associated with the lawsuit, Mr. Hershey said. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger last week, and the deal is expected to close by year-end, Mr. Hershey said.
Another biotechnology company, Applied Molecular Evolution, in San Diego, also benefited from the economic turnaround, Mr. Hershey said. Its share price climbed 107.8 percent in the quarter. The company has a robust product pipeline, he said, and works with bigger companies like Medimmune, which uses Applied Molecular's protein immunization technology to improve some drugs.
The fund also made money with the WSFS Financial Corporation of Wilmington, Del., the parent company of the Wilmington Savings Fund Society, which operates 25 retail banking offices. Its shares gained 11 percent in the quarter.
The company's strong share price is "recognition of what has been hard work by the bank's management over the last few years," Mr. Hershey said. Another factor was its sale of a big portfolio of reverse mortgages, which "put real value directly on the balance sheet and into the price of the stock," he said.
He expects the economy to continue improving gradually. "I think interest rates will stay low and we'll see opportunities for growth ahead," he said.

Explosive Growth Sought
Small, rapidly growing companies helped the $230 million Oberweis Emerging Growth fund secure fourth place among diversified stock funds in the third quarter, with a 19.5 percent return.
"We identify high-growth, small-capitalization companies that still trade at reasonable valuations and that are in explosive stages of their growth cycle," said James W. Oberweis, 29, the fund's lead manager.
He buys companies with market caps below $1 billion that have at least 30 percent average annual growth in revenue and per-share earnings. The fund holds about 75 stocks.
"We're at a point in time that's exceptionally favorable for small growth stocks," Mr. Oberweis said from his office in North Aurora, Ill. "The outlook for the economy is a bit more upbeat than earlier this year and certainly all of last year, and smaller companies typically adapt most quickly to economic changes to take advantage of an upswing."
One of the fund's strongest performers was Switchboard, in Westborough, Mass., which provides Internet yellow pages and other online directories. Its share price rose 151.4 percent during the quarter. "Many Internet companies have gotten beaten up because they're unprofitable," Mr. Oberweis said. Switchboard turned profitable in the second quarter, he said, and "the stock took off as people saw that the business model really worked."
He also made money with Abaxis Inc., in Union City, Calif. Its stock price gained 115.2 percent. The company sells blood analysis systems to for veterinary and human use. 
Another winner was Bradley Pharmaceuticals, in Fairfield, N.J. The company's stock price rose 65.2 percent, driven by strong sales of its Carmol prescription skin lotions. The company reported 81 percent growth in earnings per share and 75 percent growth in sales for the three months ended June 30, Mr. Oberweis said.
He expects that stock prices of small growth companies will be less explosive in the months ahead. "Certainly, valuations are not as cheap as they were in the beginning of the year," he said. "But we're still optimistic that small growth companies will do well over the next two to three years as the period of the recession gives way to economic growth," he said.

Environmental Screening
Smaller stocks also drove the returns of the $73 million Winslow Green Growth fund, which returned 18.1 percent and finished in seventh place. Its manager, Jackson W. Robinson, 61, said the fund bought what he considered to be environmentally responsible businesses.
"Our green screens eliminate companies that have environmentally related issues, which ultimately can be disastrous for balance sheets," he said from his office in Boston. The fund will not buy companies involved with things like asbestos, tobacco and percolate, a chemical used in rocket fuel, he said.
One of his top performers has been the Polymedica Corporation, based in Woburn, Mass., a medical products and services company. He began buying shares in September 2001, after the stock price fell to about $15 from nearly $50 because of news of investigations into its accounting practices by the Department of Justice. Last quarter, the Securities and Exchange Commission closed its investigation, finding that the company's accounting practices were appropriate. Its share price was up 15.6 percent in the quarter.
Another winner was Flamel Technologies, a French biotechnology company whose shares trade as American depository receipts on Nasdaq. Management recently announced a contract with Bristol-Myers Squibb for a timed-release system for delivering insulin to diabetics. Mr. Robinson called the deal "a very big win for the company." Its timed-release drug technology is unique, he added, and has other potential applications. The share price climbed 150.6 percent.
Mr. Robinson also holds shares of Chiquita Brands International, based in Cincinnati, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in March 2002 with a new chief executive, a strong balance sheet and, in Mr. Robinson's opinion, greater sensitivity to the environment. Chiquita's shares gained 22.1 percent in the quarter. After selling its noncore businesses, the company reported record earnings for the second quarter.
It is planning to grow, Mr. Robinson said, by using its well-known brand name to introduce a fresh-fruit product line in what is a $1 billion market growing at 20 percent annually. And it is considering a line of Chiquita Smoothies juice drinks, he said. Based on his 2004 earnings estimate of $2.50 a share, he said, the company's stock price could reach $50 in the next 12 to 18 months.
Mr. Robinson said that a lot of money that flowed out of small growth stocks into value stocks during the last three years is now returning. Over all, he expects companies that can meet their earnings targets to perform strongly.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; 
Can Confidence Be Restored?

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
"The mutual fund industry has been blessed -- and blessed is the only word -- by being relatively free of scandal"
Harvey J. Goldschmid, member,
 Securities and Exchange Commission 
 THE lack of scandal has been one of the principal boasts of the mutual fund industry, and Mr. Goldschmid's quotation was displayed prominently this spring when the Investment Company Institute, the industry's trade association, held its annual meeting. 
"I have attended more than 30 consecutive general membership meetings," said Matthew P. Fink, the association's president, in his speech to the gathering. "At virtually all of them, industry leaders have stood before you and said that our No. 1 responsibility is to do everything we can to maintain and enhance public confidence in mutual funds.
"Mutual fund leaders didn't just politely listen to these words," he added. "They acted."
Perhaps they did not act enough.
While the industry may boast of being "relatively free of scandal," the key word is "relatively." 
The fund industry is coping with disclosures indicating that some investors have not been treated well. Those disclosures include late trading, market timing and overcharging customers who invest considerable sums but are denied volume discounts on sales charges.
There is also controversy over "soft-dollar" commissions, in which fees paid by funds when they buy and sell stocks are used to pay for research and other services that might be borne by the fund sponsor out of the fees it receives for managing the fund. 
New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's discovery that hedge funds were allowed to put in orders hours after the stock market closed -- and get the 4 p.m. price -- stunned many in the industry. Mr. Spitzer has filed a criminal charge against a Bank of America broker, and a portfolio manager at Millennium Partners, a New York hedge fund, has pleaded guilty in connection with late trading. The mutual fund industry is now waiting to learn the extent to which fund companies are implicated in such late trading.
Clearly, late trading can be theft. Normally, investors are allowed to buy and sell fund shares until 4 p.m. at that day's closing net asset value. Even trades made just before the deadline can hurt other shareholders because the fund may not be able to buy or sell assets at those prices the next day. If one trader invests just before prices soar, the fund will have to invest that money at higher prices. That dilutes the interests of other shareholders.
PRESUMABLY, there is a randomness to that problem. It is just as likely that prices will fall the next day, in which case other fund holders benefit from the money that came in at yesterday's higher net asset value but is being put to work at today's lower prices.
Late trading changes those dynamics. If one investor can buy as late as 6 p.m., as Bank of America allowed the hedge fund to do, then that investor can act after late news and the stock index futures market, which stays open all night, have made it clear that prices will rise the next morning. The winner is the late trader. The losers are the other investors in the funds being traded.
Why would anyone allow that to happen? Bank of America officials seem to have been lured by the prospect of other business from the hedge fund, Canary Capital. And a decision to put more money into a family of funds increases the management fees for the fund manager and, perhaps, allows marketing officials to meet their goals.
It is not hard for a brokerage firm to allow late trading. Such firms have some time to report to fund companies the trades that come in by 4 p.m., and there does not seem to have been much effort by fund companies or regulators to police whether the trades actually arrived on time. The fund industry hopes that no other fund sponsor will be found to have had employees who sanctioned the practice.
But there appears to be little interest in the obvious fix: Require that all trades arrive at the fund company by 4 p.m. to get that day's price. That would make it easy to spot late trading if any had occurred, but it might also depress fund sales to people who want to move fast. The funds like to have that money to manage.
That money has, however, produced what are called "market-timing" abuses. Those occur when big traders move in or out of funds at the end of the trading day. That is not illegal, but it can damage other investors in the funds. That is why many fund groups have policies saying they try to prohibit or restrict such short-term trading.
It now appears that at a number of fund companies, those rules were ignored or evaded to get money from big traders. Last week concerns were revealed at Alliance Capital and Prudential, on top of firms such as Janus that had already conceded there were problems and promised to restore money to shareholders. 
Such market timing is most prevalent in funds that invest abroad. The Japanese market closes at 2 a.m. New York time, and European markets close by noon in New York. Market movements before 4 p.m. can make it clear that foreign stock prices will move up or down the next day. If a fund does not adjust those prices when it calculates its 4 p.m. net asset value, it has "stale prices" that are begging to be picked off by clever market timers.
Using data from some funds that report assets on a daily basis, Eric Zitzewitz, an assistant professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, has estimated that there have been substantial costs to shareholders of funds that do not make such adjustments. Moreover, he looked at his data again after the Bank of America revelations and concluded that late trading had been going on for years.
The industry disputes his methods, but the slowness of some fund groups to move to adjust prices has left them vulnerable to criticism. 
The issue of overcharging fund buyers stems from the myriad fees and commissions in funds sold by brokers. Investors who buy front-end load shares -- typically called Class A shares -- have lower continuing expenses than investors who buy other shares, typically called Class B or Class C shares. Which class is best depends on how much is to be invested and how long the investor plans to leave the money in the fund.
Investors who put enough money into a fund can get the Class A share without paying much, or any, front-end commission, thanks to so-called break points in commission fee schedules. But in some cases, regulators have found, investors were not given the benefit of break points. In others, investors with a lot of money were sold Class B shares anyway, presumably because that produced more money for the broker making the sale. Under regulatory pressure, funds are now offering refunds to some customers.
The view among regulators about those abuses is relatively benign. Some say the fund industry became too complicated and its record keeping did not keep up with the complexities. Perhaps so, and better information about fees and break points may help. But such abuses of investors are not new.
In her 1995 book, "Fidelity's World," Diana B. Henriques, a business reporter for The New York Times, recounted the tale of one 1950's case in which investigators found that a purchase order for $255,000 of fund shares had been broken into 11 orders, "each falling just below the level at which a volume discount on the sales commission would have kicked in." The broker was able to collect an extra $8,200 in commissions from the buyers, an order of nuns.
THE current wave of reform is likely to force mutual funds to disclose their holdings more frequently -- quarterly instead of semiannually -- and to put more pressure on fund directors to prevent abuses. And it is showing investors that they may need to worry about hidden costs as well as visible ones, and about arcane fund policies on such issues as stale prices.
Still, evidence that the mutual fund industry's image isn't entirely tarnished comes from the current trends in corporate governance -- which seem to be aimed at giving funds more power, not less.
On Wednesday, the S.E.C. is expected to propose rules to make it easier for major shareholders to nominate directors to run against incumbent directors at companies where shareholders are unhappy with management. The assumption is that institutional money managers, including mutual funds, will be a force for change where it is needed in corporate boardrooms.
That was once quite controversial. After the bull market of the late 1960's collapsed, many blamed the managers of "go-go" funds for putting money into dubious companies and funding conglomerates that had gotten into financial trouble after gobbling up too many companies.
In a 1970 book, "The '70s Crash and How to Survive It," John F. Lawrence and Paul E. Steiger recounted scandals involving mutual funds, including Bernard Cornfeld's Investors Overseas Services, and assessed whether mutual funds ought to have more power. "In theory," they conceded, "the responsible use of the voting power of the institutions could prove a boon to American management efficiency."
But, they added, there were two strong arguments against the idea. First, they feared the "massive concentration of economic power" that would entail. "The second argument is far more devastating," they wrote. "The funds have already gone a long way toward interfering in management -- and look at the chaos they have created." Not only were the funds to blame for troubled conglomerates, but "there is a nation's stock market so out of whack that the average investor has lost confidence in a stock certificate as a thing of worth."
Funds were blamed then for a loss of investor confidence. Now it is hoped that giving them more power will help restore that confidence.

HEADLINE: From Pitchforks to Proposition 13 

BYLINE:  By David M. Kennedy; David M. Kennedy is professor of history at Stanford University.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
On Jan. 25, 1787, 1,200 desperate farmers brandishing barrel staves and pitchforks attacked the federal arsenal in Springfield, Mass. They called themselves the Regulators. Led by a debt-plagued veteran of Bunker Hill and Saratoga named Daniel Shays, they sought firearms with which to enforce their threats to close the courts in western Massachusetts and compel the legislature to enact debt-relief measures, including an inflationary paper currency and an end to mortgage foreclosures.
 A single cannon volley killed four of the embattled farmers. Then a Revolutionary War hero, Gen. Benjamin Lincoln, arrived with a militia that scattered the remaining rebels and relentlessly hunted them down through the heavy snow. Yet the Regulators' failed outburst had consequences that have shaped the character of American politics for more than two centuries, up to the current recall election in California. 
 The uprising was handily crushed. But it intimidated the Massachusetts legislature into enacting laws that menaced the interests of the monied class. Many leaders in the founding generation gagged on this apparently craven pandering to the popular will. Outright insurrection was one thing, but the state legislature's cavalier disregard for property rights was a far more insidious threat. "An elective despotism," Thomas Jefferson wrote, "was not the government we fought for."
Shays' Rebellion, in short, had demonstrated that America was not immune from the inherent affliction that theorists of democracy had warned against since the days of the ancient Greeks: that a government based on the will of the majority would inevitably yield to the demands of the "mob" and lead to a tyranny of the majority. Such a polity would be resentful toward excellence and callous toward minority rights. Worst of all, it would wield the power of the state against more prosperous members of society and confiscate their wealth.
To protect the United States from that unhappy fate, leaders like James Madison called for radically revising the Articles of Confederation, under whose rules the fledgling republic was then governed. The result was the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which convened four months after General Lincoln turned back the rebels. At the convention, Madison and others drafted a new fundamental law whose checks and balances and elaborate federal structure would, among other things, frustrate the confiscatory designs of future would-be Regulators. For better or worse, Daniel Shays thus deserves to be recognized as a founder.
Over time, many Americans came to believe that the Constitution's drafters had seen their duty -- and overdone it. The framers had created a federal governmental apparatus too well insulated from the popular will, too difficult to mobilize for any common purpose, whether confiscatory or constructive, and too easily hijacked by special interests whose machinations eluded public scrutiny. At the dawn of the 20th century, that kind of thinking animated a host of so-called progressive reformers, conspicuously including a cantankerous California Republican named Hiram Johnson.
A self-styled "natural rebel" (and Arnold Schwarzenegger's improbable political hero), Johnson was elected governor of California in 1910. In a flurry of political innovation unmatched before or since in the state, Johnson flamboyantly battled giant corporations like Southern Pacific Railroad and incorporated several radical reforms into the California constitution. They included the direct election of United States senators, previously selected by the legislature; the initiative, by which citizens can directly write laws; the referendum, by which they can undo the work of the legislature; and of course the recall, which provides for the removal of elected officials.
In the spirit of Daniel Shays, Hiram Johnson sought to transform California into a model of majoritarian, popularly responsive, direct democracy. But one must always be careful what one wishes for: Johnson would probably be appalled by many of the results of his reforms.
The initiative process that he championed has contributed to the near-fatal weakening of the legislature, and has created prodigious opportunities for manipulating and mismanaging the state's political business. Legislators have been reduced to diddling uselessly in Sacramento while various interest groups routinely bamboozle the electorate with proliferating ballot initiatives that are poorly written, often contradictory, and nearly always bad law. Proposition 13, for example, which passed in 1978, addressed a real problem -- wildly rising property taxes -- with an inept combination of inequitably defined tax limits and impossibly large supermajority requirements for any revisions in the law.
Proposition 13 led directly to drastic slippage in financing for local schools, and has contributed heavily to the state's current fiscal crisis. But as Warren Buffett found out when he urged Arnold Schwarzenegger to make the overhaul of Proposition 13 the centerpiece of his gubernatorial campaign, even suggesting changes to that infamous initiative is forbidden. (Mr. Schwarzenegger told Mr. Buffett that if he mentioned Proposition 13 again he would have to do 500 push-ups. Mr. Buffett has not been heard from since.)
Proposition 13's untouchability, and Mr. Schwarzenegger's fierce commitment to it, suggest that something has happened in American society that would have mystified Daniel Shays -- and Hiram Johnson as well. In their very different ways, they sought greater democracy as the means to a government that was more responsive to the masses.
But in California more democracy has produced not more attacks on the wealthy and big business but chronic chaos and even paralysis -- a kind of political catatonia perversely sanctified by neoconservative and libertarian dogmas that assert, as another former governor of California put it, that "government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." (Shays may have agreed with the second clause of that sentence, but certainly not with the first; he wanted to use the government to protect debtors and the disadvantaged.)
To the extent that Californians -- and Americans -- subscribe to that view, they have confounded the predictions of countless theorists about the nature of democratic politics. Among those theorists, Alexis de Tocqueville is an exception, for he identified the peculiarities of the American case now so vividly manifest in California, that most American of states. The characteristic social class that American society nurtured, said Tocqueville, was composed of "eager and apprehensive men of small property." Though born in revolution, their country was unlikely ever again to undergo revolutionary upheaval. "They love change, but they dread revolutions," Tocqueville concluded, because "they continually and in a thousand ways feel that they might lose by one."
That social class of small property owners, and its attendant attitudes, are now ascendant in California, and perhaps in the nation at large. Their influence explains why the government from which Shays demanded relief, and the government that Johnson tried to place more firmly in the hands of the people, has now become the object of popular suspicion and hostility. Americans apparently prefer misgovernment that will leave them to their own devices to an effective government that might actually do something for them -- or ask something of them.
We've come a long way from the Regulator to the Terminator.

HEADLINE: The Real Patriot Act 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
This is a column about the war of ideas -- but first a word about gasoline prices and Hummers.
 In case you missed it, OPEC just decided to slash its oil production to keep gasoline prices high. I guess it would be foolhardy to expect that maybe Saudi Arabia or Kuwait would use its influence in OPEC to hold down prices at a time when Western economies are struggling to climb out of recession. Everybody's just looking out for themselves. So why don't we? 
 There's all sorts of talk now about how to finance the $87 billion price tag for the reconstruction of Iraq. I say, let's make OPEC pay -- indirectly. Let's have a $1 a gallon gasoline tax and call it the "Patriot Tax." We could use the revenue it would raise -- about $110 billion a year -- to finance the entire reconstruction of Iraq, with plenty left for other good works.
Here's the logic: The two things OPEC hates most are falling oil prices and gasoline taxes -- and the Patriot Tax would promote both. The reason that OPEC hates gasoline taxes is that if anyone is going to benefit from higher prices at the pump, OPEC wants it to be OPEC, not the consuming countries. It drives OPEC crazy that the Europeans pay roughly twice as much per gallon as Americans do, because their governments slap on so many taxes.
A $1 a gallon gasoline tax, phased in, would not only be a huge revenue generator (even with tax rebates to ease the burden on low-income people, farmers and truckers) but also a huge driver of conservation and reduced oil imports. Not only would it mean less money for Saudi Arabia to transfer to Wahhabi clerics to spread their intolerant brand of Islam around the world, but it would radically improve America's standing in Europe, where we are resented for being the world's energy hog.
President Bush could even say that this tax is his long-promised alternative to Kyoto, because the amount of energy conservation it would produce would result in a much greater reduction in U.S. energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, than anything Kyoto would have mandated.
In short, a tax that finances the democratization of Iraq, takes money away from those who would use it to spread ideas harmful to us, weakens OPEC, makes us more energy independent, reduces the deficit and overnight improves the world's view of us -- from selfish, Hummer-driving louts to good global citizens -- would be the real patriot act. (It would also encourage Iraq not to become another oil-dependent state, but to build a middle class by learning to tap its people's entrepreneurship and creativity, not just its oil wells.)
"Until we raise energy prices we really aren't fighting the war on terrorism, because we're doing nothing to deny the countries who fund terrorists the cash they need to destroy us," says Philip K. Verleger Jr., the energy expert. "We could use the excess revenues to fund a true Manhattan Project to cut U.S. oil consumption in half by 2007, thereby permanently making OPEC irrelevant. That would be a truly patriotic move."
Yes, yes -- I know, the Bush team would never even consider such a tax. But that's my point. When you have an administration that will not even consider undertaking the most obviously right course -- a gasoline tax -- that would produce so many strategic, economic and political benefits for America, then how do we win this war in the long run? Because this war on terrorism is not simply a military fight. That's the easy part. More important, it is a war of ideas. And to win a war of ideas we need to do two things:
First, we need to successfully partner with Iraqis to create a free, open and progressive model in the heart of the Arab-Muslim world to promote the ideas of tolerance, pluralism and democratization. But second, and just as important, we need to set an example ourselves, in order to get others -- both potential allies and longtime adversaries -- to buy into our war, to believe that we are not just out to benefit ourselves or protect ourselves, but that we really are out to repair the world.
Unfortunately, this president -- for ideological reasons, because of whom he is beholden to economically, and because he knows that the American people never demanded this war, so he cannot demand much from them -- will not summon Americans to set that example. He will not summon us to be the best global citizens we can be. The Bush war cry is: "Do as we say, not as we do. Good ideas for Iraqis, gluttony for Americans."
That is so wrong. We may not get a better Iraq out of this war, but let's at least make sure we get a better America.

When a Simple Phone Call Becomes a Costly Swindle

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY

 BODY:
Patricia Toledo, a waitress from Astoria, Queens, called the number in the newspaper ad on behalf of her brother, who was looking for a job. Sofia Espinal, an unemployed machine operator from Williamsburg who was looking for an apartment, called a similar number on a lamppost flier. 
 Both fell victim to an apparent swindle. The phone numbers direct callers to other numbers, which, when called, surface on phone bills in charges of $18 and more. 
Ms. Espinal said the flier she had seen in Flushing in August advertised apartment rentals with no fees or credit checks. When she called the number on her mother's cellphone, the number she was instructed to call carried the same first six digits as the numbers used by similar advertisers: 718-540. 
 Like 900 numbers, phone numbers beginning with 540 carry toll charges. Providers of such numbers are required to state those charges up front, either in print or by a recorded message that allows a caller to hang up without being billed. 
 Ms. Espinal said she heard no such message when she called the 540 number, only a garbled recorded voice that seemed to be giving apartment information. Not realizing she was dialing a toll number with a $28 connection charge and a rate of 20 cents a minute, she called four times, fruitlessly, to get a better connection. 
 A few weeks later, her mother's phone bill had a $112.80 charge for the calls. That is when Ms. Espinal said she realized that "they ripped me off." 
 When Ms. Toledo called a number beginning 718-540 in a jobs ad, a recorded voice said the call would cost $18 unless she hung up. "I hung up right away but they charged me anyway," she said. 
 Both women said they called Verizon to dispute the charges and were told they would get credit.
 Ms. Toledo also complained to her state assemblyman, Jose Peralta, who then reported the problem to state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. "We've received numerous complaints about this," said Brad Maione, a spokesman. The attorney general's office is now investigating. 
 Mr. Peralta said of the swindle: "It's targeted to minority and immigrant communities where they know there's a need for apartments and jobs. Most likely when people make these phone calls, they won't check their phone bills. Or if they check, they won't know who to call to question them."

Markets Open 3rd Quarter on a Strong Note

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
What a difference a week makes. After plunging in the final full week of the third quarter, major stock market averages had their biggest weekly gain in more than four months. 
 Optimism about third-quarter earnings and a better-than-expected September jobs report helped to fuel the gains. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 259.23 points, or 2.8 percent, to a close at 9,572.31. Only two stocks of the 30 that make up the blue-chip index -- Merck and AT&T -- posted declines for the week. Intel was the Dow's biggest winner, rising 8.8 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, meanwhile, gained 33 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,029.85. Siebel Systems was the best performer among S. &P. 500 stocks.
The Nasdaq composite index shot up 88.50 points, or 4.9 percent, to 1,880.57.
It was the best weekly performance for the Nasdaq and the Dow since the week ended May 30. The S.& P. 500 had its best week since the week ended May 2.
Bond yields, which spent much of September moving lower, rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note stood at 4.20 percent late Friday, up from 4 percent a week earlier. KENNETH N. GILPIN

Employed,Yes. But Not Necessarily Happy.

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
You'd think, with unemployment lurking in every byway, that those with jobs would tally their blessings daily. Not so. Job satisfaction -- assuming a mere survey could measure such a many-sided beast -- has been slipping steadily since 1995. 
 In fact, the latest survey -- done for the Conference Board by NFO WorldGroup and covering 5,000 households -- showed a grim milestone: fewer than half of Americans now say they're satisfied with their jobs. 
 The most content? Those over 64, at 54 percent. That makes sense: many unhappy people in that group have already retired, if their 401(k)'s have not melted down. The least content were those 45 to 54, at 46 percent. Midlife-crisis time, perhaps? Finally, higher earnings equaled higher satisfaction. Of course. HUBERT B. HERRING

< HDL>How High A Bounce For Chip Stocks?

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
IS there more stretch in the SOX? 
 A year ago this Thursday, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, commonly known as the SOX, closed at 214.06. It has rebounded nicely, closing on Friday at 449.12 . 
 But it is still a long way from the peak of 1,332.73 it reached on March 10, 2000. Rick Whittington, a semiconductor analyst at American Technology Research, a broker-dealer in Greenwich, Conn., talked last week about why he is bullish on chip stocks. 
Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. The SOX index has risen considerably, but you are still positive about the sector. Why?

A. First, the pricing environment is better. From the latter part of 2000 into the first part of 2002, we had sharp price declines in semiconductors at a rate of about 5 percent to 7 percent a year. Pricing started to firm about a year ago. And I think you are about to see a visible round of price increases by the chip producers. Over the next three years, I think prices will go up about 10 to 15 percent.
Second, production is coming back. It has been visibly recovering for about a year, but until fairly recently there has been a debate about how sustainable that recovery is. 
Finally, demand is firming from a broad array of users, from cellphone manufacturers to personal and notebook computers to consumer electronic products. 

Q. Are investors still recovering from the market decline that started in March 2000?

A. People are shellshocked throughout the investment community. People were hurt and damaged terribly. And the scandals that have rocked Wall Street have also hurt. Investors have been unwilling to accept comments from the brokerage companies because of the damage done to the reputations of those making recommendations. But managements from the chip companies are increasingly showing up on television and elsewhere and speaking extremely favorably about current business conditions.
They weren't doing that in the winter or the spring of this year.

Q. Have semiconductor companies been big cost cutters over the last few years?

A. The restructuring and expense reductions have easily been as great as they were in the early 1990's.
To give one example, Intel's capital spending budget is running at about 15 percent of revenues. That's about half of its 20-year average. Put another way, in the third quarter, Intel will have revenues of almost $8 billion. For the entire year this year, their capital spending budget is $4 billion.

Q. How long do up cycles in the semiconductor industry usually last?

A. The typical up cycle lasts three years. You could argue that this one didn't really start until after the end of the Iraq war. But even with the war and SARS, the second quarter was a good quarter for the chip makers. So we have at least two very strong years ahead of us.

Q. Is it realistic to think that semiconductor stocks could get as hot in this cycle as they were in the last one?

A. Nobody is looking at the March 2000 peak as the bogey. In the winter of 2002, the SOX was trading between 550 and 600. Right now it is still well below where it was a year and a half ago, when business was collapsing. The index is off the bottom, but we had one big sell-off last year.

Q. Which particular companies do you recommend, or should investors buy a basket of these companies?

A. Buying a basket is precisely the way to do this. There are 40 quality chip and chip equipment companies that have been around for at least four or five economic cycles.
I am recommending virtually the same companies now that I was 10 years ago. We know how to analyze these companies when their earnings power starts to turn. 
Intel should be part of the basket, because of its dominance of the chip market. It has a competitor in Advanced Micro Devices, but Intel has exploited the wireless computing and networking boom. If past cycles are a guide, it is possible the company could earn as much as $2 a share next year. If that happens, the stock could trade at between $40 and $50 a share. 
Maxim Integrated Products is another company I like. They make analog semiconductors that used to go exclusively into industrial and high-end computers but are now finding their way into a broad range of digital consumer products and even automobiles. This company went public in 1985 and has had only one follow-on offering since. Yet it has a balance sheet with no debt and almost $1.2 billion in cash. At the moment, the valuation on this stock is high. 
And we like Applied Materials in the capital equipment area. It is the leader.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
My Exit Music, Please

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
Since March 2001, the national payroll has shrunk by more than three million jobs. Still, at any time in any economy, it isn't hard to find people with jobs who have decided that enough is enough -- and that it's time to move on. 
 Promises, promises. Some of them turn out to be empty. 
 Leida Snow of Manhattan says she remembers how happy she was when her boss at a nonprofit advocacy organization told her that her contributions would be recognized with a significant increase in salary.
Six months passed, and nothing happened. Ms. Snow recalled that when she reminded the boss of her promise, she said: "You're right. I'll make it happen." 
Another six months passed. Ms. Snow reminded her boss again, and the woman was noncommittal. 
Ms. Snow made up her mind to leave, and some months later, when she handed in her notice, the boss was furious. "How can you do this to me?" she remembers her boss asking. "Why?"
Ms. Snow, now the director of public relations for the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, explained that the significant raise that she had been promised had never materialized.
She said her boss responded, "I didn't know it was important."
George Zucker has some simple advice about knowing when to change jobs: "When loyalty becomes a one-way street, it's time to move from the block."
Mr. Zucker, a retired journalist who lives in Haverford, Pa., says: "I learned this in 1961 when I was a young radio reporter for a big station in Indianapolis and the program director gave me a tough assignment: snag entertainer Danny Thomas for an interview." 
Two problems confronted Mr. Zucker. The first was that Thomas, in town to meet with a major supporter of St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Memphis, which he founded in 1962, would have time only for a news conference, not for an interview. 
"The second was a union problem," Mr. Zucker writes. "As a reporter, I could run a tape recorder to collect sound bites. A union technician was needed for a complete program." 
When Mr. Zucker pointed out the union problem, he said the program director told him: "You get the interview. Let me worry about the union."
Mr. Zucker went off on his assignment. "Thomas, impressed that my station would air a whole program on the interview, agreed to devote his entire news conference to my questions. This was glum news for reporters from the city's three daily newspapers, who were told to sit quietly and take notes.
"I returned in triumph to the station, expecting to take a bow or two."
His joy was short-lived. He said angry union technicians marched into the station owner's office to file a grievance. The program director was summoned. He puffed on his pipe but said nothing in Mr. Zucker's defense.
Mr. Zucker was informed that he would be fired if he ever caused another problem with the union.
"I quit the following day," he writes.
"My next job led to a 34-year career with The Associated Press."
Sometimes the decision to quit isn't a result of a single incident. Consider the case of Sarah Mann of Norwalk, Conn.
"After 11 years as the director of a federal program for the elderly at a small not-for-profit social service agency located in an economically depressed area, in Norwalk, I've made the decision to leave," she writes.
"This was a heart-wrenching decision for me because I used to adore my job."
What prompted the decision? In part it was the knife fight Mrs. Mann said she encountered outside the building, the gunshots in the alley that led to the parking lot, the homeless drug addict ranting about hatred and demanding money and the addicts who shot up in the agency's restrooms.
In part, it was the work itself. Mrs. Mann said she found herself spending more time writing mind-numbing reports and less time with the elderly who dropped by, and she began to feel undercompensated for the responsibility and stress that went with her job.
"Not that I was ever in it for the money," she writes, "but every so often a cost-of-living increase would have been nice." 
But her decision to quit was not easy. She would be leaving behind intelligent, thoughtful colleagues, wonderful volunteers and a commitment to making a difference, she said.
"I walked into the agency not having a clue about poverty, sickness, the uninsured or diversity in our society," she said. "I leave humbled and far more aware of people of other cultures."
Mrs. Mann has had a second interview with another agency. "If that doesn't work out, I'm going to take a year off. I'll do all of the things around the house I've been putting off, " she writes. "Things I want to do myself, not pay someone else to do. I'll give some serious thought as to what I want to do with the rest of my life.
"Of course, this would not be possible without the support and encouragement of an understanding husband. We may have to tighten our belts a bit, but we've decided that my happiness, safety and well-being are more important than a job."
What are some things a person should consider before walking away from a job? 
Some advice comes from Susan Wilson Solovic of St. Louis. Ms. Solovic is the chief executive of SBTV.com, a Web site devoted to small-business owners, and is the author of "Reinvent Your Career: Attain the Success You Deserve and Desire" (Career Press, 2003). 
"Deciding whether or not to leave your current position is difficult for many people, particularly in difficult economic times," she writes. "Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs in the past several years, so isn't any job better than no job?
"Not really. There are several assessments you can utilize to determine whether or not it's time to hit the bricks.
"1. Ask yourself if you are doing the work you are doing today simply because you've always done it and don't know what else to do. If you are going through the motions of your career without any passion or challenge, then most likely your performance is pretty lackluster, too. Mediocre performance can enhance your chances of getting the pink slip, so no action becomes an action in itself.
"2. Take the alarm clock test. When your alarm goes off in the morning, do you hit the snooze button time again and again because you dread the thought of another day on the job? Work should be fun and enjoyable, not your ticket to perpetual ulcers.
"3. Consider your financial situation. Are you spending yourself into a no-way-out situation? Loading yourself up with debt causes you to be more vulnerable and more terrified about job transition. Unload the debt and shore up your financial picture so your options are open. Strive to have a cushion of about six months. You'll feel stronger and more confident with the choices you make."

More Company For Millionaires

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino

 BODY:
American consumers may have at least one reason to feel confident that an economic recovery is in place: the country's "millionaire club" is becoming much more crowded. 
 According to a new study by NFO Financial Services in Greenwich, Conn., the number of households in the United States with at least $1 million in assets, excluding primary residences and retirement funds, totaled 3.8 million for the first half of 2003. That was 14 percent higher than in the same period last year, when 3.3 million households made the cut, and the highest level in the 22 years that NFO has conducted the study. 
 This year's results were released last week.
The survey also suggested that more people were on their way to becoming millionaires. The number of affluent households -- those with more than $500,000 in net worth, excluding primary residences -- rose for the first time in three years, to 10.5 million from 9.1 million in 2002, an increase of more than 15 percent.
Jeanette Luhr, the program manager for the NFO study, attributed the growth in the ranks of wealthy people largely to a rebound in stock prices after a three-year slump. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen about 25 percent since March.
"Last year, the bear market caught up with these folks," Ms. Luhr said. "At the onset of the bear market, many households on the fringes of affluence had fallen below the threshold."
Half of the millionaires in the survey expected further gains in the prices of stocks through the end of the year, compared with 36 percent who expressed bullish sentiment a year ago.
The strong real estate market also bolstered wealth. 
The study found that wealthy households over all held 20 percent of their assets in real estate other than a primary residence this year, up from 10 percent last year. Vivian Marino

Sunny Skies For Europe? Grab That Umbrella

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
TO judge by the economic surveys that are published almost daily in Europe, the Continent is solidly on the road to recovery. So why are the people who study these barometers so dour?
 The trend is clear: Germany's influential Ifo index of business sentiment rose in September for the fifth consecutive month, to its highest level in more than two years. 
 The ZEW survey of investor confidence, released by the ZEW Center for European Economic Research, and its consumer counterpart, the GfK survey, by the market research company GfK in Nuremberg, are also showing newfound vigor. 
The upward-pointing arrows are not limited to Germany. In France, the closely watched Insee survey, by the national statistics office, recorded its second consecutive monthly improvement last week, after a long stretch of gloomy results.
Yet rather than proclaim a recovery under way, most economists warn that it is too soon to declare a turn in Europe's fortunes. Part of the caution stems from experience. Most of these surveys registered similar gains in sentiment last year, stoking hopes of a recovery that never materialized. Germany fell back into a mild recession last autumn, while the rest of Europe stagnated. "People had their fingers burned," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank.
Hope may again be sprinting ahead of reality. "It's too early to say a recovery has arrived," Mr. Mayer said. "For that, we'd like to see a turnaround in current conditions. Unfortunately, there is a considerable disparity between expectations and conditions."
Consider the Ifo index, which is published by the Ifo Institute, an economic research group in Munich. The index, a survey of 7,000 German companies, showed an improvement in sentiment in September. But it was driven by a rise in expectations for a better future, not on conditions today.
With the exception of a positive report on manufacturing orders last month, there is no tangible evidence -- in statistics like unemployment or retail sales -- that the German economy is moving. The disparity between emotions and evidence exists in France and other countries.
On the same day the new Insee survey was published, French officials lowered their estimates of gross domestic product in late 2002 and early 2003, which means their already modest goal of 0.5 percent growth this year is probably unattainable.
Some experts chalk this up to the normal cycle of an economic recovery. There was a similar lag between improved sentiment and tangible economic results in the United States, they said. "Europe is at a much earlier stage," said David Abramson, the chief European strategist at the BCA Research Group in Montreal. Beyond issues of timing, however, the caution reflects a fear that this recovery is unusually fragile. The euro has renewed its climb against the dollar, which will put pressure on the German and French exports that are considered a crucial driver of any sustained growth in Europe. 
"The euro is one of the major threats to the recovery," said Michael Heise, the chief economist at Allianz in Frankfurt. A sharply higher euro, he noted, could cause Europe's economies to succumb yet again. 
Mr. Heise said he was encouraged that the German government had pushed ahead with politically painful reforms of the labor market, as well as of welfare and pension benefits. The government also cheered the public by accelerating a tax cut that had been scheduled for 2005.
The trouble is, too much good news on the economic front could pose a threat to the reform agenda of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. European leaders have tended to put their reform plans in mothballs during times of robust growth because they no longer appear as necessary.
PERHAPS the easiest way to deal with the curse of rising expectations would be to pay less attention to the alphabet soup of surveys. Ifo, ZEW, and GfK came to prominence partly because of the growth of financial markets. Investors like trading on the numbers.
But they also reflect the tardiness and unreliability of the economic data released by European governments. If Paris, Berlin and Rome issued timely, dependable statistics, Mr. Mayer said, the influence of these private surveys would ebb.
As it is, he said, the surveys can even distort an economic cycle. Last year, after the flood of upbeat reports, the European Central Bank sent out hawkish signals about interest rates. That spooked investors, whose reactions may have contributed to the subsequent relapse of the economy.
"We need a more balanced diet," Mr. Mayer said. "If we live off these surveys, we'll get indigestion."

A Takeover Artist's New Target Is Land

BYLINE:  By DAVID WETHE

 BODY:
FOR T. Boone Pickens, the onetime Texas oilman and corporate investor of the 1980's, it is a new venture. He is combing the lands of West Texas, buying working cattle ranches and selling them to executives who are looking for grand places to play. 
 Unlike the classic American ranch, with vast spaces populated by cattle and by men in cowboy hats, modern recreational ranches may be bereft of livestock. 
 Mr. Pickens's own Mesa Vista Ranch, in the Texas Panhandle, an hour's flight from Dallas in his private jet, is a prototype of the recreational ranch. It has no cattle at all -- just deer and quail for hunting and amenities like a gym, a basketball court and a small golf course. 
Mr. Pickens is quick to point out that his personal spread, including a 22,000-square-foot house, is not for sale. But nearby, he is selling off 36,000 acres of ranch land he bought early last year through the B&J Land and Cattle Company, which he set up with Jim Parks, his business partner and a longtime hunting buddy from Dallas. 
Over time, both alone and through his partnership, Mr. Pickens has bought six ranches that cover 121,685 acres of rural land, almost two-thirds the total size of New York City's five boroughs. 
Indeed, people like Mr. Pickens are shaking up the ranching business with their ideas in much the same style that they changed corporate America in the 1980's by investing in companies and then demanding that they alter the way they did business. 
The desire for more recreational property across the country has helped push up rural land prices, said Nancy Novack, associate economist at the Center for the Study of Rural America, which is based in the offices of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.
"If you're selling the land, it's a great thing," she said. "If you're a young farmer wanting to get into the business, really it's not feasible for you to buy land at inflated prices." Over the past five years, the price of rural land in Texas has increased 46 percent, to $961 an acre at the end of 2002 from $657 in 1997, according to the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University in College Station.
Although Mr. Pickens says he does not make "big money" refurbishing land for resale, he does profit from it, and he enjoys selling the land to other hunters. His desire to use the land differently is also an incentive. 
"I wanted to preserve the quail habitat wherever I could," said Mr. Pickens, an avid quail hunter who has an army of 30 English pointers and five Labrador retrievers. 
He is limiting himself to the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma, he said, because that is the area where quail are most known to live. "I think that quail are the most fun, the most challenging of any bird in the United States" for hunting, he said.
Mr. Pickens does not have a defined plan for this venture, but when he sees another property where the price or location is right, he'll jump in. "It's an ongoing business," he said.
In many ways, the ranch plan sounds like a knockoff of his strategy for fixing up lumbering corporations in the 80's. "The goal is to upgrade it, sell it and get it into the right hands so that it can be further developed and preserved," Mr. Pickens said. 
Few doubt that if Mr. Pickens sees the possibility for profits in recreational ranches, others will be quick to follow. 
"I think when you see someone like him getting involved in this activity, that should be an indication that there's some real money to be made in it," said Charles Gilliland, a research economist at the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M. "Because if there wasn't, I don't think he'd be fooling with it."
Mr. Gilliland said that rising production costs like fuel prices and labor expenses would force ranchers to look at leasing their properties to hunters with fat wallets.
"These ranchers are going to have to realize, if they want to continue to live on ranches, they're not in the livestock business anymore," he said. "They're in the hospitality business. And that's a big change for a bunch of these guys."
Although recreational ranches have existed since the 1970's, they have grown especially popular over the past few years, said Bill Bahny, a ranch broker in Montana.
His most unusual sale, he said, was made three years ago when a Minnesota man, who has since died, spotted a 7,000-acre recreational ranch listed on the Internet and bought the property for $2.1 million without seeing it first.
"It was weird," Mr. Bahny said. "I just don't see cattlemen anymore."
Big financial institutions, too, are getting into the business. Bank of America, in a pilot program through its private bank, has been allowing clients to get special loans for buying recreational ranches, which can cost anywhere from $1 million to $5 million. 
As opposed to a commercial-property loan for farms, a recreational-ranch loan does not require a certain amount of revenue to come from the land, said Chris Jones, private lending manager for Bank of America's private bank. He said that ranch loans differ from residential loans because housing lenders do not like to finance properties where the home represents less than 25 percent of the value.
Bank of America is rolling out a program nationwide to all 100 branches of its private bank, providing loans to wealthy clients -- people with at least $3 million in investable assets -- who are interested in buying ranches.
"What we found was an overwhelming response," Mr. Jones said. "Our clients told us, our competitors indicated and our contacts within the industry told us that this was an opportunity for us." 
A survey of agricultural credit conditions released in the second quarter of 2002 by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas included an ominous comment on the purchase of several New Mexico ranches by nonagricultural buyers, who said they planned to subdivide the land.
"It's the beginning of the end for ranching, as we know it," the report said.
Mr. Pickens has already learned that buying a ranch for recreation involves issues that a traditional rancher might never consider. 
"I hate junk," said Mr. Pickens, who has paid to burn down dilapidated buildings and bury discarded ranch trash that once included an old school bus. "When a guy comes in to look at buying a ranch, he wants to see it clean."
Mr. Pickens said he generally spends about $50 to $100 an acre fixing up a ranch. That includes fencing the property's perimeter, building roads, adding food and water dispensers for quail and renovating houses or building new ones.
Besides cleaning up the land, Mr. Pickens also likes to let the grass and shrubbery grow out a little, to improve the quail population. After all, birds need a place to build their nests and hide, he said. One of the first things Mr. Pickens likes to do is "under graze" the land, or clear off all the grazing cattle. It is all for the benefit of a larger wildlife population, he said.
"We understand fully that people have to raise cattle or whatever else they need to do," he said. "But I really do discourage anybody ever breaking up the land and plowing it and farming it."
MAX WILLIAMS, a Dallas oilman, subscribes to Mr. Pickens's theory. After buying a 2,478-acre spread of recreational land from Mr. Pickens last year, Mr. Williams immediately went to work planting vegetation in eight different plots for roaming turkey, hogs and deer to munch on. Now on his ninth ranch since the mid-1970's, Mr. Williams said he has learned his lesson after owning cattle.
"That's the slowest way in the world to get rich," said Mr. Williams, owner of a 27-year-old oil company in Dallas. 
Now he wants to use the ranch for fun. In addition to having a chuck wagon to impress guests during cookouts, his ranch includes a newly built 3,000-square-foot stone house, and another one almost twice that size is on the way.
"It's just like owning a yacht," he said of ranch ownership. "You better have a good day job to pay for it." 
As for Mr. Pickens, he thinks he has found a pretty good supplement to his day job of running two investment funds under the name BP Capital. So, in addition to pursuing his plan to one day build a pipeline and sell the water trickling under his land to fast-growing Texas markets like Dallas and San Antonio, Mr. Pickens is always looking for another ranch to convert to recreational property - and fast.
"I've got to hurry," he said. "I'm 75 years old."

A Land of MarketTiming (and Broken Watches)

BYLINE:  By CARLA FRIED

 BODY:
A MAXIM of the investing world holds that you haven't earned your stripes until you've lived through a bear market. By that measure, most of the 95 million Americans now invested in mutual funds are duly decorated. 
 Have investors weathered the battle well? "Unequivocally no," said John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group. As they have in the past, he said, people tried to time the market, only to end up buying high and selling low. "After investing record amounts into equity funds at the 1999-2000 peak, we then saw money come out when prices were 50 percent cheaper," said Mr. Bogle, now the president of the Bogle Financial Markets Research Center, which focuses on mutual fund investor issues. 
 This week will be the one-year anniversary of what has turned out, at least so far, to be the bottom of a bear market. From their lows on Oct 9th, 2002 through September this year, the Nasdaq composite index was up 60.4 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 28.2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial average was up 27.3 percent. But the portfolios of many investors weren't in place to benefit from those increases. 
According to AMG Data Services, investors moved a net $11.7 billion into stock funds in 2002, the least since the firm began tracking the data in 1992. At the same time, a record $133.5 billion flowed into bond funds. That meant that investors lessened their commitment to stocks when prices were low, and could not maximize their returns when the market rebounded. And they invested a record amount in bonds just in time to be hammered when interest rates started to rise in the spring of this year. 
Through August this year, investors have been shifting into stocks. Net inflows into stock funds offered through the fund marketplace of Charles Schwab amounted to $8.52 billion. That is more than double the $3.83 billion inflow for the same period in 2002. Some $1.99 billion of new money flowed to stock funds in August alone, four times the amount in August last year. 
Not surprisingly, the flows were much different for bond funds. The 2002 net inflow, $8.45 billion, was a record for Schwab. But in August this year, as the stock market was in the fifth month of its rally, bond funds had a net outflow of more than $500 million. 
"Investors focus on past performance and feel compelled to react to their fear or euphoria," said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab. Over the last 50 years, the average holding period for an investor in a mutual fund has fallen to less than 3 years from 16. And that peripatetic shift hasn't been profitable. 
ACCORDING to Dalbar Inc., a financial markets research firm in Boston, fund investors have continued a bad habit by jumping in and out of different asset classes -- usually at the wrong time. Dalbar calculates that actual stock fund returns for investors over the last 19 years averaged less than 3 percent a year. That is less than the inflation rate, and well below the 12.2 percent annualized return of the S.&P. 500. 
Bond investors were also punished for poor timing. 
Dalbar calculates that the average bond fund investor earned 4.2 percent, annualized, from 1984 through 2002. Both long-term government and corporate bonds returned more than 11 percent, annualized.
Don Phillips, managing director of Morningstar, suggested that fund companies were partly responsible for investors' poor performance. 
"Rather than market their funds based on allocation strategies that will help investors meet their long-term goals, we get fund marketing that is based on recent performance of funds," Mr. Phillips said. "It's so sad to see investors not capture the real returns that come with long-term investing." 
Robert E. Torray, co-manager of the $1.5 billion Torray fund, said the declines of 2001 and 2002 were a gut-wrenching experience for many fund investors. Having lived through several bear markets in his 42 years in asset management, he said, he knows not to run for shelter. 
"We never increased our cash position or changed our investment approach," he said. "It's not fair to manage based on hunches and, in the end, that's what market timing comes down to." 
The risk of being on the sidelines when the market rallies is too great, Mr. Torray said. In a letter to shareholders, he pointed out that from one recent S.&P. 500 low, on July 23, 2002, through the first half of 2003, the index gained 24.3 percent. But if the five best days during that stretch were subtracted, the index would have lost 1.6 percent. "So, despite a rise that would take almost a half-century to match at today's money market fund rates, the odds of making anything trading in and out over this time frame were 50 to 1 against you," Mr. Torray said. 
James D. Oelschlager, who has been a portfolio manager for 33 years, said he had also stayed the course, even when his $1.9 billion White Oak Growth Stock fund lost 39 percent in 2001 and 40 percent in 2002. 
"Painful as the fall was, I knew it was part of what you have to go through," Mr. Oelschlager said. "I never gave any consideration to changing anything." 
Although his roller coaster ride may be intolerable for many investors, he has delivered strong long-term performance. Despite the fund's painful two-year stretch through 2002, its 10-year annualized gain of 11.4 percent ranks in the top 4 percent of large-capitalization growth funds tracked by Morningstar. From its Oct. 7, 2002, low through September this year, the fund gained 63.4 percent, more than 35 percentage points ahead of the S.&P. 500. 
While most White Oak investors stayed with the fund, Mr. Oelschlager said, some became nervous and bailed out. The fund had net inflows of $425 million in 2001 but net outflows of $710 million in 2002, he said. That represented roughly 20 percent of the fund's asset base at the beginning of last year. 
"I hate to see people shoot themselves in the foot," he said. "I tried to tell them to hang in there, that this was just a part of the cycle. Wall Street is the only place people get nervous when things are on sale." 
Mr. Oelschlager says that while fund outflows have stopped, net sales have been modest. "We're still in a neutral mode," he said. "I sense people in general are still traumatized by the market."
ROBERT E. TURNER, chairman of Turner Investment Partners in Berwyn, Pa., manages more than $8 billion and says he also chose to stand pat when stocks fell. "We took it on the chin in the downturn, losing 20 percent in each of the past three years," Mr. Turner said. "But that same strategy helped us beat the benchmarks by 15 to 20 percentage points during the boom," he said. "If we tried to time we could have been wrong both times. It was hard to know exactly when the peak was going to hit, and last October sure looked like the end of the world." 
One positive factor, Mr. Phillips said, was the continued periodic investments by workers in 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts. "At least 401(k) investors got the real benefit of buying low," he said, "and are now seeing those shares appreciate strongly." Even so, a recent study by the Investment Company Institute and the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that 40 percent of all 401(k) assets were in equity funds in 2002, versus 53 percent in 1999. 
Ms. Sonders of Schwab said investors could put the losses of 2001 and 2002 to good use. "If the lesson learned is that you never want to go through that experience again, then now -- when values have come back a bit -- is the time to make changes and create a more diversified portfolio." 
Once that is in place, Mr. Bogle has some simple advice: "Do nothing. It's going to be far more successful than jumping to react to every market move." 
Sound as that advice may be, it is not very popular. Rich Chambers, a financial planner in Palo Alto, Calif., said that in 1999, few clients would listen when he advised them to diversify their assets and adopt a long-term buy-and-hold strategy. 
"It's still not an easy sell today," Mr. Chambers said.

After a Fast Start, Growing Pains

BYLINE:  By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
RAISING millions of dollars in venture capital, landing big-name customers and measuring sales growth in percentages of four digits may seem to be every entrepreneur's dream. But there can be a nasty side to breakneck growth, and Kevin Laracey can tell you all about it.
 Revenue at edocs Inc., the company Mr. Laracey founded in 1997, has surged by more than 7,000 percent in the past four years. But Mr. Laracey quickly found that coping with such growth can be tricky. Other parts of the business, like staff and space, have to grow, too. 
 Edocs provides software that helps corporations put customer bills online. After it raised $4 million in June 1998 in its first round of venture-capital financing, it moved its three executives and two other employees into a 1,000-square-foot office in Westborough, Mass. 
Just a few months later, in early 1999, the staff had grown to 17 employees and the company moved again, to Wayland, Mass., to a building that under the state code was supposed to hold a maximum of 45 office workers. But it was soon busting at the seams with 77 employees, who occasionally used picnic tables near the parking lot for meetings.
So in the fall of 1999, with 160 employees, edocs began negotiating to lease 25,000 square feet in an office park in Natick, Mass., with a guarantee that 17,000 square feet across the street would also be available as it grew. With eight other companies vying for that same space in a hot real-estate market, Mr. Laracey persuaded business colleagues and even investment bankers to talk up his company to the landlord.
"I remember putting on my suit and getting my PowerPoint slides ready to do a presentation on how fast we were growing, how well we were raising money and how good our prospects were," he recalled.
He got the deal. And now he wishes he hadn't. Soon after he signed a lease for the additional 17,000 square feet in December 2000, the stock market tumbled, and so did the office-rental market. No longer needing the extra room, edocs subleased some of it at a loss. To date, it estimates that it has paid $1.6 million for essentially idle space.
In March 2000, edocs filed to go public, in part to secure "additional financing to fuel our growth," Mr. Laracey said. But the plan was shelved in February 2001 because technology shares tumbled.
It wasn't just Mr. Laracey's aggressive moves into real estate that ultimately backfired. With sales growing so rapidly, he said, he became caught up in the euphoria and sometimes spent money unwisely. Edocs shelled out $1 million in 2000 on a product that made it easy for customers to download and manage bills on their personal computers rather than do everything on the Internet. But the Internet won out, and the product flopped.
Furthermore, in his rush to build staff, he said, he sometimes hired candidates he instinctively felt weren't right for the job. In one case in particular, he recalled, "although I had my reservations on how he fit into the culture, we went ahead and hired this person," he said.
"He created some real problems and impacted morale at the company," Mr. Laracey added. "He wouldn't interact with people. Other employees would come to me and say, 'Why won't he talk to me?' "
The company was also slow to tackle the problem of soaring health care costs for employees, putting off creation of a self-financed insurance plan "until the cost got painful enough to get our attention," said Melinda Smith, the chief financial officer.
Expanding overseas likewise led to hiccups. Decisions to open offices in countries like Australia and Britain often came on a moment's notice, Ms. Smith said, forcing her to scramble to figure out the logistics. "I'd find out in a sales meeting that in two to three weeks we're deciding to go to another country," she said.
Business functions that were simple in the United States seemed daunting elsewhere, she said. "In order to accomplish the practical matter of getting our international folks a paycheck," she said, "we needed referrals to local bookkeepers in Melbourne and in London to help us register the company to withhold employer taxes and establish local-country benefit and pension schemes, which vary by country and are often very different from what is offered to U.S. employees." 
Despite all the bumps, edocs kept roaring ahead. While the wobbly economy of the last couple of years has slowed its growth pace, Deloitte & Touche ranked it as the 16th-fastest-growing technology company in North America last year, and Inc. magazine has just rated it the 13th-fastest-growing privately held company in the United States. Today, the company has 202 employees, 80 major corporate customers and offices in Australia, Europe and Asia. Revenue in 2002 was $34.5 million, the company said; Mr. Laracey would not project the total for this year.
Not all fledgling businesses are so lucky, or so well run, or both. "The most prominent cause of death in a start-up is growth," said Mark Lipton, author of "Guiding Growth: How Vision Keeps Companies on Course" (Harvard Business School Press) and chairman of the organizational change management program at the New School for Social Research in New York. "Growth is what kills them, especially the inability to manage growth."
One particularly severe self-inflicted wound is the refusal by many entrepreneurs to delegate authority. "The biggest issue I see is whether the founder or owners are willing to let go," said Lynn Daniel of the Daniel Group, a strategic planning and market research firm in Charlotte, N.C. "Letting go means having the discipline to say: 'I have someone here that's responsible for that. Let them do it.' "
Mr. Laracey acknowledged that it had taken awhile for him to hand over the reins. Even so, his tenacity and attention to detail apparently rubbed off on his staff. Rob Orgel, vice president for business development at edocs, said he often got after-hours e-mail from his boss. "Kevin is notorious for his midnight Google searches," he said. "He'll say, 'Go read this,' if we're trying to get a new customer or we're looking at a new product. He feels if you have those three or four extra nuggets of information, you will look better prepared."
MS. SMITH, the chief financial officer, ruefully recalled a conference call that her boss organized last year when she and her husband were out Christmas shopping on a Sunday. "Here I am on the cellphone, walking around the mall," she said. "There's a frenzy around getting every deal."
Avivah Litan, a research analyst who focuses on financial services at Gartner Inc., a consulting group, can attest to that. "They really do their homework, getting to know each industry and coming up with more cost-saving-tailored products," she said. "Edocs salespeople and account managers are like dogs on your heels that don't let go."

HEADLINE: A Beneficial Debut For That $20 Bill 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As a retired advertising executive, I applaud the Treasury Department's planned $33 million effort to introduce the new and improved $20 bill, though I question its strategy ("Need Change for a $20 Bill? Call Hollywood," Sept. 28): 
 It seems to me that a different approach would be more beneficial than having the bill mentioned on television and elsewhere: Send some of the new bills to unemployed Americans. That should get plenty of publicity and even have a salutary effect on our officially recovered economy.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: MILITARY; 
Iraqi Army Takes Shape As Recruits End Training

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER

DATELINE: KIRKUSH MILITARY TRAINING BASE, Iraq, Oct. 4 

 BODY:
Iraq officially got back its army on Saturday as almost 700 new soldiers graduated from basic training here, the first battalion in a much larger force the United States is quickly establishing to help stabilize Iraq and reduce the burden on American troops here. 
 In Baghdad, one American soldier was killed and another wounded late on Friday when their convoy was attacked with a rocket-propelled grenade, the military said on Saturday. At least 177 American soldiers have died since President Bush declared major combat operations over in Iraq on May 1, 85 of them in combat. 
 Also, former Iraqi soldiers, now unemployed but still collecting pay from the American-led forces here, scuffled with American and British soldiers in Baghdad and in the southern city of Basra. The British military reported that it had killed one Iraqi on Saturday in Basra, and the United States military reported that two of its soldiers were injured in the disturbances in Baghdad. It was the latest of several skirmishes with former Iraqi soldiers. 
At the Kirkush training base, in the desert between Baghdad and the Iranian border, the graduation of the 700 Iraqi soldiers was celebrated with a ceremony and parade, but there was no pretense that the new Iraqi Army would play a central military role in the country anytime soon. Until a new Iraqi leadership takes over, American officials say, the Iraqi Army's duties are expected to be aimed more toward guarding the country's lengthy borders and replacing American soldiers for routine duties like manning checkpoints.
Still, Americans and Iraqis hailed the new battalion as a small, early step toward Iraqi self-rule. In a short speech to the new soldiers, Iyad Alawi, this month's president of the American-appointed Iraqi Governing Council, said the new army would not oppress Iraqis, like the one commanded by Saddam Hussein. 
"Our army will be the defenders of our nation as well as of its citizens," he said.
As white flags fluttered with the initials N.I.A., for New Iraqi Army, nearly 700 pairs of boots crunched over hot gravel as the new soldiers marched past Iraqi and American officials, including L. Paul Bremer III, the American civilian administrator in Iraq. The next class, with about 1,000 recruits, stood watching.
Mr. Bremer did not speak at the ceremony but offered brief congratulations before a row of cameras afterward. 
"We have seen a group of Iraqi men who have trained in a very short time to become professional soldiers," he said. "It's a wonderful and proud day for all Iraqis."
The battalion that graduated today -- recruited largely from former Iraqi soldiers, but not members of Mr. Hussein's Republican Guard -- is the first of a planned 27, for a total of 40,000 soldiers, to be trained over the next two years. They are to form the core of an army ultimately to be commanded by Iraqis. In the next year, the United States plans to spend about $2.2 billion on various military training programs. 
The graduates went through two months of basic training. Of them, 65 officers, 230 noncommissioned officers and 400 soldiers are to be deployed around the border area near here within a few weeks, an American official said.
Unlike the old army, which largely rewarded soldiers who were, like Mr. Hussein, Sunni Muslims, Saturday's graduates were a mix of both Sunni and Shiite Muslims, Kurds and other groups in roughly equal proportions to Iraq's population, said Walter B. Slocombe, the Pentagon official in charge of rebuilding Iraqi security institutions. It was an experience, he said, that "took a little adjustment on all sides."
Just before the ceremony, three new officers stood chatting. One was a Kurd who once belonged to militia that fought Mr. Hussein, and the other two were a Sunni and a Shiite who both were in Mr. Hussein's army. 
"This is evidence that we are one people," said the Sunni, Capt. Zuher Mahmoud, 38. 
The Kurd, Maj. Sherwan Britkay, 34, said he was not concerned that the United States Army still held the real power in Iraq.
"Power is the last thing to be used, not like the old regime, who used power as the first way of solving problems, even against innocents," he said. "It's a great day for us. It's different from the old Iraqi Army. Everybody in the world looked at the old army as wild and starting wars."

HEADLINE: A Statistic That's Missing: Jobs That Moved Overseas 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The job market finally showed some life in September, but not enough to sidetrack a growing debate over why employment has failed to rebound nearly two years after the last recession ended. The debate intrudes increasingly on election politics, but in all the heated back and forth, an essential statistic is missing: the number of jobs that would exist in the United States today if so many had not escaped abroad.
 The Labor Department, in its numerous surveys of employers and employees, has never tried to calculate this trade-off. But the "offshoring" of work has become so noticeable lately that experts in the private sector are now trying to quantify it. 
 By these initial estimates, at least 15 percent of the 2.81 million jobs lost in America since the decline began have reappeared overseas. Productivity improvements at home -- sustaining output with fewer workers -- account for the great bulk of the job loss. But the estimates being made suggest that the work sent overseas has been enough to raise the unemployment rate by four-tenths of a percentage point or more, to the present 6.1 percent.
That leakage fuels the political debate. The Bush administration is pushing the Chinese to allow their currency to rise in value, thus increasing the dollar value of wages in that country, a deterrent to locating work abroad. The Democrats agree, but some also call for trade restrictions, and they attack Republicans for cutting from the budget funds to retrain and support laid-off workers in the United States.
While most of the lost jobs are in manufacturing or in telephone call centers, lately the work sent abroad has climbed way up the skills ladder to include workers like aeronautical engineers, software designers and stock analysts as China, Russia and India, with big stocks of educated workers, merge rapidly into the global labor market.
"All of a sudden you have a huge influx of skilled people; that is a very disruptive process," said Craig R. Barrett, chief executive of Intel, the computer chip manufacturer.
Intel itself has maintained a fairly steady 60 percent of its employees in the United States. But in the past year or so, it has added 1,000 software engineers in China and India, doing work that in the past might have been done by people hired in the United States. "To be competitive, we have to move up the skill chain overseas," Mr. Barrett said.
The trade-off in jobs is not one for one. The work done here by one person often requires two or three less-efficient workers overseas. Even so, given the very low wages, the total saving for an American company can be as much 50 percent for each job shifted, even allowing for the extra cost of transportation, communication and other expenses that would not be needed if the work was done in the United States. That is the message of the nation's management consultants, who are encouraging their corporate clients to take advantage of the multiplying opportunities overseas.
" 'Encourage' is a difficult way to put it," said Harold Sirkin, a senior vice president at the Boston Consulting Group. "What we are basically saying is that if your competitors are doing this, you will be at a disadvantage if you don't do it too."
The estimates of job loss from offshoring are all over the lot. They are back-of-the-envelope calculations at best, inferred from trade data and assumptions about the number of American workers needed to produce goods and services now coming from abroad, or no longer exported to a growing consumer market in, say, China.
Among economists and researchers, the high-end estimate comes from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, who calculates that 995,000 jobs have been lost overseas since the last recession began in March 2001. That is 35 percent of the total decline in employment since then. While most of the loss is in manufacturing, about 15 percent is among college-trained professionals.
Boeing, for example, employs engineers at a design center in Moscow, while having shrunk its engineering staff in Seattle. Morgan Stanley, the investment firm, is adding jobs in Bombay, but not in New York -- employing Indian engineers as well as analysts who collect corporate data and scrutinize balance sheets for stock market specialists in New York.
Near the low end of the job-loss estimates sit John McCarthy, research analyst at Forrester Research Inc., and Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insights. For them the loss is 500,000 to 600,000 jobs over the past 30 months, again mostly in manufacturing -- with Mr. McCarthy suggesting that the 600,000 might turn out to be 800,000. His research focuses more on the future: Starting in January 2000 and running through 2015, globalization of American production will have eliminated 3.3 million jobs at home, he estimates.
Some are trying niche estimates. Roshi Sood, a government analyst at the Gartner Group, for example, estimates roughly that state government cutbacks have pushed overseas the work of 3,400 people once employed in the United States, either on public payrolls or on the payrolls of companies that contract with state government.
In Indiana, for example, the Department of Workforce Development recently chose an Indian company, TCS America, to maintain and update its computer programs, using high-speed telecommunications to carry out the contract. The TCS bid was $8 million below those submitted by two American competitors, Mr. Sood said.
Now political groups are offering estimates. The Progressive Policy Institute, which is affiliated with the Democratic Party, will soon publish its calculation of manufacturing jobs shifted overseas since George W. Bush took office just before the recession began, said Rob Atkinson, a vice president. Not surprisingly, the estimate -- imputed from trade data -- is on the high side: 800,000 jobs lost to overseas production.

HEADLINE: Home for the Homeless, But Can It Continue? 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Sept. 28 

 BODY:
Dignity Village, a tiny community on the northeastern edge of Portland, convened an emergency session of its legislature the other evening.
 The 26 representatives present sat in a circle on ragtag chairs collected over the years from garbage dumps and curbsides, near a wide puddle they call Lake Dignity. The chairman of the nine-member Dignity Village governing council was there, along with the heads of most departments: the treasurer, the secretary and chairwoman of the tents and population committee, the security chairman, the trash and sanitation chairman, the toilet meister and the coffee meister. 
 They had an urgent item on the agenda: the uncertain future of their village, an unusual encampment of more than 60 homeless people, living in tents or one-room shacks built of plywood, tarpaulins, plastic sheeting and anything else that could be scavenged and hauled in old wheelchairs and shopping carts.
Dignity Village is no squatter's camp. Its residents describe it as a "self-governing urban village" and it is one of the nation's few government-sanctioned homesteads for the homeless. It rents land from the city of Portland, runs a nonprofit corporation, adopts an annual budget, has bylaws and an executive and a legislative branch of government and is working to create a court system. 
But its permit for camping on city land is expiring, two years after city officials decided to rent an acre of public land for the encampment -- a move that the Portland mayor, Vera Katz, acknowledged at the time might have sounded "absolutely crazy" when New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities were cracking down on their homeless residents. The village is losing the support of some officials, who say it has overstayed its welcome. And the village's latest bid to buy a private lot and build portable houses made of straw and clay fell through in August.
Still, the villagers, many of whom met more than three years ago, when they were living in tents on a stretch of mud under an Interstate highway bridge here, said they were undeterred. The consensus at the legislative session was that whatever happened, as long as they remained homeless, they would stay together.
"We have something," said Jack Tafari, 57, the chairman of the Dignity Village Council. "It's a lot better than nothing, but we're going to have more."
The city seems amenable to allowing the villagers to stay at least a few more months. They plan to present a formal proposal to the city by Oct. 15, and city officials have agreed to postpone a final decision until then. 
The Dignity Village Legislature -- which includes anyone who lives there -- will now debate whether to try to stay put for the foreseeable future, on an asphalt lot at a city leaf-composting plant near the Portland Airport, and possibly propose expanding.
But there is growing opposition to the village in Portland, a city of 530,000 where roughly 1,800 people sleep in shelters or on the streets on a given night. That number is growing along with the city's poverty rate, city officials say.
Critics say that Dignity Village is unsafe, that fire hazards abound, that the encampment, a 40-minute bus ride from downtown Portland, is too isolated. They say the city, which is absorbing about $15,000 annually in maintenance and rent costs for the village, should funnel that money to other services for the homeless.
"I respected the intent and desire of the people who back Dignity Village," said Jim Francesconi, one of the five Portland city commissioners, including the mayor. "I just never thought it would work, and I also don't believe that camping in the city is the most humane way of treating the homeless."
Mr. Francesconi voted with the minority in August 2001, when the City Council voted to allow Dignity Village -- then called Camp Dignity -- to inhabit public land. 
Still, Dignity Village has many loyal supporters here, including a particularly devoted Portland businessman, Lee Larson, a retired transportation company executive. Mr. Larson gave residents an old airport shuttle bus to use as a library; has paid the city $40,000, covering their rent over the past two years; and is determined that Dignity Village not disband.
"It's really kind of the American dream," said Mr. Larson, 62, who heard about this group of homeless people when they were living under the Fremont Bridge and wondered how he could help. "You have homeless people pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps."
"I mean, they've done all this," he said during a visit to the village, pointing to the ramshackle structures, the windmill that provides electricity, their outdoor kitchen, the propane-heated showers, the portable toilets and the communal meeting area under a tarp, where couches are available for those without a tent or shack. "It's really neat, it's a neat thing."
Many at the encampment said they had no desire to abandon their dream now. They have survived too much -- frequent police sweeps under the bridge and confrontations with the City Council before the city finally legalized their new camp. There were Portland's relentless rains, continuing criticism of the village and political battles among the villagers. The ultimate goal, they said, is to create a workable model of self-sufficient villages for homeless people across the country.
Many had slept in shelters, in the streets or under the Fremont Bridge. They say that village life is better than sleeping on benches or in doorways or even in shelters, where they cannot store their possessions or keep pets, and where couples are split up.
Dignity Village requires those who live there to look for work or go to school, said Brenda Howard-Gray, who as chairwoman of the tents and population committee works on "intake" of new residents at the committee meeting every Tuesday at 10 a.m. About 25 residents have full- or part-time jobs, and most villagers receive food stamps or other benefits.
Among the residents, some have mental illnesses or physical disabilities. Some are highly educated -- there is a former nurse and an unemployed engineer -- and only recently fell on hard times.
People with children are discouraged from living in the village. Drinking is not allowed. Breaking that rule, stealing, being violent or causing other problems can lead to banishment by the Village Council -- for 24 hours, a week, 30 days or permanently, depending on the seriousness of the offense.
Gaye Reyes, the villager who is proposing a Dignity Village court, said that as with any bureaucracy, moving proposals through the village government could take forever.
"You know, you wouldn't think so, but a lot of homeless people are Type A," said Ms. Reyes, who left her job in accounting a few years ago at the age of 50, became deeply depressed, lost her apartment and now uses a wheelchair. "They have very specific ideas, and so everything around here is a battle royale."
"The village isn't for everybody," she added. "If you want to lay around and suck on a bottle for the rest of your life, fine. But you can't do it here."
No matter what the city allows, residents said they would continue raising money to buy their own property. They have $8,000 in a land fund, and several private donors, including Mr. Larson, have said they will contribute substantially more to a land purchase.
"I want to see this thing through," said Benjamin Howard, a member of the Village Council, who lost his job on an oil tanker last year and lives in Dignity Village with his wife, Ms. Howard-Gray, who is also the village secretary. "I want to see it thrive. I don't necessarily want to be a permanent village resident, but whether the village survives here or not, most of us want to be a part of the village."

HEADLINE: From Pink Slip to Owner 

BYLINE:  By NANCY DONIGER

 BODY:
UNWILLING to uproot their families and restart their careers in a distant location, several men from a Newtown manufacturing plant that closed last summer managed to save 50 jobs by acquiring a machine shop where they had each logged an average of 20 years' experience.
 The machine shop, at 31 Pecks Lane, nowhums 24 hours a day under the name of Tier One LLC, producing parts for centrifuges and instruments used in the bio-medical markets. 
 Tier One acquired the machining and assembly operations for an undisclosed amount from Kendro Laboratory Products, whose owner, SPX, announced in May that it was closing the Newtown plant to consolidate centrifuge production at its Revco Technologies Division in Asheville, N.C. Kendro had employed 230 people in Newtown.
 SPX offered relocation packages to about 50 employees, but only 15 accepted, said Kevin Lech, the vice president of human resources. 
 Tier One's management team of Michael J. Iassogna, 42, R. Joe Young, 37, and Richard A. Hall, 37, had already weathered divestitures, acquisitions and mergers while working at the Newtown plant, but they realized they were facing a whole new threat with Kendro's closure: they would have to move or seek employment elsewhere.
 Mr. Iassogna had been Kendro's plant manager, Mr. Young the vice president of sales and Mr. Hall the director of development in charge of engineering, technical services and marketing.
 "We thought, 'Why can't we be the same company and minimize risk to our clients by providing the same people and processes,"' Mr. Young said. "We could keep the manufacturing machinery and assembly and fill a niche with highly engineered products."
 They tapped into their years of manufacturing experience and offered to supply Kendro with the same precision products that the Newtown plant had been refining for 50 years, but with a new twist. They would offer lean manufacturing, a means of finding efficient ways to make a product by using modern technology and techniques to fill small orders quickly.
 "But," Mr. Young said, "we're not opposed to quantity."
 Mr. Lech of SPX said that having the same people make the same parts presented less of a risk to SPX than if the company had to start fresh with a third party. As a result, SPX is Tier One's biggest customer -- at least for now. 
 "Their being able to ensure quality parts has helped us transition to our new location," Mr. Lech said.
 Mr. Hall said: "It's a win-win situation. We can provide the products in the quantities they need without interruption."
 The Tier One management team went to Ridgefield Savings Bank for assistance with financing. Larry Bues, the bank's vice president, said he welcomed the opportunity to support a manufacturing startup.
 "This is a terrific company with highly skilled workers," he said. "Saving jobs is important for the local economy and the region."
 Tier One uses the Kendro plant's existing machines and has retained 50 machinists, model-makers and engineers, each with an average 20 years of experience. The skilled workers earn salaries of $40,000 to $80,000 and perform jobs that in the past might have required several people. 
 David Beatty of Sherman, a group leader with 17 years of experience as a machinist, said he was relieved to still have a job. "I feel good," he said. "I've been saying we could run leaner and reduce excess inventory. Now we're seeing that."
 Tier One began operations Aug.6, manufacturing more than 1,000 highly engineered machined parts and assemblies.
 Three former Kendro machine shop managers, Donald Stankus, Stanley Montefusco and Theodore Turiano, also work for Tier One and, like the three principal owners, are investors in the business.
 "We didn't want any outside control," Mr. Iassogna said.
 Tier One will remain at the 120,000 square foot Newtown plant, where it occupies 35,000 square feet, as long as it can lease the space from SPX or a future owner, Mr. Iassogna said. 
 Mr. Lech said he couldn't make any guarantees about SPX's relationship with Tier One for the future. But, he said, "we see continuing as long as they provide quality products and services at a competitive rate."
 SPX has also retained 40 positions in its bioprocessing department at the Newtown plant, Mr. Lech said. 
First Selectman Herbert Rosenthal said he was sorry that people had lost their jobs, but he praised the entrepreneurship of the Tier One management team. 
"From a lot of perspectives this is a very positive development," he said. "There will be a negligible loss of tax revenue, since they are keeping the equipment and machinery. It's good for the town and the region."
 Mr. Iassogna said that Tier One had the skilled work force necessary to produce high-tech products, with plenty of room to grow.
 "We're confident," he said. "We could double production on the same equipment."

HEADLINE: They Shoot Bears, Don't They? 

BYLINE:  By JEREMY PEARCE

 BODY:
THE black bear, once as uncommon a sight as a kangaroo in the suburbs, has returned to flourish, captivate northern New Jersey and upset more than a few political garbage bins.
 Not since the invasion of the Canada goose or the white-tailed deer has a species made so smashing a reappearance. A plan to prune the bear population by allowing a state hunt was approved earlier this year, marking the first such season in three decades and opening a brawl within the environmental community that has yet to simmer down. 
 Governor McGreevey, who courted the animal-rights lobby during his election campaign and pledged to protect the state's bears, has rethought his position and endorsed the six-day hunt, intended to remove 500 bears in December. Residents in Sussex and Passaic counties, who until recently were armchair animal feeders, have suddenly become frightened settlers, just as activists have emerged to defend the black bear's wider rebound. 
 But perhaps most significant, the issue has sharply divided biologists, who disagree about the number of bears in New Jersey -- with estimates that range from 1,350 to nearly 3,300 -- and are raising questions about the accuracy of counts that put the population at 500 bears only a few years ago. Thelargest figures were compiled by state biologists and imply an explosive rate of reproduction that other scientists say is highly improbable.
 "It's such a wide range that I find it disturbing," said Dr. Lynn L. Rogers, a bear biologist and director of the Wildlife Research Institute in Ely, Minn. "If the state's numbers are wrong, they could set things back many years for the black bear's recovery in New Jersey."
 Even the one constituency expected to thrill at the chase has expressed its ambivalence. By the final deadline last week, the state's hunters had applied for only 6,300 of 10,000 available bear permits, and state officials said that about 20 percent of applications were being returned because of confusion in filling out the forms.
 Some outdoorsmen explained that stalking bears requires a specialized knowledge that is distinct from the lore of the deer camp and duck blind. After 33 years without a bear hunt, they said, there are fewer old-timers to pass on that expertise.
 "You are hunting an animal that has the potential to do some damage to you -- that's the difference," said Thomas G. Mullane, a Sussex County hunter who has pursued bears in Pennsylvania, Maine and Canada.
 Referring to Sussex, which has been a flashpoint in the debate, Mr. Mullane said: "We've been living in a bear factory up here. Something had to happen. If you look at the amount of nuisance complaints the state has been receiving, you understand that a hunt should have taken place a long time ago."
 Indeed, the state Division of Fish and Wildlife has presented statistics to suggest a rapid increase in bear-related problems. For instance, the number of bears breaking into homes nearly doubled in five years, from 29 annually to 57 so far this year. Police and wildlife officials are euthanizing other bears -- found to be repeatedly entering houses and tents or marauding through livestock and beehives -- at a steeply increasing rate, from 4 bears killed in 1999 to a total of 35 last year.
 Finally, recent months have brought out the most controversial statistic -- accounts of two bears in New Jersey that reportedly attacked humans. While neither incident resulted in serious injuries, they are cited, along with the death of a child in New York State last year, as evidence of a growing threat to public safety and an urgent justification for the state's hunt. No other attacks on humans in New Jersey have been recorded in recent memory.

Number of Bears Questioned
 W. Scott Ellis, chairman of the New Jersey Fish and Game Council, which decided in July to permit the hunt, said that new census figures for the species had startled members and led them to reconsider an open season. Three years ago, Gov. Christie Whitman halted plans for a similar hunt at the final hour after an uproar from opponents. In actuality, the council is autonomous in deciding hunting seasons, although it is advised by the wildlife division, which itself is an entity of the state Department of Environmental Protection.
 "Had we had the hunt three years ago, we wouldn't have the problems we face today," said Mr. Ellis, a corn and soybean farmer who also happens to be a hunter.
 "The closer the biologists look at it, the higher the bear numbers seem to get," he said. "We do need to recognize political pressures in designing a bear season. But the public safety issue is also much more pronounced than it was in 2000. Bears are not a problem until you have one of your own."
 Yet before the council had announced its decision, Bradley M. Campbell, the state's environmental commissioner, intervened, ordering a seven-member panel of scientists and residents to take a second look at the bear census. Mr. Campbell said he had hoped to reconcile what were "inherent uncertainties" in counting the population.
 As a result, the state invited a high-level group to sit around one table -- a leading animal activist, state bear experts from New York and Maryland, a zoologist from Tufts University, a member of the state Fish and Game Council, another representative for the state as well as Dr. Rogers, the biologist from Minnesota and a bear hunter himself.
 After a single meeting, the panel released a remarkable report. In essence, its members decided to agree to disagree, and listed comments both in support of the hunt and against it. Dr. Rogers criticized New Jersey's census for "unsupported claims and exaggerated reproductive rates" and state bear researchers' use of "misquotes" from other other scientific works.
 In his critique, Dr. Rogers went on to say that natural deaths among the state's bears had probably been undercounted, further skewing the population figure upward. He concluded that the best course for the state would be to continue field studies of the animals, and to promote a broader understanding of bear behavior among residents.
 Another panelist, Dr. Allen Rutberg of the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, said he shared Dr. Rogers's concerns about the bear estimates and whether the hunt would markedly reduce complaints from fearful residents.
"We know that many of the problem bears are active in communities that are not huntable," said Dr. Rutberg, a zoologist who is also a consultant to the Humane Society of the United States, a national animal-rights group that opposes the bear hunt.
 He added: "Then you factor in that the state is making assumptions about bear numbers and bear movements that some of us are not comfortable with. Small changes in those assumptions would result in large changes to estimates of bear numbers."
 Other members of the panel praised New Jersey's census and said the studies showed that the state was ready for a regular bear season that could be sustained indefinitely. Louis T. Berchielli, a bear biologist with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, said it would be possible to kill as much as 25 percent of the population each year and still retain plentiful numbers. About 900 of New York's 5,000 to 6,000 bears were bagged during its hunting season last year; New Jersey's target this year of 500 bears would amount to about 15 percent of its population, according to the official estimate of about 3,300. Only a year ago, the official estimate stood at 1,900 bears.
 "I was extremely impressed with the amount of work that New Jersey put into collecting its bear data," said Mr. Berchielli. "And the evidence needed for a hunt is pretty clear."

Bear Population Put at 3,000
 Harry A. Spiker Jr., a bear biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, acknowledged the difficulty in counting bears, but said he was satisfied that New Jersey's population had probably reached 3,000, and warranted a hunt. Finally, George P. Howard, a panelist and member of the state's game council, also sided with the notion of a hunt.
 "The animal-rights people keep harping on the numbers," said Mr. Howard, who is also a former director of the state's wildlife division. "That's kind of ridiculous. The concern shouldn't be about killing too many bears -- the concern is about killing too few bears."
 Mr. Howard said the council's decision to grant 10,000 permits to hunters was based on the premise of a 5 percent success rate, which would amount to the killing of 500 bears. State regulations stipulate that bears of any age and either sex can be shot during a season -- scheduled for Dec. 8 to 13, intended to run at the same time as New Jersey's firearms season for deer. The dates are based on an assumption that the winter will be reasonably warm, and the majority of bears will be roaming and not underground, in hibernation.
 Lynda Smith, an activist who was placed on the state's bear panel, said she opposed the hunt and suspected that the state's Fish and Game Council had made a tacit decision to allow it even before the panel published its findings.
 "The hunt was a foregone conclusion," said Ms. Smith, director of the Bear Education and Resource Group, which has led a statewide campaign to tutor residents in ways to deter the animals from home sites. Last month, the group also picketed in anti-hunt protests held in front of Drumthwacket, Mr. McGreevey's official residence in Princeton.
 "We do have a problem," she continued. "The problem is that the Fish and Game Council is accountable to no one -- not to the voters, not to the governor and not to the Department of Environmental Protection."
 A measure of the state's own ambivalence was revealed when the environmental commissioner, Mr. Campbell, wrote to the game council in March, shortly before the initial vote to consider a bear hunt. In his letter, Mr. Campbell recorded a surge in animal complaints, but questioned the accuracy of state census numbers and emphasized the bear panel's lack of agreement. 
 "I was especially concerned about this because the Division of Fish and Wildlife's internal projection of the current population has increased by more than 70 percent over the past several months,"" wrote the commissioner, who describes himself as an "occasional hunter," although not of bears. "In light of these considerations, I urge the council to exercise caution in the use of current data to support a bear hunt."
 More recently, Mr. Campbell has softened somewhat. While falling short of an outright endorsement of the hunt, he said that he believed bear numbers likely stood "at the higher end of the range, but I am reserving judgment."
 He considered for a moment, then said: "No matter how many animals are taken in the hunt, we will continue to have bear-management problems in New Jersey. The hunt is certainly not a cure-all."

McGreevey's Shift Angers Some
 The politics of bears has proven at least as sticky as the arithmetic. Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for Mr. McGreevey, said the governor's change of heart came reluctantly, after a realization that bear numbers had tipped toward becoming a threat to public safety. In 2000, while still mayor of Woodbridge, Mr. McGreevey openly opposed plans to permit a hunt.
"The governor has serious personal concerns about a hunt," said Mr. Rasmussen."He wishes there was some alternative way to control the population. But ignoring the bear problem is no longer an option."
 News of Mr. McGreevey's reversal infuriated animal-rights groups, who said the change flew in the face of explicit campaign promises to protect bears made to Humane USA, a national political action committee. As a result, Wayne Pacelle, the chairman of the committee, said his group would no longer support a McGreevey candidacy.
 "Anybody interested in animals is going to know that Jim McGreevey failed to stop this hunt," said Mr. Pacelle, who is also a senior vice president of the Humane Society. "People need to understand that this is not a long-term strategy for handling bear-human relations."
 In fairness, it is not clear just what else Mr. McGreevey could do. Last year, the governor helped speed into law a bill making the feeding of bears by residents illegal. The new law is intended to break the chain of familiarity with the animals that too often ends in nuisance complaints about raided garbage cans and, ultimately, euthanasia.
 Efforts to trap and relocate animals out of state have withered because no other state wants them. Others have placed hopes in developing chemical castration or a contraceptive -- a vaccine that would prevent female bears from conceiving -- but even its most ardent backers admit such solutions are, at best, years in the future.
 "There have been a couple of captive studies of contraceptives on black bears, but no studies of bears in the field," said Dr. Rutberg, who is researching the project for the Humane Society. "All of them are encouraging, but none is definitive."
 On the political front, Mr. Howard reiterated that neither the governor nor the environmental commissioner has the power to overturn the game council's decisions. Further, two bills in the state Legislature that would ban hunting bears for five years have yet to see the light of day. Even the sponsors of those bills are beginning to waver.

'People Come First'
 "I am a realist," said state Senator Joseph F. Vitale, a Democrat of Woodbridge, who is a primary sponsor of a Senate bill for a ban. "People come first. A limited hunt may make sense."
 Assemblyman Christopher Bateman, a Republican from Somerville, is sponsoring the companion bill for a ban. Mr. Bateman declined to comment, but conceded in an interview last year that the state "may need to have a limited bear hunt down the road."
 For his part, Mr. Campbell insists that he holds the authority to end New Jersey's hunt prematurely, if he determines that the numbers of bears killed has been excessive. Yet any interruption could not take effect until the beginning of the hunt's third day, according to the game council's regulations. Therefore, said Mr. Campbell, the last chance to pre-empt the bear hunt almost certainly remains in the courts.
 Following that strategy, a coalition of animal-rights groups two weeks ago launched a lawsuit against the game council, the state wildlife division and the Department of Environmental Protection, claiming that the bear hunt is not justified by the population census. No timetable has yet been set for hearing the suit, which was filed in the Appellate Division of state Superior Court in Trenton.
 "We're exploring every avenue to get the hunt stopped," said Ms. Smith, whose activist organization joined the New Jersey Animal Rights Alliance in filing the complaint. "The cruelty of this is sickening,**.
 Applying other pressures, opponents of the hunt have potentially struck another blow. They have induced six towns within Newark's rural Pequannock watershed area to deliberate about allowing bear hunters access to 35,000 acres termed by one state wildlife official to be "the epicenter of bear problems in New Jersey."
 Zinnerford Smith, executive director of the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corporation, which manages the land, said that he had sought opinions from local officials in West Milford, Vernon, Rockaway, Kinnelon, Jefferson and Hardyston while preparing to make a decision. The state's hunt would be limited to lands north of Route 78 and west of Route 287 -- essentially to the counties of Sussex, Passaic,Morris, Hunterdon and Warren. Jefferson Township, in Morris County, has already voted to permit the hunt. In May, in neighboring West Milford, a man was slightly injured when he tackled a bear reportedly engaged in a fight with his dog.
 "You have to weigh in on citizen concerns," declared Mr. Smith. "We're either going to allow hunting on all the land or not at all. We're not going to complicate the issue."
 Regardless, as residents, scientists and politicians argue and collide, some see room for still further distinctions. Robert McDowell, who was director of the state wildlife division during the hunt furor in 2000, said the bear problem also boils down to dollars and cents. Instead of paying for bear control, public education and crop damages, said Mr. McDowell, the hunt should be viewed as a means of revenue.
 "All the uses of wildlife are an asset to the economy of the state," he said. "People forget that. I don't know of any other place in this country where the density of bears per square mile is this high or the density of people is this high."
 But to sidestep an issue they sensed might inflame public sentiments further, the game council decided not to levy a special permit fee for hunting bears -- unlike additional fees required to hunt ducks, geese, quail and pheasants. As with deer hunters, resident adults who wish to pursue bear will pay a $27.50 license fee. Under the law, hunters are allowed to carry shotguns with slugs or muzzleloading rifles, but not bows -- for the time being, deemed too likely to wound and not kill cleanly. Seminars to school would-be bear hunters are required, and scheduled to begin next month.
 Arguably, the recasting of bears as a game animal is a kinder fate than nuisance status, in which townships might choose to hire sharpshooters as a remedy.
 Carmen Aliberti, a retired electrician from Richwood, in Gloucester County, already has his hunting license and has applied for a free permit to shoot bears.
 Mr. Aliberti, who used to hunt black bears in Pennsylvania and Maine, said that he would drive to Sussex County and begin scouting his quarry. He likened the flavor of bear to "stringy steak, a tasty meat," and said that he would make use of most parts of the animal, not just the trophy pelt, as alleged by many hunt opponents.
 "It's exciting to be part of the first season," he said. "I feel if I can find the proper signs, I'll have a good chance."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
The Doctors Are Crying All the Way to the Bank

BYLINE:  By David Kocieniewski; David Kocieniewski is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
The sputtering economy and New Jersey's back-to-back budget deficits have inflicted plenty of serious financial pain in the past two years.
 Thousands of senior citizens have seen their prescription drug benefits slashed. Low-income families have lost their state-subsidized health insurance. Schools and local governments have been forced to make do with less; property taxpayers have been forced to pay more. Just last month, the McGreevey administration increased the fee it will collect from developmentally disabled adults who live in state group homes, forcing them to turn over 75 percent of their Social Security checks instead of 50 percent. 
 With all those people contending with all those calamitous problems, it is bewildering that the shrillest complaints about economic hardship have come from one of the most privileged quarters of society -- New Jersey's doctors.
 Substantial increases in medical malpractice insurance premiums have put a financial squeeze on many doctors. The increases have been steepest for high-risk specialists, forcing some obstetricians and emergency room doctors to leave the state or find another specialty. It is a serious, legitimate concern -- no one likes paying higher insurance premiums (as any New Jersey driver can surely attest). But the reaction from the state's medical establishment has been the political equivalent of a temper tantrum.
 The doctors have declared the issue "a crisis" and used their political influence and financial muscle to pressure lawmakers into backing a series of reform measures. Most of the state's political leaders are willing to back a plan that will collect a licensing fee from lawyers, doctors and insurers and offer financial assistance to those doctors facing the most drastic insurance increase.
 But the medical society is demanding still more: it has vowed to continue its hardball lobbying until the state also enacts a cap on malpractice awards for pain and suffering.
 To dramatize their concerns, the doctors have walked out on their patients three times during the past year and have scheduled another walkout for Tuesday. They have organized a campaign aimed at legislative candidates who oppose caps, and will be canvassing door-to-door in several swing districts.
 A few doctors have discussed organizing an effort to recall Governor McGreevey, as if the remedy for their problem is to put the state through the expense and political ordeal that has made California a political farce ("Calling Dr. Schwarzenegger "). A handful of renegade physicians have even suggested closing emergency rooms across the state unless they get their way.
 The whole debate has become so irrational and bombastic that there are times it appears as if it is being coordinated by Dr. Strangelove.
 While it is clearly in the state's best interests to keep doctors in business, the militancy and single-mindedness of the medical establishment is odd, and at odds with the facts because the only people guaranteed to benefit from malpractice caps are the insurers.
 Dr. Mark Olesnicky, president of the Medical Society of New Jersey, insists that high malpractice awards by juries are the culprit, and points to Texas and California as two states that have brought the premiums under control by instituting caps.
 "Caps are the only way," he said.
 But many experts contend that malpractice awards play only a small role in inflating the cost of premiums and that California only solved the problem by overhauling its malpractice insurance industry. Malpractice insurance is a cyclical business tied to the fluctuations of the bond market: when bond rates fall, insurers are pressured to increase the premiums. Malpractice insurance companies have been reluctant to open their books and allow lawmakers to analyze precisely what percentage of their operating costs are tied to jury awards.
 A report by the advocacy group Public Citizen, which analyzed data in the National Practitioner Data Bank, found that the number of malpractice payouts in New Jersey, and the total amount of malpractice awards, had dropped in 2001 and 2002, when premiums rose sharply.
 The legislation backed by Democratic legislators and the McGreevey administration includes language that would discourage frivolous lawsuits, tighten rules for expert witnesses and offer other protections to doctors. But they oppose the proposal backed by the medical establishment, which would grant insurers a $300,000 cap (and create a public fund to pay an additional $700,000) because some legitimate cases of negligence can cause extraordinarily expensive damage.
 So the doctors will continue their attempt to stoke sympathy from the public and the longer they persist, the more one wonders whether they should be tested for political tone-deafness. On Tuesday afternoon they will fan out to neighborhoods in several tight legislative districts and go door-to-door, warning voters that if doctors don't get their way, women might soon have to leave the state to have their babies delivered.
 Eight days, later members of the Ocean and Monmouth County medical societies are scheduled to meet to bemoan their dire financial condition and plot more strategy at a banquet hall in Lakewood. An invitation to the soiree, which features a cocktail hour and a choice of entrees -- chicken marquis or chateaubriand -- also includes one fascinating note: "Our thanks to the NJ Pure Malpractice Insurance Company for their sponsorship of this event."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Porsche Cayenne Turbo and Cayenne S; 
Taking Midlife Crises to New Places

BYLINE:  By KEITH MARTIN

 BODY:
SPORTS car buyers are a fickle lot, their purchases rising and falling with the economy. While a Porsche is often the self-prescribed treatment for a midlife crisis, Prozac may be a more affordable alternative when times are tough.
 In the go-go year of 1986, Porsche set a sales record of 30,471 cars in the United States. But as the economy sank, the company gasped. It sold just 3,729 cars in 1993, and some analysts wondered whether it could afford to stay in this market -- or to remain an independent car company at all. 
 A less expensive Porsche, the $40,000-and-up Boxster roadster, provided a lift in 1997. And the company began to consider how to give its booming-or-busting dealers something to sell that would not be so tied to stock prices, annual bonuses and the jobless rates on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley. 
Thus, Porsche decided to make a sharp break with its sports car heritage and jump into the booming sport utility market with a four-door, four-wheel-drive wagon that it ultimately named the Cayenne. To hold down the expense, development costs were shared with Volkswagen, whose new Touareg uses the same structure (though none of the mechanical components, Porsche representatives are quick to emphasize). 
The Cayenne arrived this summer to the curiosity of the masses and the horror of many longtime Porsche enthusiasts. Still, from a financial standpoint, the S.U.V. can only be viewed as a success. While sales of Porsche sports cars fell 41 percent through August of this year, overall sales increased 16 percent to 18,038 in that period. And the company's American sales nearly doubled last month, compared with September 2002, largely on the strength of the Cayenne.
Porsche set high goals for its new vehicle. Rather than compromise in any area, it sought to design the definitive S.U.V., one that could lap racetracks at sports car speeds, scramble up mountains like a billy goat and cruise comfortably to the spa.
Those lofty goals resulted in a lofty price.The Cayenne S starts at a healthy $56,665, the Cayenne Turbo a considerable $88,900. I drove both versions, an S with a sticker of $68,760 and a Turbo that listed for $96,090.
Porsche is known for its responsive engines, so it should be no surprise that the specifications of the Cayenne's new 4.5-liter liquid-cooled V-8 are impressive. In the S, which breathes normally, that engine produces 340 horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m., and 310 pounds-feet of torque in a wide range from 2,500 to 5,500 r.p.m. But while the nonturbo S provided lots of torque at low engine speeds, it felt curiously flat at higher revs. In comparison, the 290-horsepower V-8 in the BMW X5 4.4i feels sportier and more responsive.
The Turbo, with twin turbochargers, makes a staggering 450 horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m. and 457 pounds-feet of torque from 2,250 to 4,750 r.p.m. This is the most powerful engine in any mass-produced S.U.V.
Car and Driver magazine clocked the Cayenne Turbo at just 5 seconds from 0 to 60 m.p.h.; Porsche claims a more modest 7.2 seconds for the S. (By comparison, Car and Driver tested the six-cylinder Boxster S at 5.3 seconds.) Porsche says the Turbo's top speed is 165 m.p.h., the S's 150 m.p.h. 
Having owned a variety of Porsches over two decades, I wanted to like the Cayenne. But I found that driving both the S and the Turbo presented a variety of contradictions that made the overall experience less satisfying than I had expected.
Yes, the Turbo is the fastest S.U.V. I have ever driven. In most situations, the engine delivers a seamless, seemingly never-ending surge that can quickly take you to triple-digit speeds. Passing is effortless. But when driving in a spirited manner, there is a decided hesitation when you push the accelerator to the floor, before the turbos kick in. 
The resulting rush of power, when it arrives, is somewhat unsettling; indeed, on a gravel road, the rear tires consistently lost traction despite the best efforts of the various electronic suspension and traction-management electronics packed into the car.
To get the most performance out of the Turbo, I found that putting the Tiptronic into manual shift mode -- this is the first Porsche offered without the choice of a true manual gearbox -- increases the engine speed and reduces the turbo lag.
The Cayenne is no lightweight, with the Turbo weighing 5,192 pounds. As this is an S.U.V. rather than a low-slung sports car, it feels top-heavy when cornering briskly. The brakes are huge and effective, with 13.4-inch rotors and 6-piston calipers in front, 13-inch rotors and 4-piston calipers in back.
But despite all the sophistication and performance, I couldn't help but feel that the Cayenne is like a tenuous coalition of warring Balkan tribes: its weight fights its horsepower, and both its weight and horsepower fight its brakes, as effective as they are. Standing alone, each major aspect of the Cayenne is superlative, yet it is simply impossible for a vehicle this heavy, with such a high ride height, to feel truly nimble.
Another issue is styling, and the Cayenne will not win any beauty contests. While the VW Touareg, the Nissan Murano and the Infiniti FX have showed new possibilities for creative S.U.V. design, the Cayenne comes across as plain at best, stodgy and uninspired at worst. 
The Turbo's front end is unembellished except for fancy headlamps and a large air intake that resembles the one on the 911 Turbo. Viewed from the rear, wide haunches make the Cayenne look big-hipped.
Optional 20-inch wheels, wearing low-profile high-speed tires, are impressive. (Eighteen-inch wheels are standard on both models.) The Turbo has red brake calipers, a nearly obligatory (and meaningless) touch for a performance car these days. 
This S.U.V. is best enjoyed from the inside out. The leather in the Turbo is of designer quality; you feel as if you are sitting in a fitted set of Italian luggage. My Turbo test car was black, with a tan interior and blond wood across the dash, offset by silver surrounds for the shifter and the navigation, radio and cooling controls. The look was stunning, with a sense of quiet elegance overlaid with ruggedness, and it seemed fitting for a nearly six-figure S.U.V.
Unfortunately, the interior of the S suffers by comparison, with large-grain vinyl atop the dash that seems out of place in a $60,000 vehicle.
There are analog gauges plus digital readouts in front of the driver for fuel consumption (I never topped 12 m.p.g.), outside temperature and road speed. The ignition switch is to the left of the steering wheel, like those in the 911 and Boxster.Three switches in the center console control the electronic air suspension, which is standard on the Turbo and a $3,200 option on the S. One switch locks the center differential for serious off-road work; another sets the ride to sport, normal or comfort settings; and a third adjusts the ride height from extra low, to assist in loading and unloading, to nearly 11 inches of ground clearance. You can roll right over that boulder in the Neiman Marcus parking lot. 
Porsche says the Cayenne can ford streams up to 21.9 inches deep.
Rubberesque mats on top of the carpet are a nice touch, sort of like wearing lug-soled rubber wading boots over your tuxedo shoes.
There are grab handles on both sides of the center console. My wife, as a passenger, liked having one, but wondered why the driver needed one as well. "Wouldn't he be better served holding onto the wheel in the rough sections?" she asked.
The back seats are reasonably spacious, split in a 60/40 proportion and fold down easily. The rear is nicely carpeted, with tool and emergency kits stored underneath.
Despite the Cayenne's inherent contradictions of height, weight and horsepower, this is a fearsome performance machine. And Porsche expects it to be driven hard. For instance, at 130 m.p.h. the Turbo automatically lowers a half-inch for less air resistance and better handling. But how often will you drive your 2.5-ton S.U.V. at twice the speed limit?
For Porsche fanatics who already have a 911 and want a more practical Porsche for everyday use, the Cayenne is a dream come true. Porsche is betting that there are plenty of people willing to pay dearly for a speedwagon that wears its badge.
If you commute 300 miles a day over potholes or do hot laps at a weekend autocross, the Cayenne fills the bill. If you want to go into the woods to soothe your middle-age angst, the Cayenne will get you there.
But for the everyday chores of everyday people, the Touareg, the X5 and the FX45 can deliver a large percentage of this Porsche's usable capabilities at 50 percent of its price.

INSIDE TRACK: High performance, high price.

At Home in Lower Manhattan for 211 Years

BYLINE:  By Charles V. Bagli; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft renovated three Art Deco buildings in Lower Manhattan 20 years ago, the firm's partners expected that it would be their last move to a new headquarters. But Cadwalader, the oldest law firm in Manhattan, expanded into every nook and cranny of 100 Maiden Lane and took even more space across the street. 
 Now, when the economy seems to be teetering between a recession and a jobless recovery, Cadwalader is expanding again and planning for a new headquarters. Cadwalader is completing negotiations to move to more spacious accommodations seven blocks away at 1 World Financial Center. 
 Robert O. Link Jr., Cadwalader's chairman, said the firm intends to grow eventually to 750 lawyers, from 400 today. The firm also expects to increase the size of its administrative staff, now about 400 people. 
Rosy growth projections often prove to be faulty, especially when the economic news is grim and investment banks and other companies are still laying off employees. But Mr. Link said the firm's anticipated job growth was based conservatively on what has happened at the firm over the last decade. 
The number of lawyers at Cadwalader's New York offices has jumped by nearly 90 percent since 1996, through good times and bad. "We've tried to position ourselves so that we're recession-proof," Mr. Link said. The firm's largest practice is in financial services, but it also does litigation, bankruptcy and restructuring, and real estate finance. 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki were so thrilled with Cadwalader's decision that they hastily arranged a news conference on Sept. 17, even though the firm had not completed the negotiations to lease 450,000 square feet on 14 floors at 1 World Financial Center. It expects to move in early 2005.
The politicians wanted some good news for downtown, which has been wounded by corporate relocations since the attack on the World Trade Center and layoffs at financial services companies. After all, Pillsbury Winthrop, an old-line downtown law firm that merged with a California firm, had decided to abandon its roots in the financial district and move to the Bertelsmann Building in Times Square to be closer to its clients. Sidley Austin Brown & Wood have moved to Seventh Avenue from downtown. Cadwalader also considered moving to a skyscraper at 7 Times Square, or to satellite offices outside the city.
"Midtown rents are as attractive as we will see in our lifetime," Mr. Link said. But when the time came, the partners voted 3 to 1 to remain in Lower Manhattan, the firm's home since it began in 1792. 
"Ultimately, we believe that downtown is still the financial capital of the world," Mr. Link said. "We didn't feel like abandoning it. We believe in the rebirth of Lower Manhattan."
In the interest of full disclosure, rents are also 25 to 35 percent cheaper downtown. And state and city officials provided Cadwalader with a $5.3 million grant from a program intended to retain businesses in Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attack, $1 million in low-cost electricity and up to $3.4 million if the firm adds 400 employees over the next five years. 
Cadwalader is selling its 100 Maiden Lane complex, with the most likely buyer an investor who will convert the building to apartments. 
But the move by Cadwalader also highlights an employment trend in which the city's law firms have generally fared better than most other businesses since the local economy peaked in 2000. Private-sector employment in the city has fallen by more than 150,000 jobs, or 4 percent, since 2000. But the decline at law firms generally has been more modest. From 2000 to 2002, the number of jobs in legal services fell by 1,000, or only 1.2 percent, to 81,900. 
Indeed, Studley, the real estate firm that represents Cadwalader, said that law firms have accounted for more than 20 percent of all the office space leased this year.

HEADLINE: Gambling on Family Fun 

BYLINE:  By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
APROPOSAL to build a theme park near the casinos has caused quite a stir in a region once famed for Mystic Seaport and the Mystic Aquarium. It sounds logical to place family entertainment near the casinos, the state's top tourist draw, but it may not be the slam dunk that some towns surrounding Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun hope. Las Vegas tried the same strategy about 10 years ago and the jury is still out on whether it was a good idea.
 Utopia Studios, a New York investment group led by Joseph Gentile, his wife, the actress Cathy Moriarty-Gentile, and Francesca Hilton, the daughter of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Conrad Hilton, has proposed building a theme park similar to Universal Studios in California on the former site of Norwich State Hospital, which is less than 15 miles from the casinos. It is just the latest proposal to build an entertainment park near the casinos to take advantage of the almost 25 million people who go there a year. 
 "I believe for our casinos to continue to be successful in the future, southeastern Connecticut has to become a destination, especially as other states build casinos," said Bob Congdon, the first selectman of Preston. "The proposal for the Norwich State Hospital site would do that. It would give people a reason to come to southeastern Connecticut, maybe for the casinos, maybe for this. We definitely need to diversify our area." 
But the question still stands. Do gambling and a family vacation mix? Should the towns who fought the casinos and their continued expansion now open their arms to developers who promise jobs and new property tax revenue? A closer look at Las Vegas shows that the same strategy there ended up with what gaming analysts said were mixed results.
In the 1990's, Las Vegas tried to promote a family-friendly image by building lavish theme parks, spending millions on entertainment to attract families. Although Las Vegas had long seen its share of children, brought by parents who wouldn't, or couldn't, leave them at home, the move worked. The percentage of families visiting Las Vegas rose, from 7 percent in 1992 to 12 percent by 1996.
Then the new approach began to unravel. The MGM Grand Hotel's $100 million Grand Adventures theme park, opened in 1993, closed in 2000, citing poor attendance. Parents who were comforted by the sight of gleaming new theme parks were stunned when a 7-year-old California girl was raped and murdered at a Nevada casino in 1997 while her father was gambling. The city has not added any new major family attractions in years. 
Bit by bit, the casinos backed away from the family-friendly focus. As the MGM Grand turned its back on its theme park, it opened La Femme, a revue featuring nude dancers. Other hotels were doing the same. Still, the family numbers did not diminish, fluctuating between 10 and 12 percent of total visitors to Las Vegas over the past four years, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
"I think there was a short-term approach to the family market and it has certainly changed," said Sandy Zanella, a spokeswoman for the MGM Grand. "Las Vegas as a whole is an adult playground. Families still come here and they are certainly welcome, but we are geared toward adults."
So are Connecticut's casinos, and both tribes acknowledge that. Although regional officials were enthusiastic about creating an even larger entertainment area in the region, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods distanced themselves from promoting the idea of children at their casinos.
"We make a distinction on separating that here," said Mark Brown, the chairman of the Mohegan Tribe. "The retail component, and the restaurants, the arena, the hotels, are not bringing people into gaming. With Las Vegas, you're walking your family past the slot machines to check into the hotel."
Foxwoods has concentrated on its resort and casino business and was adamant about its adult orientation.
"We are an adult theme park," said Bruce MacDonald, a spokesman for Foxwoods. "We market to adults and we specifically do not market to people under 21 because this is an adult activity. This is not a young person's destination."
Analysts said whether a theme park would survive in Connecticut depends on several factors. The weather in New England has been a constant issue, said Steven Kent, a gaming and lodging analyst at Goldman Sachs. A theme park also needs to be self-supporting, he said, meaning it cannot rely solely on casino traffic to survive.
"Although a theme park could draw more traffic into that market and could be exceptionally successful, the history on combined family entertainment with casinos is mixed," Mr. Kent said, noting Las Vegas's attempts. Alternately, he said that Atlantis, a resort in the Bahamas, successfully mixed a water park with a casino to attract families. 
"The Connecticut casinos have reached out to the community, with basketball and concerts and restaurants," he said. "The strategy of reaching out to customers both for their entertainment and gaming dollars has been successful in other markets."
The numbers for visitors stopping at Mystic attractions then heading to the casinos has increased in the past two years, according to one study. In 2001, 500 people were part of a study done by Mystic & More, a marketing arm of the Mystic attractions. Of those visitors, 19.7 proceeded on to Foxwoods, and 9.9 went to Mohegan Sun. One year later, in a study of 752 people, 32 percent went on to visit Foxwoods and 29 percent to Mohegan Sun, said Diana Ketner, a spokeswoman for Mystic & More. Ms. Ketner could not explain the increase.
"It's hard to track whether people go to the casino and leave the area or visit other attractions," said Eliza Cole of Mystic & More. "We aren't really sure what the precise numbers are."
The Connecticut theme park proposal, although not detailed, would be primarily indoors. The park would cost about $400 to $500 million to build, with an additional cost for construction of 5,000 hotel rooms, said Mr. Congdon of Preston. The remaining Norwich Hospital acreage might be used for classrooms for Three Rivers Community College and for a marina to be developed by another company, he said. 
Utopia Studios had shopped its proposal during the past four years to various municipalities, including the Bronx and Calverton, N.Y. Mr. Gentile said a press conference is scheduled for Friday to reveal his financial backing.
"We've entertained numerous sites, and it's about trying to find the right home," Mr. Gentile said. "I can't tell you much yet, but while this is a standalone project, the traffic -- millions of people -- is already here. This is becoming a destination region, and we're very excited about this site."
Other theme-park proposals for the area around the casinos have met with resistance. Madeline Jeffery of North Stonington, who helped fight off a Six Flags amusement park proposal in 1997 and tribal land annexations in her town, said developers have been buying the open space around the casinos. Besides tribal purchases, Hackman Capital Properties of California has bought 220 acres this year near the Mohegan Sun casino and is negotiating for more. Michael Hackman, president of the company, said it hasn't decided what to build on the property. 
"I would never have built a casino here, I would say you're crazy," Ms. Jeffery said. "But seeing these casinos and seeing the number of people who go up there every day, I can imagine almost anything now. These proposals are all busy work -- it's a reason to come here, to make our towns a resort destination. They're thinking, 'who else can we drag here, and what can we do with the kids?"'
The similarities are striking enough: Las Vegas rose from a dark and desolate plot of sand to a strip of entertainment choices. In southeastern Connecticut, Foxwoods grew from an almost empty reservation.
Bill Eadington, director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a professor of economics there, said the Connecticut casinos are the closest thing to Las Vegas strip casinos that you can find outside Vegas in America.
"Good entertainment, hotels, increasing outdoor recreation," he said. "They are building all the pieces that Las Vegas has developed. My suspicion is, if anywhere else in the country is going to make this transformation, it's southeastern Connecticut or Atlantic City, and Atlantic City still has a seedy day-trip destination feeling to it. Southeastern Connecticut has a critical mass now -- they're generating a couple of billion dollars a year in gaming revenues, mainly day-trip destinations -- and at some point it all starts looking like a potential resort." 
The financial feasibility of building family fun around all the casino traffic is not lost on longtime casino opponents. Jeff Benedict, founder of the Connecticut Alliance against Casino Expansion, said he is sympathetic to the southeastern Connecticut towns who have reaped little benefit from the casinos.
"You can't fault a town like Preston for giving serious consideration for a plan like this theme park," Mr. Benedict said. "It has been largely left out of the massive revenues brought in by Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. In the best-case scenario, the towns and local tourism districts would be in a place where they could reject out-of-hand any proposal that would feed into gambling, but the landscape here is such that two sovereign tribes have casinos that are not going away. A project like a theme park at least can be taxed and generate money in that way. Are we happy that people are bringing in theme parks that frame casinos as family-friendly? No. Do we think it's healthy for the social policy of Connecticut. No. But with towns buckling under fiscal problems and two casinos that produce billions each year, I can understand it." 
Mr. Congdon of Preston did indeed embrace the proposal. Although the state is responsible for marketing the Norwich Hospital property, the town has the first right of refusal for development proposals. Originally marketed as a biotechnology campus, the 500 acre-campus, reminiscent of a crumbling British estate, has sat unused since the state officially closed the mental hospital there in 1996. Town officials had hoped that Pfizer might build its headquarters there. That did not happen, and little interest has been shown by other companies. A decade ago, there was talk of building an amusement park on the property, but the area was zoned residential. The zoning has been changed since then. 
"We definitely need to diversify our area," Mr. Congdon said. "A circus-like atmosphere is not what I envision. What I see is more like Universal Studios in California. People can watch movies being made, and there would be an entertainment component to it, but it would be complementing the movie studio rather than being a Six Flags or other amusement park." 
Tourism and casino spokespeople in southeast Connecticut distinguished between Las Vegas and southeastern Connecticut, which Mystic Seaport and Mystic Aquarium initially established as a family destination. The casinos just added more traffic, they said.
"I have a 10- year old granddaughter, and we've been to Mohegan Sun to go to a basketball game," said Larry McHugh, executive director of the Middlesex County Chamber of Commerce and former head of the Connecticut Tourism Council. "I don't have a problem with it. When people go in and see what it's like, the naysayers will disappear. It's O.K. to go to the Caribbean and stay in a hotel where there's gambling going on and there's no hang-up there. And there's a huge difference between Las Vegas doing that in the 90's and our region."
He pointed to Mystic Seaport and the aquarium, the Valley Railroad in Essex and the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme.
"Those activities were here before the casinos came in, and this place was already known as a family area," he said. "To have an excellent theme park will boost the attendance at these other venues."
Although Mr. Eadington acknowledged that some of the Las Vegas theme park investments of the 1990's failed, he pointed to others that succeeded.
"The key statistic is that over all, the number of families coming to Las Vegas has increased," he said. "Those particular investments missed the mark, but the whole package of activities in Las Vegas, including a lot of thrill rides and family entertainment venues, have made the city considerably more attractive to families. There's always been sex in Las Vegas, it's always had an R-rated overtone. But Las Vegas is a diversified and segmented market, and the family market grew through the 90's. Now, Vegas has become a 21st-century recreation center for adults, with a few kids thrown in."

HEADLINE: The Downside Of Moses' Legacy 

 BODY:
"Robert Moses' Village Gets Him Back, in Bronze" Sept. 28 , on the installation of a statue of Robert Moses in Babylon, tended to portray the works of Moses as mainly beneficial to the majority of, if not all, New Yorkers, and Long Islanders in particular.
 The parks created by Moses on Long Island and throughout New York State do stand as a monument to his vision. 
However, in the course of his building rampage, Moses, as an unelected virtual despot, displaced at least 250,000 people to build his highways, and maybe the same number to build Lincoln Center and other public buildings, campuses and urban renewal projects. Most of these displaced individuals were poor, black and Latino, and without a political voice or financial power (unlike the North Shore landowners who fought, and usually won, their battles with Moses). 
 The housing projects built for poor people were bleak, sterile and further destroyed the neighborhoods they were placed in. The vast majority of the public parks built in New York City by Moses were concentrated in middle-class neighborhoods. By concentrating his transportation development on highways he starved the subways and commuter railroads of needed funds.
 It is Moses whom we should thank for the irritating, life-consuming concern that is the current reality for getting from one place to another on Long Island. His works were monumental and awesome, but as Robert Caro wrote in his Moses biography, "no aspect of those highways and bridges and tunnels was as awesome as the congestion on them."

HEADLINE: The Untouchables 

BYLINE:  By John Colapinto; John Colapinto, a contributing editor to Rolling Stone, is the author of "As Nature Made Him" and "About the Author," a novel. His last article for the magazine was about young Republicans.

 BODY:
Last May, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, facing an almost $4 billion budget gap, made the difficult decision to close six New York City firehouses -- including one in Williamsburg, Brooklyn: Engine Company 212, popularly known as the People's Firehouse. Neighborhood residents refused to take it lying down. By the fall, some three months after the closings -- and long after demonstrations at the five other closed houses (in Harlem, Brooklyn and Queens) had faded -- the protest at Engine Company 212 was still going strong. Firefighters and local residents draped the facade of the two-story, redbrick building on a scrubby section of Wythe Avenue with banners reading "fire cuts kill" and "budgets slashed, brooklyn burned." In a tent on the sidewalk in front of the firehouse, volunteers from the neighborhood took turns sleeping each night. By day, they collected signatures on a petition, determined to get their firehouse reopened. 
 Their goal was not as quixotic as it might seem. In New York City politics there are few issues more volatile than firehouse closings -- especially after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, when the Fire Department lost 343 men and New York City firefighters became known around the world as America's Heroes. But even before that tragedy, politicians knew that closing a firehouse was not to be done lightly. It is, as one source in the Bloomberg administration says, "a third rail for politicians -- touch it and expect to do damage to yourself." The People's Firehouse protesters knew this from experience. 
 Back in 1975, Mayor Abraham Beame also closed Engine Company 212 -- or tried to. Before the building was actually shuttered, a local factory worker named Adam Veneski roused the north-side neighborhood by bullhorn, then he, his wife, his 11-year-old son, Paul, and others stormed the building and occupied it for 18 months. Beame was hammered by regular news stories about the little engine company that wouldn't die. After Beame lost his re-election bid, his successor, Ed Koch, reopened Engine Company 212 and the legend of "the People's Firehouse" was born. 
Adam Veneski died a few years ago, but Paul, now 39, is carrying on the fight for Engine Company 212 today. On the morning of its most recent closing, Veneski sneaked into the firehouse basement and chained himself to the fire truck. Since then, he has put himself in front of a lot of TV cameras and microphones, vowing that he will get the firehouse reopened. On the day I recently visited Engine Company 212, Veneski wasn't there; he was at work, but he had fine spokespersons in the three protesters camped out on folding chairs in front of the building.
"I'm going to be out here as long as it takes," said Leonides Reyes, a 40-something unemployed man whose hair was wrapped in an American-flag bandanna. "I've lived in this neighborhood all my life, and I'm going to fight for our firehouse."
Leonore Russo, a grandmotherly woman from the neighborhood, chimed in, "They're using Gestapo tactics." She was referring to a recent raid by police in riot gear, who seized the fire truck from the building while protesters tried to fight them off. "We're going to get our engine back." 
"I was born after the Second World War," said the third protester, Del Teague, an attorney who has lived in Williamsburg for 25 years. "It was ingrained in me how sacred democracy is. I lived through a time when people said, 'Don't ever, ever accept a leader who gets up there and says, "It doesn't matter what you think; just do what I say." ' Bloomberg did that when he closed this firehouse." 
You have to admire the passion of the People's Firehouse advocates -- fighting against a budget cut that, they're convinced, has made their lives and property less secure. 
But there are some stubborn realities that make the story of the People's Firehouse, with its stirring overtones of dynastic struggle against a bullying and autocratic City Hall, a little difficult to conform to the movie-of-the-week treatment it begs for. Chief among these is that Engine Company 212 has been among the city's most inactive firehouses. At the time of its closing, it ranked near the very bottom in every category of measurement for activity of the city's then 203 engine companies, including number of calls to structural fires, medical emergencies and total number of runs. Nor can it plausibly be argued that removing Engine Company 212 has left north-side Williamsburg without fire services. Another engine company is situated within blocks of the closed house, and two others within three miles. According to the Fire Department's preclosing computer analysis and to real-time statistics gathered in the two months after the closings, those companies are able to respond, on average, in under four and a half minutes to any location within the area that Engine Company 212 had covered. This response time is well within the city average of 4 minutes 50 seconds, and one that, even after the removal of Engine Company 212, makes the residents of Williamsburg's north side, statistically, among the best-protected of city residents. Which goes some way toward explaining why Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta says that the closing of Engine Company 212 was a "no-brainer." At a time of dire budget crisis, it made no sense to keep open an almost moribund firehouse that was costing the city $1.2 million a year to staff and operate. 
But Mayor Bloomberg's decision to close the six firehouses sheds light on a little-remarked-upon fact about the New York City Fire Department as a whole. Namely, that today it rarely fights fires. Indeed, Deputy Mayor for Operations Marc Shaw told a budget panel last spring that firefighters spend only 5 percent of their time performing the skill for which they are so highly trained and so widely lionized. The reason for the vast reduction in firefighting is obvious enough: New York City isn't burning the way it used to -- especially when compared with what firefighters call the War Years, that extraordinary period from the late 1960's to mid-1970's when a confluence of social and cultural factors made New York City a kind of perfect storm for fires. Arson-for-profit spiked as the city slid from recession into bankruptcy, and desperate business owners, trying to save themselves from financial ruin, torched their own premises for the insurance money. Laws stipulating that welfare recipients could escape their grim city-subsidized dwellings in case of fire led to a rash of apartment arsons (one veteran firefighter recalls arriving at an apartment fire only to find the occupant out front on the street with bags packed and ready to go). Add to this a heroin epidemic that had junkies nodding off, cigarettes in hand, all over the city and a roiling climate of social protest ("Burn, baby, burn" was a favorite slogan of the day), and you had a metropolis that was, literally, going up in flames. Firefighters in the worst-hit neighborhoods -- the South Bronx, Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant -- routinely fought three or four major blazes a night. So difficult was it for the Fire Department to keep up with the conflagrations that they resorted to throwing up two temporary firehouses in corrugated metal Quonset huts on vacant lots and doubling up engine companies in single firehouses. 
Things are completely different today. The number of structural fires in New York has dropped to a rate unheard of since the 1950's; last year, the city had the lowest number of civilian fire fatalities in 75 years -- statistics that reflect not only a more pacific social climate, but also improved building codes and construction over the last 30 years: fire-retardant materials and automatic sprinkler systems are the norm in buildings today. Large demographic shifts have further rendered the city's firehouses less active than when many of them were built 75 to 130 years ago. Back then, the siting of firehouses was dictated by the limited firefighting technology of the day. Engines were pulled by horse-drawn carts and fires were doused with water that was hand-pumped, so firehouses needed to be close together to keep response times down. But what was effective siting for a city of the postindustrial revolution is considerably less so for a city of the 21st century.
Given these realities, and the size of the city's yawning budget hole, Mayor Bloomberg decided that cuts to the Fire Department were unavoidable. Everyone in his administration knew how tricky it would be. New York City mayors have struggled with theproblem of declining productivity in the Fire Department ever since the mid-1970's, when fires started to decline and the War Years began to come to a close. Mayor Beame's standoff with the protesters at Engine Company 212 was only the first in a series of clashes over the shuttering of a firehouse, but it stood as a potent warning to every city politician who came after. When Mayor Ed Koch closed Engine Company 232 in Brooklyn, he ordered his men to figure out a way to, as one former aide in the Koch administration puts it, "avoid another People's Firehouse." The solution they arrived at was effective, if unsubtle. On Super Bowl Sunday, 1988, the Fire Department issued a false call to Engine Company 232, summoning them to cover for another firehouse. When the firefighters returned to their building, they found guards out front and a padlock on the door. Koch had avoided a showdown with activists, but the tactic backfired. More than 4,000 firefighters marched across the Brooklyn Bridge chanting obscenities at him.
Koch's successor, David Dinkins, was also hurt by a firehouse closing. In January 1991, he shuttered Engine Company 294 in Richmond Hill, Queens, and then suffered the nightmare every politician who closes a firehouse fears. Within days, a fire swept through a nearby home, killing two men. Two years later, Rudolph Giuliani resurrected the incident when he ran against Dinkins for mayor, assailing Dinkins repeatedly over the tragedy and making the reopening of Engine Company 294 a campaign promise. (Giuliani did reopen the firehouse after he defeated Dinkins.)
In the weeks leading up to the recent closings, it quickly became clear that Mayor Bloomberg was not going to avoid the problems of his predecessors. Rallies were held at the six firehouses, and City Council members in those districts leveled a lawsuit to block the closings; it was denied. Joining in the chorus of voices were the two firefighters' unions. Pete Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, insisted that the firehouses were not redundant, that despite fewer fires, other calls -- stuck elevators, gas leaks and emergency response -- were increasing. Steve Cassidy, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, devised a plan for corporate sponsorship of the houses slated for closure. "I spoke with several corporations who were absolutely interested," he says. "It would have cost them $1.3 million per corporation per year, and we were looking for a three-year commitment. I said to the mayor: 'They'll want something for it. They may want to put their logo on the firehouse door, or something, that's to be negotiated.' They didn't want to do it."
A close adviser to Mayor Bloomberg explains why the administration dismissed the scheme. "How do you give essential municipal services to a corporation?" the aide says. "How do you allocate them? Is a corporation willing to pay for a firehouse on Fifth Avenue but not on 169th and Third Avenue in the Bronx? If we're going to get corporate sponsorship, we should decide what service we need and where we need it. We shouldn't do it because somebody's willing to pay for a firehouse, if it's not what you need in the end."
Bloomberg stuck to his plan to close the houses, but took a different approach than previous mayors. In the weeks before the closings, he visited each firehouse personally and spoke to the firefighters. "The guys weren't happy, clearly," says a Fire Department insider, "but he went there to take the heat, to say to them: 'Blame me. Don't blame anybody else.' Talk about gutsy." It did little good. The unions and firefighters continued to attack Bloomberg publicly, arguing that the data on postclosing response times is flawed. (The Mayor's office counters that it used the same system for computing response times that it has always used and is employed by fire departments across the country.) 
The unions weren't the only ones to pile on. One City Council member, when asked how much the mayor harmed himself with the closings, told me, not without relish: "Deeply. He may never recover."
Some within the Bloomberg administration seem inclined to agree. "If you're a politician and you close six firehouses," says one of Bloomberg's senior aides, "you just gave your opponent six communities to go into, at the next election, with a bludgeon. Which makes it incredibly difficult to do. That's why mayors don't want to do it." But Bloomberg, he argues, had no choice. Facing a budget gap that exceeded, in dollar value, even that which nearly sank the city in the late 1970's, he had to make cuts, and it only made sense that they would include one of the city's most inefficient agencies. As Ray Horton, a professor at the Columbia Business School and former president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors the city and state, puts it, "If a well-run operation seeks to use its people and its facilities as fully as possible, then the Fire Department falls about as far short of that as any organization you could ever think of." In addition, firefighters are among the best paid of all city workers. With overtime, the average annual pay for a member of the Fire Department is more than $60,000. 
Even at that, however, Bloomberg was mindful of the politics of fire cuts. Despite the six closings, the Fire Department took a light hit compared with other city agencies. More than half of the city's public health assistants were laid off. Three thousand members of the city's municipal work force lost their jobs. Other essential agencies had 25 to 30 percent of their operating budgets axed. In comparison, the New York City Fire Department took a 10 percent cut to its operating budget of $1.2 billion, and none of its workers were fired. The firefighters who worked in the six engine companies that were closed were reassigned to other houses, and indeed were given a pick of where they wanted to go. Yet the firefighters fought the cuts, telling reporters that the closings would lead to deaths, festooning their firehouses in banners that attacked the mayor's decision. 
But then, the Fire Department has always been reluctant to accept any changes that would make it more cost-effective. In the mid-1990's, Mayor Giuliani, determined to get greater productivity out of a department that was fighting fewer and fewer fires, initiated a plan to make firefighters first responders in medical emergencies, with a long-term plan ultimately to fold E.M.S. into the Fire Department. The unions fought the change furiously, then agreed to take on the added work only if they got extra pay on top of their regular firefighting salaries. Negotiations between the unions and the Fire Department took years to settle. Still, many in the Fire Department continue to resent doing E.M.S. work, and the comfortable integration of E.M.S. into the Fire Department is far from complete. 
The fire department's deep resistance to change is, in some respects, an inevitable aspect of the firehouse culture. Firefighters, who sometimes refer to themselves as the Brotherhood, are second family to one another. They live together, sleep together, shop together, cook together, clean together and socialize together. And sometimes they die together. As in the military, such enforced fraternity breeds the trust necessary for the performing of life-threatening duties as a team. But the culture also breeds a mentality that rebels against authority outside its direct chain of command, a deep suspicion of the outside world and a sometimes poisonous attitude of Us against Them. 
Thomas Von Essen knows the culture in the New York City Fire Department as well as anyone. He worked in the department for 32 years, first as a firefighter with Ladder Company 42 in the South Bronx, then as head of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, and eventually as fire commissioner under Mayor Giuliani. (He is now a senior vice president at Giuliani Partners, a consulting firm created by the former mayor.) Von Essen is one of the few former department insiders who will speak on the record about firehouse closings. His willingness in part reflects his alienation from the Brotherhood. Von Essen first angered the unions and firefighters when, as commissioner, he pushed hard for the department to take on expanded E.M.S. duties, but he was most ferociously criticized by the unions and the rank and file after Sept. 11, when he tried to reduce the number of firefighters assigned to clean up at Ground Zero. Von Essen was booed by the firefighters at a Madison Square Garden tribute after the attacks -- a major humiliation.
Today, Von Essen is, at the very least, a man no longer interested in upholding the myths that can obscure what ails the department. He is blunt in saying that Mayor Bloomberg was justified in closing the six firehouses, and that, indeed, "he probably could have closed a few more." He points to the vast reduction in fires, the changing demographics of the city, and the simple, unavoidable fact that in slow firehouses firefighters are sitting on their hands. These firefighters "are often bored, but unwilling to admit it," Von Essen says. 
He also scoffs at the union officials who say that the absence of a given engine in one of the closed neighborhoods will eventually lead to a death that could have been prevented. "You could absolutely create any scenario you want to make it impossible to ever close anything," he says. "It's like the police. If you want to give everybody maximum protection, I suppose we should have a police officer in the vestibule of every apartment building. At some point somebody has to say, 'Well, we can't afford one in every vestibule.' You can't run a city or an army or anything like that." As Von Essen goes on to explain, "Any time you say that there's any logic to closing a firehouse, it's like the end of the world."
Indeed, often firefighters from closed houses are ultimately happy to be reassigned to a busy house. As one longtime veteran of the Fire Department told me, firefighters "just say they don't want to go because that's the thing you're supposed to say. They're afraid of the Brotherhood coming down on them." 
It's 10:30 a.m. at Engine Company 55 on the fringe of Little Italy and, since shift change at 9, the house has answered three calls. The first was an E.M.S. run to the corner of Lafayette and Canal streets -- what one of the firefighters sardonically calls a "popular call." It involved helping a local homeless man, Juan Cruz, whom the firefighters of Engine Company 55 regularly escort to a detox center. The second call was to a construction site where a wire shorted out and caught fire under a board in the street. The third call was a stove fire that the apartment dweller had already doused with a home extinguisher. Capt. Richard Sautner describes Engine Company 55 as a "middle-of-the-road house, in terms of activity." Now it's moving toward 11 a.m., and Captain Sautner is having coffee with one of his fellow firefighters in the kitchen out back, beyond the treadmill and exercise equipment. In front of the building, two younger firefighters are lounging around the firehouse entrance, sipping ice water, smoking cigarettes, watching the tourists pass along the sidewalk on Broome Street. Every few minutes someone stops and asks directions. Only one member of the five-man company is working hard today, and that's the new guy -- a probie fresh out of the fire academy. 
"Yeah, he's our new janitor, laundry man, sous chef and cleaning man," says one of the firefighters in front of the building. "One of Brooklyn's own." 
According to Captain Sautner, Engine Company 55 was rumored to have been on a list for closing back in the 1960's. Judging from the pace of things around here today, that doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Engine Company 55's splendid Romanesque and Beaux-Arts firehouse was built in 1898, it serviced a neighborhood of tightly packed tenement houses honeycombed with immigrant sweatshops and cell-like basement rooms that housed workers who lighted their quarters with candles, and later, bulbs powered by overloaded sockets and extension cords -- a serious firetrap that made the area busy indeed for the local firehouses. But demographic changes over the last century have transformed the neighborhood. Today, the surrounding area is filled with renovated multimillion-dollar loft spaces, upscale boutiques, and the glamorous bars and restaurants of Nolita and SoHo. And many of the buildings are now equipped with state-of-the-art sprinkler systems, alarms and fire-retardant materials.
Captain Sautner admits that these changes have resulted in a lot less work for him and his men. "Well, we're busy," he clarifies, "but there are more 'busy' things to do." By this, he means the round of regular, daily drills to keep their firefighting skills sharp (with fires down so drastically, New York's firefighters no longer learn primarily on the job; they learn in the classroom and in simulated situations). They also go out, twice a week, on the dreaded building inspection -- or "B.I." -- to make note of fire code violations in the neighboring buildings. The rest of their time is filled with E.M.S. runs. They get the odd heart attack, of course, but often it's calls like the one to ferry Juan Cruz to detox. Since the anthrax attacks that followed Sept. 11, every firehouse in the city has had an increased number of calls to stem biochemical terrorist attacks -- which, so far, have all turned out to be nothing more harmful than spilled Ajax on a subway platform or unspecified powders in buildings. "You name it," Sautner says. 
But despite its drastically reduced workload, and the fact that there are other engine companies nearby, it's doubtful that Engine Company 55 will ever be closed -- not now, not after Sept. 11, when Engine Company 55 took a particularly devastating blow. Five of its six men on duty died when the twin towers collapsed, crushing their fire truck. The engine company has built a shrine in their firehouse, just inside the front door, where it's visible to passers-by on the street: at its center is the truck's crumpled door still whitened by the dust from ground zero. In the days after Sept. 11, Engine Company 55 became a mandatory photo-op backdrop for visiting celebrities and politicians -- in part thanks to the actor Steve Buscemi, who was a firefighter at Engine Company 55 from 1980 to 1984. Among those who visited were Paul McCartney, the actor Denis Leary and President George W. Bush, who ate pizza at Engine Company 55's kitchen table three weeks after the World Trade Center attacks. 
Chris Geraghty, a tough-looking man in his early 30's, is a firefighter with Engine Company 55. After stints in advertising and bartending, he joined the department four and a half years ago. He was off-duty the morning of the terrorist attacks but reported to a firehouse near his home in Manhattan. He later helped to clean up the site. Geraghty has better reason than most to know how different the life of a firefighter is today from that of a firefighter 30 years ago. His father was a firefighter in the Bronx and Brooklyn during the height of the burning in the early 70's. "We wouldn't see him for days at a time," says Geraghty of himself and his five siblings. "He told us stories of going to three, four fires a night."
By comparison, Chris fights perhaps one serious structural fire a month. His last "real fire" -- by which he means one that his engine company was first responder to and which was more than a pot of beans left on the stove -- was a mattress fire; dangerous, but not the kind of five-alarm row-house inferno that would have been routine in his father's day. Geraghty reluctantly admits to the itchiness that comes with inactivity. "Everybody gets excited when they hear 'Fire,"' he says. When I ask if his father ever ribs him about the relative ease of his life as a firefighter, Geraghty shoots back: "You mean because he went to a fire every day? No. My father tells me, 'After 9/11, you've seen more than I saw in 30 years on the job."' 
The answer makes emotional, but not rational, sense. Horrible as it must have been to dig out at ground zero, that experience was different from the daily dangers faced by Geraghty's father. But Chris's answer does get to the heart of why firefighters are so opposed to firehouse closings, or indeed any changes in the Fire Department. Tradition, firehouse culture, the Brotherhood -- whatever name you give it -- blind them to the realities at play when a mayor is facing a disastrous budget crisis. Unable, or unwilling, to acknowledge that the huge reduction in fires has introduced redundancies into the department, most firefighters feel only bitterness at the closings. As Geraghty puts it, "Makes you feel a little like the flavor of the month. One minute you're heroes, the next minute they're shutting houses."
If any event underlined the enormous differences in the flammability of New York City today versus the New York City of the so-called War Years, it was the blackout of Aug. 14, 2003. Though a higher than usual number of fires did occur that night (mostly because of mishaps with candles), the city's 197 firehouses proved sufficient to handle all facets of the emergency, from fires to stuck elevators to subway evacuations (in comparison with 1977, when the city exploded in arson and looting). Still, this summer's blackout did point up the huge political risks Mayor Bloomberg has taken in shutting the six firehouses. One of the fires that broke out that night trapped four elderly people in a four-story apartment building in north-side Williamsburg, within the first-call zone of former Engine Company 212, the People's Firehouse. It was one of those incidents that no computer model could have predicted. All the engine companies meant to cover for Engine Company 212 were tending to other emergencies in the blackout. No deaths occurred, thanks to Ladder Company 106, the sole company to respond to the scene, but it was a close call and not just for the four people rescued from the blaze. If history is any guide, Mayor Bloomberg's re-election hopes might not have survived a fatal fire in a neighborhood where a firehouse had been closed. That put a peculiarly personal cast on a ceremony held five days after the blackout, at City Hall, where Mayor Bloomberg presented citations to a number of agencies that helped with the crisis, including Ladder Company 106. "While the true heroes of last week's blackout were the eight million citizens of this city," Bloomberg said in his opening remarks, "I want to say a special thank-you to members of our municipal work force." You can bet he meant it.

HEADLINE: An Accidental Radical 

BYLINE:  By Peter Beinart; Peter Beinart is the editor of The New Republic.

 BODY:
 THE GREAT UNRAVELING
Losing Our Way in the New Century.
By Paul Krugman.
426 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95.
 IF you want to understand Howard Dean, read Paul Krugman. Krugman, who has compiled more than three years of columns for The New York Times (and some for Slate and Fortune) in "The Great Unraveling," is to liberal journalism what Dean is to Democratic politics. Like Dean, Krugman is a relative newcomer to his field: Dean practiced medicine for a decade before running for office; Krugman enjoyed a highly successful academic career (he's still an economics professor at Princeton) before becoming a columnist. These unusual career paths have left both men with a sense of themselves as outsiders in their current professions. In particular, both Dean and Krugman are acutely aware -- and proud -- of not living in Washington.
This self-conscious distance from their colleagues is crucial to both men's emergence as what one might call "accidental radicals." In the 1990's, neither Dean nor Krugman would have been obvious liberal-left standard bearers. Dean's fiscal conservatism angered many liberal Vermonters, and Krugman's unabashed support for free trade elicited attacks from the antiglobalization movement. But over the last year, both men have been radicalized by the presidency of George W. Bush -- more specifically, by the political and journalistic elite's docile response to the presidency of George W. Bush. Just as Dean caught fire by attacking Washington Democrats for acquiescing to upper-income tax cuts and the Iraq war, Krugman has repeatedly railed against Washington journalists -- including liberal Washington journalists -- for rationalizing and minimizing the Bush administration's extremism. "During the first two years of the Bush administration, many pundits insisted that the radical conservative bent of that administration was only a temporary maneuver," he writes in his introduction. "I was ahead of the curve in realizing that something radical was happening. As a professional economist, I was in a position to appreciate the disconnect between official claims and reality; as a media outsider I wasn't part of the Washington culture, in which it's considered bad form to suggest that leading politicians have ulterior motives that bear little resemblance to their stated goals."
Krugman is at least partly right: his economics background does give him an edge. As generalists, political reporters often lack the policy expertise to cut through a phony social security or energy proposal on deadline. And even when they do, the conventions of newspaper evenhandedness dilute their analysis. Krugman, by contrast, is blunt even compared with most opinion writers. Columnists who began as reporters (think of Krugman colleagues like Maureen Dowd, Thomas L. Friedman and Nicholas D. Kristof) often construct their columns around compelling anecdotes or scenes; conveying a mood is as important as building a case. For Krugman, like other columnists without newspaper journalism backgrounds (think of George Will, Charles Krauthammer or Michael Kinsley, whose hyperlogical, almost clinical style defines Slate, which employed Krugman for several years), argument is king. Many of Krugman's columns even contain mini thesis paragraphs near the top, followed by a systematic laying out of the evidence and ending with a forceful restatement of the central point. In the hands of a more plodding writer, such a structure could grow dull. But like Kinsley, Krugman scrupulously avoids jargon, never wastes words and pivots sharply between paragraphs to keep readers' attention. 
Krugman's best columns showcase his fluency in economics, analytical power and willingness to go out on a limb. Take the California energy crisis. Faced with such a complex and technical subject, many commentators latched onto the same vague, reasonable-sounding explanations; conservatives took it as axiomatic that the crisis in no way undermined the case for electricity deregulation. The result, as Krugman notes, was a mushy, safe consensus that California had brought the debacle upon itself through poorly implemented deregulation. Krugman, however, diverged early on, arguing -- on the basis of conversations with, and reports by, economists who study energy -- that while California may indeed have deregulated poorly, the real problem was willful gouging by large energy companies. Eventually, even the toothless Federal Energy Regulatory Commission acknowledged that the market had been manipulated.
In "The Great Unraveling," Krugman tries to harness his columns into one overarching argument about the Bush presidency. In the introduction, he calls the administration a "revolutionary power" -- a term he takes from Henry Kissinger's analysis of France under Robespierre and Napoleon -- that wants to replace the post-New Deal order with an undiluted plutocracy. But to make his case, Krugman has to do more than merely dissect the administration's policies; he has to explain its motives and culture. And here Krugman's unconventional background becomes a liability. He criticizes Washington reporters for being prisoners of their sources, and the dinner-party-going "commentariat" for succumbing to groupthink. But guest lists that cross ideological lines can help liberals understand the conservatives they write about. And many Washington conservatives genuinely don't see the Bush administration as radical: they see it as having ratified a big-spending, culturally liberal status quo. Krugman assumes a revolutionary consciousness that may not actually exist on the ground. 
Krugman's assumptions about the administration's motives are most problematic on foreign policy. He understands the Iraq war by analogy to the Bush tax cuts, as if rewarding corporate friends with military contracts via the Carlyle Group was a driving force behind the decision to depose Saddam Hussein. He wonders whether the Bush administration will "start threatening already democratic countries with military force." And he dismisses suggestions that President Bush's aggressive foreign policy was a genuine reaction to Sept. 11, writing that "we knew there were people out there who wanted to hurt us; it wasn't that much of a surprise when they finally scored a hit."
At one point, Krugman says he has "a vision -- maybe just a hope -- of a great revulsion." Among liberals, that revulsion is now on full display, powering the candidacy of Howard Dean. But most Americans do not consider the Bush administration corrupt, and Paul Krugman cannot convincingly prove it is. He should stick to what he does so well: simply proving, on issue after issue, that the Bush administration is wrong.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; 
A Good Quarter (In Spite Of It All)

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
THE third quarter is usually a quiet time for investors. That was not the case this year. 
 Mutual fund shareholders were confronted with one of the worst sell-offs in the history of the bond market and the onset of a scandal in the mutual fund industry. And evidence that the economy was gaining strength remained mixed, at best. 
 Still, optimism was the dominant sentiment in stock markets around the world, even though a late-September slide pared what had been extremely strong gains. 
"It was a good quarter," Christine Benz, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc., said. But, she added, "Up until the last week, it was shaping up to be a stupendous quarter." 
Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, is investigating trading activities at a number of fund families. But there is little evidence to suggest that this has soured attitudes about investing in mutual funds. 
The scandal did prompt Morningstar to recommend that investors pull their money out of four of the fund families that have been named in the investigation: Banc One, Janus Funds, Strong Funds and most funds offered by Bank of America. 
"There is sufficient evidence in Mr. Spitzer's complaint to suggest some major ethical breaches at those funds," said Brian Portnoy, senior fund analyst at Morningstar. "It's an extremely competitive industry, and these violations are noxious enough that you should seriously consider moving your money elsewhere." 
Even with the mini-swoon in late September, the average domestic diversified equity fund rose by 4.2 percent for the quarter, according to Morningstar data.
Reflecting the breadth of the advance, virtually every fund group had positive returns. Among diversified stock funds, only bear market funds, which "short" the market, and utility funds,moved lower. Among sector funds, only utilities lost ground. 
Gold-oriented funds, which gained 24.6 percent, were the best performers, reflecting a steady rise in gold prices. Japanese funds rose 21.6 percent, and emerging-markets funds were up 14.1 percent.
Even bond funds were relatively unscathed, despite the huge sell-off that began in mid-June and ran well into July. Bond prices rallied during the last three weeks of September, erasing much of the loss sustained earlier in the quarter. 
For the period, taxable bond funds had an average return of 0.6 percent, according to Morningstar. 
William H. Gross, who manages the world's largest bond fund, the $73 billion Pimco Total Return fund, said that even after the big sell-off in July, redemptions from his fund were minimal. 
"We might have lost $500 million in August after the bad July," Mr. Gross said. "To be frank, we were saved by the fact that the Total Return fund is dominated by small institutions and the like who have a longer time horizon than others." 
Robin Thurston, global director of research at Lipper, said, "The fact that taxable bond funds ended the quarter flat to slightly positive is a surprise, especially after what happened in July." 
Investors started to pull money out of bond funds in July, according to figures from AMG Data Services, and withdrew $7.7 billion in August, the highest level of redemptions since March 2000. Most of that money was withdrawn from government bond funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities.
Even though science and technology funds had another strong quarter -- the funds posted an average gain of more than 10 percent, according to Lipper -- fresh investments in those funds were minimal. 
Investors "went into growth and value equity funds and were more focused on small-cap and aggressive-growth funds," said Robert Adler, president of AMG. "That suggests investors are taking more risk but are broadly ranging into other sectors where they see opportunity."
STILL, investors with money in technology funds were rewarded. The sector's strong performance was somewhat surprising, because the summer quarter is usually weak for technology companies. 
"Typically, the third quarter is a seasonally slow period," said Christopher K. McHugh, who manages the $23 million Turner Technology fund, which had gains of 21.5 percent for the quarter. 
"But the last two or three years have just been awful, so there was a back-to-school demand build-up that was better than anticipated. All of the work these companies have done in cutting costs is really beginning to filter through" to the bottom line. 
Mr. McHugh said that he was not concerned that the Nasdaq composite index had risen 33.8 percent this year through Sept. 30.
"I am not worried about valuations at this point," he said, "because we have not begun to see the operating leverage at these companies." Earnings reports for the third and the fourth quarters "will ultimately funnel out the good stocks from the bad stocks," he said.
It was hard to find a gold stock that did badly in the third quarter. The stocks rode the increase in the price of gold, which rose to $386.10 an ounce. Gold prices have climbed about 15 percent for the year. 
A weaker dollar, coupled with concern that expansive monetary and fiscal policies in Washington will fuel inflation, will keep gold prices firm for some time, said Darko Kuzmanovic, portfolio manager of the $200 million Scudder Gold and Precious Metals fund, which gained 44.3 percent in the quarter. "If prices stay at these levels, we have a lot of opportunity to make money for our unit holders," he said.
As the quarter drew to a close, the decline in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen sent major market averages lower in Tokyo. But the price decline followed nearly three months of strong gains in the Japanesemarket, and barely nicked the performance of Japanese equity funds. 
From time to time over the past decade, there have been hints that Japan's moribund economy is on the verge of a recovery, so there is reason to be cautious about the positive data that have been flowing out of the country recently. Still, American investors have begun to pay attention
"We have had more questions from independent investment advisers, who recognize they have very small exposure in Japan," said Mark W. Headley, manager of the $33 million Matthews Japan fund. "The fund has had steady but small net inflows over the last six months. People are noticing, and the performance is of interest." 
Mr. Headley said it is not clear,, that Japan's economic recovery is sustainable. "We don't know the answer to that," he said, "but Japan has taken dozens of half steps in many areas that are adding up to significant change." Mr. Headley said he was pleased to see the Japanese yen gaining strength. 
"Personally, I think a strong currency is good for a stock market," he said. "It encourages people to keep their money at home, and it encourages foreigners to invest there." 
With major market indexes solidly in the black through the first three quarters, many fund managers might be happy to see the year end tomorrow. 
Nonetheless, as the fourth quarter begins, investors and the professionals who manage their money have to wonder if market leadership is about to change. 
Thomas McManus, chief investment strategist at Banc of America Securities, who has 75 percent of his model portfolio invested in stocks, said he was still positive about the market's prospects. But yesterday's stars are about to take a back seat to other stocks, Mr. McManus said. 
"I think midcap and small-cap outperformance is coming to an end," he said. "Growth expectations are no longer low, they are high, so the surprise is gone."
He added: "Between now and year-end, some of the large-cap, laggard stocks, including consumer staples, big drug companies and some large-cap laggards within the technology space like I.B.M. and Microsoft will simply catch up to the Standard & Poor's 500. If that happens, the S.& P. itself will be up 50 points."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Park Avenue Proletarians; 
Every Four Years, Blue Bloods Put on a Blue Collar

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt. 

 BODY:
IN 1908, the populist presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan had an idea: he'd expose the Republican nominee, the rotund Ohioan Robert Taft, as a rich elitist by using pictures of him playing golf. Golf! The sport of blue bloods.
 In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt was castigated by fellow upper-crusters as a traitor to his class for using federal tax revenues to aid the impoverished. 
 And as recently as 1992, Democrats mercilessly lampooned the first President Bush as an out-of-touch patrician. His crime? During a visit to a national grocers' convention in Orlando, Fla., he appeared almost giddy about the wondrous technology of supermarket scanners, apparently unaware that they had been quite familiar to American shoppers for more than a decade. 
Americans famously like to think of themselves as members of a classless society, where merit and hard work determine fate, while at the same time, they scoop up magazines with the latest gossip about Britain's royals. 
In Europe, "there's always an angry left and people responding to arguments about rich conservatives," said Robert Frank, an economist at Cornell University. "Here, there doesn't seem to be so much of a resentment towards the rich."
This time around, with a sluggish economy and a bogged-down war effort in Iraq, Democrats are hoping to find more traction on the class issue, particularly in light of the administration's tax cuts, which rivals will try to paint as a looting of the Treasury on behalf of the president's super-rich cronies. 
But the mix of backgrounds among the candidates assembling for the coming presidential race has many wondering whether class warfare can become an issue in 2004.
Howard Dean, who has led the tirades against the current President Bush, is himself the scion of an established New York family that lived on Park Avenue, summered in East Hampton and went to all the right schools. John Kerry, who also attended the right schools and had affected a Boston Brahmin demeanor, married into a vast fortune and finds himself struggling on the campaign trail to redefine himself as a man of the masses. John Edwards, on the other hand, is a multimillionaire lawyer born into the working class, whose campaign message is liberally, perhaps even bitterly, sprinkled with reminders that his father was a factory worker who didn't get all the breaks that some other candidates' families enjoyed.
"I think class issues will get some traction in this election because of the Bush administration's tax cuts," said Alan Wolfe, a political scientist at Boston College. "There really are only two classes in America now -- that top 2 percent and everybody else. If the Democrats can't make an issue out of class this time around, then they will never be able to do it."
Many believe class will never be more than background noise in a presidential election, partly because of the decline of the old ruling class, as well as a deep-seated sense among voters that most rich people probably earned what they got.
"We don't deal with class anymore in this country, because we can't deal with class," said James B. Twitchell, author of "Living It Up" and a professor of English and advertising at the University of Florida in Gainesville. "What does class mean to us now? Class is based on such things as how many generations have lived in the same place. Who cares about that now? Or the number of vowels in your name, and who cares about that?
"It really used to be based on where your pew was in the Episcopal Church, but the Episcopal Church is in a state of absolute free fall. Everything that built class has been effaced."
Certainly, the track record of invoking class in presidential elections is a dismal one.
Even armed with his cross of golf, Bryan was unable to beat Taft in 1908. Earlier, Theodore Roosevelt did not deny his patrician roots but used them to highlight his reformist credentials. The attempts to paint Franklin Roosevelt as a class traitor resulted in his winning re-election three times. And while the first President Bush's grocery-scanner faux pas was followed by his loss to President Clinton, few regard it as anything more than a link in the chain that toppled him.
In the one election where class might have played a role -- the rich Senator John F. Kennedy versus the up-from-the-middle-class Richard M. Nixon in 1960 -- it was never really evoked. Kennedy opponents preferred to highlight his Roman Catholic roots over his bank balance. And besides, to true blue bloods, there was always something unsavory and arriviste about the Kennedy fortune; to attack him for being a member of their class would be to admit that he was one.
Mr. Twitchell said he believes class will not make an appearance in the coming campaign, if only because Mr. Bush so successfully squelched the issue in 2000.
"Look at this guy," he said. "He is Andover, Yale, Harvard, Episcopal Church, and yet he recast himself as a West Texas good old boy, a sportsman. The triumph of George W. is not that he denies his class, but that he so completely and sincerely recreated his class."
That might have worked in 2000, others argue, when the president's record was a blank slate, but it may not work again.
"It was an image rebranding," Mr. Wolfe said. "Now we will see if he can survive a policy rebranding."
Whatever the case, Mr. Twitchell said, the class issue is unlikely to unseat a sitting president. "Class warfare, it's absolute nonsense," he said. "That's really all that's left of class, sort of a dim memory of haves versus have-nots."
Whether candidates come from the upper classes or the lower orders will probably matter less than where they stand on class issues.
"Arguably the most left-wing presidency was F.D.R.'s, and he was from a 17th-century Dutch-manor background," said Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University historian. "When Nelson Rockefeller was running, he tried to use the argument that he couldn't be bought because he was already so rich, and perhaps that can be successful. The 'I was born in a log cabin' thing can help, it can be an add-on, but I can't think of a single instance in American history of it making the difference."
The bottom line in American politics, he said, has always been: what are you going to do for me?
"Americans are sort of realistic," Mr. Kazin said. "They're not voting for someone because of their background, but because they think they can help them."

HEADLINE: The World: Three Wars Over Iraq; 
Staying the Course May Be the Hardest Battle

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
SOME prominent Americans said this time would come, and now it is here: the season when American staying power in Iraq is being seriously tested.
 In Congress, many Republicans are joining Democrats to challenge President Bush's decision to spend $20 billion on reconstruction without any commitment for repayment from this oil-rich land. The American military is as overextended as it has been since Vietnam, with tens of thousands of reservists facing career and family dislocations. The United Nations, with no discernible mission, is fleeing, having sacrificed some of its best and brightest diplomats in a vicious car bombing. Many humanitarian organizations are following. 
 And Iraqis -- even those who welcomed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein -- are rebelling against occupation. More Iraqis say they admire the French president, Jacques Chirac, than Mr. Bush. Go figure. 
Yet on the ground here, despite the staccato of gunfire in the night, optimism has never been stronger that Iraqis will pull through, if America can find a formula for letting them take control of their destiny as the allied armies and occupation administrators recede.
The streets of Baghdad, Basra and Mosul bustle with commerce. Restaurants are filled late into the night as the heat of summer abates along with the fear of crime. Schools, many refurbished with the help of Americans, reopened last week. New textbooks, cleansed of Saddam Hussein's image, are being printed. The curfew has been extended an hour, until midnight.
Iraqis are voting with their feet, figuring that it is time to reopen their shops because the violence here is not directed at them, but at the American military and, less, at Iraq's new police and politicians.
Still, consensus in postwar Iraq is as elusive as Mr. Hussein, who remains in hiding. And the war over Iraq policy has moved into a complex phase.
There are three wars, really: the guerrilla campaign inside Iraq, the diplomatic war between the United States and the international community over nation-building and peacekeeping, and the partisan war in Washington, where Mr. Bush's critics are challenging almost everything about the course he charted here.
The war inside Iraq is now about occupation, a word that conjures the worst memories in a region that has been a battleground for empires and still seethes over the plight of Palestinians under the Israelis. 
In Khaldiya last week, tribal elders surveying the wreckage of their cousin's home from an assault by 82nd Airborne troops railed against the foreigners in their land. Bash Abid Shehab, 74, said the resistance here that drew American fire was not about bringing back Mr. Hussein, nor was it about religion.
"We need our freedom and prosperity," he said. "The Americans should walk with us in freedom without pointing guns at us, and if they don't we will keep resisting them until we force them to leave the country."
The resistance in Iraq began growing in May, when the Bush administration decided against handing power immediately to a provisional government of untested exiles, Kurds and Shiite groups, and opted for a lengthy occupation strategy that seemed necessary to free up Iraq's assets and to get the oil flowing and United Nations sanctions lifted. 
That decision, made in the Oval Office, was announced with the arrival of L. Paul Bremer III, the occupation administrator. There was no consultation with Iraqis. Now many Iraqi political figures say that despite Mr. Bush's declared commitment to rebuild the state as a democratic model, the failure to consult them distorted Iraqi assessments of Mr. Bush's intent.
The occupation model put American troops into immediate confrontation with the minority of Iraqis invested in American failure and, more important, it antagonized a majority, who supported Mr. Hussein's overthrow. A blistering summer of power failures, water shortages and Mr. Bremer's practice of working with Iraqis only as token advisers made things worse.
In an off-the-record conversation three weeks before he died in the car bomb attack on Aug. 19, Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations envoy here, said he considered his mission one of persuading Mr. Bremer to trust the Iraqis to rule themselves during the transition to a new state. He later admonished the Iraqi political leaders to take Mr. Bremer's offer of a "governing council" despite their reservations. Once in the council, he said, they should seize all the power they could because "Bremer will not be able to stop you."
But the experiment with the 24-member governing council may be failing, its members say. Mr. Bremer returned from Washington last week and scolded council members at a meeting for having taken independent decisions. Four times, members said, Mr. Bremer reminded them that he held supreme authority. One member walked out.
Mr. Bremer's authority has done little to quell the daily attacks on American forces. Some of those responsible are Mr. Hussein's men. Some are paid to do it. Some convince themselves that Islam demands it. Most are Sunnis in the arc around Baghdad. Some may be Shiites under the influence of radical clerics. Some are infiltrators from Syria and Al Qaeda. Some are tribal people seeking revenge for a humiliation or loss of a relative. Some are just criminals.
But the sum of this resistance does not necessarily amount to a military challenge to the United States. Many Iraqis see the security problem as an issue of policing -- which Iraqis should perform. Security is undermined, they say, when M-1 tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles roar through the streets with young American soldiers isolated behind machine guns they keep pointed at the people they have liberated.
The war inside Iraq feeds the conflict between the United States and those countries that questioned whether a war to oust Mr. Hussein was really necessary.
Many Iraqis are less concerned about this debate, aside from the fact that any sign of American and British duplicity about the evidence marshaled for the war undercuts the moral position of the occupation. For many Iraqis, the discovery of mass graves, the opening of the torture chambers, the discovery that Saddam Hussein sent his son to clean out the Central Bank in March is more than enough to convince them of the moral rightness of toppling the dictator.
But the United States does not get a pass. Many Iraqis look to the United Nations and to Europeans as more detached in their judgment of how to put things right. In this view, putting the Iraqis in charge under a United Nations mandate, as the Europeans argue, makes sense. 
But for the Bush administration, any loss of control threatens not only the economic payback for the $20 billion the United States is spending on reconstruction, but also the image of American pre-eminence in reshaping the world. And this fuels the third war -- the one inside the Washington Beltway, where American anxiety about the cost of the war in Iraq plays into the hopes or fears of anyone with a stake in the debate.
For most Iraqis, though, the deed has been done. Mr. Hussein is history. They are ready to move on. If members of Congress demonstrate that Mr. Bush went to war based on intelligence that did not support the assertions about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction or support for terrorists, where does that leave the commitment for rebuilding Iraq?
The anonymous guerrillas trying to blow up American convoys and shooting American soldiers hope they can break American will and send them home, as Mr. Hussein once thought he could with the "mother of all battles." The Iraqi politicians challenging Mr. Bremer's authority, making end runs to Congress and making nice with the French are trying to gain control of the country because they think they can do a better job than the Americans.
They don't want America to leave, but they fear an erosion of American staying power under the current policy. And this is the season in which that power will be tested.

HEADLINE: The World: Pakistan's Perennial Gadfly; 
In One Man's Life, a Glimpse of Democracy's Agony

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
AS a young man, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan excitedly watched South Asia's political lions lead the fight against British colonialism. Mohandas K. Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohammed Ali Jinnah, who read literature and wrote extensively while leading mass independence movements, became his icons.
 When he was 29, his dream came true. British colonial ruled ended in South Asia. Pakistan was born as a homeland for the region's Muslims. 
 But for the next 50 years Mr. Khan would spend his life in opposition, demanding democracy in Pakistan and deploring military dictators as well as authoritarian civilian rulers. He died last week in his mid-80's, still in opposition -- leading an alliance of diverse political parties that were trying to unseat Pakistan's current military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. "It's like painting a dictatorship democracy," he said of General Musharraf in a recent interview in a Pakistani newspaper. "If a cock crows at midnight, it doesn't mean that it's morning."
In some ways, the story of Mr. Khan's long, sad struggle illuminates Pakistan's failure as a democratic state. Military dictators have ruled Pakistan for most of its history. No civilian government has completed its full term in office, thanks to repeated coups and rapacious political infighting. Today, Pakistan's neighbors to the east and west, India and Afghanistan, accuse it of breeding and exporting a virulent and violent form of Islamic militancy. And its 130 million people remain among the most poverty-stricken in the world.
In the midst of it all, Mr. Khan stood as an unrepentant political gadfly. He had a rare ability to forge coalitions among Pakistan's polarized political class. He accused the United States of helping to create Pakistan's problems by repeatedly backing military dictators, including General Musharraf. His supporters eulogized him last week as a rare phenomenon -- a member of the country's feudal elite who did not compromise his principles for power.
"The mere fact that he kept chipping away and did not lose heart, did not give up, was also this exemplary kind of conduct," said Aitzaz Ahsan, a veteran politician in the Pakistan People's Party. 
Mr. Khan, according to his admirers, representedwhat a Pakistani civilian leader should be. Of a political class accused of corruption, opportunism and jockeying for privilege, he lived most of his life in a two-room apartment in Lahore that served as his office and home. In the 1980's, Gen. Zia ul-Haq, Pakistan's military dictator at the time, confined him to house arrest there for five years. The general is said to have sent numerous emissaries to buy him off. Mr. Khan did not waver.
Steeped in South Asian culture, tradition and thought, he wrote Urdu poetry and backed the creation of a secular Western-style democracy with indigenous touches, including respect for a moderate version of Islamic law. During the few times he held senior posts in government, his performance was disappointing, Pakistani commentators wrote last week. He seemed to thrive, instead, in the role of rebel.
A red fez seemed permanently in place on his balding pate. He ceaselessly puffed on a hookah, or water pipe, while conversing for hours about politics and current affairs. Frail, skeletal and constantly seeming to be out of breath, he appeared in his later years to be living on by sheer force of will.
Mr. Khan's first disappointment with Pakistani politics came a decade after independence. In 1958, after a series of weak civilian governments brought Pakistan close to economic collapse, the army's commander, Gen. Mohammad Ayub Khan, seized power in a coup. Mr. Khan demanded the restoration of civilian rule and formed the first of many opposition alliances, the Democratic Action Committee.
Soon after, civilian rule arrived in 1970, Mr. Khan was again in opposition. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was elected prime minister but began ruling with an iron hand. In what local politicians called the only blemish on Mr. Khan's democratic credentials, he denounced Mr. Bhutto as a dictator and backed General Zia's seizure of power. The general later hanged Mr. Bhutto.
Mr. Khan eventually turned on General Zia. In 1988, civilian rule returned and Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of the executed prime minister, became prime minister. Mr. Khan and many other Pakistanis criticized Ms. Bhutto's government for corruption and mismanagement. He then opposed the government of Ms. Bhutto's bitter rival, Nawaz Sharif, an industrialist who was accused of graft and incompetence. In a 1991 coup, General Musharraf drove Mr. Sharif from power.
Last week, Mr. Khan's closest friends insisted that in a way, he had been making headway in his long struggle for democracy. Its pace seems glacial, they say, but Pakistan is changing.
"We have moved forward a great deal since the 1960's," said Shafqat Mehmood, a former senator. "Now it's not possible for a military ruler to completely dominate the country the way they did then."
Mr. Mehmood called General Musharraf's rule a "very strange kind of democratic martial law." Pakistanis have a form of press freedom, he said, and a year ago they elected a Parliament with limited power.
Meanwhile, the army, with the backing of the United States, continues to dominate the country. An alliance of religious parties that won record support in last year's elections has emerged as the most powerful opposition force, with the country's two secular, mainstream parties dispirited and disorganized.
Mr. Khan's admirers said he represented a breed of South Asian politician that is vanishing. 
"Power and privilege did not turn him on," Mr. Mehmood said. "What did turn him on was fighting for a cause. That is very different from why most people get involved in politics in my country."

HEADLINE: Where Are All the New Drugs? 

BYLINE:  By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
AT its birth in 2000, the executives who created GlaxoSmithKline crowed that the company would unleash a cabinetful of new medicines. "We will be the kings of science and innovation," Dr. Jean-Pierre Garnier, the chief executive, said at the time. 
 Three years later, GlaxoSmithKline is still a long way from its coronation. 
 The company has introduced just three new medicines, only one of which it discovered. Indeed, nine top scientists who recently left Glaxo said they believe its laboratories' productivity was getting worse, not better. "It's a disaster," said one of them, Dr. Peter G. Traber, who was the company's chief of clinical development until February. 
What went wrong? According to Dr. Traber and others, the very thing that was supposed to bolster the labs' output -- the merger -- has instead hampered it. 
If they are correct, GlaxoSmithKline's problems could have implications for the entire industry. Poor lab productivity is bedeviling almost every drug company. Across the industry, introductions of new drugs plummeted last year to 17 from a high of 53 in 1996, despite a near doubling in annual research spending, to $32 billion.
To survive the long drought at the lab, many executives have concluded that one company is better than two. The $400 billion worldwide pharmaceutical industry has rapidly consolidated; 38 major drug companies have merged since 1994. And at nearly every major merger announcement, executives said that lab synergies were a driving force behind the deals.
But many scientists say that if mergers are executives' cure for poor pipelines, the medicine is making the patient sicker. And they point to Glaxo, the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company, after Pfizer, as proof. 
"The effect of mergers on research productivity is an issue that this industry has yet to deal with," said Dr. Traber, who left Glaxo to run the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, one of the nation's top centers of biomedical research. "You save a bit of money, but it's disaster to the labs."
Dr. Garnier dismissed the comments of former employees and said the company's pipeline was just fine. "You can cry over spilled milk, but we are excited about the transformation," he said from his office in Philadelphia. "Transformations are disruptive and sometimes resisted by people who don't like change."
Dr. Tadataka Yamada, Glaxo's research chief, said the former scientists who blame the merger for productivity woes are wrong. "Yes, a merger is a disruption, but a disruptive period is a time to make big changes that shape the company to take on challenges we couldn't take on before," he said. 
The company says it plans to hold a meeting for analysts on Dec. 3 to describe in detail all the new drugs it hopes to roll out, including an AIDS drug and a medicine for incontinence, both of which are under review by the Food and Drug Administration. "If I can deliver this pipeline, the creation of value will be enormous," Dr. Garnier said. Convincing investors that the future is bright is crucial for Glaxo because the next several years don't look so good. Generics are threatening the company's biggest sellers, including the anti-depressant Paxil. The company's historical lead in AIDS drugs is slipping. And while its newest drug, Levitra for erectile dysfunction, is doing well, the company has few other potential big sellers ready for introduction in the next two years.
To increase its $27 billion in annual drug revenue, analysts said, Glaxo will have to do better than just one novel drug a year, its pace so far. In a speech last year, Jan Leschly, the former chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, said that Glaxo needs five new drugs each year to grow adequately. "They are far from being there," he said. He did not return telephone messages last week.
Mergers are hardly the only reason Glaxo and its competitors have produced so few new medicines. The science of drug development has become tougher. New technologies like robotic screening machines that rapidly test millions of chemical compounds against biological targets have not worked as well as industry executives hoped. And the avalanche of genetic information created over the last several years has led to more confusion than clarity. 
But studies of drug industry mergers have found that the combined companies generally lose market share and shareholder value. One reason is that merged drug companies have pipelines that are significantly smaller than those of their predecessor companies, according to a study by CenterWatch, a company that tracks clinical trials. The study blamed the disruption the deals cause in the labs. 
"Mergers may be harming the industry's long-term ability to innovate," said Ken Getz, the chief executive of CenterWatch. Sir Tom McKillop, chief executive of AstraZeneca P.L.C., said in an interview Friday that distraction among scientists is "a huge problem" during mergers. "I was terrified of all the internal focus during the merger," Sir Tom said. Astra A.B. merged with Zeneca P.L.C. in 1999.
Mention mergers to scientists in the industry, and they're prone to rant about their corrosive effects. The worst, they say, are "mergers of equals," like GlaxoSmithKline's, which can lead to months, and even years, of uncertainty and indecision. All of GlaxoSmithKline's previous mergers only added to the mess, according to its former scientists. 
The SmithKline Beckman Corporation combined with Beecham Group P.L.C. in 1989; Glaxo P.L.C. joined with Wellcome P.L.C. in 1995; and Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C. and SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. announced their marriage in 2000 to become GlaxoSmithKline. The company is based in Britain, although it has significant operations in the United States, including corporate offices in Philadelphia and research operations in Research Triangle Park, N.C., and King of Prussia, Pa.

When Two Become One
A joke e-mail message making the rounds in the drug industry starts by saying, "You know you work in the pharmaceutical industry when: you've sat at the same desk for four years and worked for three different companies; your company welcome sign is attached with Velcro ." 
The joke elicits rueful laughter from former GlaxoSmithKline scientists. Many of them say they went through wrenching changes to remake the company's myriad standard operating procedures in 1995 only to see those procedures tossed out in 2001 simply because executives couldn't be seen to favor one company over another. Months were spent remaking procedures.
"I was in meetings thinking, 'My life is futile,"' one former researcher said. "Moving piles of dirt from here to there will make you crazy."
The bureaucratic task of combining the two companies became the sole chore for many top scientists, some of whom had to shuttle between continents, they said. That took a toll on research projects. "You simply can't do it all," said another former researcher, who did not want his name used because he continues to work in the industry.
Former company researchers say these are some of the results: Development of a cardiac arrhythmia drug was delayed for nine months, two gastrointestinal drug projects were sidetracked for 18 months, and work on a cancer drug was shelved for nearly two years, former company researchers say. In another case, they say, an allergy medicine project was stopped, started and stopped again while newly formed committees examined the science behind each project.
Dr. Yamada said, "We make scores of pipeline decisions in the course of a year." The old ways of discovering drugs simply weren't working, he said in an interview. "I had been head of R.&D. at SmithKline for 10 months, and it was enough time to know that fundamental change was needed." 
He said he wanted the labs to take the best from both the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. To him, drug discovery's first and last steps -- sifting through genomes and screening millions of chemicals at first, and finally testing drugs in large populations -- are more efficient in large pharmaceutical companies. Small organizations are better at tinkering with promising chemicals to make them into medicines, he said. 
So Dr. Yamada created a research operation in which the first and last stages of the process are done by large unified groups while the middle stages are split among six separate and competing organizations called Centers of Excellence for Drug Discovery, or CEDD's. "We created this notion of being both big and small at the same time," Dr. Yamada said.
Dr. Traber came on board in September 2000, nine months after the GlaxoSmithKline merger was announced and during discussions about how the company would combine its two huge research operations. The merger was consummated at the end of the year.
"What ensued was an incredible number of arguments about who was doing what," Dr. Traber said, echoing comments made by other former researchers. 

Who Makes the Call?
Dr. Traber led the company's clinical pharmacology and experimental medicine group. But the CEDD chiefs wanted to run their own clinical programs, at least for early trials. Arguments over who did what raged for months, he said.
"And I'll tell you what wasn't happening: Research projects weren't being pushed forward," Dr. Traber said.
As a result of the merger, the company had two clinical research groups -- one of which was called global medical affairs, and the other, clinical development product strategy. In March 2001, Dr. Traber was asked to lead global medical affairs after its chief left. For the rest of the year, he wrestled with his counterpart over who had control over the company's clinical trials. "Instead of making a decision right away, they let it decline to the point where no one could get anything done," Dr. Traber said. 
Dr. Yamada responded that global medical affairs was always the company's sole clinical group, but several former researchers confirmed Dr. Traber's version of events.
In December 2001, the company combined the two clinical organizations into a single department, Dr. Traber said. Executives throughout the clinical program were told to reapply for their jobs. So, for the second time in a year, their jobs were in jeopardy, Dr. Traber said.
"We had two vice presidents, and sometimes three, for every clinical area," he said. "Imagine the turmoil."
Once the vetting process was over, the new clinical group had to decide how it would operate, Dr. Traber said. Teams of physicians are needed to plan and execute tests in humans, but members of each team had different ideas about their responsibilities. "We had changed the organization to such an extent that no one knew what they did," Dr. Traber said. The new rules for the clinical group were announced in November 2002, he said.
"That means that nearly three years passed between the merger announcement and the time when anyone knows what they're actually doing," Dr. Traber said. "It's only this year that serious prioritization work has begun," he said.
Roughly two-thirds of research dollars are spent in the clinic, so turmoil there can be devastating to a company's research operations. 
David Webster, president of the Webster Consulting Group, which specializes in the drug industry, said that his research confirms Dr. Traber's conclusions. Mr. Webster noted that many of GlaxoSmithKline's top scientists left voluntarily shortly after the merger. A major reorganization in the midst of a merger. Mr. Webster said, increased the uncertainties for all and made even basic decisions difficult. "The outcome of all of this was a 'Lord of the Flies' kind of chaos," he said.
The chaos, Dr. Traber said, left GlaxoSmithKline's pipeline nearly bare when he departed in February. Paging through a 2002 analyst's report listing all of GlaxoSmithKline's promising projects of the time, Dr. Traber said that of the company's 18 projects that were in the Phase 2 of clinical development, 14 had been canceled by the time he left -- a 78 percent failure rate. There have been significant delays with most of the remaining four, he said. 
A recent study by Joseph A. DiMasi, director of economic analysis for the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston, found that, on average, Phase 2 studies have a 56 percent chance of failing.
Dr. Yamada says the company's pipeline is coming along nicely. "The notion that the merger created a sickly, dysfunctional organization is just the opposite of what happened," he said.

The Jury Is Still Out
A few former GlaxoSmithKline scientists said the jury was still out on whether the merger would ultimately improve the company's research. Two said some project teams worked well during the merger despite the distractions. George Poste, the retired chief scientific officer of SmithKline Beecham, said the merger was needed because "scale is very important in this industry."
But 11 other former GlaxoSmithKline scientists said that the merger was mishandled. The restructuring, they said, was overly ambitious and poorly executed. Nearly all did not want their names used because they had signed confidentiality agreements and continued to work in the industry. "You had to have one person from one side and another person from another with little regard as to whether the organization would run," one former researcher said.
Another scientist agreed: "They wanted real consensus, unity and oneness, so we had to get input from every part of both companies and all over the world. It took forever." After Sept. 11, 2001, many executives became reluctant to travel by plane, which further slowed the integration. This scientist continued, "The hallway chat was: 'Why don't they just tell us what to do? Somebody make a decision."'
As for the restructuring, Dr. Traber said, "there was so much arguing about structure and turf that what got lost was getting anything done." 
Dr. Peter B. Corr, the research chief at Pfizer, acknowledged in an interview that Pfizer's acquisition in 2000 of Warner-Lambert suffered a bit from indecision as well. "The biggest problem is that people don't make a decision," Dr. Corr said. "I think we spent too much time trying to get it perfect." Pfizer's merger this year with Pharmacia is not suffering from such indecision, Dr. Corr said.
Philip Ma, a principal at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, said mergers of equals in the drug industry were often destructive to lab productivity. "Mergers of equals sound great in concept, but in reality at every department, at every function and at every subfunction, there are arguments about what to do," Mr. Ma said. "When everything's up for grabs, it's not good. Taking the best of both in a feel-good process is not the way to go."
In the past two years, Dr. Yamada said, Glaxo has introduced several modified versions of older drugs, including Wellbutrin XL and Paxil CR for depression and Augmentin XR, an antibiotic. All were created to deal with looming losses to generic competitors. "This reflects work done in the first two years of the merger," Dr. Yamada said. "It could not have been done if we had dropped the ball."
It remains unclear whether the company can run with the ball in creating the kinds of new drugs that will make the merger worthwhile.

HEADLINE: Bison Burgers, for Humanity'sSake 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, Ted Turner's effort to restore the country's bison herds was such a success that it created a problem: a glut of bison meat. So Mr. Turner has started a restaurant chain, Ted's Montana Grill, where he is turning bison into burgers and, in the process, hoping to build what he calls "another great fortune." 
 With little fanfare, Mr. Turner opened the first of the restaurants in 2002 and now has 11 of them in the South and West, five in this city alone. But as everyone knows, Mr. Turner thinks big. So it should come as no surprise that he has ambitious plans for what started as a simple experiment to see if he could create an appetite for bison. 
 "I can see a day when this company has 500 restaurants and a billion-dollar market cap," he said over lunch at the grill that he recently opened in the lobby of his Atlanta office building. "Isn't it great?" he half-asked, half-stated, of the spanking new addition, which was fairly bustling on a recent weekday. 
Wearing a dark suit and a tie adorned with -- what else? -- bison images, Mr. Turner, 64, was promoting the concept with the same touch of hucksterism that he once used to convert skeptics who did not see the potential of CNN, the 24-hour news network he founded. 
Whether restaurants that serve bison burgers will ever be as successful as CNN is not clear. But for Mr. Turner, a new fortune would come in handy. He has lost billions by stubbornly holding his AOL Time Warner stock, the bulk of which he received when he sold Turner Broadcasting to Time Warner in 1996 and endorsed Time Warner's merger with America Online four years later. 
At its height, his stake in the media giant was worth nearly $9 billion. But then the stock market plummeted, sending AOL Time Warner's shares tumbling. Next came several controversies, including questions raised over whether the company's earnings might have benefited from questionable accounting. Since the AOL Time Warner merger was announced in January 2000, the stock has fallen 78.8 percent. 
Exasperated with AOL Time Warner's management and infuriated that it had ignored him, Mr. Turner resigned as vice chairman early this year, although he remains on the board of the company, which is changing its name to just Time Warner. He also plans to make his presence known by opening a Ted's Montana Grill two blocks from the new corporate headquarters on Columbus Circle in Manhattan. 
The stock's decline has been especially hard for Mr. Turner because of his enormous philanthropic commitments. He is now worth about $2.3 billion. His remaining 40 million shares of Time Warner are valued at $600 million, and he has roughly $700 million in land and bison. An additional $800 million is in bonds and other liquid investments. But that includes roughly $550 million he has promised the United Nations as part of his groundbreaking $1 billion pledge in 1997. "That's not my money," he said in an interview.
While several philanthropists have given away a total of $1 billion or more, Mr. Turner and Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and benefactor of the world's largest foundation, are the only two people known to have pledged single grants that big. Mr. Gates's fortune has held up pretty well since the economy and the stock market went on the defensive three years ago, but Mr. Turner and legions of other philanthropists have seen their fortunes shrivel.
Anecdotal reports from charities and fund-raisers suggest that deadlines for many big pledges have been extended and some donations canceled as a result. But Mr. Turner is determined to fulfill his pledge to the United Nations. So long as Time Warner stock continues to trade around its current value -- $15.39 -- he will be able to fulfill his promise. If the stock were to plunge, Mr. Turner would still give away the same number of shares he initially promised, though the total gift would be worth less than $1 billion. 
But Taylor Glover, Mr. Turner's chief financial adviser, said he was constantly evaluating strategies to ensure that Mr. Turner meets his goal. "You either give money or you don't," Mr. Glover said Mr. Turner once told him. "You don't give it and try and take it back." 
TODAY, Mr. Turner is clearly sobered by the saga of his fortunes. "I was just getting cranking," he said of his grand philanthropic gestures, though he is also realistic. "I don't want to be broke in my old age." 
That's hardly likely. In fact, his Time Warner stock has rebounded from its lows, the value of his 1.8 million acres of ranch land is rising and the price of bison has improved slightly. 
But even billionaires can benefit from fiscal discipline. Mr. Glover is working on a program that will make Mr. Turner's 14 ranches self-sustaining and even profitable. The 600,000-acre Vermejo Park Ranch in New Mexico and Colorado, for example, now generates about $6.5 million a year from hunting and fishing fees, more than covering its costs.
Mr. Turner has also gotten a break from the board of the United Nations Foundation, the vehicle that funnels his money to various United Nations projects. It stretched his payments out five years beyond the original 10-year timetable. 
If the world is still amazed at the size of that gift, Mr. Turner says he does not understand why. To him, it was a logical progression for a philanthropist. In the early days, "like everybody else I gave away the 5 percent of the foundation's value that the law required," Mr. Turner said. "Then I realized you can give away everything if you want to." 
Why the United Nations? Mr. Turner said he had been fascinated by it since childhood. "I remember watching Nikita Khrushchev bang his shoe on the podium at the U.N. and thinking it was a place to blow off steam," he said, referring to an incident in the 1950's when a speech by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan of Britain sent Khrushchev into a rage. "I figure when they are screaming and hollering at each other, they are not throwing bombs." 
"I like gallantry, and the U.N. was an idealistic thing," Mr. Turner said. "I was inspired by things like the Round Table and King Arthur. " But even Mr. Turner's advisers were stunned by the plan he formulated roughly 48 hours before he wasto receive an award from the United Nations Association of the United States of America. 
"I was worried, I had nothing to say and I was getting this big award in front of all these people," Mr. Turner recalled. "So I was thinking what could I talk about when I started to think, well, I'll buy the U.S. debt to the U.N., at a discount, maybe, like a repo man."
AT the time, Congress had withheld roughly $1 billion in dues that the United States owed to the United Nations. "Imagine, the U.N.'s biggest member was a deadbeat," Mr. Turner said. "If you go to a country club, your name is posted if you don't pay." 
Mr. Turner learned quickly that an individual cannot simply give money to the United Nations, so his advisers created the United Nations Foundation as the conduit for his money. The United Nations Fund for International Partnerships serves as a liaison office between the United Nations and the foundation, suggesting projects for it to finance. 
Although his overall pledge generated big headlines, the grants that his foundation makes are generally for small, innovative programs that would not otherwise receive financial support from the United States. One of his projects is the Equator Initiative, a package of programs aimed at reducing poverty and preserving the vast biological and ecological wealth in the countries around the Equator. Local nonprofit organizations and communities submit their programs for consideration, and the United Nations Foundation, with the United Nations, selects the best. Last year, seven prizes of $30,000 each were awarded and additional grants were made later to help spread word of practical solutions, build business and financial expertise among local small businesses and create an educational campaign. 
Mr. Turner said he now spends about 50 percent of his "thinking time" on philanthropy. But as much as he loves the spotlight, he runs his foundation the way he always ran his businesses: he is hands off on day-to-day issues. He describes his role as "a banana, just one of the bunch." 
But $1 billion makes for a big banana, and he periodically exercises his power. For instance, the United Nations Development Program submitted a proposal that the foundation help underwrite a project to prod the Angolan government to spend more of its oil income on social welfare. ChevronTexaco, the oil giant, would have been a partner in the project. 
The foundation's staff and the United Nations advisory board that vets proposals liked the idea, but Mr. Turner opposed it. During a dinner with the foundation's executive committee, Mark Malloch Brown, the administrator of the United Nations Development Fund, presented the plan. "To the audience of one, it bombed completely," Mr. Malloch Brown said. "The snag in the carpet was that we forgot that Ted hates oil companies because of his absolute environment commitments." 
How does the United Nations feel about Mr. Turner today? Mr. Malloch Brown recalled a lunch to honor Mr. Turner on the fifth anniversary of his gift. "The room was mesmerized," he said. "Ted is outspoken, vulgar, strategic and big. They are tactical, small and buttoned down. The community is mesmerized and seduced by him. Of course, they think individual ideas are a bit wacky. But he is a wild force of nature at a polite tea party." 
Mr. Turner is also proud of the leverage that his gift has had in opening other coffers to the United Nations. 
"The greatest thing about the Turner gift was that it built a network for us," said Amir A. Dossal, executive director of the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships. "Many of the organizations like Gates and the World Bank that came to us through the United Nations Foundation now also become our partners independently." 
Whether Mr. Turner can live up to his commitments to two other foundations is far less certain. In 2001, he pledged shares worth $250 million to his Nuclear Threat Initiative, aimed at deterring nuclear proliferation. But by the time the organization needed his money, AOL Time Warner stock had started its tailspin.
Mr. Turner has never handed the shares he has pledged to underwrite his philanthropy to the beneficiaries, preferring to preserve the potential upside to finance future charitable endeavors. 
But this year, he gave the Nuclear Threat Initiative the rest of the shares he had promised so it could sell them, preventing further losses and locking in $70 million. His family foundation, which is dedicated to conservation and environmental causes, suffered a similar fate.
The Nuclear Threat Initiative then became a public charity, letting it accept donations from others. Warren E. Buffett, who has long said his big philanthropic gestures will begin only after he dies, celebrated the occasion with gifts totaling $15 million. 
"You have to get oil out of the ground a little bit at a time," Mr. Turner deadpanned about Mr. Buffett's philanthropic track record. 
The United Nations Foundation was set up as a public charity from the beginning and has raised $175 million from other donors, adding to the $449 million of Mr. Turner's money it has spent. 
But Mr. Turner says the world is in imminent crisis and wants to save it; the Turner Foundation hands out "Save the Humans" bumper stickers. So he is working to build another fortune with his restaurant chain. 
The grills are decorated with reproductions of Western paintings and photographs that hang in his ranch house, and the cuisine is derived from recipes handed over by his ranch cook.
As he does with CNN, he likes to think that the quality of his product is superior. "These fries are hand cut every morning," he said, urging visitors to try a few.
In keeping with his desire to protect the environment, napkins are fabric dish towels, not paper. But the straws are paper. "Do you know how hard it is to recycle a plastic straw?" he asked. 
He has poured about $30 million into the chain, and he makes a personal appearance at each restaurant opening, greeting customers at the door with a hearty handshake and a "Hi, I'm Ted," much as he used to glad hand at cable conventions. 
Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant, said, "The restaurants have a better-than-average chance because showmanship is critical to the restaurant business, and Ted's got it." Still, Mr. Wolf added, "bison is a bit too exotic and not ingrained enough in the culture to make it evident it could be a mainstream chain."
But Mr. Turner, ever the optimist, is certain the restaurants will work. And they fill a void that was left as his role in the cable business diminished. For years, he would show up at cable conventions and remind executives, "I was cable when cable wasn't cool." 
Now he is on stage again, albeit a smaller one. "Got to play to a new audience, you know," he said.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Party Time; 
California's New Trend: Big-Tent Republicans

BYLINE:  By JOHN MICKLETHWAIT and ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE; John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, who write for The Economist and who covered California for the magazine, are writing a book about American conservatism, to be published next year.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
IN the latest "Terminator" movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a robot who returns from the future to save a grand old civilization from chaos. In Tuesday's California recall election Mr. Schwarzenegger stands a chance of transforming a grand old political party, not just in California but possibly on the national stage as well. That prospect exhilarates national Republican leaders, even as some acknowledge that it carries risks as well.
 The election goes beyond the prospect of salvaging Republican pride in Ronald Reagan's backyard. For many Republicans, a Schwarzenegger victory also carries an even more tantalizing promise with it: "rebuckling" the Republican Sun Belt, so that a revitalized libertarian Western wing balances the party's currently dominant moralistic Southern wing. 
 A Schwarzenegger victory would be "a political earthquake that will redefine what it means to be a Republican," said Frank Luntz, a political consultant who has advised Republicans from Newt Gingrich to Rudolph Giuliani. "People who have written the party off for being too strident on social issues will have a reason to re-examine their opinion." 
In this view, a Schwarzenegger victory would send a strong message that the Republican Party is a tent big enough to include a pro-abortion, pro-gay rights Hollywood superstar who has acknowledged manhandling women and smoking marijuana. As Vin Weber, a former member of Congress and occasional adviser to the Bush administration, puts it, "many people will think, 'If the Republican Party is good enough for Arnold Schwarzenegger, it is good enough for me.' "'
But first, a majorityof Californians have to vote to recall Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday, and Mr. Schwarzenegger has to win the most votes among the candidates to replace Mr. Davis. It is unclear what last-minute effect new accusations of sexual misconduct -- "behaving badly sometimes" toward women, was how the action star put it -- would have on voters' views. But polls last week, taken before the encounters were detailed in The Los Angeles Times on Thursday, showed a majority still in favor of the recall and Mr. Schwarzenegger outpacing other candidates. 
If Mr. Schwarzenegger wins, his populist insurgency will mark a twist in the strange tale of California Republicanism. In the 1960's California was the cradle of Western conservatism, which emphasized individual freedom and demonized government intervention. That was in stark contrast to the Republicanism of East Coast patricians like Nelson A. Rockefeller and post-ideological managers like Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
Orange County was a breeding ground for right-wing groups. The John Birch Society was founded in Massachusetts but flourished most luxuriantly in Southern California. The Australian-born Dr. Fred Schwarz established a school of anti-Communism that attracted thousands of local students (many excused from regular classes by their school boards). Freedom Forum shops sold books with titles like "You Can Trust the Communists (to Be Communists)." 
The new creed soon found its hero in Barry M. Goldwater, who may have hailed from Arizona, but whose message of individualism found fervent supporters in the sprawl of Los Angeles and Orange County. Though President Lyndon B. Johnson easily carried California in 1964, many of the state's suburbanites responded rapturously when Goldwater proclaimed that the country would be "better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea." The Reagan Revolution was born. 
Although Ronald Reagan was a more complicated figure than Republican mythology holds, he persuaded the faithful he was the real thing: a Western conservative (and frequent speaker at Schwarz's anti-Communism school) who had no doubts that government and taxes were the enemy. 
By the mid-1970's California Republicanism had blossomed into a broader movement. In 1978, it produced the anti-tax Proposition 13 -- a fervent revolution against the political establishment. It had gained an intellectual edge, with Hoover Institution analysts swapping ideas with Thatcherites in London. Meanwhile, the party consolidated its grip, holding the governorship from 1982 to 1998, first with George Deukmejian and then Pete Wilson.
The state's Republicans began to lose their edge when they were caught up in the Dixification of their party. They adopted race and religion issues in a state where neither had played much of a role in politics. In 1994, Governor Wilson, facing a re-election battle, endorsed Proposition 187, which called for withdrawing benefits from illegal immigrants. He won, but alienated the state's fastest-growing minority. Mr. Reagan used to win close to half the Latino vote; in 1998, the Republican candidate for governor, Dan Lungren, drew only 17 percent. 
Meanwhile, the Christian right strengthened its grip on the party. Mr. Reagan was an easygoing divorced actor who, as governor, signed the country's most liberal abortion law. (His subsequent alliance with the Christian right was the price he paid for the support of his party's Southern wing for his presidential run.) Both Governors Deukmejian and Wilson were pro-choice (as was Goldwater). Since then the party has nominated anti-abortion gubernatorial candidates.
The 2002 state Republican convention in Anaheim reflected the change. Elderly white faces packed the rostrum. The only sign of demographic diversity was a James Brown song, played when Bill Simon Jr. somewhat awkwardly entered the hall. 
Today California is arguably the most Democratic state, with the party controlling both houses of the Legislature and every statewide office. 
Even now that providence has delivered them the recall, some Republicans are uneasy about Mr. Schwarzenegger. Despite his party's pleas to step aside, Tom McClintock, a conservative state senator, remained in the race as of Friday, siphoning votes from Mr. Schwarzenegger.
As for the problems that await a Governor Schwarzenegger, these are so great that a Republican governor in another state privately worried, "This might be a better race for us to lose." If Mr. Schwarzenegger raises taxes to resolve a budget crisis, it will infuriate a right wing that already loathes his social views. But he can't cut services without alienating many ordinary voters. 
Yet it would be foolish to underestimate the potential national implications of a Republican victory in a state with 54 electoral votes. In the 2002 governor's race, Karl Rove, George Bush's political adviser, urged Republicans to nominate Richard J. Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles, whose liberal social views were in line with suburban California's. The recall has provided Mr. Rove with a socially liberal candidate with infinitely more star power. 
Next year's Republican National Convention in New York would surely give a hero's reception to the slayer of Gray Davis. And it would be a huge blow to the Democrats' morale, at a time when their fortunes seem on the upswing, forcing them to devote more resources to defending a state they would like to take for granted.
"If the Republicans drop their uptight social agenda," predicted Edward H. Crane, head of the Cato Institute, "they will flourish in California." No wonder Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, is pushing a constitutional amendment to allow foreign-born citizens to run for president.

HEADLINE: To Find Party, General Marched to His Own Drummer 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 

 BODY:
It is like a code among die-hard Democrats, and Gen. Wesley K. Clark wanted to show that he understood it.
 To a crowd of party loyalists, he declared that he voted for Al Gore in 2000, "and I'm proud that his campaign was a winning campaign." He added later, "George W. Bush will need brothers in 49 other states to take this election." 
 With that nod to the "we was robbed" mentality of loyalists still smarting over the disputed 2000 election, General Clark -- who declared his allegiance to the Democratic Party just one month ago -- sought to bond on Friday with Democrats at a meeting here of the Democratic National Committee. But his record suggests he may have a hard time convincing some in his newly adopted party that he is one of them.
He voted for Republicans Richard M. Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1984. General Clark's wife, Gertrude, worked for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, for more than a year, starting in 1994. At a Republican dinner in Little Rock, Ark., the general himself raised money for and lauded the Bush administration in May 2001 before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. And as recently as January, he gave the impression to two Republicans at a meeting in Switzerland that he would have joined their party had he not felt snubbed by the Bush White House after the attacks.
Both Republicans and Democrats who have talked with General Clark said they perceived him essentially as a centrist who felt forced by the political process to declare himself a member of the Democratic Party because he wanted to run for president -- and that was the only party that did not have a nominee.
His opponents call it opportunism.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut has said that the general's joining the Democratic Party was a matter of "political convenience, not conviction."
But General Clark said that when he was in uniform, he could not have declared a party affiliation because he needed to serve the commander in chief, whatever the party.
When he announced his allegiance to the Democrats, he implied that he had a natural affinity with them.
"I like the message the party has, I like what it stands for," he said. "To start, it's a party that stands for internationalism, it's a party that stands for ordinary men and women, it's a party that stands for fair play and equity and justice and common sense and reasonable dialogue."
General Clark's father, who died when Wesley was 3, was steeped in Democratic ward politics in Chicago and ran for alderman in 1927. General Clark said in a recent interview that his mother told him that Richard J. Daley, who rose to become the legendary mayor of Chicago, once worked in his father's office.
Yet, more than two weeks after General Clark announced he was running for president as a Democrat, he still has not changed his party registration. He remains registered as an independent in Pulaski County, Ark. Campaign aides said he has been too busy to tend to the paperwork but will do so pronto.
Still, the body of evidence before his Sept. 3 declaration suggests that he might just as easily have announced that he was a Republican.
Two prominent Republicans, Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado and Marc Holtzman, president of the University of Denver, recalled in interviews this week an unusual encounter with General Clark at the economic conference in Davos, Switzerland, in January. They struck up a conversation with General Clark, who was sitting nearby but whom neither of them had met. They said that he started talking about his relationship with the Bush administration and quoted him as saying: "I would have been a Republican if Karl Rove had returned my phone calls."
General Clark, asked in a telephone interview about the conversation, did not deny it but said of his remark, "That was a joke!"
Neither Mr. Owens nor Mr. Holtzman saw it that way. "He said it very directly, he didn't say it as a joke," Mr. Owens said. "And he repeated it. He wasn't joking."
Mr. Holtzman recalled: "This wasn't a joke. The governor said to him, 'With all due respect, there are many reasons to become a Democrat or a Republican, but not having your phone call returned is not one of them.' And we also said to him that someone of his stature, with his relationships, ought to have other ways of communicating his interest if he thought he was being ignored. He just shrugged his shoulders."
It is not clear that General Clark ever called Mr. Rove, who is President Bush's senior political adviser. After the incident was first reported in Newsweek, The Daily Standard, the online version of the conservative Weekly Standard, asked Mr. Rove to check his telephone logs at the White House. The Daily Standard reported that there had been no calls from General Clark.
One possibility is that rather than actually call Mr. Rove, General Clark had simply expected to be called upon for his military expertise in helping to shape the war against Iraq. As Mr. Holtzman said, "He was very positive with where the president was going with Iraq," although he is an archcritic now.
Whether General Clark's Republican-tinged past will matter to Democratic voters is unclear. Some of those at the Democratic meeting on Friday said they were open to him.
But, as Bob Ream, chairman of the Democratic Party in Montana, said, "he has to make it clear that he's standing up for Democratic values."
The depth of his commitment on some of those values is not yet clear. For example, when he was asked in an interview if his support for abortion rights extended to using taxpayer money for abortions for poor women, he hesitated and said he had not thought the matter through.
One Democratic lobbyist said that General Clark's primary interest was international affairs and "I don't think he's really thought about" domestic issues. The lobbyist said: "I think he'd go along with what the prevailing Democratic views are. Right now, he's on a steep learning curve."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: RECONSTRUCTION; 
Report Offered Bleak Outlook About Iraq Oil

BYLINE:  By JEFF GERTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's optimistic statements earlier this year that Iraq's oil wealth, not American taxpayers, would cover most of the cost of rebuilding Iraq were at odds with a bleaker assessment of a government task force secretly established last fall to study Iraq's oil industry, according to public records and government officials.
 The task force, which was based at the Pentagon as part of the planning for the war, produced a book-length report that described the Iraqi oil industry as so badly damaged by a decade of trade embargoes that its production capacity had fallen by more than 25 percent, panel members have said. 
 Despite those findings, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told Congress during the war that "we are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon." 
Moreover, Vice President Dick Cheney said in April, on the day Baghdad fell, that Iraq's oil production could hit 3 million barrels a day by the end of the year, even though the task force had determined that Iraq was generating less than 2.4 million barrels a day before the war.
Now, as the Bush administration requests $20.3 billion from Congress for reconstruction next year, the chief reasons cited for the high price tag are sabotage of oil equipment -- and the poor state of oil infrastructure already documented by the task force. 
"The problem is this," L. Paul Bremer III, the top civilian administrator in Iraq, asserted at a Senate hearing two weeks ago: "The oil infrastructure was severely run down over the last 20 years, and partly because of sanctions over the last decade."
Similarly, Bush administration officials announced earlier this year that Iraq's oil revenues would be $20 billion to $30 billion a year, which added to the impression that the aftermath of the war would place a minimal burden on the United States. Mr. Bremer now estimates that Iraq's total oil revenues from the last half of 2003 to 2005 will amount to $35 billion, running at a rate of about $14 billion a year.
The administration now plays down the report's findings. 
Senior administration officials said that Mr. Cheney, Mr. Wolfowitz and Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, were aware of the oil group's overall mission, but that they could not say whether they knew of its specific findings.
"I think when it is all said and done," said Lawrence Di Rita, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, "prewar estimates that may be borne out in fact are likelier to be more lucky than smart."
Mr. Di Rita added that earlier estimates and statements by Mr. Wolfowitz and others "oozed with uncertainty."

Iraq's Most Valuable Asset
In the months leading up to the war, administration officials said little in public about oil, partly because they were "encumbered by fear" that their actions would be seen as helping the American petroleum industry, said one administration adviser. But behind the scenes, officials were studying how to handle Iraq's most valuable asset.
It was evident from much of the information they received that Iraq's oil was not a ready resource for reconstruction.
One expert consulted by the government, Amy Myers Jaffe, who heads the energy program at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston, said her group concluded in a report last December that "oil revenues would not be enough and that the expenses of reconstruction would be huge."
In addition, United Nations reports dating back to the late 1990's documented the deterioration that occurred in Iraq's oil system as a result of trade embargoes, which curtailed Iraq's access to technology and equipment.
The administration's examination of the subject began last September when Douglas J. Feith, the under secretary of defense for policy, asked an adviser to oversee plans for Iraq's oil industry in the event of war, according to a Pentagon official involved in the project.
The result was the Energy Infrastructure Planning Group, whose existence has not been previously disclosed. It drew on the expertise of government specialists including the Central Intelligence Agency and retired senior energy executives. It planned how to secure the oil industry during the war and, afterward, restoring it to its prewar capacity. 
The task force's job was not to make a direct assessment of how much money the oil industry could contribute to rebuilding Iraq. But determining Iraq's actual oil production capacity was important. First, it could help other administration officials gauge how much revenue might be generated for the reconstruction effort. Second, the administration was concerned that it did not want to be seen as profiting from invading an oil-rich nation and giving oil production levels a boost. 
The task force concluded that although Iraq's stated production capacity was just over 3 million barrels per day, the system was only producing 2.1 million to 2.4 million barrels, panel members said. 
"I think most people would agree that the 2.4 was a little high and the average for 2002 was 2.1," said a Pentagon official on the task force who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The "condition of the Iraqi oil infrastructure was not particularly good," the official said. "That would be evident to anybody who realized the country had been under U.N. sanctions for many years."
The United Nations produced reports on Iraq regularly from 1998 to 2001. The documents painted a picture of a troubled system and cited the need for improvements, some of which are now being proposed by Mr. Bremer, like the $125 million repair of the Qarmat Ali water plant in the south.
In April, when Vice President Cheney was asked about Iraq's oil during an appearance before newspaper editors, he cited higher numbers rather than the task force's more sober findings.
While noting that Iraq's oil fields were in "bad shape," Mr. Cheney said, "With some investment we ought to be able to get production back up on the order of 2.5, 3 million barrels a day, within, hopefully by the end of the year."
An aide to the vice president said recently that those estimates were "consistent with prewar capacity," but could not say whether Mr. Cheney was aware of the task force's different assessment.

An Optimistic Vision
The administration was also optimistic when it came to public estimates of Iraq's oil revenues.
Shortly after the war began in March, the administration's budget office provided Congress and reporters with a background paper on Iraq. It said that Iraq would "not require sustained aid" because of its abundant resources, including oil and natural gas.
On March 27, Mr. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, told the House Appropriations Committee that his "rough recollection" was that "The oil revenues of that country could bring between $50 billion and $100 billion over the course of the next two or three years." 
Testifying in the Senate that same day, Mr. Rumsfeld emphasized that "when it comes to reconstruction, before we turn to the American taxpayers we will turn first to the resources of the Iraqi government." He noted that the war's costs were not knowable, but he also said an important source of money for reconstruction would flow after the United States worked "with the Iraqi interim authority that will be established to tap Iraq's oil revenues."
At the outset of the war, the administration had asked Congress for $62 billion for Iraq, which included $1.7 billion for reconstruction and $489 million for oil-related repairs.
In a televised interview in late April, Andrew S. Natsios, head of the United States Agency for International Development, the group overseeing Iraq's reconstruction, said that amount was "it for the U.S." He said any other reconstruction money would come from elsewhere, including other countries and future "Iraqi oil revenues," which he predicted at "$20 billion a year."
In an interview this week, Mr. Natsios said he had based those comments on "the discussion in the interagency process at the time," adding, "That's what the Office of Management and Budget was telling us." 
Trent Duffy, a budget office spokesman, said this week that "the administration was very clear that the $1.7 billion in initial reconstruction was for the beginning stages and that it was necessary to get a better understanding of the fuller, comprehensive needs going forward." 
Last week, appearing again before the Senate committee, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "I don't think I did misjudge" Iraq's oilcapacity. According to current projections, he said, the country's oil revenues will grow to $12 billion next year from $2 billion this year; they should reach $19 billion in 2005 and $20 billion in 2006.
"So, their oil revenues will be contributing," Mr. Rumsfeld said.
Yet Mr. Bremer, in his remarks to legislators two weeks ago, said that for the next two years, whatever revenue was reaped from oil production would not exceed the cost of Iraq's day-to-day operating expenses. In 2005, he said, there would be a surplus of only $4 million to $5 million.
As for Mr. Cheney's projection in April that oil would produce as much as $20 billion a year, a Cheney aide said last week that "there was much more extensive damage due to looting and sabotage, so we're not going to get there when the vice president anticipated."

Reassessing Revenues
The public revenue estimates made in the spring were in line with the very top range of projections made by the Pentagon task force.
According to the Pentagon official who served on the task force, its projections for yearly oil revenues were $25 billion to $30 billion "in the very best case, no sabotage and little or no battle damage," and about $16 billion in the "worse than best case."
The worst case was no revenue for a few years, if there was "major sabotage and some significant battle damage."
Last December the Baker Institute estimated that even if there was no war damage, "Iraq's total oil revenues would still only likely average around $10 billion to $12 billion annually."
Yet even after the war, some officials in Washington seemed to cling to an optimistic view of Iraq's oil production.
In July, Mr. Wolfowitz told a group of senators that production had reached "over a million barrels per day." Although Iraq was having electrical power problems, Mr. Wolfowitz said the oil was flowing "because we brought in portable generators to provide electricity" and planned to bring in more.
But Philip Carroll, a retired petroleum executive and the senior American oil adviser in Baghdad, said in an interview that Iraqi oil production "experienced a terrible month in July because electrical problems cut us back to half of what we should have produced." Those problems, including the need to import considerable fuel, he said, led him to arrange new generator leases in late July.
Mr. Carroll said that although gross production for the week of July 25 was a million barrels a day, 350,000 barrels had to be injected back into the ground, because of a lack of storage or distribution infrastructure.
An aide to Mr. Wolfowitz said he believed that the oil information came from a briefing and that Mr. Wolfowitz's testimony was "sober and nuanced."
Once the war ended, and United States officials gained access to Iraq's oil records, they got a more complete picture.
"When we actually got their production figures for 2002, we were able to make a distinction between productive capacity and what they were actually producing," said Gary Loew, an Army Corps of Engineers official, reducing their capacity figures by 20 to 25 percent.
That reduction roughly corresponded to the Pentagon task force's cuts before the war began.

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; 
Congress Gets a Hot Potato: Bush's Detailed Program to Rebuild Iraq

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 

 BODY:
The most carefully read document on Capitol Hill at the moment is the detailed list of the Bush administration's plans to rebuild Iraq, which resembles no other spending request in recent memory.
 In explaining how it proposes to spend $20.3 billion to restore a civil society to Iraq, the administration has prepared a virtual travelogue of the country's descent into destruction and chaos. Nearly every structure of public life that Americans take for granted -- from firefighting to water supply to the post office -- is described as decimated, far worse than the administration ever imagined. 
 "We found the infrastructure in the country was in a lot worse shape than we thought, and that's the problem we've got," L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Iraq, told the Senate Appropriations Committee a few days ago. "We have got to redo that infrastructure. It's expensive."
 But the vast breadth of the administration's rebuilding plans has also astonished lawmakers, coming at a time when deficits are keeping domestic spending under severe restraint. Mr. Bremer described the request as only the most fundamental, essential services, but many members of Congress say the scope of the plan is beyond their expectations. Democrats have described many items on the list as "gold plated" and unnecessary, and many Republicans have said they may have to trim back the plan to pacify uneasy constituents.
 But even this spending bill would address only a fraction of the nearly $100 billion in reconstruction needs for Iraq that have been identified by the World Bank and other global agencies. Administration officials say they hope to raise the balance from international donors.
 This list, though not all-inclusive, shows most of the $20.3 billion in spending items requested by the Coalition Provisional Authority, headed by Mr. Bremer, and the administration's justifications and explanations. The House is likely to begin voting on the request this coming week, along with the $67 billion in military assistance requested by the Defense Department. Votes in the Senate will follow the week after.

GRAPHIC: ChartPublic Safety $2.1 billion International police training force: $800 millionA group of 1,500 would be assembled from around the world to train a new Iraqi police force in "democratically based principles of civilian policing." Traffic police: $50 millionThe buildings, fleet and equipment of the 5,200-member traffic police department were destroyed or looted. Border enforcement: $150 millionAlmost all the previous border police deserted, and the admin-istration proposes "a massive recruitment/ training program." At least 2,500 immigration inspectors will be trained, along with 2,250 consular officials, and 75 long-term outside advisers will be hired. Fire service: $290 millionMore than 165 firehouses were destroyed by the war and by looting, and there are no radios or firefighter gear. Facilities protection: $67 millionA guard system for public property: Training and administration, $15 million 80 pickup trucks, $2.6 million ($33,000 each) 400 hand-held radios and 200 satellite phones, $3.6 million Safety training: $274 millionThree public safety academies will be built or refurbished and courses will be conducted for 60,000 Interior Ministry employees. Security communi-cations system: $150 millionIncludes a national 911 system and a fiber-optic network connecting security agencies in all major cities, as well as a radio network for fire and ambulance services. National Security -- $2.1 billion New Iraqi Army: $2 billionAn "entirely new military structure" is needed to replace an army decimated in the war. The admin-istration proposes building a force of 40,000 troops by next August. The request includes $82 million for a small coast guard, $22 million to establish a new Iraqi Defense Ministry, $51 million for military academies, and $6 million to send the best officers to overseas professional military schools. Civil Defense Corps: $76 millionLightly armed Iraqi battalions to replace American forces as guides and interpreters and to conduct searches and operate checkpoints. Justice System -- $919 million Investigations into crimes against humanity: $100 millionAbout 500 experts and investigators will be paid $100,000 each to document crimes committed by Saddam Hussein's government. Security for judges and prosecutors: $200 millionPersonal security details for about 400 judges and prosecutors, plus security systems for about 130 court buildings. Witness protection program: $100 millionSafeguarding about 100 families of witnesses in organized crime cases, possibly moving them overseas. Prison construction: $500 millionTwo 4,000-bed maximum-security prisons would be constructed (at $50,000 a bed), and 26 existing prisons and detention centers would be modernized or rebuilt. Electrical System -- $5.7 billion Generation: $2.9 billionCurrent generation capacity in Iraq is slightly more than half of its needs, and the resulting blackouts are described as the major source of discontent, preventing the economy from recovering. This amount will restore existing generators, install more than a dozen new gas turbine units and build several larger thermal power stations. Transmission: $1.6 billionOne-fourth of all transmission towers are down, along with thousands of miles of power lines, which would be restored and expanded. International engineering firms would be brought in to make recommendations. Distribution: $1 billionLocal power substations, damaged by looting and lack of maintenance, would be repaired and replaced. Oil System -- $2.1 billion Capital investments: $1.2 billionIraq's principal source of revenue has been damaged by war, looting, and terrorist sabotage, the admin-istration says, and the following investments are necessary just to approach prewar levels of oil production: Rapid pipeline repair team, $55 million Four topping plants, the first stage in oil refinement, $125 million Backup distribution, including 200 fuel tankers and 250 liquified petroleum trucks, $68 million Oil system security force, training and equipment, $60 million Personal security for the oil minister and directors, $8 million Oil industry consultants, $5 million Pipeline and refinery repair, dating back to 1991, $575 million Oil import purchases: $900 millionThe oil system is so damaged that Iraq needs to import petroleum from abroad, the administration says, including a 30-day reserve. The products to be brought in include liquified petroleum gas for cooking, kerosene for heating, benzene for automobiles, and diesel for larger equipment and power generation. Water and Sanitation -- $4.6 billiion Potable water access: $2.8 billionOnly 60 percent of the population has access to safe drinking water, and even that water is not always reliable, the administration says. This amount would pay for water mains, reservoirs, salt-water treatment plants, tanker trucks and wells. Even that amount would only bring water to 90 percent of the population. Reducing water loss: $30 millionAbout 60 percent of the available water is currently lost to leaks and other flaws. These repairs would bring that loss down to 40 percent. Sewage improvements: $697 millionOnly 6 percent of Iraqis have access to sewers, leading to illness and death, particularly among children. This amount would build treatment facilities and urban sewers, increasing the population with access to sewers to 11 percent, or 900,000 more people. Solid waste management: $153 millionFifty landfill sites at $1 million each for construction and equipment, along with 40 garbage trucks at $50,000 each. Irrigation pumps: $75 millionThe irrigation system was not badly damaged but this amount"will demonstrate to the people of rural Iraq that the coalition is dedicated to improving their lives," the request says. Repair of old irrigation systems: $130 million"Village and tribal leaders need clear examples of improvement to gain the confidence and backing of their members," the request says. Dam safety repairs: $100 millionFor work identified by an Army Corps of Engineers safety team. Basra water supply: $200 millionReplacing an open canal to Iraq's second-largest city with a pipeline would prevent evaporation losses, the request says. This is just for the first phase; another $800 million will eventually be required. Housing and construction -- $470 million Housing: $100 millionWith no large-scale housing projects having been built in 20 years, the administration proposes building 3,528 new houses in seven areas around the country. The request notes that this amount will barely address the need for more than a million new housing units, but will show that housing needs are being addressed. Public buildings: $130 millionRepair more than 1,500 damaged buildings. Roads and bridges: $240 millionLack of maintenance has led to 43,000 miles of deteriorating highways and streets, and 32 bridges damaged by the war have not been repaired. Nearly half is for Expressway 1, the major north-south route in the country. Transportation and Telecommunications -- $835 million Civil aviation: $165 millionReopening the Baghdad and Basra airports, along with 120 others around the country. These funds would pay for control towers, avionic equipment, fiber-optic communication lines, training for air traffic controllers, and security systems. Ports: $45 millionThe large Umm Qasr port would get perimeter security, cargo handling equipment, a new customs office, electric power and water. Railroads: $303 millionHundreds of locomotives are out of service because of vandalism, the administration says, and freight cars and buildings have been looted. This amount would repair or replace trains, tracks, signal systems and two bridges. Postal and telephone study: $54 millionA business study of the Iraqi Telephone Postal Company to determine its capital needs. Postal system upgrade: $9 millionAutomated systems for an "antiquated" post office would include bar coding for letters and packages, and establishment of a ZIP code system. Wireless internet: $19 millionA WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) network would link mobile computer users to a central network, and improve communications within the government. Television and radio networks: $10 millionThis amount would restart commercial broadcast and cable operations, using modern transmitters. Rogue broadcasters would either become licensed or shut down. Telephone numbering system: $4 millionEstablishment of area codes and a 911 emergency system (which would actually use the emergency number of 112). Health Care -- $850 million New children's hospital: $150 millionThis amount would begin construction on a $500 million to $700 million hospital in Basra designed to improve high childhood mortality rates. It is described as a base for "cutting edge research," and will be a "visible sign of the transformation of the health care system in Iraq," the request says. Hospital refurbishment: $393 millionThis amount would repair 200 of the existing 240 hospitals, and supply equipment for 900 of the 1,200 primary-care clinics and five regional maternal centers. Medical equipment: $300 millionNearly half the equipment in the 240 hospitals is in "desperate need of repair or replacement," the request says, including X-ray machines, incinerators, lab equipment and backup power generators. Other Areas Business development: $300 millionA $200 million fund would invest in private enterprises and supply western business knowledge, along with 22 employment centers for job counseling and assistance at a cost of $350,000 each. Job training would be provided in computer literacy, English as a second language and vocational areas. Refugee assistance: $105 millionThis amount would help return over 500,000 Iraqis from neighboring countries and over 1 million internally displaced persons to their homes. Most of the money would be used by the United Nations, the Red Cross and other international organizations. Local governments: $90 millionThis amount would help 266 cities build public information centers to disseminate information about municipal services. Property claims tribunal: $30 millionA special court would resolve thousands of property disputes that have arisen from the appropriation of land and houses by Saddam Hussein's government. Banking improvements: $30 millionThe request says the banking system was nearly destroyed in postwar looting, and proposes a modern, computerized system to create trust in bank accounts and promote foreign investment. Business training: $20 millionThis amount would provide a four-week training course to about 2,000 middle managers, at a cost of $10,000 each, to instruct them in modern Western business practices. "As Iraq opens its doors to direct foreign capital investment, it will need managers and leaders who understand these concepts," the request says. Human rights: $15 millionTo help begin the healing process, the request includes: Museum documenting past atrocities, $1 million Equipment and training for exhuming mass graves, $2 million Development of national missing persons bureau, $1.5 million Memorial to Iraqi athletes who suffered under the former government, $500,000 Women's resource centers and training, $ 5 million

IN BRIEF

 BODY:
 * Raising expectations that he may support introducing greater pluralism, President Hu Jintao made a vague but insistent call for more democracy in China. Mr. Hu almost certainly does not plan to push Western-style democracy. Even so, Mr. Hu's speech was his boldest call for quickerpolitical change since he became general secretary of the Communist Party last year.

* David Kay, the government's chief weapons inspector in Iraq, told Congress that his team had failed to find illegal weapons after three months of scouring the country, but he said the group had discovered some evidence of Saddam Hussein's intent to develop such weapons and even signs that Baghdad had retained some capacity to do so.

* The public's confidence in President Bush's ability to deal wisely with an international crisis has slid sharply, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll found. The poll found that just 45 percent of Americans have confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to do so, down sharply from 66 percent in April, and half now say they are uneasy about his approach.

* The job market in September showed its strongest signs of revival since the start of the year, as a government report suggested that the economic recovery might finally be powerful enough to help workers.
Employment rose by 57,000 last month, the first increase since January, and the unemployment rate held steady at 6.1 percent, the Labor Department reported. But the increase in jobs was still not large enough to match the growth of the population, and the percentage of adults with jobs fell to the lowest level in 10 years.

* J. M. Coetzee, a widely acclaimed South African novelist who has often used his country's apartheid system and its post-apartheid transition to mirror the bleakness of the human condition, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm.

HEADLINE: The Nation -- CALIFORNIA 101: WHAT HAPPENED?; 
Governor NAME HERE : Good Luck

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
AN optimist, Ronald Reagan used to say, is someone who looks at a pile of horse manure and says, "There must be a pony around here someplace."
 Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gray Davis must be optimists. 
Why else would they want to be governor of California? 
 Whoever emerges as governor after Tuesdays election (and it could be any of the top candidates; stranger things have happened already this year) will face a pile of problems.
The new (or old) governor inherits an anemic state economy, a surly electorate, more than 300,000 state employees who are worried about their jobs, a State Legislature dominated by liberal Democrats and, most vexing of all, a budget for next year that starts $8 billion in the hole. (That gap is more than 10 percent of this year's budget of $71 billion; about 80 percent of the budget is mandated, largely outside a governor's discretion.)
If Mr. Schwarzenegger is elected, he will find himself the only Republican among the states eight constitutional officers. At least two of them, Attorney General Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides, are considering running for governor in 2006. And some Democrats are making noises about initiating a recall of Mr. Schwarzenegger, if he wins, even as the new governor is trying to put together a staff and cabinet and fill some 3,000 other appointed positions.
In the meantime, Governor Davis is scrambling to sign as much legislation and fill as many empty jobs as possible before this Tuesday, leaving much for a new governor to do and undo.
Timothy Hodson, head of the Center for California Studies at Cal State Sacramento, said, "For political junkies with a sense a sadism, it will be an interesting thing to watch." JOHN M. BRODER

NEW DISTRICTSNew political districts drawn in 2001 tended to create Democratic and Republican strongholds, polarizing the Legislature.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE GOVERNOR; 
DAVIS STRUGGLING TO HOLD HIS BASE

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER and MIREYA NAVARRO; Carolyn Marshall contributed to this report.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4 

 BODY:
It is not hard to find the reason that Gov. Gray Davis is in such trouble.
 Recent polls and a string of interviews support the perception that Democrats who might be expected to reject the recall and support Mr. Davis are deserting him in droves and that Mr. Davis is in serious jeopardy of losing his job on Tuesday. Nothing the governor has said or done in the frantic final weeks of the campaign seems to be bringing his base vote home. Page 30. 
 Scott Anderson, a unionized electrician from Venice Beach, said he was furious at Mr. Davis and at the leadership of his union, which is spending heavily to oppose the recall. 
"Gray Davis and the rest of his people in the tower of corruption are destroying this state," said Mr. Anderson, 33. "He needs to be recalled."
Kenitra Thompson, a 23-year-old nursing student at Southwest Los Angeles Community College, said she had not decided how to vote on the recall. "I don't know yet," she said, shaking her head. "He's behind all the budget cuts at this school."
Even those Democrats who say they plan to vote against the recall have little good to say about Governor Davis, whom they see as a pinata for an aggrieved electorate. 
"Basic things have gone wrong in California," said Whitney Skillcorn, 28, a musician who lives in San Francisco. "Our power crisis was not handled to benefit consumers; education needs revitalization. People are absolutely fed up. They want change and they want change now."
California is one of the most Democratic states in the nation, preferring Al Gore to George W. Bush in 2000 by a million-vote margin. The party enjoys a 10-point advantage over Republicans in voter registration and the state is home to millions of members of core Democratic constituency groups -- labor, environmentalists, blacks, Latinos. All Mr. Davis needs to survive is for these groups to mobilize and vote no on the recall on Tuesday.
Yet he has so far been unable to make his case, despite appearances by major party figures like Bill Clinton and the signing of a number of bills designed to appease and energize the party's core.
"The governor has never done the job he should have maintaining his base," said Phil Trounstine, director of the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State University and a former senior aide to Mr. Davis. "He hasn't spent the time in the union halls and at the environmental dinners and in the black churches and in the Latino community that he should have. That makes it difficult for him when he needs that base to turn out for him."
Not even the accusations that have hit Mr. Schwarzenegger over the past week -- accounts by at least six women that he made unsolicited physical advances toward them and a report that quoted him as saying in 1975 that he admired Hitler -- appear to have energized some in Mr. Davis's core base.
"I don't think a lot of it is true," Joyce Allen, a 48-year-old Democrat, said on Friday as she was having breakfast at Junior's Delicatessen in Westwood. "I can't imagine he'd be an admirer of Hitler."
Both Ms. Allen and her 70-year-old mother, Sally Allen, who is also a Democrat, said they were for the recall and that they intended to vote for Mr. Schwarzenegger. Both said they would not think of voting for Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante because they believed he was part of the same Davis administration that had failed Californians.
"He's done too many things that have been bad for the state," Sally Allen said of Mr. Davis.
Joyce Allen said, "I'm not sure I like Schwarzenegger more than anyone else, but I don't want Davis or Bustamante."
Two statewide polls this week showed that nearly 30 percent of likely Democratic voters planned to vote for the recall, even though that would probably result in the election of an untested Republican, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Even 20 percent of self-identified liberals said they intended to vote to remove Mr. Davis from office on Tuesday, 11 months after he was elected to a second four-year term, the polls found. In 2002, Mr. Davis won 80 percent of Democratic votes. In 1998, 9 out of 10 Democrats supported him.
Tracy Schmidt, a consultant for nonprofit groups in San Francisco, is among those Democrats disenchanted with Mr. Davis. She said she planned to vote against the recall, more from fear of its consequences than from loyalty to Mr. Davis.
She said the governor had squandered the support of his constituency by insulating himself after taking office and losing touch with voters.
"He didn't watch his back," said Ms. Schmidt, 36. "He focused on political insiders and the capital rather than keeping touch with his base. He did not consider the political machine of the conservative Republicans. There is an old saying: Keep your friends close and keep your enemies closer. I don't think he did either."
Ms. Schmidt said she hoped the revelations of the past few days would inspire more Democrats to forget, at least for a day, their misgivings about Mr. Davis.
Democratic disaffection with Mr. Davis is particularly strong among union members and Latinos, some evidence shows. Art Pulaski, leader of the state's largest labor group, the 2.1-million-member California Labor Federation, A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that as of Friday internal polls showed that up to 40 percent of his members were planning to vote for the recall. 
"There's no question this is an uphill battle," Mr. Pulaski said. "Our members are subject to the same concerns and frustrations as the rest of the public -- the downturn of the economy, the potential of joblessness, fear of terrorism." It added up to a search for scapegoats and a desire for change, he said.
His labor group is spending $5 million to try to stop the recall. This week it sent out more than 500,000 pieces of mail, and it has hundreds of people working phone banks to try to persuade members to oppose the recall. The federation has also sent dozens of members out to ring doorbells to plead the case.
Ana Diaz, a member of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, went door to door in a Hispanic neighborhood just west of downtown Los Angeles one evening this week. She and her partner knocked on the door of Jaime Estrada, 39, a stock supervisor at a Gap store.
He was unswayed by their argument that Mr. Davis had expanded a state health care program for children and signed a bill allowing illegal immigrants to get driver's licenses.
"I'd like a change in the government," he told the women.
Out of earshot of the precinct walkers he said: "One of the things I've heard and read is that he doesn't know how to govern, and we are the ones left paying taxes. One way or another, he has to respond for that."
Mr. Davis has damaged himself with his admittedly tardy responses to the state's energy and budget crises. But this week he was hurt by an accident of the calendar. On Wednesday, vehicle license fees tripled as part of a budget-balancing deal signed in July.
Ms. Diaz heard plenty of complaints about that this week.
"Throw him out," said Rafael Salmeron, 54, a welder fretting over seeing his $46 license plate fee rise to almost $150. "I don't know if it's his fault, but car plates tripled and the price of gasoline is up, too."
In many ways, Mr. Davis found himself in an impossible position when the recall question qualified for the ballot. His approval rating was in the low 20's and he had to find money and votes somewhere. He took a turn to the left to try to shore up support among Democratic interests, signing the driver's license bill, approving legislation to expand the rights of gay domestic partners and indicating he would sign the most expansive employer-mandated health insurance plan in the nation.
Those moves ensured millions of dollars in donations from unions, interest groups and wealthy liberals. But they turned off some moderates and independents, who are a substantial slice of the California electorate.
"A lot of Democrats I talk to are voting for the recall as an opportunity to protest the movement to the left within their party," said Joseph E. Canciamilla, one of a handful of Democratic moderates in the state Assembly. "Ultimately when you move to the extreme you're going to lose many in the middle."
He added, "I'm not afraid of working with Arnold."
The two groups that appear most united behind Mr. Davis are environmentalists and gays. Leaders of the state's major conservation groups all expressed unqualified support for the governor. 
"It's got to be close to unanimous in the environmental community," said Rico Mastrodonato, acting executive director of the league. "I don't know a single reasonable soul who is supporting the recall at this point."
Bob Hattoy, a gay activist and former Clinton administration official, said many of his gay friends were upset with the condition of the state and eager for a change. But he tells them that electing Mr. Schwarzenegger is not the answer.
"There are times I've been annoyed with the governor," Mr. Hattoy said. "But this is not about me anymore. It affects lives, jobs, futures."
He added: "I tell people, 'If you're angry, see a therapist. But don't vote for the recall and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's self-destructive.' "

HEADLINE: Jobs, the Quality Kind 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Slowing Stream of New Jobs Gives a Full Picture of a Slump" (front page, Oct. 1): 
 To get the full picture, the public needs data on the quality of the jobs created, not just the net number of jobs lost or gained. 
 Losing one well-paying high-tech job that has health insurance and gaining, say, two restaurant-worker jobs that pay neither a living wage nor health insurance may be a net gain in employment, but our country and its citizens will be poorer for the change.
We have lost nearly three million jobs in recent years, many more people who have been looking for work have given up and are not even counted, and 43.6 million of our citizens had no health insurance last year. We read daily about manufacturing jobs going overseas, film production leaving the United States, and even American workers having to train their overseas replacements before being fired.
The public cannot evaluate its elected representatives without knowing how their policies affect the creation of quality jobs at home.

HEADLINE: Product Liability Lawsuits Are New Threat to Microsoft 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Trial lawyers have watched with increasing interest in recent months as malicious computer viruses and worms -- all exploiting security flaws in Microsoft software -- have crashed computers and networks around the world. It is only a matter of time, they said, before the class-action suits against Microsoft start dropping.
 The first came last week, filed in State Superior Court in Los Angeles, asserting that Microsoft engaged in unfair business practices and violated California consumer protection laws by selling software riddled with security flaws. The suit seeks class-action status. More such suits are anticipated. 
 The litigation, legal experts said, is an effort to use the courts to make software subject to product liability law -- a burden the industry has so far avoided and strenuously resisted.
"For a software company to be held liable would be a real extension of liability as it now stands," said Jeffrey D. Neuburger, a technology lawyer at Brown Raysman Millstein Felder & Steiner.
To date, software companies have sidestepped liability suits partly by selling customers a license to use their programs -- not actual ownership -- with a lengthy list of caveats and disclaimers. So the warranty programs offered by PC makers, for example, cover hardware but not software.
The industry has argued that software is a highly complex product, often misused or modified by consumers. Assigning responsibility for a failure, the argument goes, would be unfair to any single company.
Besides, software executives say, the industry is a fast-changing global business that is largely led by United States companies. Opening the industry up to product liability lawsuits, they say, would chill innovation and undermine the competitiveness of American companies.
Yet whether the software industry can remain beyond the reach of product liability is still not certain. The modern economy -- from office work to financial markets to power grids -- depends increasingly on software. And the trial lawyers are not the only ones who think software makers should face stronger incentives to create products that are more reliable and secure. 
Outside of the courthouse, regulations and legislation may also be deployed to prod the industry toward more secure software. A report last year by a National Academy of Sciences panel, made up largely of computer scientists from universities and companies, included the recommendation that "policy makers should consider legislative responses to the failure of existing incentives to cause the market to respond adequately to the security challenge."
The debate over software liability seems certain to become more intense, computer security experts say, and some shift toward holding software makers responsible for defects may be inevitable. 
"The broad issue is, as a matter of policy, do we want suppliers of products and systems that are critical to our economy to be able to absolve themselves of all liability," said Mark D. Rasch, a former federal prosecutor who is a senior vice president of Solutionary Inc., a computer security firm.
But class-action suits against Microsoft over security matters, legal experts say, will be hard-fought and difficult to win. Such cases are trying to break new ground in a way that recent class-action antitrust suits against Microsoft, for example, did not.
In the antitrust cases, the class-action plaintiffs filed in the wake of the landmark federal case that found the company was a monopoly that had repeatedly abused its market power. Microsoft has tried to settle its antitrust class actions, including agreeing to pay a $1.1 billion settlement in California earlier this year.
Microsoft, by contrast, has suffered no reverses in court that would establish any liability for flawed software. In the current case, it is conceding nothing. Microsoft issued a statement saying that developing the most secure software possible was a top priority for the company.
"This complaint misses the point," the Microsoft statement added. "The problems caused by viruses and other security attacks are the result of criminal acts by the people who write viruses."
The suit was filed by an experienced product liability lawyer, Dana B. Taschner, on behalf of Marcy Levitas Hamilton, a Los Angeles film editor, and other members of the proposed class.
The 19-page complaint is a broad-brush document arguing that Microsoft's Windows operating system, which runs 90 percent of all personal computers in the world, is poorly designed, flaw-ridden, and that the company ships software it knows is riddled with security flaws. The complaint adds that Microsoft's system for warning the public of security problems is so confusing and technically complex that it is of little use to the ordinary computer user. 
Because of Microsoft's insecure software, the complaint asserts, Ms. Hamilton suffered identity theft -- someone obtained unauthorized access to her Social Security number and bank account information, which was stored on her computer.
Still, a big hurdle for class-action plaintiffs, legal experts say, will be the standard software license. It is what all computer users see and click to agree to -- even if they seldom read it -- when they start a new machine or load a new software program. For the plaintiffs to prevail, a judge will have to rule, in effect, that the software license is unenforceable or is overridden by another standard, like the "fit for intended use" rule that applies to most consumer products.
Class-action lawyers say they are confident that this standard will eventually be applied. "As a matter of policy, I think the courts will find that software companies have basic obligations to provide a product that does what it is supposed to do," said Terry Gross, a partner of Gross & Belsky, a firm in San Francisco. "And that the companies cannot avoid those obligations just because of the language in the license."

HEADLINE: Southeast Asian Nations Meet To Tighten Economic Bonds 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct. 5 

 BODY:
The nations of Southeast Asia need to band together more closely economically or else American investment will continue to decline in the region as it flows ever more to China, an executive representing large American corporations said here on Sunday. 
 The trend of a sharp increase in American investment in China and a steady drop in Southeast Asia can be countered only if the region moves toward the integration of its 10 countries with a total population of 500 million, the executive, Ernest Z. Bower, the president of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, told a top business group meeting here. 
 The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, start arriving here in Bali on Monday for their annual meeting. The centerpiece of the gathering is expected to be the signing of an accord that lays out plans for an Asian economic community. 
To fully integrate, Mr. Bower said, the Asean economic community will have to tackle issues of labor laws, customs and judicial reform in some countries.
But Asean, generally fearful of interference in the affairs of member nations, is famous for slow movement, and the question hovering over the economic integration plan is whether it can be achieved fast enough to make the region competitive with China.
In recognition of the problems, the business and investment summit meeting that opened Sunday was a first for Asean and was initiated in large part by the new secretary general, Ong Keng Yong, of Singapore. 
The Indonesian president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, addressed the business leaders on Sunday, and said Bali was deliberately chosen as the site for the summit meeting to show that Indonesia would not be deterred by the terrorist attack here a year ago. Other leading members of Asean include Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.
Though China does not belong to Asean, it is represented at the meeting, less as a participant that is knocking on the door than as one that had already entered the house. 
The 48-member delegation of Chinese business executives is the largest of any country, and China wanted to field an even bigger delegation, said Tanri Abeng, the head of the meeting's organizing committee.
The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, will be among three non-Asean leaders attending the summit meeting. The others will be Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan. 
Mr. Wen will sign a treaty of amity and cooperation with Asean, a pact that Beijing has advertised as a sign that China wants friendly, not threatening, relations with the region. 
American companies have $52 billion invested in the region, compared with $12 billion for China and $54 billion for Japan, Mr. Bower said in an interview. The U.S.-Asean Business Council represents more than 400 of the largest American corporations that do business in Southeast Asia, including the major energy and telecommunications companies. 
But Chinese investments are rapidly growing in Southeast Asia, he said. In some cases, Chinese companies are buying up Asian investments being sold by American companies, particularly in the power and telecommunications sectors in Indonesia.
At one of the seminars on Sunday, figures showed that in 2001 Asean members, with their combined population of 500 million, attracted only 1.7 percent of the available global foreign investment while China, with more than double the population, received 9 percent of the available investment. 
And while this increase in trade with China was going on, many countries in Southeast Asia believed that the United States was preoccupied with terrorism in the region at the expense of everything else. 
That is a "misconception," Mr. Bower said. He suggested that President Bush's planned trip to four Southeast Asian countries -- Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia -- in two weeks could help correct that view. No American president has visited as many as four countries in the region on one trip.

HEADLINE: 88 Keys, Many Languages, One Proud Name; 
Workers at Steinway Reflect the Changing Face of New York

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
By mid-June, the timetable for Steinway concert grand No. K0862 was clear. In the fall it would become a musical instrument. But first it would become a piece of furniture.
 Before installing the 12,000 parts that would make No. K0862 a piano -- strings, hammers, keys and the like -- Steinway workers would have to turn the laminated rim they had bent in March into a case. They would install wooden braces trimmed according to trellislike patterns kept on a nail on a wall of the Steinway & Sons factory in Queens. They would drill holes in places a pianist would never see. 
 Then, on a rainy Wednesday in July, No. K0862 would lose its unfinished, wood-shop look. In less than 20 minutes it would be sprayed with shiny black lacquer by a man whose previous job was to paint cars in an auto body shop. ("This," the lacquerer, Joseph Klimas, said, "has better benefits.") 
His are among the 900 hands at the factory -- hands that are working on No. K0862, shaping its character, its personality. For Steinways are still largely handmade in a factory of men (and the company's work force is overwhelmingly male) who carry on traditions that go back more than 100 years.
Steinway wraps itself in its history: its high-ceilinged showroom in Manhattan has outsized paintings of the 19th-century matinee-idol pianist Ignace Paderewski, whose coast-to-coast concert tour helped make Steinway a household name, and busts of Franz Liszt and Sergei Rachmaninoff.
At the factory, though, the workers seem refreshingly unburdened by the weight of Steinway's past. They are focused on the piece of wood in front of them at any given moment and are not especially talkative -- "It's a job," more than one replied when asked whether he liked working there.
That may be what they say inside the factory between 7:30 and 4. "The payback is not in here," said Gino Romano, who was hired in 1964 and now, at 64, is Steinway's most senior supervisor. "The payback is outside, when you get the celebrity treatment for building a Steinway, when you meet somebody for the first time and they ooh and ahh: 'You build Steinways? Wow.' You're automatically put on a higher level, and you go, 'I didn't realize I was that notable.' "
Inside the factory, they do their jobs the way Steinway workers always have. The factory has been modernized in recent years, but No. K0862 is being built according to designs Steinway patented decades ago. "That's our foundation," Mr. Romano said.
One of Steinway's many traditions is an oral one: instructions are handed down in a variety of languages, with English often second to German, Italian, Spanish or, lately, Serbian. That is because Steinway's work force has changed along with New York.
For generations after its founding in 1853, Steinway hired German, Austrian, Irish and Italian immigrants. By the 1980's, job applications reflected the influx of immigrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republican. Haitians now account for the largest single group of immigrants at the factory, 17 percent of the work force. Dominicans make up 4 percent.
The city's immigration patterns changed again in the 1990's, and so did Steinway's. The company hired refugees from the war in Yugoslavia -- Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian immigrants -- who now make up about 7 percent of the work force.
"We had Serbs in some parts of the factory and Croats in others," said Michael A. Anesta, the personnel director. "At the height of the conflict, we had fund-raising going on on one floor and clothing and food collections going on on another floor for the opposite sides, and still made pianos every day." (There were some arguments at lunchtime, he said, but no blows.)
The quality control inspector who will check No. K0862 after it is finished grew up in Belarus. There is talk around the factory that he once worked with Lee Harvey Oswald. Not so, said the inspector, Sam Sheykman, 65 -- he and Oswald did have jobs at the same factory in Minsk, making cabinets for radios and televisions, but at different times.
Silvio Dodos immigrated from Romania when he was 8. Steinway hired him after he graduated from the State University of New York at Morrisville with a degree in wood products technology. He is now 25 and has worked at Steinway since 1998.
He is one of the few craftsmen to work on No. K0862 who has a piano at home -- not a Steinway but a Kawai upright. His sister plays, and he has tried to learn. So the question was inevitable: What does he think of the Kawai, a mass-produced piano from a company whose production for a week almost equals Steinway's for a year?
"It's well made," he said, "but I don't think it's the same quality as a Steinway is. The sound pretty much tells it. I've tried a lot of pianos in the factory. I'm not really a musician, but you can tell."

Old Ways and Modern Tools
Mr. Dodos's work on No. K0862 began after the top and bottom of the rim had been trimmed off by Louis Nozil, a Haitian, working with an Ecuadorean, Jorge Roca. Mr. Dodos used a power saw to make a rough cut at the end of the rim, forming the sharp-elbowed arms that bracket the keyboard.
In the piano business, this kind of cutting is called fraising, from a French word meaning to ream out. That term, also used in watchmaking, worked its way into English in the last third of the 19th century, a heyday for piano makers. The essential elements of Steinway's manufacturing process have not changed much since then. Steinway workers hired in the 1960's, for example, say they learned to use handsaws to cut the ends of rims, the way Steinway workers had done 100 years before.
"It took two men, like you were cutting a log," said Mr. Romano, the foreman in Mr. Dodos's department.
These days, a machine does that job. But first, Mr. Dodos had to finish the preparations. After he cut the ends of the rim, he dropped the two blocks of wood into a barrel behind his workbench. To avoid wasting expensive wood, Steinway sends such blocks to another woodworker at the factory. They are trimmed into smaller pieces, with a 45-degree angle at one end, known as cheek blocks. They strengthen the rim when they are glued back on. So Mr. Dodos's next two moves were to cut a 45-degree notch into the rim of No. K0862 and reach into a barrel of completed cheek blocks. 
A few days later, a co-worker in Steinway's case department, Louis Auguste, loaded No. K0862 onto a machine that completed the shaping of its Sheraton arms (named for Thomas Sheraton, the 18th-century furniture designer) and its sharp corners.
There were no complications with No. K0862. "There are a lot of things we stop in here because they're not up to our standards," said Mr. Romano, the foreman. His department was behind schedule, in part because one worker had been hurt in a car accident and missed several weeks of work. Mr. Romano could not simply assign someone else to substitute, because it takes almost a year to train a case maker. "When you lose one of them for a long period of time," he said, "it has a serious effect on our output." (By September, Mr. Romano had hired an experienced case maker who had been living in Florida, a relative of another Steinway worker.)
Steinway officials said the factory moved to a drumbeat of 10 pianos a day, or about 2,500 a year. But the total this year could be fewer than that. Concerned about a sputtering economy and sluggish sales before the war in Iraq, Steinway shut the factory for two weeks this year, in addition to its usual three-week summer vacation.

Working Without Words
"It's still pretty much a carcass," Andrew Horbachevsky, Steinway's manufacturing director, said before Senad Beharovic went to work on No. K0862. This was a few days after Mr. Dodos and Mr. Auguste had finished their cutting and gluing.
Mr. Beharovic, 35, a Macedonian who goes by the nickname Dragan, would spend more time with No. K0862 than any other worker so far -- about seven hours, with time out for lunch and coffee breaks. He began by laying a trellislike pattern for the four thick braces to go inside the case. Soon he was nailing, clamping and planing, and Mr. Horbachevsky was explaining that the machine-made braces are intentionally cut a bit too big so they can be hand-trimmed for a precise fit.
"The braces lock in the curved shape," Mr. Horbachevsky said. "We're dealing with wood here. Every rim is a slightly different shape. This one could be off 1/16th from that one. We're not talking very different, but enough to contribute to the personality of the piano. That's why we scribe that particular brace to that particular rim."
The same goes for the keybed, a wide rectangle with expansion joints designed to deal with different humidity conditions. "We don't want the keys sitting on a foundation that twists," Mr. Horbachevsky said as Mr. Beharovic worked away.
This is solitary work. Mr. Beharovic worked for an hour without speaking. Only when a colleague told him it was time for the midmorning break did he say anything: "I'll be back."

Time for theBlack and Gold
The final step in the furniture-making part of No. K0862's life came three weeks later, but only after Mr. Beharovic's keybed had been covered over. The wrestplank -- a thick chunk of wood also known as the pin block because it will hold the tuning pins -- was also covered, with cardboard. Michael Senia, the foreman in the coating department, explained that the cardboard was held in place not with ordinary masking tape, but with a low-tack variety. "Otherwise, you'll pull up that spruce," he said.
Soon a worker, Jeremy Shepherd, was sponging linseed oil on the rim. "You've got to fill the pores," Mr. Senia said. "That's important, so the lacquer doesn't go in and damage the wood. This way, you know you'll have a smooth finish."
Then No. K0862, riding on a metal trolley, was wheeled into a booth with a waterfall at the back. Here, five to six gallons of lacquer will be sprayed on. The waterfall is supposed to catch droplets of lacquer that miss their target and could raise health issues if they drifted into the factory.
Mr. Klimas, 52, the former auto-body shop worker, has been lacquering pianos since Steinway hired him seven years ago -- he knew Mr. Senia's brother-in-law, who knew there was an opening. "There's less trouble with these than with cars," said Mr. Klimas, who started on the long, straight side and worked back and forth like an oscillating fan. "Not as many colors to match."
He would spray five coats on No. K0862 before Labor Day. But now, after the first and before the second, No. K0862 was in the hands of Tomasz Kawalko.
His job was to rub a decal that spells out Steinway & Sons in inch-high gold letters on the side of No. K0862, where the name and Steinway's lyre-and-treble-clef symbol can be seen from the back of any auditorium. Mr. Kawalko is also the one who rubs a smaller Steinway decal inside each fallboard, the cover that hides the keyboard when closed.
Mr. Kawalko, who is 26 and was a parking attendant before Steinway hired him five years ago, likes being the man who puts the Steinway on Steinways.
"It's fun to watch MTV and show my wife, 'Look, this is what I do,' " he said.

Invention for 900 Hands

It is something of a mystery. The same 450 workers bend and shape the wood the same way. The sounding boards are made to the same specifications. The strings and pins, hammers and keys -- there should be no variation.
Yet every piano that Steinway & Sons produces has a unique sound. Some Steinways are modest, some monumental. And no one knows exactly why.
This is the fifth article in a series following one concert grand, No. K0862, as it is made at Steinway's factory in Astoria, Queens. The sixth article will look at the company's financial picture.

Nobody's Business But Yours

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
THE city's educational broadcasting stations are up for sale, and while they still have their diehard fans, most New Yorkers probably would not mourn the loss of the former Board of Education's undernourished radio and television stations -- WNYE. If they knew.
 Which they do not. To people in the communications business, it is an open secret that WNYC-FM is close to purchasing the radio station and that WNET-Channel 13 will probably buy the TV station. To the people of New York, though, who own the stations, the transactions are merely a secret. 
 There has been no announcement, no competitive bidding, no comment from the agency conducting the negotiations, the Economic Development Corporation. Its spokesman, Michael Sherman, said that neither the corporation's president, Andrew M. Alper, nor its executive vice president, Jonathan S. Fair, would have anything to say and referred inquiries to the mayor's press secretary, Edward Skyler.
"There is a negotiated sale of the radio station under way," said Mr. Skyler, adding that the value of the TV station, (Channel 25) is under analysis. Terms? Players? The asking price for WNYE-FM (91.5)? "They don't want to talk about terms until it's done," he said of the men at the Economic Development Corporation. Nor will critics of the process say anything for public consumption either, citing fear of retribution, which was not uncommon when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, though, pledged to run a more open shop -- and often he does. But public officials tend to use the arrows in their quiver and the Public Development Corporation is one sharp arrow. It is a semi-autonomous agency that was created years ago so the city could put together financial deals without doing the usual political battle. Its members are appointed by the mayor and answerable only to him.
"It carries out 90 percent of the economic development activities of New York City and the City Council can't touch it," said James A. Parrot of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research group. "It is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as it doesn't otherwise skirt public review."
A significant caveat. The corporation is a version of those increasingly controversial boards and authorities -- there are about 50 statewide -- that, to the frustration of prominent Albany Democrats and civic groups, often seem unaccountable to the public.
The most recent criticism has centered on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for its opaque budgeting, and the Canal Authority, which sold lucrative access rights to the Erie Canal system to a developer for $30,000. And it was charged in a lawsuit that the Economic Development Corporation in the Giuliani days pushed city agencies to raze the Thunderbolt roller coaster in Coney Island; the demolition was illegal, a federal jury said last month.
"The purpose of the E.D.C. is to do a variety of economic development deals and other things without following normal procurement or other rules and some of what it does is justified in an emergency," explained the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who favors limiting the power of boards and authorities. "But there are even rules for emergencies. In effect there are no rules for the E.D.C. The parallel to state authorities is a correct one."
EVEN supporters of WNYE assume the sale of the stations is inevitable. The money to turn WNYE into what it was supposed to be when it was formed in the late 1960's, a sophisticated educational broadcasting system, has never been there and is not likely to arrive. Programming, especially in the arts, has improved lately, but the stations have never escaped their sleepy image, and their most fervent backers today are not educators but ethnic groups that lease inexpensive air time.
Those groups are not without influence, but while they were able to stop an effort two years ago to turn over the operation of WNYE to WNYC and WNET by appealing to the Board of Education, they have lost that political ally with the board's abolition.
Supporters of the stations recognize the likelihood of a sale. It's the method they are questioning. "Why not open it to competitive bidding, why not operate transparently?" one supporter asked. Another asked if the negotiations reflected favoritism. There might be answers to those questions. If someone in the city would entertain them. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 9, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The Metro Matters column on Monday, about plans to sell the Board of Education's WNYE radio and television stations, misstated the founding date of the radio station. It was 1938; the television station opened in the 1960's.

HEADLINE: A Rough-and-Tumble Mayoral Fight in a Fast-Changing River City 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: HUDSON, N.Y., Oct. 1 

 BODY:
The two candidates for mayor in this shabby-chic river city seem to come from different planets. 
 The incumbent, Richard E. Scalera, a Democrat, is an unabashed good old boy: a longtime correction employee; father of five; former coach in the schools; and a Hudson native whose own father, also a native, toiled in the cement plants that once hugged the riverfront. 
 The challenger, Linda Mussmann, a Democrat running on her own party line, is a hipster and relative newcomer who moved here with her partner a decade ago when they relocated their avant-garde theater from Manhattan. She is openly lesbian, childless and a self-described "writer, director and thinker" who has embraced her adopted community. 
Their oil-and-water personalities, and the way they reflect the tug of cultures in this fast-changing town (with more than 70 antiques stores at last count), would, on their own, make the fall election noteworthy.
But it gets better, or worse. In recent weeks the contest has taken on the appearance of a whodunit-cum-farce, with enough political maneuvering -- on both sides -- to make Machiavelli blush.
First came Mr. Scalera's political coup of securing the endorsements of all four parties in town: the Democratic Party, of course, but also the Independence, Republican and Conservative parties. Mr. Scalera called it an honor, a sign that he had worked his "tail off" during this term to bring all parties together.
For his critics, however, the cross-endorsements smacked of back-room dealing.
Enter Ms. Mussmann, who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Scalera in 2001 on her own Bottom Line Party. This time around she decided to challenge Mr. Scalera in the Democratic primary.
She helped assemble a slate of about 20 primary candidates, known as "Mussmann Democrats," to run against the officially sanctioned Democratic slate of aldermen, the equivalent of councilmen, and committeemen, the party officials who were appointed years ago.
This so infuriated Mr. Scalera that in mid-August he quietly gathered signatures on petitions to gain control of the Bottom Line designation, which she had planned to use again in the general election if she were defeated in the primary. He also staked a claim to the hand-drawn house that served as the Bottom Line logo.
"It was tit for tat is all it was," Mr. Scalera said this week in an interview as he sat behind his bow-front desk in City Hall looking relaxed in a brown turtleneck sweater. "She had a full slate of Democratic candidates to run against the city Democratic candidates. That's the most divisive tactic they ever could have used."
Ms. Mussmann sees things differently. "Any Democrat in America can run in a primary," she said. "That is what is so galling about Scalera and his Democrats: they feel they own the party.
In the end, Ms. Mussmann lost the Democratic primary by seven votes, but the committee people she had backed prevailed and took control of Hudson's Democratic Party. At the first meeting of business at the end of September, the committee voted to make Ms. Mussmann its chairwoman. 
Ms. Mussmann is still fighting Mr. Scalera's move to snag the Bottom Line designation in federal court. But in the meantime, she has registered a new party name, the Fair Deal, for her mayoral run in November. "People are pretty riled," she said. "Everyone knew I had run on that line. It was common thievery, and he sort of gloated that that's what he did."
She was particularly peeved, she said, by Mr. Scalera's co-opting of the Bottom Line logo, which her partner, Claudia Bruce, had drawn.
"I mean draw your own house, man," Ms. Mussmann said as she steered her red pickup truck through the city's streets, a patchwork of restored mansions and tattered two-family houses.
Residents and business owners in Hudson are abuzz over the many twists in the race. But more than a few are growing weary of the tactics.
"I don't think it was a very gentlemanly thing to do," said J. Edward Murphy Jr., a Hudson dentist, of Mr. Scalera's appropriation of the Bottom Line name. "There's a certain lack of maturity to the way the race has been conducted. People here are not the brightest people in the world, but they are not idiots."
Against the backdrop of political machinations is a real issue facing the city: whether to resist or support a proposal for a giant cement plant. Mr. Scalera is for it; Ms. Mussmann is against it. Many blue-collar residents favor the plant and the economic boost it could give the city, while more recent and affluent arrivals tend to denounce the air pollution and visual blight they foresee. 
Not everyone is planning to cast a vote according to their views on the plant, however. More than anything, the race seems to have thrown into relief the tensions between old Hudson and new Hudson.
Elizabeth Tompkins, a Hudson-born sales clerk, opposes the plant but is set to vote for Mr. Scalera. "I can't see her doing anything for the city, at least not for the working-class people," she said of Ms. Mussmann. "She'll be good for the antiques dealers and all the rest of them here."
Ms. Mussmann bristles at the assessment, pointing out that she lives on the side of town that is "not gentrified," with people who are "Bangladeshi, black, Hispanic, straight, gay." Through her theater, Time & Space Limited, she has reached out to low-income residents. "I don't represent wealthy New Yorkers or one group of people," she said. 
Yet both candidates express sadness over not always being welcomed by the "other" Hudson. "There's always this feeling that if you don't have someone buried in the cemetery here then you don't have a right to speak out," Ms. Mussmann said, still looking every bit the downtown New Yorker in rimless glasses and a sage-green shirt.
Mr. Scalera says he also feels alienated -- from Hudson's newcomers.
"When people come to town, they're given a stump speech: 'He's the unfairest, meanest, most back-door,' " Mayor Scalera said, his voice trailing off. "I'm not one of them is what it amounts to."

HEADLINE: As Garbage, and Smell, Rise in Chicago, Striking Trash Haulers Reject a Raise Offer 

BYLINE:  By JO NAPOLITANO 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 5 

 BODY:
A group of private waste haulers and striking workers failed to agree Sunday on a new contract, assuring millions of Chicagoans and suburbanites that they would have to endure a fifth day of mounting heaps of refuse and the stench from overstuffed trash bins.
 The garbage haulers overwhelmingly rejected what the management described as its "best and final" wage and benefit increase, voting 2,210 to 191 against the offer. 
 A spokesman for the union representing the workers, who belong to Teamsters Locals 731 and 301, said it wanted to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, perhaps with a federal mediator. Telephone calls to the Chicago Area Refuse Haulers Association, the agency representing the 17 companies involved in the dispute, were not returned on Sunday evening. But a spokesman said on Saturday that negotiations had gone on longer than anyone had anticipated and that he was not sure of the next step. 
The companies that are part of the association collect garbage at most of the high-rise residential and commercial buildings in Chicago and its suburbs.
"We had hoped that both sides would have come to an agreement by now and have tried to be patient so they can work out those issues," said the city commissioner of streets and sanitation, Alfred Sanchez. "But our patience is starting to wear very thin." 
Concerned that the rapidly rising trash would attract rodents, city officials said they would add 25 garbage trucks to the usual 360 on Monday to pick up debris collecting in alleys. But they said that could not make up for the 3,300 union workers who have been on strike since Wednesday. 
The city's sanitation department is a separate service responsible for single homes and apartment buildings of three units or less, among other jobs.
City officials are asking residentsto make sure perishable items are double-bagged and stored inside sealed bins.
The Teamsters said the management offer of an additional $1.35 an hour for the first year and $1.20 an hour for each of the next four years was not enough to keep pace with rising health care costs and inflation. The haulers' hourly rate is now $10 to $21. 
Many Chicago residents seemed sympathetic to the garbage workers' cause.
"If this is what they think they need to do, I'll live," said Michael Schneider, a 54-year-old lawyer living in the Old Town section. 
But with the stench starting to rise along with the garbage, some residents and businesspeople were not as calm as Mr. Schneider.
Matt Parsons, general manager of the Grand Lux Cafe, a restaurant downtown on Michigan Avenue, said the situation had quickly reached a crisis for his business.
Mr. Parsons said the restaurant usually washed its loading docks twice a week, taking extra care that no trash fell outside the bins. But four days into the strike, hundreds of trash bags have created a 10-foot hill that has buried the bins and is leaking a foul-smelling fluid.
The trash has made it hard for delivery trucks to enter.
"By Wednesday, we're going to be in a very tough spot, operationally," Mr. Parsons said.
Some garbage haulers said they, too, were surprised that the strike had gone on so long.
Susan Travis, a 41-year-old trash hauler, said she was eager to get back to work.
"I'm tired of walking in the picket lines," Ms. Travis said. "I need to make money for myself, my family, my bills. The kids need money for school clothes. We want fair wages, but on the other hand, we want to go to work."
Rick Hnat, 41, who has worked as a trash hauler for 18 years, said he voted against the offer because he did not think it was fair.
Still, Mr. Hnat said he sympathized with residents who were watching their trash cans overflow.
"My garbage isn't being picked up either," he said.

HEADLINE: The Looming Shrimp War 

 BODY:
The nasty catfish war with Vietnam has tempted American shrimpers to engage in some trade mischief of their own. Using spurious allegations of unfair trade practices, American catfish farmers have been able to hoodwink the federal government into slapping tariffs of up to 64 percent on Vietnamese catfish. A group of shrimpers from eight Southern states is now preparing to file a claim requesting a similar tax on imported shrimp. 
 Americans believe in the free trade game until they start losing at it. Then we accuse the other side of cheating. That is the message these baseless dumping cases send to the rest of the world. It is understandable for people to seek protection when their livelihoods are adversely affected by trade. But as a nation that benefits from freer trade, the United States cannot afford to continue encouraging these cases. They antagonize poor farmers and laborers around the world who discover that the world's superpower does not really believe in what it preaches. 
 Trade laws allow domestic industries to seek protection to keep imports from being "dumped" into the United States, either below their cost of production or below their price in their countries of origin. True dumping should not be tolerated, but these claims are judged by Commerce Department officials, who tend to be highly solicitous of domestic lobbies. Vietnam is an enticing target for such cases. It is also the second-largest exporter of shrimp to the United States. Because Vietnam is considered a "nonmarket economy," the department is free to ignore actual production costs and determine what they theoretically ought to be, making it even easier to establish that imports are being dumped. 
The good news for Vietnam, and American consumers, is that this time, in contrast with the catfish wars, it will have powerful allies. The Southern Shrimp Alliance will also be doing battle with other major shrimp exporters, like Brazil and Thailand. These countries' sophisticated shrimp farms can get products to market at a lower cost than American trawlers can, and since both Brazil and Thailand are classified as market economies, the Commerce Department cannot engage in accounting shenanigans to fudge reality. 
Sales of shrimp by American fishermen have been flat for some time while imports have surged, accounting now for more than 80 percent of the market. Plummeting prices have allowed shrimp, once an expensive delicacy, to rival tuna as the most popular seafood in the United States. If a case is filed, seafood importers will side with the foreign defendants on behalf of consumers, arguing that this is not a case of dumping but a textbook example of the theory of comparative advantage.
The government should heed this argument, and avoid further erosion of America's reputation as a fair trader. For their part, American shrimpers should rethink their decision to pursue what amounts to a groundless case. They would do better to focus on becoming more competitive, or to lobby for some transitional aid for fishermen whose livelihoods are threatened.

The Daily Internet Habit

 BODY:
The Internet is becoming a part of daily life for an increasing number of Americans. Each day in the United States, 39 percent of heads of house-holds log on to the Internet, according to the most recent quarterly consumer survey that the Conference Board, a nonprofit economic research organization, conducted with the research firms NFO WorldGroup and Forrester Research. 
 The daily use figure taken from the third quarter is up from 35 percent in last year's third-quarter survey. Meanwhile, the number of heads of households who say they have never been online continues to dwindle -- 31 percent in the third quarter, compared with 33 percent a year earlier and 35 percent at the end of 2001. 
 Personal communication in the form of e-mail and instant messaging continues to be the primary reason that more than a third of those Internet users log on. But that use is slipping, while others like work-related activities and conducting financial transactions gain ground.

Trying to Sell CD's by Adding Extras

BYLINE:  By CHRIS NELSON 

 BODY:
For a glimpse into the troubled nature of the music industry in the 21st century, just conduct the following experiment: Ask five people who buy the new P.O.D. album, "Payable on Death," what persuaded them to make the purchase. Chances are, you will get five different answers.
 There is the person who buys it for the hard-rock music P.O.D. performs. But then there is the consumer who picks it up for the PlayStation 2 game that comes included on a DVD. Or the one who wants it for the trading cards packed in the cover. Another P.O.D. fan is after the documentary about the band, also on the DVD. And the last wants the CD because it offers access to unreleased P.O.D. music online. 
 Bundling a album with a raft of value-added extras -- while charging just a dollar more than the standard price for a CD -- may sound like a costly move for P.O.D.'s label, Atlantic Records, part of AOL Time Warner. But it is a testament to just how desperate music companies are to stoke consumer interest and reverse a three-year sales slump by pulling fans away from making free downloads of music from Internet file-trading sites.
While the P.O.D. album, scheduled for release Nov. 4, is unusual in the amount of extra material it will carry, it is just one album in a flood of new CD's promising extras. Recent discs from artists representing a broad cross section of genres -- from R.&B. diva Mary J. Blige to singer-songwriter Elvis Costello to punk band Pennywise -- have come with extra material. 
At the same time, retailers -- who have not been nearly as vocal about the downturn as labels -- are struggling to entice store traffic. Some shops, particularly independents, now invite their customers to lounge as if they were at a Barnes & Noble or Starbucks, and promise employees who know more than just the difference between the White Stripes and Whitesnake.
The newfound zeal to include extras on music CD's might just be working. On the latest weekly Billboard 200 album chart, the top six spots are held by albums making their first appearance on the chart. All of those artists -- OutKast, Dave Matthews, Limp Bizkit, R. Kelly, Obie Trice and Nickelback -- include some type of bonus with their albums: an EP of extra songs, access to online content, a chance to meet the musician or two CD's for the price of one.
Total sales for the week ending Sept. 28, reached 12.48 million units, according to Nielsen SoundScan, besting sales for the same week in 2002 by nearly 1.75 million. That is a rare bright post for the industry, which experienced a 17.3 percent drop in album sales from 2000 to 2002, down to 650 million units.
They have fallen another 7.4 percent in the first nine months of 2003, compared with the same period last year. The industry points to illegal downloading, competition from other entertainment and the weak economy to explain the decline. Critics of the industry say high CD prices and mediocre music are also a reason.
Despite labels' new emphasis on value-adds, no one is predicting that the record industry will go the way of bubble-gum makers, who once offered trading cards as an added value to gum only to have the cards become their primary business.
"In this extraordinary week, when you really tear it apart and look at it, the music is what wins," said Jordan Katz, the senior vice president for sales at Bertelsmann's Arista Records label. Arista discounted OutKast's two-CD set "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below," to $18.98 to compete with single albums. It sold 510,000 copies and landed at No.1 on Billboard's chart. 
The bevy of bonuses continues even as Vivendi Universal's Universal Music Group, the world's largest record company, put into effect plans to slash CD prices up to 30 percent on coming releases. 
Labels will survive the downturn better by emphasizing value with add-ons rather than stressing price as consumers' main consideration, said Peter Fader, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
But some music industry executives say price cuts are necessary. "We would not be reducing the price of music if we were not fighting" free music, that is, popular file-sharing services like Kazaa and Morpheus, said Jim Urie, the president of Universal Music and Video Distribution.
 The onus for drawing customers into stores falls equally on retailers, said Jerry Goolsby, a marketing professor who studies the music industry at Loyola University in New Orleans. Music stores must reinvent themselves, just as bookstores have recast themselves as coffeehouses and meeting places, he said.
Beyond switching from selling vinyl albums to CD's and outfitting their stores with listening stations, national retail chains have done little to revamp the way listeners experience music in stores.
"The record merchant is caught in an absolutely horrible place," said Paco Underhill, the chief executive of Envirosell, a market research and consulting firm. "There are few other industries where the merchant has so little leverage over the form and content, much less the packaging, of what arrives at his place of business."
With little control over their wares, some music stores are attempting to change the nature of the record-buying experience.
Seattle's independent new and used music chain Sonic Boom Records has succeeded during the slump by appealing to locals with, among other things, a staff that loves to discuss music with customers, said Julie Butterfield, general manager of the store in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Several times a year, the company is the host of Sonic Boom Band Night at a nearby tavern, showcasing employees who perform their own music.
"It's community and the spirit of community that I think brings people back in," Ms. Butterfield said. 
In the past year, Sonic Boom has had some of its biggest sales months since opening in 1995, and last March it opened a third store.
Labels, meanwhile, are trying to put music in front of as many customers as possible. Warner Music Group has beefed up TV advertising for albums by baby-boomer favorites like Cher and the Eagles. At the same time, the company is selling products at unconventional markets. It has offered Josh Groban CD's in Hallmark stores and Frank Sinatra discs in Ritz-Carlton hotels.
Enticing customers is even more difficult when the music industry's main physical product, the CD, has become increasingly unimportant, particularly to young people who have grown up with music as digital computer files. "My 17-year-old daughter loses the jewel boxes as fast as she can," said John Esposito, president of WEA, AOL Time Warner's music distribution arm, referring to the plastic cases that hold CD's. 
While value-added material is intended in part to lure people away from free file-sharing services, extra songs available through bonus CD's or password-protected Web sites are often made available through file-sharing programs nearly simultaneous to an album's release. 
Nonetheless, the experimentation with add-ons will continue. "Our job is not to perpetuate history," Mr. Esposito said. "It's to find out what the new history is."

HEADLINE: Sports Fan Is the Prize, Or the Victim,In Cable Fight 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Miami and West Virginia were tied 10-10 in the third quarter of their college football game Thursday night, and many eyes in the crowd at the Draft House Sports Cafe in Phoenix were trained on a big television set tuned to ESPN, the only channel showing the game.
 Most were blissfully unaware of a business dispute that is threatening to keep many televised sports events from fans in Phoenix, as well as in San Diego, New Orleans, Cleveland and other cities served by Cox Cable, the fourth-largest cable company in the country. 
 Cox is heading for a showdown with both ESPN and its programming rival, the Fox Sports regional networks. For years, ESPN and Fox Sports have infuriated cable operators by negotiating stiff increases in the fees paid to carry their networks. Last week, James O. Robbins, chief executive of Cox, stunned a Goldman Sachs investors conference by declaring publicly that his company would not meet the latest demands made during talks to renew its contracts to carry several ESPN channels and the Fox Sports networks. 
Many analysts interpreted his comments as a threat to drop the channels from Cox's service -- which reaches 6.3 million homes -- for some period of time if the two sides cannot come to terms.
It isan alarming prospect for hard-core fans like Kelli Wilson, manager of the Draft House, which relies on Cox Cable's sports programming. "That would stink," she said, in a telephone interview midway through the Miami-West Virginia game. "It would cause a lot of problems for a lot of people, and it would be devastating to anyone in the sports industry."
But Mr. Robbins's attacks on ESPN and Fox Sports are only one skirmish in a battle playing out in the television business. Cable systems are clashing with sports programmers around the country, whether it is the fight between Cablevision and the YES Network that kept New York Yankees games off the air in much of the metropolitan area last year or feuds this spring between Fox Sports and Time Warner Cable in Minnesota and Orlando. 
With few new customers signing up for their basic service, cable companies -- and especially the new industry giant Comcast -- are pushing to hold down the fees they pay for programming, and the sports channels are by far the most expensive on cable.
Yet the parent company of Fox Sports, the News Corporation, and ESPN's parent, the Walt Disney Company, each count on the sports networks as a pivotal source of financial growth. Derek Baine, a sports programming analyst at Kagan World Media, a consulting company, estimated that ESPN accounted for 15.5 percent of Disney's $3.75 billion cash flow last year.
And both companies carry weighty cudgels to the bargaining table, including the singular and irreplaceable appeal of the sports events they control, Disney's ability to withhold cable transmission of its ABC television stations in certain markets, and News Corporation's pending acquisition of control of the satellite service DirecTV.
If disgruntled sports fans defect from Cox, they might subscribe to DirecTV instead -- a silver lining for the News Corporation. Still, Cox executives and other cable operators say they are emboldened by the example of Cablevision, which said it lost only 50,000 of its 3 million subscribers in the year it did not broadcast the Yankees.
Cable customers, meanwhile, complain that their monthly fees are soaring. Basic cable charges have risen 7 percent a year for the last five years, three times the rate of inflation, driven in part by the cost of sports programming. In reaction, Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona, recently denounced the cable industry's "apparent willingness and ability to gouge the American consumer."
Analysts said Mr. Robbins's unusual display of belligerence at the clubby Wall Street conference appeared to be intended to open a public relations battle by focusing on the fee increases for sports programming should a deadlock keep the channels off the air. Negotiations between cable companies and programmers are usually confidential, but Mr. Robbins told the analysts at the conference that ESPN wanted a 20 percent annual increase in its fees from Cox, while Fox Sports proposed a 35 percent increase next year.
Cox, he said, pays ESPN $2.61 a month for each subscriber, more than the cost of the seven top-rated ad-supported networks combined. He said ESPN accounted for 4 percent of its customers viewing, but 18 percent of its programming costs. In Phoenix, where Fox Sports operates a regional sports channel, Fox Sports and ESPN together make up 8 percent of viewing and 32 percent of programming costs, he said.
Mr. Robbins said the solution was to allow cable operators to tier sports networks -- offering the channels as an extra package at an additional cost to basic cable, just as Cablevision offersthe YES Network and other regional sports channels as a premium package in New York.
"We simply are not going to be able to swallow that percentage increase," he said. "We don't know where this train is going to end up."
But removing Fox Sports and ESPN from basic cable packages would reduce the channels' audiences and cut advertising revenue.
Speaking at the same Goldman Sachs conference a few hours later, Peter Chernin, president and chief operating officer of the News Corporation, flatly contradicted Mr. Robbins. "That 35 percent is just not true," Mr. Chernin said, adding that the idea of tiering was "a nonstarter."
Speaking in the afternoon, Robert A. Iger, president and chief operating officer of Disney, called Mr. Robbins's comments "comic relief," adding that the emphasis on ESPN's cost belied its value to cable operators in attracting subscribers and selling local advertising.
After the conference, a News Corporation executive described the 35 percent fee increase as merely a starting bid in haggling over a new contract to pick up when the current agreement expires at the end of the year. But if Cox did take the Fox Sports networks off the air, the executive warned, Cox would end up losing subscribers to DirecTV -- a preview of how gaining a major interest in DirecTV could strengthen Fox's hand with cable operators.
ESPN's contracts with Cox are set to expire at the end of the first quarter of 2004. Asked in a telephone interview Friday, Sean Bratches, ESPN's executive vice president for affiliate sales and marketing, said Mr. Robbins's figures about ESPN's ratings or viewership understated its importance to die-hard sports fans, a mostly male audience that is valuable to advertisers because it is hard to reach. ESPN is often the reason they subscribe to cable, he asserted, and he pointed to a survey of cable operators suggesting that the network was more valuable than other networks. 
"Our value is being positioned publicly in a very myopic and self-serving way," Mr. Bratches said. He said there was a "distinct possibility" that ESPN could be dropped by Cox Cable for a time. "We think it would be a great disservice to Cox subscribers," he added, "and we are very confident that our fans would find access to our service through other means."
He acknowledged that those other means entailed switching to a satellite service. If ESPN went off Cox Cable, he added later through a spokeswoman, "it would hurt Cox more than ESPN, because ESPN is a bigger part of Cox's business than Cox is of ESPN's. And satellite would be the big winner."
One thing is for sure: sports fans will look for someone to blame.
"It would be terrible" to be without the sports networks, Eric Dahrling, manager of Yogi's Sports Bar in San Diego, said Thursday night, watching Miami beat West Virginia 22-20 with a 23-yard field goal with 11 seconds to play.

HEADLINE: No. 2 State Dept. Official Visits Afghan Region of New Attacks 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Oct. 5 

 BODY:
Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage flew into the troubled southern province of Kandahar on Sunday to meet with regional officials on the first leg of a visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan that centered on the continuing war against a resurgent Taliban and members of Al Qaeda.
 Nearly two years after their defeat in Afghanistan, suspected Taliban and Qaeda forces are threatening the stability of the government of President Hamid Karzai and stalling reconstruction efforts. 
 Mr. Armitage brought a message of continued American support. He came here to the capital after his stop in Kandahar and told journalists after meeting with Mr. Karzai and his foreign minister that the United States would spend $2 billion this year on Afghanistan if, as he expects, Congress approved a supplementary aid package of $1.2 billion. 
Mr. Karzai, speaking Sunday in a taped interview with the BBC, said, "It is very frustrating to see our country is still being attacked, people attacking girls' schools, killing people on the highways." 
In the Kandahar area alone, there have been three serious attacks and 14 people killed by suspected Taliban insurgents in the last four days. Two Afghan soldiers were killed and three were wounded in an attack in neighboring Helmand Province on Saturday night. In addition, six Afghan mine removers were rounded up by fighters whose commanders ordered their execution, though they escaped with one wounded. Ten Afghan soldiers and two children were killed in an ambush by suspected Taliban forces in northern Kandahar Province last Wednesday night.
Mr. Armitage, suffering from a sore throat that had delayed his visit, said, "Militarily, economically, politically, culturally and socially -- assuming the agreement of the government of Afghanistan and of the people of Afghanistan -- the United States is going to remain involved." 
A large part of the new money will be spent on training members of the new Afghan Army and on a new program to train 19,000 police officers in the region.

HEADLINE: In Putin's Words: Win Iraq's 'Sympathies' 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 5 

 BODY:
 Following are remarks by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from an interview on Saturday, as transcribed and translated by The New York Times. A more complete version of his remarks is online at nytimes.com/world.

I. On the need for an international mandate for the American-led occupation of Iraq:

MR. PUTIN -- We think that Iraq's problems can be efficiently solved only with involvement of the Iraqi people themselves. This task has to be solved with their participation and by their hands. But so that it would be efficient they have to believe in our serious intentions, in our desire to restore sovereignty. This is why we think that the U.N.'s role has to be increased -- not because we would like to diminish the significance of the United States, but in order to change the situation in Iraq itself.
 Make it clear for the Iraqi people that the situation is changing qualitatively. As of today, according to international law, the forces of the coalition are called the occupying ones. This corresponds to the fundamental documents of international law. Of course, how would the local population treat forces whose official name is the occupying forces? We need to change the status of these forces. We have to win the sympathies of the Iraqis. We have to get on our side the Muslim and Arab countries, whose mood toward a solution of the problem is very important.

II. -- On Russia's plans to continue building a civilian nuclear reactor in Iran, despite protests by the Bush administration:

A. -- We are not only hearing what our U.S. partners are telling us, we are listening to what they have to say, and we are finding that some of their assertions are justified. For example, their professional observation that spent fuel can subsequently be enriched and used as a component of nuclear arms. Our specialists also think so, and confirm this. That is why we have put the question before our Iranian colleagues that spent Russian nuclear fuel must be returned to Russia and now we are seeking to introduce such stipulations in our agreements. We also believe, as our American colleagues and partners believe, that Iran has no justification not to allow the overview of the I.A.E.A. over their nuclear programs, and therefore in this area again our positions fully coincide with that of the Americans. But this does not imply that without agreeing upon the principles of our cooperation in this sphere we're going to suspend all of our programs.

III. -- On criticismsthat the growing role of security services signaled a retreat from reforms:

A. -- We remember, and we are obligated to remember, everything negative, everything horrible that we encountered in the 20th century. We should draw conclusions from this. We have paid a very great price for this. Millions of people died in the camps. The totalitarian regime brought the country to a national catastrophe and to the collapse of the Soviet Union. And we are fully aware of this, and the people of Russia have drawn conclusions for themselves. We firmly stand on the path of development of democracy, of a market economy. Even if someone wanted it to, it is impossible for the country to make a U-turn.

IV. -- On elections in Chechnya, which were held on Sunday, and the prospects for a political settlement of the conflict there:

A. -- We have been talking with you today about a time frame for moving toward a normal situation in Iraq. We think it is necessary to have a transitional period there, to give it some time to prepare all the necessary structures for elections to be held there. It is a different situation in Chechnya. It is an internal problem of Russia.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA RECALL: THE GOVERNOR; 
Davis Calls on Unions to Help Defeat Recall

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 5 

 BODY:
In a last-ditch effort to rouse opponents of the California recall, Gov. Gray Davis on Sunday turned to one of his most consistent sources of support during three decades of public life, organized labor, and implored workers to turn out in droves on Tuesday to save his governorship.
 In a highly partisan speech frequently interrupted by cheers of approval, Mr. Davis told several hundred union members that the election hung in the balance. He warned of hard times for working people if he was removed from office and the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, became governor. 
 "Somebody in this state has got to stand up to George Bush," Mr. Davis said. "We have a big moment in front of us. It will shape the future of this state for a long time to come."
In a rare reference to other candidates vying for his job, Mr. Davis singled out three for praise: Lt. Gov. Cruz M. Bustamante, a Democrat; the Green Party candidate, Peter Camejo; and Arianna Huffington, the independent who dropped out of the race last week. But he warned that none of them had a chance against Mr. Schwarzenegger.
"Let's face it," Mr. Davis said. "This race has boiled down to a two-person race. Either you are going to vote no on the recall, and retain the governor you elected last November, or you are going to get Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor and I don't think you want to go down that road."
"No! No! No!" came shouts from the audience, one of the liveliest to greet Mr. Davis on a three-day statewide plane tour leading up to the recall election on Tuesday.
Mr. Davis made a brief reference to recent accusations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Schwarzenegger, but largely allowed other speakers to take up the Democratic drumbeat on that issue. Speaking to reporters before entering the union hall for the South Bay A.F.L.-C.I.O. Labor Council, Mr. Davis suggested that the accusations raised questions about Mr. Schwarzenegger's ability to govern.
"Mr. Schwarzenegger needs to address these charges in detail, not in evasive language and partial denials," he said. "Californians should be left with one question: are all these women and their families lying or is Mr. Schwarzenegger not telling the truth?"
The Davis camp will begin broadcasting a new television commercial on Monday that features Senator Dianne Feinstein. The commercial does not accuse Mr. Schwarzenegger of any wrongdoing or even mention the nature of the claims against him. But it suggests they are serious.
"This recall is turning around," Mrs. Feinstein says in the advertisement. "People are beginning to see how unfair it is, and how harmful it is to California's economy and to our people. And in recent days serious allegations have surfaced with respect to the governor's opponent. We should all give this serious consideration. This governor was fairly elected -- he does not deserve to be recalled."
Mr. Davis was joined at the rally here by a large number of Democratic officials, including State Attorney General Bill Lockyer. Speaking with reporters, Mr. Lockyer called upon Mr. Schwarzenegger to voluntarily submit to an investigation of the sexual misconduct accusations, particularly those published in the past few days in The Los Angeles Times. The newspaper wrote about 15 women who had claimed that Mr. Schwarzenegger groped them or sexually humiliated them.
Mr. Lockyer said it would be difficult to conduct an investigation without the actor's cooperation because none of the accusers had filed charges and the statute of limitations would apply.
"This time of year, sometimes everything goes through the lens of what's political," Mr. Lockyer said, "and those that want to believe their candidate is virtuous tend to just disbelieve any charges, but there are too many of them. And it just seems to me somebody ought to do an adequate investigation."
Mr. Lockyer is a Democrat who has described himself as a friend of Mr. Schwarzenegger's and who in past elections has criticized Mr. Davis's campaign tactics. Mr. Lockyer said his office had spent more than $1 million investigating claims against the Davis administration in the last five years, with no criminal charges resulting.
In keeping with the day's theme of working people, Mr. Davis appeared on Sunday morning at a bill-signing ceremony for legislation, which was strongly supported by organized labor, requiring employers to help provide health care coverage to about one million California workers who are currently uninsured. 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke before Mr. Davis, criticizing the recall. "We had an election last year," Mr. Jackson said. "To elect a governor every four years is enough."

HEADLINE: White House to Overhaul Iraq and Afghan Missions 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 

 BODY:
The White House has ordered a major reorganization of American efforts to quell violence in Iraq and Afghanistan and to speed the reconstruction of both countries, according to senior administration officials.
 The new effort includes the creation of an "Iraq Stabilization Group," which will be run by the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. The decision to create the new group, five months after Mr. Bush declared the end of active combat in Iraq, appears part of an effort to assert more direct White House control over how Washington coordinates its efforts to fight terrorism, develop political structures and encourage economic development in the two countries. 
 It comes at a time when surveys show Americans are less confident of Mr. Bush's foreign policy skills than at any time since the terrorist attacks two years ago. At the same time, Congress is using President Bush's request for $87 billion to question the administration's failure to anticipate the violence in Iraq and the obstacles to reconstruction.
"This puts accountability right into the White House," a senior administration official said.
The reorganization was described in a confidential memorandum that Ms. Rice sent Thursday to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, and the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet.
Asked about the memorandum on Sunday, Ms. Rice called it "a recognition by everyone that we are in a different phase now" that Congress is considering Mr. Bush's request for $20 billion for reconstruction and $67 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. She said it was devised by herself, Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Powell and Mr. Rumsfeld in response to discussions she held with Mr. Bush at his ranch in late August.
The creation of the group, according to several administration officials, grew out of Mr. Bush's frustration at the setbacks in Iraq and the absence of more visible progress in Afghanistan, at a moment when remnants of the Taliban appear to be newly active. It is the closest the White House has come to an admission that its plans for reconstruction in those countries have proved insufficient, and that it was unprepared for the guerrilla-style attacks that have become more frequent in Iraq. There have been more American deaths in Iraq since the end of active combat than during the six weeks it took to take control of the country.
"The president knows his legacy, and maybe his re-election, depends on getting this right," another administration official said. "This is as close as anyone will come to acknowledging that it's not working."
Inside the State Department and in some offices in the White House, the decision to create the stabilization group has been interpreted as a direct effort to diminish the authority of the Pentagon and Mr. Rumsfeld in the next phase of the occupation. Senior White House officials denied that was the case, and said in interviews on Sunday that the idea had been created by members of the National Security Council and embraced by Mr. Rumsfeld, who has been a lightning rod for criticism about poor postwar planning.
"Don recognizes this is not what the Pentagon does best, and he is, in some ways, relieved to give up some of the authority here," a senior official insisted, noting that L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the allied provisional authority in Iraq, will still report to the Defense Department. But one of Mr. Bremer's key deputies will sit on the new stabilization group, giving him a direct line outside the Pentagon.
Mr. Rumsfeld's spokesman, Lawrence Di Rita, said Sunday that the defense secretary was "aware of the new approach" and noted that Mr. Bremer's "relationship with Rumsfeld remains unchanged."
If Mr. Rumsfeld is giving up some authority, officials say, so is Mr. Powell. The State Department has been in charge of the Afghan reconstruction effort, but now the White House will assert new control over the interagency effort there. 
"While the problems in Afghanistan are less complex," a senior official said, "the president wanted to know how come it took so long to get the highway under construction." That project has become symbolic of the slow pace of reconstruction, especially outside the capital.
The creation of the stabilization group appears to give more direct control to Ms. Rice, one of the president's closest confidantes, who signed the memorandum announcing it. For the first two and a half years of Mr. Bush's presidency, Ms. Rice often seemed hesitant to take a more active role, eschewing the kind of hands-on approach for which Henry A. Kissinger and other national security advisers were known, and viewing her job chiefly as providing quiet advice to Mr. Bush. 
Now, four of her deputies will run coordinating committees -- on counterterrorism efforts, economic development, political affairs in Iraq and the creation of clearer messages to the media here and in Baghdad. 
Each working group will include under secretaries from the State, Defense and Treasury Departments, and senior representatives from the Central Intelligence Agency.
State Department officials have complained bitterly that they have been shut out of decision-making about Iraq, even as attacks on American troops increased, lights failed and oil production remained stuck far below even prewar levels.
Mr. Bush, a senior administration official said, made it clear that he wanted "all the powers of the government" turned toward making the reconstruction work in both Iraq and Afghanistan. "The president is impatient withbureaucracy," the official said.
In the interview, Ms. Rice described the new organization as one intended to support the Pentagon, not supplant it.
"The N.S.C. staff is first and foremost the president's staff," she said, "but it is of course the staff to the National Security Council." That group will in effect be taking more direct responsibility.
The council is made up of top advisers to the president who meet three times a week in the Situation Room. They have often seemed unable to coordinate efforts on the main issues relating to the occupation of Iraq. "The Pentagon remains the lead agency, and the structure has been set up explicitly to provide assistance to the Defense Department and coalition provisional authority," Ms. Rice said. 
Other officials said the effect of Ms. Rice's memorandum would be to move day-to-day issues of administering Iraq to the White House. 
The counterterrorism group, for example, will be run by Frances F. Townsend, Ms. Rice's deputy for that field. Economic issues -- from oil to electricity to the distribution of a new currency -- will be coordinated by Gary Edson. He has been the liaison between the National Security Council and the National Economic Council. 
Robert D. Blackwill, a former ambassador to India, will run the group overseeing the creation of political institutions in Iraq, as well as directing stabilization for Afghanistan.
Anna Perez, Ms. Rice's communications director, will focus on a coordinated media message -- a response to concerns about the daily reports of attacks on American troops and lawlessness in the streets.

HEADLINE: Putin Says U.S. Faces Big Risks In Effort in Iraq 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Monday, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia says the United States now faces in Iraq the possibility of a prolonged, violent and ultimately futile war like the one that mired the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. 
 In an expansive interview on Saturday evening, Mr. Putin warned that Iraq could "become a new center, a new magnet for all destructive elements." He added, without naming them, that "a great number of members of different terrorist organizations" have been drawn into the country since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Excerpts, Page A8. 
 To respond to this emerging threat, he said, the Bush administration must move quickly to restore sovereignty to Iraqis and to secure a new United Nations resolution that would clearly define how long international forces remain there. 
"How would the local population treat forces whose official name is the occupying forces?" he asked, suggesting that further hostility to the United States was inevitable unless its occupation received the international legitimacy it now lacks.
Mr. Putin said for the first time that Russia was prepared to offer partial relief on the $8 billion it is owed by Iraq, but only in coordination with other major creditor nations in the Paris Club. The United States has been struggling to persuade its European allies to make significant contributions to the multibillion-dollar rebuilding of Iraq.
During an interview that lasted nearly three hours and ranged from Iraq to Russia's economic development to the state of democracy here, Mr. Putin repeatedly characterized Russia's relations with the United States, and his own with President Bush, as close and frank -- those of a partner, even, at times, an ally.
But at the same time, he was sharply critical of American complaints about Chechnya, of humiliating new visa requirements for Russians, of what he called lingering cold-war habits of mind, and of the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq, which he simply called "an error."
Mr. Hussein's government had, with reason, been called "a criminal one," Mr. Putin said, but he disputed one of the core reasons given by President Bush for attacking Iraq in March: the assertion that it had ties to international Islamic militancy and terrorism. Rather, he suggested that the invasion of Iraq had created a terrorist haven where one did not previously exist.
"It struggled against the fundamentalists," he said of Mr. Hussein's government. "He either exterminated them physically or put them in jail or just sent them into exile."
Now, he added, with Mr. Hussein ousted, "The coalition forces received two enemies at once -- both the remains of the Saddam regime, who fight with them, and those who Saddam himself had fought in the past -- the fundamentalists."
Mr. Putin did not identify the militants entering Iraq, but he said they came "from all the Muslim world." Those militants, he suggested, may now find themselves at ease in Iraq, as they once were among the Afghans, and the "danger exists" of a decade-long struggle like the one fought by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980's. Such fears, he added, "are not groundless."
Mr. Putin spoke at his wooded presidential compound in Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow, appearing relaxed but also fiercely concentrated. His growing understanding of English was on display in the not infrequent correction of an interpreter on his use of particular words. 
As he did during his recent trip to the United States, he seemed eager to present a softer, more congenial image -- perhaps in response to a flurry of advertisements, protests and newspaper columns suggesting that he was an autocrat bent on reversing Russia's democracy. Mr. Putin affectionately stroked his black Labrador, Koni, who bounded in -- seemingly on cue for the kinder-Russian-ruler campaign -- halfway through the interview.
Repeatedly, Mr. Putin used American analogies to drive home his points. Why, he asked, was his wide use of the Russian security services any different from the creation of the Department of Homeland Security? Why should terrorism in Chechnya provoke any lesser response here than America's if the same problems arose in Texas? Why should his former role as a K.G.B. agent prompt concern when the first President Bush was once head of the C.I.A.?
Turning to Iran, Mr. Putin said Russia had sought to address American concerns about its aid in the construction of a civilian nuclear reactor in Iran by insisting that Iran return any spent nuclear fuel -- a demand not yet ironed out in talks with Iran. Without identifying them, he complained that American and European companies also assisted Iran's nuclear ambitions but did not face sanctions, as some Russian companies had.
He made it clear that Russia reserved the right to complete Iran's reactor at Bushehr. But he also reiterated his call for Iranian leaders to accept expanded international inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities, saying they had no reason to object if they had nothing to hide. "We are not only hearing what our U.S. partners are telling us, we are listening to what they have to say," Mr. Putin said. "And we are finding that some of their assertions are justified."
On the conflict in Chechnya, an open sore in Russia's standing in the world, Mr. Putin portrayed the presidential election being held on Sunday as an important step toward a political settlement to end four years of conflict -- not unlike, he said, what was needed in Iraq. On Monday, the election commission chief in Chechnya, Abdul-Karim Arsakhanov, said the Kremlin's hand-picked candidate, Akhmad Kadyrov, had secured victory by gaining more than half the votes, the Interfax news agency reported. The election has been widely criticized as a farce.
Mr. Putin dismissed the criticism and bemoaned what he called an American double standard in which Islamic fighters in Chechnya were called democrats, while those in Afghanistan and Iraq were viewed as criminals. He also joked that when it came to elections, the United States had its own problems. "As yet you have not yet mastered well the situation in California," he said.
Mr. Bush was "courageous" for expressing support for Russian policies in Chechnya, he said, but he complained that other United States "agencies and ministries" were far less helpful -- a legacy, he said, of a cold-war mentality he also perceived in a recent American decision, now revoked, to send surveillance flights over the Black Sea. 
Mr. Putin spoke a week after a four-day trip to the United States that ended with an overnight stay with President Bush at Camp David. A qualitatively new relationship now exists between Russia and the United States -- one mature enough to withstand pointed criticism and frank advice, Mr. Putin said. "Our interests in the sphere of the fight against radicalism and terrorism coincide," he said.
But on Iraq, differences clearly remain. Mr. Putin ruled out, for now, sending Russian troops to help there and said that although a variety of international military contingents provided political support for America in Iraq, they were not much use in other respects because they "abuse alcohol," "begin to sell weapons" and only thought about "fleeing as soon as possible."
He declined to say which countries' soldiers he had in mind, but described the troops as "motley" rather than multinational. Several dozen nations have contributed to the America-led force in Iraq -- including Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Spain, Portugal and Mongolia -- usually with small contingents.
As to the postwar looting and chaos in Iraq, Mr. Putin said Russia had not been surprised by the collapse of Iraqi institutions. But, like the Bush administration, Russia believed before the war that unconventional weapons might be found. "The question is what has happened" to the weapons, he said.
Although Russia seeks a rapid return of sovereignty to Iraq, it would accept a dominant role for the American military in providing security, he said, as well as a gradual rather than a rapid transfer of actual power to the Iraqi authorities. Given the money it has spent and is spending there, America has to play a leading role in Iraq, he suggested.
This position -- calling for a greater United Nations role in Iraq but apparently acknowledging American primacy -- puts Russia at odds with some countries, like France, that have been more critical of the United States. Mr. Putin described the Russian position as "very pragmatic and flexible."
Asked if he believed that the United States now treated Russia as a junior partner, he offered a striking admission, saying he was "fully aware of what Russia is, what place it occupies in the world, what are our capabilities." At the same time, however, he said Russia "with all the problems it has" would not subsume its national interests to those of the United States or any other country.
Turning to the rift between the United States and its European allies, particularly France and Germany, Mr. Putin said the difficulties would be overcome. "We think that it is kind of a quarrel in a holy family -- and sooner or later it will heal," he said. "The less emotion expressed here the better."
He noted that the European Union accounted for half of Russia's trade and said it would have a "special level of relationship" with the union that stopped short, he emphasized, of becoming a member. Russia, he said, was intent on "setting up a unified economic and humanitarian space in Europe," one that ensured that "no new divisive lines" are established on the continent.
As for the state of democracy in Russia -- the state control of television, the harassment of some rights groups, the growing influence of former security agents, like himself -- he said different countries had different identities.
"But on the whole, the main principles of humanism -- human rights, freedom of speech -- remain fundamental for all countries, and Russia enjoys no right to claim any exclusive status in this area," he said.
He described tremendous progress since the collapse of the Soviet Union -- noting that it had taken centuries for democratic institutions to evolve in Western Europe and the United States. While the Inquisition in Europe ended centuries ago, Russia's own form of Inquisition ended barely a decade ago, he said.
The country, for all its problems, is following an irreversible trajectory toward democracy and a free market, he declared.
Russia would seek to spur foreign investment, including a possible deal involving ExxonMobil acquiring a stake in the Russian oil company, Yukos, he said, because "we favor foreign capital investment."
Mr. Putin alluded to Boris N. Yeltsin's decisive achievement in bringing freedom to Russia and suggested that his own mission was to consolidate his predecessor's by completing Russia's transition. "Even if someone wanted it to, it is impossible for the country to make a U-turn."

HEADLINE: When Pigs Stress Out 

BYLINE:  By ARMELLE CASAU

 BODY:
Half a century of selective breeding has had an unappetizing side effect for the nation's $40 billion-a-year pork industry.
 In what researchers say is a biochemical chain reaction sometimes caused by a stress syndrome inadvertently bred into many pigs, 10 to 15 percent of pork turns into sweating pale cuts of meat that ooze liquid in the packaging and become leathery when cooked. 
 The pork industry estimates that the problem costs $90 million a year in lost revenue. Now the losses have led to research to seek new ways to improve breeding and handling. 
Food scientists say the problem dates from the 1950's, when breeders started selecting pigs with increased mass of lean muscle. Those pigs, it turned out, also inherited a naturally occurring condition, porcine stress syndrome. 
As farmers bred faster-growing hogs with ultralarge, ultralean muscles that could compete as "the other white meat," they were inadvertently selecting for the syndrome, said Dr. Jodi Sterle, a swine specialist at Texas A&M University. 
Or as Dr. Temple Grandin, an expert in livestock handling at Colorado State University, put it, "If you breed for those superlean big-bubble butts, you tend to breed for a very nervous, excitable pig that's very hard to handle." 
A predisposition to stress is heightened when pigs are raised in unstimulating environments, Dr. Grandin said. Psychological stresses, including restraint and excessive handling, make matters worse. So do physical stresses, including electric prods and extremes of heat and cold.
When a pig is stressed, it can enter a hypermetabolic state that generates excessively high temperatures and low pH's. That damages muscle cells and can even lead to heart failure.
The metabolic meltdowns can result in malignant hyperthermia, or "hot death." If the metabolic storm hits right before slaughter, the damaged muscles do not have time to recover, and the meat becomes damaged, as well. 
Dr. Grandin is in the forefront of a wave of researchers who are changing breeding and handling. Widely known outside the world of livestock research because she is autistic, she said her condition had heightened her sensitivity to visual details and noise levels that cause stress in animals. 
To evaluate swine farms, she often seeks a pig's-eye view, walking on all fours to detect the distractions that create stressful pig traffic jams before slaughter.
In August, the National Pork Board started a voluntary program for producers to evaluate and improve the welfare of the 97 million hogs processed in the United States each year.
Companies like McDonald's, spurred in part by economic losses and in part by pressure from animal-rights groups, are seeking advice from Dr. Grandin and other experts in animal behavior.
Breeders have made a concerted effort to breed the stress syndrome out of commercial herds, said Darrell D. Anderson, chief executive officer of the National Swine Registry. 
Despite the initiatives, the incidence of inferior meat has remained nearly level. 
Researchers are now looking for genetic clues to the stress syndrome. Scientists have found that the syndrome is correlated with a mutation in a gene involved in muscle contractions. A variety of mutations in that gene have been found in people with a similar malignant hyperthermia syndrome. 
Dr. David J. Meisinger, assistant vice president for educational services at the pork board, and Dr. Marion L. Greaser, director of the Muscle Biology Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, suspect that similar undiscovered genetic variants could be present in hogs. That may explain why pigs that test negative for the stress mutation still generate stressed meat. 
Under stressors, the mutated gene, a calcium channel, leads to indiscriminate leaking of calcium in the muscle cells. That in turn leads to uncontrolled contractions of the skeletal muscles and to hypermetabolic states, said Dr. Thomas E. Nelson, a professor emeritus at Wake Forest University.
If the process continues, muscle tissues start breaking down, potassium leaks into the blood, and irregular heart rhythm can follow.
The antidote is dantrolene sodium, the muscle relaxant that works in humans and pigs by inactivating the leaky calcium channel. The calcium flow stops, the muscles relax, and the body cools down. 
Stress does not seem to set off malignant hyperthermia in people, but it does in pigs. Treating hogs with dantrolene, however, would leave drug residues in the meat.
The attack can sometimes resolve itself if the animal is allowed to rest. But if it is slaughtered soon after, the meat can be damaged. 
The low pH and high temperature cause the destruction of myosin, a muscle protein involved in contraction.
Because myosin holds water molecules, "when it's denatured, it lets go of the water" and the meat starts losing fluids, Dr. Greaser of Wisconsin said.
Nor is pork the sole meat affected by stress. The accelerated decline in pH after death can also occur in chicken and turkey. That generates an economic problem, as well, because the processed meat can crumble. 
Dr. Greaser said, "You don't want to sell your deli meat with a spoon."

HEADLINE: Africa's Betting Public Lures Foreign Investors 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
The world's poorest continent has long had a gambling itch. But with betting restrictions eased in some nations and with foreign investors and corporations beginning to capitalize on Africa's gambling market, more and more Africans are regarding the good life as just one scratch card, sports bet or roulette spin away.
 There are lottery lines in South Africa and crowded gaming tables in Kenya. In Eritrea, one of the continent's most destitute countries, little boys sell instant lottery tickets to keep from going hungry. 
 "Casinos give you hope," said George Wainaina, 36, a Kenyan who has lost just about everything he owns at the roulette wheel. "It's not much hope, but it may be more than you have outside."
Bulgarians are bankrolling a new lottery in Kenya, and Chinese businessmen recently revived Uganda's Lotto. An American company based in Rhode Island, Gtech Corporation,has joined with British, Australian and South African investors in the continent's fastest-growing sweepstakes of all, South Africa's National Lottery.
Gambling was severely restricted in South Africa during apartheid. But after the black-majority government liberalized the rules in 1996, dozens of casinos opened, and a booming lottery started. Players choose 6 numbers out of 49 and hope they match the ones generated by the Lotto Draw Machine -- a 1-in-14-million shot.
Since 2000, when President Thabo Mbeki inaugurated the lottery at a butcher shop in Cape Town, the game has grown by leaps and bounds, especially among the poor. A recent study indicated that 72 percent of South Africans now gamble; even 27 percent of unemployed South Africans try their luck.
Some countries in sub-Saharan Africa have had state-run lotteries since they gained independence in the 1960's. Others are only now turning to the industry as a form of economic growth.
Scientific Games, a New York company that produces scratch cards, has signed up nine African countries and is in negotiations with others. "The African market is a relatively small part of the world market, but it's growing," said Jim Trask, managing director of Scientific Games' international division, based in Britain.
Its scratch cards for Eritrea, in the local Tigrinya language, feature photographs of jaguars, buffalo, toucans and giraffes. Matching them up can turn an investment of five nakfas, less than 50 cents, into a small fortune.
In Keren, a rural town in central Eritrea, some boys as young as 9 make money no matter what. They walk the streets with long strips of tickets, each selling as many as 200 a day. Whether buyers win or lose, the boys can take home enough to make their mothers happy.
Gambling puts Africa's rich-poor divide on dramatic display. In Kenya, impoverished people who hit the jackpot are profiled in the newspapers, always with a photograph of the smiling winner holding an oversize check. A payoff of one million shillings, or about $13,000, is considered life changing.
Similar amounts, however, are won or lost in minutes by the high rollers at the casinos or at Big Bets, a new sports gambling den here in Kenya's capital.
"Kenyans are the gamblers of the future," said Alessandro Scarci, an Italian who runs Big Bets.
Mr. Scarci has about 60 regulars now, 10 of whom he considers high rollers. One, a pharmaceutical importer, already owes Mr. Scarci more than $100,000. He continues to gamble, using what he wins to try to pay off the debt.
"I do it for the thrill," he said, taking a break from watching a horse race on a big screen. "It relaxes me."
Frauds are frequent. Forgers in Kenya alter losing scratch cards so that they look like winners and then sell them on the streets. In South Africa, five men were arrested last year -- after frustrated losers turned them in -- for selling magic charms that were supposed to help people win the jackpot.
A Kenyan beer company, East African Breweries, is still trying to sort out what happened to its promotional lottery. It printed numbers inside the caps of its various bottled drinks, announced winning numbers and gave prizes to the holders of the matching caps. When the number 5774 won, more than 12,000 Kenyans showed up with caps bearing that number. The brewery called off the lottery and began and investigation. Some holders of 5774 caps have sued.
The average gambler is most interested in lottery tickets, especially the instant variety. The investment is small, but the dreams unleashed are big: a car, a home or farmland that stretches as far as the eye can see. Rarely, though, do the dreams come true.
The sellers dream, too. The countries of the Southern African Development Community, an economic bloc, are considering a regional lottery similar to the one already in place in West Africa. The African Association of State Lotteries has proposed a continentwide lottery that would offer an astronomical payoff, although language and political divisions make the success of such a venture a long shot.
Even though many Africans must get by on less than a dollar a day, they often scrape together enough coins to gamble.
"I have never won, but I still have high hopes," said Gathoka Njoroge, 62, a Kenyan house servant. He said he would like to own his own place and hire his own servant.
Monica Muthoni, 27, a secretary in Nairobi, sets aside at least $1 of her $19-a-week salary for the lottery. "Sometimes I forgo my lunch so I can buy a ticket to gamble," she said. "It's fun, you know, and I may end up becoming a millionaire."
There are few resources for those who become addicted. South Africa has a free hot line for problem gamblers, and an industry-funded group, the National Responsible Gambling Program, to study whether the country's gamblers are becoming obsessive. "Winners know when to stop" is the group's motto. The percentage of problem gamblers in the country is 4.6 percent, up from 3.8 percent two years ago, according to studies. 
That is not off the charts for countries where gambling is legal. But, as Peter D. Collins, the program's executive director and a professor at the University of Cape Town, put it, "There is a larger proportion of poor people here who, if they go too far, get into trouble very quickly."
Mr. Wainaina, the Kenyan roulette player, stays away from gaming tables these days, after losing his land and his wife. Unemployed, he still puts smallish bets on European soccer matches. "This isn't the best thing to do," he said. "I know I shouldn't be here. But I don't have anything better to do."
Gambling executives try to keep the emphasis on the positive, noting that losing tickets mean a lot of money for good causes, like poor schools and health clinics, as well as tax revenues for struggling governments.
"Our slogan is 'Everyone is a winner,' " said Jeffery C. Bamford, chief executive officer of the Kenya Charity Sweepstake, which sells seven varieties of scratch cards at 800 outlets across Kenya. "We push the message that even if you don't win a prize, someone is benefiting."

HEADLINE: Union Organizing Remains Muddled In Chrysler Pact 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
The Chrysler Group's new contract with the United Automobile Workers union, ratified by workers last month, fell short of one of the union's top goals: persuading DaimlerChrysler to recognize what are known as card checks to unionize American plants owned by the Mercedes division.
 The union has never successfully organized a plant owned solely by a foreign automaker, but it had hoped it might have an opportunity at Mercedes because the 1998 acquisition of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz put Mercedes and Chrysler under the same corporate umbrella. 
 There are considerable obstacles to organizing plants owned by foreign companies. Many are in the South, where sentiment often runs against unions and right-to-work laws mean workers do not have to automatically join unions even if their workplace is organized. 
Plants are normally organized by secret-ballot elections recognized by the National Labor Relations Board, but because they are often held at the plants, unions think they give employers something of a home court advantage. Unions think they have a better chance with card checks, in which the union gathers cards from employees designating that more than half of the work force wants to join. Companies are not obligated to recognize the process, but some agree to do so.
Soon after the U.A.W. and Chrysler reached a tentative agreement last month, a union summary of the contract provided to Chrysler workers and obtained by some news organizations said DaimlerChrysler had agreed to card checks at all of its plants in the United States and listed it as one of seven highlights of the contract talks. The 17-page summary added that DaimlerChrysler would send letters to employees saying "the company 'fully respects' the right of employees to form and join unions" -- essentially expressing neutrality instead of opposing organization. 
But Chrysler executives contend nothing in the contract covered Mercedes. Instead, the contract itself refers specifically to the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, which in the DaimlerChrysler corporate lexicon is a synonym for the Chrysler Group's operations in the United States, as opposed to DaimlerChrysler A.G., which is based in Stuttgart, Germany, and is the parent of both Chrysler and Mercedes.
Further confusing the union's summary was a statement that card checks had been a successful tactic for workers at Freightliner, a division of DaimlerChrysler A.G. 
"The contract refers to Chrysler Group manufacturing facilities in the United States," said Mike Aberlich, a spokesman for Chrysler, which has long been organized, except for some very small operations. 
The union's international leadership in Detroit has declined requests for comment on the highlighting of the card check agreement in the contract summary.
Obtaining a card check at Mercedes was billed as a priority by Nate Gooden, the U.A.W.'s top negotiator on the Chrysler contract. 
"Vance, Ala., will be a U.A.W. organized plant in the very near future," he told Reuters during the talks. 
When the contract talks were resolved quickly, with the union offering modest concessions at a tough time for the Big Three, the promise of a Vance deal appeared to be a concession from DaimlerChrysler. 
Soon after the summary was distributed, the contract was ratified by Chrysler workers, but in conversations over the last week with local union leaders there did not appear to be a clear understanding of the card check issue. 
"The corporation agreed to recognizing the hourly people if the majority of them do card check," said Larry Simmons, president of Local 7 in Detroit, which represents about 3,000 hourly Chrysler workers, referring to Mercedes.
"I think that was a big thing, because the U.A.W. has been trying to organize Mercedes Benz in Alabama for a long time." 
Jim Fisher, president of union local 1183 in Newark, Del., which represents about 2,200 workers, said "what they actually have with Mercedes is a neutrality agreement."
They won't do anything negative," he said, "to stop us from going in there and doing a card check."
Asked again whether there was an agreement for a Mercedes card check, he said: "They have a neutrality agreement. I can't comment on anything beyond that."
Leonard Barber, president of local 685 in Kokomo, Ind., said, "They just said we have a card check in any facility within the Chrysler Group."
Asked whether it extended to Mercedes, he said, "I'd refer you to the international on that."
Mr. Aberlich of Chrysler, said the deal also included no arrangement to fill 2,000 new jobs at the Mercedes plant, which is doubling its work force, with U.A.W. members from other states who needed jobs. 
Reports of such a plan had angered state officials.
"When Mercedes decided to locate here, the state offered incentives so that jobs would be created for Alabama workers," David Azbell, a spokesman for Gov. Bob Riley, said in an interview on Monday. "The state did not provide those incentives for out-of-state workers to get jobs."
Mr. Gooden could still get the card check and the job arrangement. The German corporate structure reserves seats on a company's supervisory board for union leaders, and he has one. But Chrysler has turned into a money loser for DaimlerChrysler, and management appears to be looking for cuts, not concessions.

HEADLINE: Lumps of Labor 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Economists call it the "lump of labor fallacy." It's the idea that there is a fixed amount of work to be done in the world, so any increase in the amount each worker can produce reduces the number of available jobs. (A famous example: those dire warnings in the 1950's that automation would lead to mass unemployment.) As the derisive name suggests, it's an idea economists view with contempt, yet the fallacy makes a comeback whenever the economy is sluggish.
 Sure enough, the lump-of-labor fallacy has resurfaced in the United States -- but with a twist. Traditionally, it is a fallacy of the economically naive left -- for example, four years ago France's Socialist government tried to create more jobs by reducing the length of the workweek. But in America today you're more likely to hear lump-of-labor arguments from the right, as an excuse for the Bush administration's policy failures. 
 The latest lump-of-labor revival came to my attention when I realized how eagerly certain commentators were picking up on a new study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In it, Erica Groshen and Simon Potter argue that the pattern of laying off workers during recessions and rehiring them during recoveries has changed: since 1990 employers have become much less likely to rehire former workers. It's an interesting study, and it might -- repeat, might -- shed some light on why businesses have added so few jobs during our so-called recovery.
But I was puzzled at first by the enthusiasm with which a relatively academic paper was seized upon by usually bullish, supposedly hardheaded business commentators. The puzzle vanished, however, when I read these remarks more carefully: they were mainly trying to make excuses for the administration's dismal job record. You see, they say, it's not that an economic policy consisting largely of tax cuts for the rich has failed to deliver. No, it's a structural problem with the economy, which just happens to have arisen now, and nobody could have done better.
Oh, well. But partisan politics aside, the growing lumpishness of American thinking about jobs is dangerous, in two ways.
First, it encourages fatalism -- if politicians and the public believe that new jobs can't be created, they will stop pressuring our leaders to find more effective policies. And that would be a shame, since the Bush administration has resolutely refused to try the policies most likely to improve the employment picture.
Since 2001, sensible economists have been pleading for federal aid to state and local governments so schoolteachers and police officers needn't be laid off because of a temporary fall in revenues. They've also urged the administration to stop dragging its heels on much-needed homeland security spending, not just because such spending is needed to make the country safer, but also because it would create jobs and put more income into the hands of Americans likely to spend it. (And if you're worried about spending's leading to increased deficits, why not cancel some of those long-run tax breaks for upper brackets?) Until we've done the obvious things, there's no reason to despair about job creation.
Second, lump-of-labor thinking -- and the policy paralysis it encourages -- feeds protectionism. If the public no longer believes that the economy can create new jobs, it will demand that we protect old jobs from new competitors in China and elsewhere. Economists can explain until they are blue in the face why limiting exports from developing countries would be a bad idea -- why keeping our markets open to new producers is in America's interest both economically and diplomatically. But theoretical arguments for free trade will count for little if the real-world experience of jobs lost to Chinese competition can't be offset by a credible promise that new jobs will be created to replace them.
History seems to be repeating itself: a similar rush to blame foreigners for U.S. problems happened during Bush I's jobless recovery (which looked like a hiring boom compared with recent experience). Remember the president's literally nauseating trip to Japan in the company of auto executives? But if the early 1990's flirtation with protectionism had the feeling of farce, today's employment stagnation -- and the protectionist talk now emanating from both parties -- has the makings of tragedy. If we don't get some real job creation soon, the politics of jobs may become dangerously self-destructive.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
As competition heats up in fast food, Quiznos places one new order and reviews other agencies.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives

 BODY:
THE marketing battle among restaurant chains has taken another turn as Quiznos Sub, the fast-growing chain of about 2,500 sandwich shops, has appointed a new advertising agency to help usher new customers through the doors amid the frantic competition.
 The move Friday by Quiznos comes as other big chains revamp or refresh ad campaigns, particularly in light of the news media's focus on obesity and fast-food consumption. 
 Subway Restaurants, for one, began a new campaign last month using its new agency, Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe. Others, including Burger King, McDonald's and Wendy's, have replaced old campaigns. 
Quiznos spends far less than those companies; billings on its account are estimated at $25 million to $30 million, while Subway was estimated to spend $218.6 million to advertise in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
But rapid growth at Quiznos -- the company says the pace is equivalent to adding a store every 11 hours -- will help pay for increased advertising spending. Each store contributes to the general advertising fund.
Those ads will now be created by the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Martin was named to take over for Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York, which began handling the account in 1998.
Stacie Lange, vice president for public relations at Quiznos in Denver, confirmed a report of the switch to Martin in Adweek.com. She said the decision came after a four-month review that was narrowed to Martin, Freeman and two others: the Romann Group in New York and Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore.
"Martin presented ideas that really spoke to our brand personality and where we want to take Quiznos in the future," Ms. Lange said, declining to elaborate.
The loss of Quiznos is a blow to Freeman, which has lost several large clients since last year, including Budget Rent a Car System, Mike's Hard Lemonade and Staples. In May, it decided not to participate in a review for the creative assignment from another client, Midas.
At the same time that Quiznos has changed its advertising agency, Ms. Lange said it had decided to keep the public relations portion of its account in the hands of the Denver office of Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, part of the WPP Group. Quiznos had been evaluating that assignment since June, along with the creative and other remaining portions of its account, but decided to remain with Ogilvy without hearing presentations from other agencies.
The other evaluations, however, continue. For the media planning and buying part of its account, Quiznos is looking at three agencies: Initiative Media in Los Angeles, part of the Partnership division of Interpublic, which now has the assignment; Camelot Communications in Dallas; and Media Head in New York. The assignment for in-store promotions is also under consideration; those duties are handled by the Zipatoni Company in St. Louis, another Partnership unit.

HEADLINE: Agreement in Maine Will Remove Dams For Salmon's Sake 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: OLD TOWN, Me., Oct. 6 

 BODY:
Legions of wild Atlantic salmon once surged through Maine's rivers, but for decades their numbers have been shriveling to a hapless handful. Years of efforts to bring them back by banning salmon fishing, stocking the rivers with millions of fish, cleaning up pollution and even tracking fish with transponders have failed time and again.
 But on Monday an unusual agreement was announced between a coalition of environmentalists and the power company that operates dams on Maine's largest river, an agreement many environmentalists believe stands a good chance of saving the struggling salmon, along with a dozen other species of faltering fish. 
 Under the agreement, two dams on the sprawling Penobscot River are to be torn down, removing important barriers to salmon returning from the ocean to the river to spawn. A third dam will be decommissioned, and a bypass will be built around the structure so the salmon can pass. 
In exchange, the environmental coalition will pay the power company, the PPL Corporation, about $25 million. And PPL will be able to increase its power generation on six other dams on the Penobscot and its offshoots, recapturing about 90 percent of the power it will lose when the dams are demolished. The environmentalists also agreed to drop legal challenges to the relicensing of the dams by the federal government.
"This is the most important effort in 100 years to restore Atlantic salmon in the United States," said Gov. John Baldacci of Maine, speaking Monday on the banks of the steel-gray Penobscot in this river town 15 miles north of Bangor.
Eric Ruff, a spokesman for the federal Department of the Interior, called the deal "a groundbreaking conceptual agreement," and said it was good for the environment, energy development and the state. 
Several of those involved in the agreement said Monday that they hoped its amicable resolution and creative compromise would serve as a template for other areas of the country where environmentalists and power companies have locked horns. But others, including Interior officials and those in the power industry, said it was too early to tell if Maine's formula could apply elsewhere.
The Maine agreement will open 500 miles of the Penobscot, the river that embraces by far the largest remaining population of Atlantic salmon in the country, environmentalists say.
After the dams come down, the salmon in the river will quickly increase to at least 10 to 12 times their current number of about 1,000, said Everett Carson, executive director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, a member of the environmental coalition. Atlantic salmon, majestic and acrobatic fish that can reach up to 50 pounds, have fallen on such hard times in Maine that three years ago, salmon in eight of the state's rivers were added to the endangered species list.
"This is the single best chance, maybe the last chance, to restore Atlantic salmon," said Chris Wood, a vice president of Trout Unlimited, one of the environmental groups. "This in one fell swoop restores a river system that drains one-third of the state of Maine."
And, he added, "let's not forget the less charismatic fish." The deal is also expected to help shad, alewives, shortnose sturgeon, blueback herring, tomcod and rainbow smelt.
"Sturgeon and striped bass will have an excellent opportunity to reestablish populations in Maine," said Steven A. Williams, director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. "American eel are in serious decline, but increased fish passage will open the river for them. Bald eagles and other birds will have increased foraging opportunities. 
"Fish deaths from turbines as well as stress and nonlethal injuries will be eliminated or reduced."
Environmentalists and power company representatives said it was unusual for a utility to agree to the removal of dams. In most cases, dams have been removed under pressure from government agencies, from lawsuits by environmentalists, or in the course of bankruptcy filings.
For example, the Condit Dam on the White Salmon River in Washington State is scheduled to come down in 2006 because its operator, Pacificorp, opted to remove the dam rather than pay the $30 million needed to meet federal requirements to make it less harmful to fish.
Environmental groups say a turning point came when the Edwards Dam on Maine's Kennebec River came down in 1999, becoming the first dam in the country to be ordered demolished by the federal government, against the utility's will. Within months, several species of fish made strong comebacks in that river. Since then, about 100 of the nation's 75,000 dams have been torn down. 
"Many times companies don't get compensated for these dams," said Paul Wirth, a spokesman for PPL. "We're being compensated fully for these dams, not only for the market value of the dams but for the future revenues from these dams."
By all accounts, the negotiations, which took more than two years, were initiated by PPL, an Allentown, Pa., company that took over the hydroelectric generation on the Penobscot in 1999. Walking into a contentious climate, in which environmentalists had already blocked the rebuilding of one dam and the construction of another, and were challenging the relicensing of other dams, PPL executives decided to see if all the interested parties could reach a compromise.
"We had many junctures where it would have been anybody's reasonable guess that we wouldn't come to an agreement," said Laura Rose Day, the project director for the environmental coalition. 
The agreement was aided by the shape and flow of the Penobscot, which has several broad offshoots that branch off and rejoin the river's main stem. The environmentalists ultimately agreed that if PPL increased power generation on the dams on the river's offshoots, the environmental cost would be small compared with the gain from closing dams on the river's main stem, Ms. Rose Day said.
PPL also agreed to improve fish passages at its remaining dams, constructing, for example, lifts or elevators instead of the small concrete fish ladders that exist now.
Before the dams come down, the environmental coalition has to raise $25 million to $27 million to buy them. The groups expect the money to filter in over the next five years from federal and state grants and private donors.
Also involved in the negotiations was the Penobscot Indian tribe, whose reservation is on Indian Island in the middle of the Penobscot. The Indians have a historical right to catch fish in the river with nets and spears, but they have not been able to practice that cultural ritual for years, said Chief Barry Dana.
"I remember my grandfather recalling the days you could walk across the backs of salmon and not get your ankles wet," he said.
Maine officials also hope the agreement will help foster economic revitalization of communities along the river, drawing recreational fishermen and kayakers. One ritual discontinued in 1992 might be restored: the presentation of the first salmon caught in the river to the president of the United States.
Some of the parties to the agreement believe such negotiations ought to be applied to situations as contentious as the fight over the effect on Pacific salmon of dams on the Snake River on the West Coast.
"We're reconfiguring hydro power instead of removing power," said Andy Goode, vice president of the Atlantic Salmon Federation's American program. "This could be used as a model across the country."
But Jim Owen, a spokesman for Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned power companies like PPL, said "it's too early to tell if this can be a template."
And Mr. Ruff of the Interior Department suggested that such agreements would be harder to come by in the West because dams there are bigger and produce more power than those on the Penobscot.
For now, both sides seem content to celebrate their meeting of the minds in Maine. "I can't predict whether this will work other places," said George D. LaPointe, the commissioner of Maine's Department of Marine Resources, "but it's certainly a good recipe."

HEADLINE: Creating Global Airlines 

 BODY:
The merger agreement between KLM, the Dutch airline, and Air France is more than an intriguing business story. It is an important symbol, perhaps even a landmark, in Europe's continuing integration. Asking a country to give up its gleaming 747's flying the national colors is almost as difficult as asking it to give up its currency to join a monetary union. Politicians, after all, can be like little children when it comes to big planes. That is one reason why Europe's airlines, unlike other businesses, have not been allowed to operate freely in what has ostensibly been a single economic market for a decade. 
 It makes no more economic sense for most countries in the European Union to maintain airlines with global pretensions than it does for state governments in America to have their own flagship carriers. But the Dutch willingness to surrender KLM to a holding company based in Paris is driven not only by the logic of European integration, but also by the promise of a long-overdue deregulation of the trans-Atlantic market. Both airlines say they can best capitalize on this prospect if they can offer a more extensive network to travelers. A merger would create such a network. 
 American consumers stand to gain if the airlines' premise is correct and arcane regulatory barriers are lowered not just on both continents, but for travel between them. Last week, negotiators from the European Union and the United States began talks with just such a goal in mind. 
In the past, international routes have been allotted on the basis of bilateral agreements. The United States negotiated so-called open-skies deals with France and the Netherlands, for example, and these bilateral agreements allowed airlines based in either country to fly to any destination in the other. Because late last year the European Union wrested from its members the power to regulate aviation, open-skies deals can now be negotiated for flights to all of Europe. 
The global airline industry is overly protected. One of globalization's oddities is that a business that does so much to lower barriers for others is itself tethered by protectionist restrictions. In a world of truly global automakers, banks and food conglomerates, airlines remain distinctly national. 
Rationalizing Europe's industry will reduce the number of old flagship airlines but still expand competition, as bigger airlines and successful low-cost niche players are freed to fly anywhere. Yet for the same process to take place in the trans-Atlantic market, anachronistic limits on foreign ownership must be lifted. Marketing alliances are a half-measure to get around these limits. Travelers would benefit even more if successful airlines on either side of the Atlantic were allowed to expand on the other side.

HEADLINE: Where Rejects Find Buyers Who Love Them 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

DATELINE: PEARL RIVER, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The graveyard of retailing looks like this: piles of unopened bottles of wine; pyramids of digital cameras that failed to attract attention; mountains of leopard-pattern ladies' undergarments that no one, ultimately, wanted. 
 Then there are the difficult-to-tune guitars with "Bud" spray-painted across the front, the boxes of Nailene fake fingernails, the cartons of unsold Lego toys, the full sets of golf clubs, the wedding gowns still sealed in plastic, the videocassettes well along the road to obsolescence bearing titles like "Scooby Doo's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics." 
 Food products land here, too, like Roller Bites, a sort of hamburger factory-molded into the shape of a hot dog by a Boston company that discovered too late that the public was not ready for the idea.
Retailers and their suppliers do not bury such mistakes; instead, they turn to companies that specialize in taking what is politely called excess inventory off their hands. The practitioners tend to be held in the same regard as a funeral home: necessary, perhaps, but no one's destination of choice. 
After three years of recession and feeble recovery, the excess-inventory trade might be expected to be flourishing just now, with plenty of unsold merchandise to unload. But the opposite is true: Companies like Active International, based here in Rockland County north of New York City, are having a harder time capitalizing on retailers' mistakes, because tough times have taught many retailers to make fewer of them. 
"It was a very quiet summer," said Anita Garrison, an 11-year Active veteran who handles apparel from an office bedecked with rejects, including a few leopard-print bras. "From what we saw, everybody was being really careful. No one was reordering." 
Many retailers have been striving in recent years to make their supply chains as lean as they can, by buying more carefully and by using better inventory-control technology. That has reduced the volume of product misfires, said Walter Levy, a managing director at Kurt Salmon Associates, a consulting firm, who has been observing the flameout side of retailing for decades.
Retailers are also routinely using sophisticated markdown software to move more merchandise before companies like Active have to be called in, Mr. Levy added. Excess-inventory specialists are "in many ways a dying business," he said. "But people always make mistakes." 
There are several ways to try to erase those mistakes. Simply selling the goods to a discounter or liquidator for cash is one possibility -- but that means accepting a very low price and most likely booking a loss. 
Active's barter-style approach is more complicated, and easier on the seller's profit-and-loss statements. Active typically buys the goods at full price, but does not pay cash; rather, it gives the seller credits toward part of the cost of other goods and services that it provides, like advertising. 
The selling company can then book the credits as a prepaid asset, and record its use of them in future periods as sales, said Fredrick Fuest, Active's chief operating officer. That makes it almost impossible to tell at a glance that some of the seller's products have fallen flat. Active, meanwhile, disposes of the goods, typically getting 25 cents on the dollar for them.
"We look at ourselves as a financial tool," Mr. Fuest said. "If a mistake has been made, we are there to help with the least pain. On the other hand, a lot of our clients are free to take more risks, because they know Active will be here to take the inventory." 
But these days, risk-averse retailers are trying not to have any inventory for Active to take. And Active, which calls itself "the world's largest corporate trading company," and its rivals in the industry, face Internet competition just as the retailers do -- from eBay, the leading auction Web site, which has developed a whole wing for excess-inventory trading, and from companies like Overstock.com.
Searching for growth, Icon International, an Active competitor that got its start in barter deals, has been turning its hand to dealing with blunders in another industry, real estate. Tom Bartholomew, the company's senior vice president for sales operations and fulfillment, said helping developers and property managers unload whole buildings or unexpired leases has become an important source of business for Icon, a unit of the Omnicom advertising and marketing conglomerate based in Stamford, Conn. "Fifty percent of our business comes from products and real estate, and a fair amount from more complex financial transactions," Mr. Bartholomew said, listing recent deals involving Tyson Foods, Mazda automobiles, Swiss Army watches and PepsiCo beverages. 
Sometimes technological change leaves products languishing on the shelf or in the warehouse, like those Scooby Doo tapes, made passe by the spread of DVD players. More often, though, retail duds are born of human error -- for instance, a buyer who was a little too enthusiastic about the Nailene nails or the wedding gowns. 
Changes in packaging can strand goods with the old labels in a warehouse; so can sudden order cancellations, like the 12-packs of Everest mints that Wal-Mart recently decided it did not want, prompting an urgent call from the mint factory to an Active executive. 
And sometimes cutthroat competition plays a part. One window manufacturer paid a retailer to remove all of a competing maker's windows from its stores, and then brought the rival's windows to Active to sell somewhere else, Mr. Fuest said. 
Mr. Fuest proudly displays a ship's bell on one wall of Active's offices, situated in a 1970's-era office complex that itself was a kind of misfire; it was originally intended to house the New York Stock Exchange, he said, during the exchange's brief flirtation with a move to the suburbs. Each sales representative who closes a deal gets to ring the bell in triumph. The bell is still ringing regularly, at least for the moment, Mr. Fuest said.
Some transactions come in over the transom, say with a call from a factory owner anxious to free up some storage space. But Active's sales representatives also leaf through newspapers and industry journals, looking for possibly vulnerable companies and sectors, and then pick up the telephone. 
In some sectors, the continuing impact of secondary markets, as the discounters, liquidators and other channels for disposing of unwanted goods are known, is undeniable. In the apparel industry, for example, Active's "remarketing" executives regularly turn up at industry events -- even ones held to showcase new fashions.
"We go there to interact with our clients, and our buyers are there," said Mrs. Garrison, whose flowing golden curls give her the look of a mermaid -- perhaps a Stygian mermaid, to a department store executive in distress. "A lot of the manufacturers think of us as buyers, and show us styles, colors and sizes." 
Asked whether buyers of retail apparel are happy to see her, she smiled. "Our major competitors are liquidators, who pay 20 cents on the dollar," she said. "They are the scourge of the earth."
Even goods bearing the trendiest brand names can sometimes turn up unwanted. Last year a load of Furla handbags and approximately 200,000 Razor scooters passed through Active's hands. "When my wife found out we had Furla bags, she gave them to all of her friends for Christmas," said Mr. Fuest, a former pharmaceutical executive who wears double-breasted suits and speaks in the hushed tones of one who must deal daily with the seven stages of retail error.
Many clients do not want anyone to know that they are unloading goods through secondary markets. Active agrees to keep their secrets, like the fact that a major manufacturer could not sell thousands of light bulbs, or that another found itself swimming in name-brand batteries and DVD players. And it will respect other limits on its efforts.
"They won't want it sold in the Northeast, or they won't want it sold in Ohio," Mrs. Garrison said. "Or we can't sell it in the United States at all." 
Sometimes the advertising will have to say "famous maker" and not mention the brand. "They will call us with winter coats," she said, "and say you can only sell them in Arizona and Florida." Some of the apparel Mrs. Garrison handles ends up at cut-price chains like T.J. Maxx or Syms, or at similar outlets overseas. 
Some companies seem to thrive on their arrangements with remarketers. Active's longtime clients include Ocean Spray, Kodak and Casio, Mr. Fuest said. This year, DuPont's Antron flooring division hired Active to handle all its meeting planning -- as a way to use up credits.
It is a business where even enthusiasm can have its downside. Not long ago, an Active executive, Willy Pistiner, was assigned to remarket what he called "a few million sutures" and tried to make it easy for potential buyers by setting up a Web page with details and contact information -- his e-mail address. That turned out to be a big mistake. "I get 3,000 to 4,000 junk e-mails from all over the globe, every day," Mr. Pistiner said. "We're in the process of changing my e-mail address."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rise on Hopes for a Week of Strong Profit Reports

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks advanced yesterday after PeopleSoft and Knight Trading said that third-quarter profit exceeded forecasts, leading investors to predict other companies might follow suit this week.
 Trading was the slowest in five weeks as some investors observed Yom Kippur. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.50 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,034.35. Motorola contributed the most to the gain after it announced plans to shed its semiconductor unit. The Dow Jones industrial average added 22.67 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,594.98. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 12.89 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,893.46. 
 "Earnings are improving and corporate America has definitely addressed the cost side of the balance sheet," said Dennis Fitzpatrick, who helps manage $2.1 billion for First Investors Management in New York. "There's a lot of belief revenue will also pick up now." 
 Some one billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, 25 percent below its three-month daily average. Nine stocks rose for every five that fell on the Big Board.
 Profit for companies in the benchmark S.&P. 500 index increased an average of 16 percent in the third quarter, which ended last Tuesday, according to Thomson Financial. That is the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2000.
 PeopleSoft, which is fending off a $7.25 billion hostile bid from Oracle, added 62 cents, to $20.43. It said profit and sales of business software in the third quarter exceeded its forecasts, helped by its purchase of J.D. Edwards & Company. 
 Knight Trading, the biggest market maker of stocks on Nasdaq, rose $1.85, to $13.95. Third-quarter earnings were higher than expected because of an increase in trading, the company said. The company said profit was as much as 21 cents a share. Knight was expected to earn 12 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call.
 Online brokers also gained. E*Trade Group rose 37 cents, to $10.22; Ameritrade Holding added 96 cents, to $13.30.
 "We still have an awful lot of fuel for the market to move higher," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "There needs to be a confirmation by companies that the numbers they see are real."
 Fourteen companies from the S.&P. 500 release quarterly results this week. Ten of them advanced yesterday. Alcoa, the aluminum maker which reports today, added 12 cents, to $28.27.
 Yahoo, which reports tomorrow, gained 54 cents, to $39.78. Revenue is forecast to rise 36 percent, to a record $337.8 million, according to Thomson First Call.
 Motorola, the world's No.2 maker of mobile telephones, jumped $1.22, to $13.50. It plans to shed its semiconductor unit in a public offering so it can focus on reviving its cellphone business. 
 Prices of Treasury securities rose for the first day in three in New York trading on concerns that the surge in yields on Friday reflected an overestimation of the potential for economic growth. 
 The benchmark 10-year note had its biggest decline in more than two months Friday after a report showed the United States added jobs for the first time in eight months in September.
 The sell-off "was definitely an overreaction," said Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate research at Credit Suisse First Boston. "One month's worth of data is hardly a miraculous labor market story."
 By late in the day, the 10-year note rose 6/32, to a price of 100 20/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.17 percent from 4.20 percent on Friday. And the 30-year bond rose 11/32, to 104 16/32. Its yield dropped to 5.07 percent from 5.10 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.767	99.497	High Rate	0.920	0.995	Investment Rate	0.939	1.017	Low Rate	0.890	0.970	Median Rate	0.910	0.990	Total applied for	44,124,545	45,590,227	Accepted	22,101,915	21,730,637	Noncompetitive	1,520,347	1,056,211	

Both issues are dated Oct. 9. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 8, 2004, and the six-month bills mature on April 8, 2004.

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL LUO and LYDIA POLGREEN; Michael Luo reported for this article from New York and Lydia Polgreen from Syracuse. Michelle York also contributed reporting from Syracuse.

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
The name of a cooling company has been inseparable from this frost-belt city since the Depression, when city leaders scraped together $250,000 and tax incentives to lure the inventor of the air-conditioner, Willis H. Carrier, and his business from Newark. The deal worked, and the Carrier Corporation became a mainstay of a community whose best-known landmark is the Carrier Dome, the home arena for the Syracuse University Orangemen.
 On Monday, the company confirmed rumors that those ties would loosen, announcing that it would close the two manufacturing plants at its East Syracuse site, laying off 1,200 workers and moving those operations to Asia and the South. The company will keep 1,600 jobs here, mainly in research and development, but the decision means that Carrier will no longer make any products in Syracuse, where manufacturing has long been a key part of its identity. 
 The move cuts deep in a city already buffeted this year by the see-sawing fortunes of a proposal to build the nation's largest mall.
"This is a big psychological hit," said Representative James T. Walsh, a Republican. "Carrier is our trademark. Everywhere you go, people think of Syracuse when they think of Carrier air-conditioners."
As it has across the nation, manufacturing has receded in the Syracuse area, where one of every five factory jobs -- nearly 10,000 in all -- have been lost since 2000. Carrier, which calls itself the world's largest manufacturer of heating and cooling systems and equipment, was also the region's largest manufacturer. At their largest, the East Syracuse plants employed 7,000. 
The company's decision was forced by simple business realities, said a company spokesman, Jonathan Shaw. The East Syracuse plants produced two types of products: compressor parts and refrigeration units for containers used in shipping.
More than 80 percent of the container manufacturers who buy Carrier's refrigeration units are in Asia, Mr. Shaw said in a telephone interview. "It doesn't make any sense to ship a product 6,000 miles when you have a plant in the same hemisphere," he said. So Carrier plans to make the refrigeration units at a plant in Singapore.
As for the compressor parts, sales have fallen by half over the last five years as technology has changed, so it made sense to consolidate manufacturing at plants in China and Stone Mountain, Ga.
The company is negotiating severance packages for the workers who will be laid off, Mr. Shaw said, and will offer tuition reimbursement for any employee who wants to go back to school.
The prospects for the workers are grim, however, local business and union leaders said. Manufacturing jobs are prized because they are unionized and pay well. An average factory worker at Carrier could make $19 an hour. Those who have been laid off are unlikely to find work in another factory, the local leaders said, and the key growth areas in the upstate economy now are in service jobs, in areas like education and health care.
"It's not as if you can go from a job on a production line into working in health care," said Richard Dietz, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Buffalo.
For years, Syracuse's location, at the confluence of several canals, rail lines and, later, highways, made it an appealing place for manufacturers of all sorts. There were plants that made auto parts for Chrysler and General Motors, and General Electric and Sylvania factories that churned out lamps. Most of those companies, and the manufacturing jobs they brought, are long gone.
Still, Syracuse has added other kinds of jobs; in August, the area had 284,100 private-sector jobs, an increase of 10,000 from a decade earlier. The city's once desolate downtown now stirs with life; a nascent cultural district draws visitors, and a historic neighborhood known as Armory Square has expensive restaurants and trendy bars. Despite reports this summer that negotiations over the mega-mall DestiNY USA had foundered, the local Chamber of Commerce says the plan is still alive.
Carrier was one of those rare employers whose business and beneficence were woven into the fabric of the community. It was not unusual for families to have three generations of men working in the factory at once. 
Carrier was bought in 1979 by the United Technologies Corporation, a conglomerate that includes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Chubb security systems. Many workers traced the end of the family atmosphere to that year, when Carrier's world headquarters moved from Syracuse to Farmington, Conn.
On Monday, day-shift workers got the news of the layoffs at 9:30 a.m., when supervisors gathered them and read a company memo aloud. Even though rumors had been swirling for months, many workers were still shocked. Although the plants, located east of the city in De Witt, will not officially close until sometime next year, workers said they were told they could go home for the day. Many packed into the Thompson Road Bar, a pub just down the street, to share a drink and commiserate.
"It hurts me," said James Furrow, 38, who has worked in the packaging department for five years. "I've got five kids."
Tom Vanderhoof, 38, who has three children, has worked on one of the assembly lines for 11 years. "Growing up, Carrier was always the place to work," he said. "If you can get a job there, you're in."
In April, the company announced that it was reviewing its 84 manufacturing plants, including the operation in De Witt.
In July, as it became clear that the company was seriously considering layoffs in his district, Representative Walsh met with United Technologies' chief executive, George David, over lunch to try to change his mind. Mr. Walsh said city, state and federal officials proposed an array of tax incentives and cost-saving measures, but Mr. David came prepared with flip charts and a presentation on the company's growing cost of business and declining market share. He explained that the company could make units three times cheaper in Asia, Mr. Walsh said.
At best, the incentives might be able to narrow the margin to two-and-a-half times, but not much more, Mr. Walsh said. So "I tried to appeal to his sense of citizenship, community."
But Mr. David was apparently not swayed. Gov. George E. Pataki also met with Mr. David last week in a final attempt to persuade the company to stay.
"I just got a clear impression that he wasn't interested in that," Mr. Walsh said. "They're making strategic global decisions that are beyond our ability to impact."

GOODYEAR TO ELIMINATE1,100 JOBS AT ALABAMA PLANT

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company will close an Alabama factory by Dec. 5, cutting about 1,100 jobs as part of cost reductions allowed under a labor contract approved last month. The shutdown of the plant, in Huntsville, will result in fourth-quarter expenses of $255 million, the company said. Goodyear estimates that it will save about $100 million a year as a result.

HEADLINE: Mesa Air Makes Stock Offer for AtlanticCoast 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
The Mesa Air Group said yesterday that it was offering to buy Atlantic Coast Airlines for $512 million in stock in a deal that would form the largest regional airline in the country.
 Mesa, which is based in Phoenix, said it would continue to fly to small and midsize cities for United Airlines and would halt Atlantic Coast's plans to create a low-cost airline. 
 Mesa sent a letter yesterday to Kerry B. Skeen, the chairman and chief executive of Atlantic Coast, offering 0.9 share of Mesa stock for each share of Atlantic Coast. Mesa's shares closed at $12.55 on Friday and fell 99 cents yesterday, to $11.56. Atlantic Coast closed Friday at $9.02 and rose $2.03 yesterday, to $11.05. 
A statement by Atlantic Coast said the board was considering the offer. "While it undertakes this review," it said, "A.C.A. will continue with its current operations and with the implementation of its plans to operate as an independent airline."
Mesa said the merger would create a company with $1.8 billion in annual revenue, 9,000 workers and 297 planes.
Robert Ashcroft, an analyst at UBS Warburg, wrote in an investor's note that he thought Atlantic Coast's board would not accept the offer and that Mesa would shy away from a hostile takeover since that would be costly and could anger labor groups.
Atlantic Coast said late in July that it was planning to end its agreement to run regional flights for United Airlines, a UAL Corporation unit, and start its own low-cost carrier. The share price of Atlantic Coast plummeted after that announcement, and analysts have been skeptical of the airline's chances of success in operating an independent carrier.
But Atlantic Coast has been reluctant to affirm a contract with UAL since UAL filed for bankruptcy protection last December and began using that leverage to renegotiate terms of its contracts with virtually all its suppliers and partners. About 80 percent of Atlantic Coast's revenue comes from United. It also runs flights for Delta Air Lines.
In addition, Mesa operates regional flights for United, which is its second-largest customer after America West Airlines. Mesa, which had $605 million in revenue for the fiscal year ended in September, operates in the West and Midwest; Atlantic Coast, based in Dulles, Va., runs flights mostly in the East. The two route structures complement each other.
For Mesa, the acquisition would give it a chance to quickly add planes to its fleet without having to find new aircraft financing, which is difficult to obtain these days.
Jonathan G. Ornstein, the chairman and chief executive of Mesa, said in a telephone interview that Mesa would not proceed with Atlantic Coast's plan to create a low-cost airline and would instead reaffirm a contract with United.
"Both of these carriers have done very well in the past," Mr. Ornstein said. Referring to Atlantic Coast's partnership with United, he added, "We think the company's best option going forward is to re-establish these relationships." 
A spokesman for United, Jeff Green, said that his company was still in talks with Atlantic Coast to work out new contract terms, but that "there's no guarantee a deal will be reached with them." United has been working on contingency plans to continue regional service in the areas covered by Atlantic Coast should the deal fall through, Mr. Green added.
Several analysts said Mesa's initiative for Atlantic Coast seemed like a good move. Raymond L. Neidl of Blaylock & Partners said that in light of Atlantic Coast's generally falling stock price, it was no surprise that an airline was trying to buy it.
"For Mesa, it's a big plus for them in the long term, I would say, because of the opportunity to obtain these assets at an economical cost," Mr. Neidl said. "The risk is managing the growth in the long term."
Susan Donofrio of Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors that "at first glance it appears to be a nice alternative to Atlantic Coast's current plans to transform into a low-fare airline as we are not convinced that this low-fare strategy would be successful, given the cost structure of flying regional aircraft."

HEADLINE: THE MIDEAST TURMOIL: THE WHITE HOUSE; 
BUSH TELLS ISRAEL IT HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 

 BODY:
President Bush said Monday that he had told Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel that his country "must not feel constrained" in defending itself, signaling that the United States would not condemn Mr. Sharon's decision to stage an airstrike inside Syria in response to the latest suicide bombing in Israel.
 A day after Israel attacked what it said was a terrorist training camp in Syria in retaliation for the suicide bombing in northern Israel on Saturday that killed 19 people plus the bomber, Mr. Bush suggested that the responsibility for breaking the growing cycle of violence now rested primarily with the Palestinian leadership. 
 "I made it very clear to the prime minister, like I have consistently done, that Israel's got a right to defend herself, that Israel must not feel constrained in defending the homeland," the president said at the White House in response to a reporter's question.
Israel's strategy of hitting a target inside Syria raised the question of whether the Sharon government had adopted Mr. Bush's policy of focusing on not just terrorists but also states that harbor them. The lack of explicit criticism from the United States did nothing to dispel the impression that the White House, after discouraging Israel from assuming that it could embrace the Bush doctrine in its battle against Palestinian extremists, was now doing nothing to stop Israel from doing so.
The White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said that Israel had conducted the raid without informing the United States in advance, and that the administration was not giving Mr. Sharon permission to take his nation's fight against terrorism into other countries.
"We're not a traffic light," he said.
But other administration officials said the United States was keenly aware of the parallels.
"There is some applicability here of the Bush doctrine," an administration official said.
Mr. Bush did say he had also told Mr. Sharon, during a phone conversation onSunday after the Israeli attack inside Syria, that "it's very important that any action that Israel take should avoid escalation and creating higher tensions."
But the president then pointedly turned to the subject of the Palestinian Authority and, without identifying him, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. Mr. Bush, who has written off any chance that Mr. Arafat would advance the prospects for peace, has been pushing the Palestinians to create a government with a prime minister who could assume enough power to crack down on the violent groups like Islamic Jihad and Hamas that have been responsible for most suicide bombings in Israel.
"In order for there to be a Palestinian state, the Palestinian Authority must fight terror and must use whatever means is necessary to fight terror," Mr. Bush said, pounding his fist for emphasis.
He spoke during an appearance before reporters with President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya, who was making a state visit to the White House to discuss economic aid, trade and the fight against terrorism.
American officials said Monday that the camp in Syria was known to them as having been a training base for various Palestinian terrorist organizations. The attack inside Syria was the first by Israel in 30 years. It elevated concerns in Washington and throughout the Middle East of a widening of the Arab-Israeli conflict and left Mr. Bush's peace plan, known as the road map, with little relevance to the deteriorating situation in the region.
In Congress, Republicans said the Israeli attack could help them push ahead with legislation to impose sanctions on Syria if it did not give up support of terrorist organizations.
Within the administration, officials said, there were mixed feelings about whether Israel was justified in attacking the site in Syria.
"There are ways in which this attack, this retaliation by the Israelis, raises the difficulty level for pushing forward on some of the objectives we have," the administration official said. "But the reality is that the Syrians have been a state sponsor of terrorism. And this camp that the Israelis struck has been used in the past by terrorist organizations, and it's come up in recent intelligence as a location that the Palestinians and Islamic Jihad might be using." 
But some experts said the issue of the Bush doctrine merely provided convenient cover for the administration to hold off on criticizing Israel. They said the United States had largely disengaged from the effort to bring peace to the Middle East. In particular, they said, the White House has been unwilling to force Israel to take politically costly steps like halting construction of a barrier around what it considers its territory and ending construction of new settlements, especially given the long odds of producing a lasting peace.
"The notion that the U.S. is pressured to accept Israel's actions because of its own actions against terrorism is not really what's happening," said Shibley Telhami, a Middle East scholar at the University of Maryland. "This is a rationalization of the decision that the administration is not going to weigh in because it costs something and it's not going to work."
The legislation being considered threatens Syria with economic and diplomatic sanctions if it does not abandon its support of Hamas, Hezbollah and other groups; promise to withdraw forces from Lebanon; and stop any development of medium- and long-range missiles and chemical and biological weapons.
The administration has opposed the sanctions plan, which has broad bipartisan support in both the House and theSenate. But now, lawmakers and aides say, the administration has agreed to stay on the sidelines while the House takes up the measure.
"We worked very closely with the administration to make sure it gave them the flexibility they need," said Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the House majority leader, Tom DeLay. "They will not oppose this."

PERSON: Kenneth J. Podziba 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Hunter of Big Games, Thinking Globally

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
DESPITE the spiffy suit, scrupulously tended smile, politician-quality handshake and neatly gelled, ultra-gentrified pseudo-Mohawk hairdo, Kenneth J. Podziba comes across as a regular guy for all seasons -- sports seasons. Not even cricket escapes his purview. And he professes bug-eyed curiosity about the lesser-sung Summer Olympic sports he is committed, as sports commissioner, to bringing to New York City en masse in 2012. 
 For a Mets fan, he is commendably broad-minded -- he even roots for the Yankees most Octobers, usually from the tranquillity of his Upper East Side sofa, though if he's on duty, he'll hit the stadium. As he is a health-food aficionado (he wants to live to be 100), his notion of falling off the wagon is grabbing a beer and a hot dog at a ballgame. Yummy. 
 His office downtown at 2 Washington Place is littered with sports equipment, some of it autographed by celebrity athletes, and aglitter with crystal trophies, all earned by him. Not for athletic prowess, though he does take pains to work out three times a week and tap the tennis ball around the Hamptons each summer, but for service to sports and sports fanatics.
Mr. Podziba, fortunate fellow, is in his sixth year as the city's boyishly ebullient, terminally earnest sports commissioner. What do you mean, you didn't even know the city had one? How else did the Wild Onion Urban Adventure Race, triathlon world championships and "N.F.L. Kickoff Live From Times Square" wend their way here? But not to worry. He didn't know the city had one, either, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed him in 1998 and commanded him to think outside the box. His first production: a network-televised outdoor bowling event in Bryant Park. 
Novelty sells. He was the guy who, during a stint with the Taxi and Limousine Commission, came up with the infamous Talking Taxi program, that annoying recording of celebrities advising passengers to buckle up and pocket receipts. "I hate to admit to that one," he says. "Don't hate me for it." 
He calls it an instance of a good idea and good intentions gone stale. Best thing about it, he met Dr. Ruth Westheimer at a recording session, and they became real buddies. "She's so humble and full of love," he says. "But we don't talk about sex. She doesn't give me advice. We make each other laugh. Being around her helps me realize that whatever course my life takes, I'll be fine. My job doesn't define me. It's not my worth. People tell me I take my job too seriously, but I don't think I can take it seriously enough: I'm a face of the City of New York. It's a big responsibility. Stop me if I'm rambling!"
HIS reappointment by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was a major relief. Rather than sending Mr. Bloomberg's transition team the standard resume, Mr. Podziba gambled on overkill and bowled it over with a 250-page catalog of the sports commission's accomplishments. His most pressing project this month is assisting NYC Big Events, the agency that attracts revenue-producing extravaganzas to the city, in its bid for the 2008 Super Bowl. 
Why does New York City need a Super Bowl? Not to mention that it would technically kick off in New Jersey, at Giants Stadium. Mr. Podziba feigns incredulity; a Super Bowl generates $500 million in economic activity! And might serve as a swell commercial for the metro area's devotion to sports of global interest. Like the Olympics. 
That's Mr. Podziba's other preoccupation. He wears the NYC2012 pin prominently on his lapel; the snow globe toy on his desk features five floating Olympic rings and the Empire State Building (the objective is to encircle the skyscraper with the rings); and his digital clock displays, instead of the actual time, a countdown of the days, hours, and minutes to sweat until the selection of the host city for 2012 on July 6, 2005.
There is a reason he lassoed the world championships of several low-profile Olympic sports this summer. "It demonstrates that New York City can host international events and get more attention for them because we're the media capital of the world," he recites. "It all showcases New York City as the ideal place to host the Olympics in 2012. The Olympics is a catalyst for redevelopment, and I'm a cheerleader for New York." A tireless one.
Last month the sports commission beefed up its board to include more urban "movers and shakers," as he terms them: Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports/NBC Olympics; former Mayor David N. Dinkins; Harvey Schiller, former chairman of YankeeNets; Seth Abraham, president of Madison Square Garden; and John Hayes, chief marketing officer for American Express. Mr. Podziba welcomes their clout.
But he wants all his constituents, especially the pint-size or disabled ones, to know that once upon a time, he was a Little League loser back in Oceanside. Until he discovered he had a knack for skateboarding, he preferred to spend his afternoons volunteering at the local nursing home instead of embarrassing himself on the local ball field. Until he reached Syracuse University, where he majored in marketing and advertising, he felt like a misfit. 
"I was no good at baseball," says Mr. Podziba, who is 39 but hardly looks it and began his series of city jobs as an urban planner in 1988. "I was the worst player on the team, and as a little kid, I felt, 'God, this must mean I'm worthless!' I would have never thought I'd end up being the sports commissioner of New York City! When I go around the city speaking at schools, I make sure I let the kids know that. How things can change. Look what happened to me."

HEADLINE: Balancing Cattle, Land and Ledgers 

BYLINE:  By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: THREE FORKS, Mont. 

 BODY:
HARD by the three small streams that tumble together here to form the headwaters of the Missouri River, George Kahrle tends to a herd of 50 or so bawling raven-black cattle.
 They look like cows at any other ranch, but from the time they are born, their lives and the lives of the people who raise them are different. The animals are bred later in the season than at traditional ranches, so calves are born when rich spring grasses are bursting up, and they spend less time in feed lots. 
 They roam more freely, which proponents say fends off the disease and stress so often found in pens on big ranches, and guards pastures from overuse. They are raised without growth hormones and with few, if any, antibiotics. They will even be raised a few months longer, so when they are sent to slaughter they fetch a higher price. 
Mr. Kahrle practices what is called sustainable ranching. By avoiding pesticides and relying more on range grass than feed grown with fertilizers, he says, he is helping to sustain the environment. By avoiding antibiotics and hormones, he is sustaining the quality of his beef. And by reducing his costs and becoming part of a network of distributors, retailers and chefs who care about what they are doing and are willing to pay for it, he is sustaining what is often an economically precarious way of life. "We use more of what nature gives us," Mr. Kahrle said. "It makes sense on every level."
Mr. Kahrle is part of a small, growing group of ranchers and business owners who say the meat industry has cut so many corners for the sake of profit that the environment and the quality of beef have been compromised and small ranchers have been driven out of business. With recent outbreaks of disease, like mad cow in Canada, and a larger trend toward organic and humane treatment of animals, those out West in big hat country feel the time is ripe to market beef with a known history.
Niman Ranch in California sells sustainable meat raised by 45 cattle producers who must meet certain environmental standards, use approved genetics, keep careful health records and pass inspections from Niman. Other ranchers who sell sustainable beef elsewhere follow the same general principles. There is no government or independent oversight of sustainable beef, but the ranchers are working to develop more formalized standards.
"It's about leaving the smallest and lightest footprint that you can," said Heather Hand, a chef and co-owner of the Savory Olive, a restaurant in Bozeman, Mont., that bills itself as serving sustainably grown food with an emphasis on local products. 
Meat production "can't be driven by economics only," said Rob Hurlbut, president of Niman Ranch. "It has to be driven by a quality product."
But, in a sense, sustainable ranching is about economics. Between the premium price he gets for his beef and his savings, on everything from fewer antibiotics to less hay and lower labor costs, Mr. Kahrle said he makes about $30,000 a year more than he would from traditional ranching. In a recent survey by the Corporation for the Northern Rockies, a Montana nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable agriculture, the 38 ranchers surveyed said their profits had increased by an average of 22 percent since abandoning traditional methods.
Mr. Kahrle, a native of Ohio, graduated from Harvard with a degree in sociology. "Unfortunately, that school didn't have an agricultural program," he said. He gave in to the pull of the West's open spaces, studied ranching in Montana and worked in Wyoming as a cowboy and irrigator on a large traditional cattle ranch near Casper. Some practices, he noticed, made more work. Breeding was timed so the calves would be ready for the fall market. But that meant the ranchers had to herd the cows into a barn to avoid late winter blizzards. It stressed the animals, who were used to a life outside, and made more work for hired hands. It also cost about a dollar a day more per cow to feed them hay instead of grass.
In 1989 Mr. Kahrle met Alan Savory, a guru of sustainable range management. In seminars, Mr. Savory teaches ranchers to rethink everything they do to make less work, better beef, a better environment and more profit. 
For several years after he bought his ranch, which he named Sara Faith after his grandmothers, Mr. Kahrle held himself to even more stringent standards, raising organic beef with no pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, hormones or chemically fertilized hay. It meant a lot more work pulling weeds in his ditches by hand, for example, and prices weren't high enough to justify the extra effort. He decided to try the sustainable approach.
Sustainable beef takes a bigger picture into account, he says, and while it is not completely organic, it is mostly so. "I can use some spray to kill weeds in the ditches," he said. He doesn't use chemically fertilized hay, but in a pinch he can buy hay from a neighbor, something he couldn't do with organic certification. He can use antibiotics, but only if an animal is sick -- not as a preventative, as many ranchers do. 
One stumbling block has been finding enough processing plants, though small packers are emerging, especially in the West. And officials at Niman Ranch, which sells only sustainable beef, pork and lamb, say that in the last six years their revenues have risen to $30 million from $3 million. 
At its slaughterhouse near Boise, Idaho, Niman processes cattle when they are 18 to 24 months old, after they are "finished" with a diet of grain for four to five months. Because cattle companies do not want to spend the money to feed the animals so long, large packing houses slaughter the animals at 12 to 14 months. "That's way too premature," said Mr. Hurlbut of Niman Ranch. 
Niman's feed mix, he said, is fit for human consumption. Cattle raised in large feedlots often eat chicken parts and other waste products.
Niman's cattle have more room in their pens, he said, access to shade and a sprinkler, and ranch hands who are with them until the moment they are stunned and slaughtered, all of which reduce the ravages of stress. "You want an animal with proper, relaxed demeanor in the slaughterhouse," said Mr. Hurlbut, a former vegetarian. "You get more flavor out of the meat."
All of this tender loving care means, of course, that the consumer pays more. Mr. Hurlbut says his New York strip sells to restaurants for $11 a pound, while traditional beef sells for $7 to $8. Niman's beef is also available in stores for up to $20 a pound.
Other sustainable ranchers market free-range, grass-fed beef that never comes near a feedlot. 
"Grass-fed steaks are stronger in flavor and have more texture," said Rick Bayless, owner of the Mexican restaurants Frontera Grill and Topolobampo in Chicago, and a member of the Chefs Collaborative, a group of restaurateurs who promote sustainable food. He uses only grass-fed Montana beef.
The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, an industry trade group, says the concerns over how beef is raised and slaughtered are baseless. 
"It's a marketing distinction, not a distinction based on safety or nutrition" or taste, said Kim Essex, a spokeswoman for the group. "There's a high level of consumer confidence in the beef supply." 
Because many people worry that what they don't know will hurt them, Mr. Hurlbut says, meat with a pedigree is the future. His company tracks Mr. Kahrle's individual cattle, for example. After they are slaughtered, Mr. Kahrle gets a report card.
Now, a butcher who buys a pork loin from Niman Ranch can go to the company's Web site and see a picture of the farmer who raised the animal, his or her farm, and a short biography. Soon, the company hopes to expand that program to include lamb and the cattle Mr. Kahrle and ranchers like him raise. As Mr. Hurlbut put it, "It's all about knowing where your food came from and how it got to your plate."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
Poetry, Concrete and Cosmic, in a World of Losers

BYLINE:  By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
It's shameful, isn't it, what people will do these days to get their hands on a juicy piece of poetry? Deception, betrayal, kidnapping and assorted acts of violence are enlisted in the pursuit of things poetic in "The Night Heron," the teasing, brooding new play from Jez Butterworth.
 There is, on the one hand, that big cash prize for best poem that an unemployed gardener, trapped in a hardscrabble life in rustic England, plans to win if only he can figure out how to write the darn thing. On the other hand, there's poetry in the less literal, more cosmic sense: an uncovering of rhyme and reason in a brutal, random universe. 
 The self-sabotaging characters in "The Night Heron," which opened last night at the Atlantic Theater Company, are all looking for that kind of poetry, and the odds of their finding it are heartbreakingly slim. Which does not by any means keep them from being a highly entertaining set of losers. 
Mr. Butterworth made a blazing theatrical debut in New York in 1997 with "Mojo," a high-adrenaline play about crime, drugs and rock 'n' roll in the 1950's, also produced by the Atlantic. Though this production of "Night Heron" has the same director (Neil Pepe) and several of the same actors, it doesn't grab you with the immediacy that "Mojo" did.
The play wants to say so much that it chokes on its ambitions. And you're more aware than you were with "Mojo" of the problems of an American cast putting over regional English characters. Using poetry from writers like Andrew Marvell as its linguistic motor, "Heron" doesn't have the more easily addictive rock rhythms that kept "Mojo" in full spin.
But it is bracing to watch a talented dramatist stretch beyond the formula of his first success. And Mr. Butterworth -- who oversaw the film version of "Mojo" and wrote and directed the movie "Birthday Girl" with Nicole Kidman -- has by no means lost his gift for a kinetic use of language for the stage.
Mr. Butterworth belongs to a group of young English and Irish playwrights who have brought a heady new energy to the drama of disaffection. The more probing British plays of the mid- to late 20th century specialized in lives of quiet desperation.
Like his contemporaries Martin McDonagh (the "Leenane" trilogy) and Conor McPherson (in "This Lime Tree Bower" and "The Good Thief"), Mr. Butterworth likes his desperation loud, funny and flashy. He drags the subliminal menace of Harold Pinter to the surface, where it explodes into exotic, often violent mayhem that Quentin Tarantino might admire.
The central characters of "Night Heron," who live on the edge of a marsh in the Cambridgeshire Fens, certainly qualify as desperate. Wattmore (Chris Bauer) and Griffin (Clark Gregg) have lost their jobs as gardeners on the campus at Cambridge University.
They are getting hungrier and more frightened by the day, mysteriously cringing before the headlights of every car that passes. At Griffin's insistence they take in a lodger, a bruiser of a woman named Bolla (Mary McCann), who is just out of prison and eager to help her landlords make good.
As in "Mojo" and "Birthday Girl," Mr. Butterworth delights in imparting information with tantalizing slowness and in setting up situations that inspire double takes. The play bides its time, for instance, in explaining the unlikely presence of a wall-size copy of a Byzantine screen depicting the Last Judgment, in the squalid hovel shared by Wattmore and Griffin. (The skillfully claustrophobic set, which could do multiple duty for any number of Mr. McDonagh's plays, is by Walt Spangler.)
Then there's the moment when Wattmore wakes up to find an unknown naked man (possibly dead) on the floor and a large rabbit (definitely dead) dangling overhead.
Such seemingly dislocated elements are eventually sewn into a crazy quilt of a story along with a religious cult, a scout troop, the poisoning of a litter of puppies, tips for cultivating roses and the elusive heron of the title, who has been spotted in the region. Not to mention all that poetry of both the classic and the homemade variety through which the characters seek worldly and otherworldly salvation.
The zest of Mr. Butterworth's dialogue comes from mixed marriages of working-class vernacular and arty subjects, of earthiness and mysticism. And the careful, often touching performances never betray any awareness of incongruity. Especially fine is the symbiotic teamwork between Mr. Gregg, who suggests the feral cunning and fear of a cornered rodent, and Mr. Bauer, who has the glazed, suffering gaze of a martyred saint in a Baroque painting.
Ms. McCann, tricked up in a fat suit and a neopunk haircut, gives a deftly timed deadpan performance, and the audience seems to adore her. But the feeling that she is impersonating instead of embodying her character takes the edge off the very real danger that Bolla must exude.
Overall, this production -- which also features the reliable Atlantic regulars Jordan Lage and Jim Frangione -- is stronger on comic surface than tragic depths. And by evening's end you don't doubt that Mr. Butterworth is aspiring to tragedy of a sort, both particular and universal.
Like film noirs and ghost stories, "Heron" is most enjoyable when it sustains a state of suspense. Once things start falling into patterned place, an inevitable sense of letdown sets in. And Mr. Butterworth has combined so many anarchic quirks and twists of plot that the play finally sags beneath them. Before that moment arrives, though, there is plenty to bewitch and bewilder any theatergoer in search of an original and questing imagination.

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM EUROPE; 
Russia and Germany: A Reunion of Bookworms

BYLINE:  By Mark Landler

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
The word here is that Russia's publishing industry is back on its feet, after languishing for years amid the country's economic collapse and political dislocation. But more interesting than that bit of news, perhaps, is that Russia chose the Frankfurt Book Fair, which opened Tuesday, to trumpet its literary comeback.
 Indeed, the timing and the place are rich in symbolism. The nearly 100 Russian authors who are flocking to this mammoth gathering of agents, publishers and booksellers follow on the heels of political leaders who have cultivated closer ties between Russia and Germany. 
 While Germany and the United States are barely on speaking terms after their dispute over Iraq, Germany and Russia, which made common cause against the war, are basking in the glow of a rekindled relationship.
Earlier this year, Berlin and Moscow kicked off an ambitious program of cultural exchanges that will include art exhibits, theater, opera and ballet performances, and film festivals in both countries. To coincide with the book fair, the Schirn gallery here is showing a major exhibit on Stalinist art.
In a visit to St. Petersburg University in April, while the Iraq war was raging, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder declared that "German-Russian relations are the strongest they have been for 100 years."
That is not saying a great deal, of course. While the Russian-German relationship is marked by deep cultural affinities, it has been disfigured by two world wars and the cold war.
"Lenin, Trotsky and the other Communist leaders spoke German," said Wolfgang Eichwede, an expert on Russia at the University of Bremen. "But in World War II, we tried not only to defeat, but to annihilate, the Russians. We are relatives in culture, but enemies in war."
The first thawing of the ice in German-Russian cold war relations came in the 1970's, when Chancellor Willy Brandt apologized for Nazi crimes in Eastern Europe and embarked on Ostpolitik. This reconciliation with the Soviet bloc fanned the suspicions of Western conservatives about Brandt's reliability as an ally, but initiated a steady stream of contacts between the Soviets and the Germans.
With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Germany and Russia were able to start the arduous process of really normalizing their ties. The first steps were taken by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, and continued through the 1990's.
Russia's current president, Vladimir V. Putin, is rare among Russian leaders in having significant first-hand experience of Germany. As a young K.G.B. operative in the 1970's, he worked for several years in Dresden, in the former East Germany. 
"This has been very helpful, of course," said Vladimir V. Grigoryev, the deputy minister of press, television, and radio broadcasting, who heads the Russian delegation in Frankfurt. "He lived here, he speaks fluent German, he feels somehow comfortable with German culture."
The United States, usually a major player in Frankfurt, has a subdued presence this year, in part because the American subsidiary of Holtzbrinck, which owns St. Martin's Press and Henry Holt, is boycotting the fair, after a dispute over hotel rates and exhibition fees.
"The organizers made certain guarantees, and then they reneged on what they promised to do," said a spokesman for St. Martin's Press, John Murphy. "It was basically a question of broken trust."
The decision is all the more remarkable because Holtzbrinck's corporate parent, the Von Holtzbrinck Group, is based in Stuttgart. Holtzbrinck is making an exception for one of its imprints, Farrar Straus & Giroux, but only because it publishes Susan Sontag, who is receiving a prestigious German literary award, the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade.
Ms. Sontag has a loyal following in Germany, yet the timing of her award is also noteworthy. She was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq, and aroused fury among some conservatives in the United States by questioning whether it was accurate to describe the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 as "cowardly."
There are limits to how closely Moscow and Berlin can align themselves. Russia is not a member of NATO or the European Union. That is the very reason, some experts say, that the two are placing such an emphasis on cultural exchange.
But even such exchanges carry hidden dangers. On the eve of the fair, a Russian journalist whose reporting on her country's blood-stained involvement in Chechnya has won international acclaim said her invitation to appear on a panel there had been retracted because of pressure from Russian government officials.
The journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, was scheduled to appear on Saturday with two other Russians who have written about Chechnya -- a human rights activist and a philosopher. The German publisher who organized the panel denied feeling any pressure, and said it was simply not able to scrounge up the fare for her flight.
At this book fair, where rumor and cigarette smoke cloud the air in equal measure, the dispute has caused a stir. But in a measure of Russia and Germany's reconciliation, it is playing out less as an international incident than a publishing-industry tempest. 
Mr. Grigoryev also denied that Moscow had put pressure on the organizers, noting that the fair was likely to feature several panel discussions critical of the Russian government. 
A one-time book editor who worked briefly for Random House in New York, Mr. Grigoryev wondered whether Ms. Politkovskaya was practicing some shrewd marketing. "She knows that creating a little scandal is a great way to promote her writing," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Aremarkets for local advertising recovering? Yes, no, maybe: pick an answer, any answer.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
HOW fast the market for local advertising is recovering -- or even if it is recovering -- has become a subject of intense speculation along Madison Avenue. For those arguing whether or not there is evidence of a comeback, the answer echoes that from the old Certs commercial: Stop, you're both right.
 "Business pacings have become about as predictive as 'flipping a coin,' " one analyst, Marc E. Nabi of Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report titled "Radio Business Still Erratic -- Is It Up or Down?" 
 The answer: yes and no. 
The ardor of local advertisers' intentions to spend in media like television, radio and newspapers has been in question since Sept. 24. That was when Viacom Inc., the behemoth in radio, television and outdoor advertising, warned investors that revenue and profit for 2003 would fall short of estimates because of the uncertainty of spending plans by local media.
The belief that growth is slowing is supported by data being compiled by the Television Bureau of Advertising, the trade organization for local TV broadcasters. In a monthly report, which members are to receive today, Christopher J. Rohrs, president at the bureau, a national organization based in New York, wrote that it appears it will be "very tough to make our forecast range of 1 to 3 percent growth in 2003" because of a slowdown in gains since last month.
The primary culprit, Mr. Rohrs wrote, is the difficult comparisons with fall 2002, when spending for commercials on local TV stations surged compared with spending a year earlier. That year, of course, was 2001, when the terrorist attacks led to lower local TV spending in September through December. Another reason for the strength last fall, Mr. Rohrs noted, was the robust demand for commercial time for candidates in local, gubernatorial and Congressional elections.
There is still hope for 2003 to achieve the bureau's forecast range, Mr. Rohrs wrote, adding that "the key variables" are the demand for commercial time now among candidates for office and "how strong the holiday retail season is."
The retail spending picture was the focus of a report on Monday from Paul Ginocchio, the publishing analyst at Deutsche Bank, who reduced his estimate for retail ad growth for newspapers and questioned the prospects for ad revenue growth for radio.
The issue is not so much spending cutbacks by retailers, Mr. Ginocchio wrote, but the migration of ad spending by department stores to television from newspapers and also radio. For instance, the Macy's division of Federated Department Stores is planning a campaign with Lowe & Partners Worldwide in New York to run on TV that is meant to build the chain's brand image rather than sell specific merchandise.
"As the department stores become more willing to use other media," Mr. Ginocchio wrote, "newspapers will likely be forced to reduce ad rates to induce the retailers to remain in the fold."
Mr. Ginocchio wrote that he now expected retail spending in newspapers to increase 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter compared with spending in the period a year earlier, down from his previous forecast of a 3 percent gain. He also trimmed his estimate for 2004, predicting an increase of 2 percent rather than a previous estimate of 3 percent.
The report from Mr. Nabi of Merrill Lynch, also released Monday, focused on the outlook for radio.
"Companies did not have a definitive explanation as to why local business is weaker than national," Mr. Nabi wrote in summarizing meetings he had with managers from five major radio companies: Clear Channel Communications, Cox Radio, Cumulus Media, Emmis Communications and Radio One.
"The consensus was consistent with our theory," Mr. Nabi wrote, "that local businesses are hesitant to commit to advertising until proof of a recovery is evident in their pockets." That is particularly true for local businesses that are smaller than their national counterparts, he added.
Still, Mr. Nabi wrote, the radio station owners like Cox said they thought marketers "will have to return to advertising to help to attract demand as the economy improves."
The "glass is half-full" perception was also reflected by Gordon Hodge, analyst for Thomas Weisel Partners, who also issued a report Monday on the radio industry.
"We remain comfortable with our muted 2003 radio advertising growth forecast of 2.3 percent," Mr. Hodge wrote, with a slower growth rate of 1.7 percent in the second half.
For 2004, Mr. Hodge predicted, ad revenue for radio will increase 5.4 percent from 2003, with national sales outpacing local in gains by 7 percent to 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Rose 5.2%, Above Forecastfor August 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
Consumer debt rose 5.2 percent, or $8.2 billion, in August, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday.
 The gain exceeded expectations, with August being the fifth consecutive month consumer debt increased. 
The rise was led by a sharp increase in nonrevolving credit, which includes loans for cars, mobile homes, education expenses and vacations. 
 The July increase for overall credit was revised to $6.1 billion from the initially reported rise of $6 billion.
Wall Street analysts had expected a smaller August gain of $6.5 billion.
The report Tuesday was the first Fed release on consumer credit to include student loans held by the federal government and SLM Holding, the parent of Sallie Mae. The Fed revised its data to 1977, which shifted the growth rate of credit up four-tenths of a percentage point each year, it said.
Nonrevolving credit rose $7.0 billion after a $5.6 billion increase in July. Strong auto sales had been expected to give the category a lift, as terms continued to be easy for auto loans. Nonseasonally adjusted figures showed the average interest rate on a car loan from a finance company up slightly but still at a low 3.56 percent, while the length of the average loan extended further, to 63 months.
Revolving credit, capturing charge and credit cards, rose $1.2 billion in August after a $500 million increase in July.
The inclusion of the federal and SLM Holding student debt increased the overall level of consumer credit outstanding. The total stood at $1.956 trillion in August. The figure initially reported for July, before the change, was $1.774 trillion.

HEADLINE: Time and a Half in the Capitol 

 BODY:
In a rare Republican rebellion against pro-business priorities, the House has rejected a controversial plan to overhaul the rules covering overtime for millions of American workers. The House initially approved the plan last July, but several members of the G.O.P. majority, clearly sensing voters' concern about hard economic times, switched sides last week. 
That gave the second round to the Democrats, who were warning that many white-collar workers would be stripped of their overtime rights.
 The overtime proposals, already rejected by the Senate, attempt a double-edged change. The first part is commendable. It expands time-and-a-half rights for an estimated 1.3 million low-wage workers who are not covered by union contracts. They now lose eligibility once their earnings hit $8,060 a year; this would be raised to $22,100. More troublesome is the amorphous language that would allow employers greater leeway to designate a new class of white-collar professionals as managers and force them into unpaid overtime if they earn over $65,000 a year. Critics claim that as many as eight million workers, like nurses and computer specialists, could suffer pay cuts, but the administration insists that the changes would affect only 640,000 workers. 
 The White House is threatening to veto the annual spending bill for the labor and housing agencies if the overtime plan is not restored. The symbolic stakes are high as nervous Republicans seek to lace a touch of pro-worker appeal into voting records heavily weighted in favor of the administration's pro-business tax cuts. We urge the White House to accept a Senate proposal to raise overtime strictures on the underpaid, bottom-scale workers, but not tempt employers to save on well-earned overtime by handing out hollow managerial titles.

Dollar Weakens Again(No U.S. Tears Are Shed)

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar's fall accelerated yesterday, dropping below 110 yen, reaching an eight-year low against the Canadian dollar and slumping against the euro. But the decline is still small compared with previous episodes of weakness and, for now, is still a positive for the struggling American economy.
 But there seems to be confusion about what finance ministers in the Group of 7, who said after a meeting in Dubai last month that "exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals," want to happen to the dollar. That confusion could add to the downward pressure on the currency. 
 Part of the confusion comes from the politics and economics surrounding the policies here and abroad on the dollar. The Bush administration has been pressing China and Japan since the beginning of September to let their currencies rise and the dollar fall because many of the industries hurt by a stronger dollar have lost thousands of jobs and are in states that could be critical in next year's presidential election.
In addition, Europeans do not want the euro to gain too much against the dollar or the yen because that would hurt their exports and the rebound of their economies, which are weaker than the United States' economy.
At the same time, economists generally agree that a weaker dollar is a good policy as long as it does not get out of hand. The dollar has to fall, they say, if the United States is going to be able to stop the growth of its record current account deficit, which is now $500 billion. If the growth is not curtailed, the dollar could fall even faster while interest rates rise, slowing the economic recovery.
The dollar was at its lowest in almost three years against the yen yesterday, trading at 109.79, down 1.1 percent from Monday. The euro was trading at $1.1774, up 0.6 percent. The dollar fell 0.7 percent, to 1.3308 Canadian dollars.
In September, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow began what many foreign exchange traders think is a campaign to weaken the dollar, and since then the dollar has fallen 6.7 percent against the euro and 6.1 percent against the yen.
But against a broad index of major and minor trading partners, the dollar is down just 3 percent, even though it is down 15.3 percent this year against the currency of Canada, the biggest trading partner of the United States.
In addition, the dollar's decline since its recent peak in the trade-weighted index, in February, is only 9.6 percent, less than a third of the run-up in the dollar from July 1995 to February. This is also a much smaller decline than the big dollar fall in the late 1980's, which was helped along by an agreement, known as the Plaza Accord, among America's allies to weaken the dollar. From its high in March 1985, the dollar plunged 33.9 percent until it began to bounce back in July 1995.
"It is not a problem," Michael Rosenberg, head of global foreign exchange research at Deutsche Bank, said of the dollar's decline. "I don't think it will fall too fast," he added, which is usually the main concern among government officials and economists during such a down cycle.
One positive sign is that the stock and bond markets have rallied as the dollar has fallen. Since the beginning of September, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 3.1 percent. Treasury prices are also higher, pushing the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note down to 4.26 percent from 4.47 percent during the same period.
And, in fact, there are a lot of positives to a weaker dollar, including making American exports more competitive abroad while blunting the competitive edge of imports.
The United States and its allies have not come close to any big accord on the dollar yet. But the communique issued by the Group of 7 finance ministers after their meeting in Dubai was taken as a signal for a weaker dollar by many currency traders and analysts.
Since that meeting, however, some finance ministers have said that interpretation is incorrect. The communique, they said, was aimed at China and Japan, urging them to allow their currencies to rise in value against both the euro and the dollar. The Chinese yuan is pegged to the dollar while the Japanese have spent more than 13 trillion yen this year buying dollars to prevent the yen from rising too far.
While there was no clear sign of Japanese government intervention yesterday after the dollar fell below 110 yen, it could come again if the yen gains much more. But David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, said the Japanese might be realizing that "sustaining the kind of intervention we have seen to date is not practical and not looked kindly upon by Europe or the United States."
Ernst Welteke, a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, said yesterday that "markets have interpreted Dubai in a way that was not intended," according to Reuters. It was not intended to drive down the dollar.
Mr. Welteke may be especially annoyed because while the dollar has fallen against the yen since the Dubai meeting, the yen has not budged against the euro. In trading yesterday the euro was worth 129.27 yen, off just 0.3 percent since Sept. 19. In the same period, the dollar has fallen 3.7 percent against the yen.
"The market has received some messages that were not intended," said Robert Sinche, global head of currency strategy at Citigroup. It is one thing, he said, for finance ministers, including Mr. Snow, to say it is acceptable for the dollar to weaken as a result of normal market conditions. "It is another to say I want the dollar to be weaker."

Questions as N.H.L. Season Begins

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
When he left the Anaheim Mighty Ducks for the Colorado Avalanche as a free agent last summer, Paul Kariya took a pay cut that reduced his salary to $1.2 million from $10 million. Because he wanted to play with a friend, Teemu Selanne, on a strong team, he did not try to maximize his value on the market.
 His contract is one of many startling numbers zooming around the National Hockey League like so many errant slap shots. The N.H.L.'s 30 teams, according to the commissioner's office, collectively lost about $300 million last season. 
 Television figures, a barometer of the business, show the N.H.L.'s ratings in decline and its national network exposure slipping. Rather than competing with the National Football League, Major League Baseball or the National Basketball Association, the N.H.L. on television is compared to bowling, arena football and other lesser attractions. And the low rating numbers may mean less revenue in the next network contract, expected next season. 
The N.H.L. Players Association said it doubted the owners' claims of financial problems in the last year of a collective bargaining agreement.
If negotiations between the owners and the players lead to a lockout next fall, the way they did for 15 weeks in 1994-95, a new version of the World Hockey Association, currently in the planning stages, hopes to capitalize with new teams in an alternate league next fall.
So, as the N.H.L. prepares to begin its 87th season tonight, a reasonable person may wonder: is hockey in a recession? And, if so, what needs to change?
"The hockey business, from a revenue and attendance and exposure standpoint, from a licensing standpoint and a sponsorship standpoint, has probably never been stronger," Commissioner Gary Bettman said last week in a conference call with reporters. "But we have disparities between revenues and expenses."
According to the N.H.L., the teams spent 76 percent of last season's $1.927 billion in revenue on players' salaries, which have increased to an average of $1.79 million a player. "Player salaries have increased at a rate even faster than our revenues, and this is at the core of the economic problems we are having," Bettman said.
This is disputed by the union. "The conclusions we come to are dramatically different than the N.H.L.'s current claims of financial distress," Ted Saskin, the union's senior director, said. Saskin said that the union was prepared to make compromises that favor the owners, but that the players would not agree to a salary cap or any "cost control" system that prohibits owners from paying players according to the market.
"The N.H.L.'s financial leaks to date have been very selective and completely distorted," Saskin said in a telephone interview from Toronto. "There is no way that their claims of financial distress could withstand any informal level of scrutiny."
Clearly, the bleak picture is what many analysts are seeing. One is Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, a consulting firm based in Chicago that works with arena and stadium development, and franchise acquisitions. Ganis said 5 to 10 N.H.L. franchises could be sold, if there were buyers.
One reason there are no buyers, he said, is that "numerous teams are losing significant percentages of their asset value" and "the ratings agencies very seriously question the health of the N.H.L."
Ganis said: "You can't get financing. It's very difficult." He said it would remain difficult until the N.H.L. aligned revenues with expenses and spread revenues more equally among the clubs. The way it is now, he said, hockey revenues are "very, very disproportionate" in favor of franchises like the Rangers, Boston, Toronto, Detroit, Colorado and Dallas.
But Ganis also said that Bettman must get concessions not only from players, but also from owners, who need to share money. "Some teams will absolutely not want to do this," he said. 
Teams like Buffalo and Ottawa are recovering from bankruptcy. But Pittsburgh, a few years after a bankruptcy filing, is making ominous sounds about leaving town if it does not get a new arena.
No team embodies the N.H.L.'s mixed signals more than the Devils. Although they are defending the Stanley Cup championship for the third time in nine seasons, they are an afterthought in the sports consciousness of their own major news media market. They sold out only 6 of 41 regular-season home games in 2002-3, according to Lou Lamoriello, the team's president and general manager. He said that they did not make a profit despite four rounds of playoffs.
The sport that best shares revenue is the N.F.L. Its system allows teams like the Green Bay Packers to compete with the Giants. The bulk of the revenue comes from national television contracts that pay the league $2.2 billion a year, split equally among the league's 32 franchises.
But hockey's television picture is not as big, bright or clear.
In the current package, ABC and ESPN, which are owned by the Walt Disney Company, pay the league $120 million a season. In the previous deal, from 1994 through 1999, Fox paid the N.H.L. $30 million a season and ESPN paid the league an additional $14.3 million for a different package of games.
According to figures provided by ESPN, the average audience for games on ESPN2, on which the league gets most of its exposure, was only 0.23 of a ratings point for 50 games last season, the same rating as in the previous season and down from 0.25 in 2000-1. On ESPN, the ratings dipped to 0.46 from 0.49 in 2001-2 and .59 in 2000-1. On ABC, which broadcasts five games in the regular season, ratings fell by 21 percent. At present, one rating point equals 1.08 million television households.
In addition, hockey's exposure has decreased in recent years. On ESPN2, the number of games shown dropped from 100 in 2000-1 to 75 in 2001-2 and to 50 in 2002-3. On ESPN, the number of games in the same period has been reduced from 27 in 2001-2 to 21 in 2002-3. It will dip to 20 this season on ESPN and remain at 50 on ESPN2.
When Kariya left the Ducks, Selanne joined him in Colorado and took $700,000 less than the $6.5 million he would have earned with the San Jose Sharks. Kariya's decision, according to his agent, Don Baizley, was based on a desire to play an offensive style with a good team. In addition, by accepting less than his market value, Kariya can become a free agent again before next season because he is a 10-year professional earning less than the league average.
Perhaps it is only a coincidence that his availability will coincide with the planned start of the new W.H.A., currently being organized in Niagara Falls, Ontario, with Bobby Hull as its commissioner. Hull was the key player who left the N.H.L. in 1972 when the old W.H.A. was founded, moving from the Chicago Blackhawks to the Winnipeg Jets. The W.H.A. was in business for seven seasons before it folded and the N.H.L. absorbed four teams (Winnipeg, Edmonton, New England and Quebec).
Al Howell, the co-founder of the new W.H.A., said that his group hoped to sell 8 to 12 franchises for $1.5 million each and that an N.H.L. shutdown next fall would be "a big bonus for us."
His prediction echoes the worst-case scenario in an industry that expanded from 21 teams in 1990-91 to 30 teams in 2000-1. In that period, the league left two Canadian cities, Winnipeg and Quebec, and colonized markets in the Sun Belt in the United States, like Tampa/St. Petersburg, Fla., and Phoenix. Two-thirds of N.H.L. teams are playing in new arenas. Bettman was asked the chances of the N.H.L. reducing the number of teams. "None," he said.
One of his top aides for the first seven years of his administration was Steve Solomon, now an independent sports consultant. When asked whether the hockey business, over all, was healthy, Solomon said yes and no. He added that it was obviously a "very difficult year for the yes part."
The talk of a shutdown next year "makes it difficult for the fans to embrace the sport," Solomon said. Nevertheless, Solomon said, hockey will grow and its investors will enjoy the benefits, eventually. "It will have its ups and downs, like the New York Stock Exchange," he said. "Over the long haul, investors in the sport will see it grow. At the core is the game, and it is a great team sport."

Wall Street's October Winning Streak Goes to Fifth Day

BYLINE:  The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street extended its October winning streak into a fifth day yesterday, although trading was erratic as investors shied away from big commitments in advance of third-quarter earnings reports.
 Analysts said investors were likely to remain cautious as economic news trickled in, and they warned that the market could become volatile if company results revealed many negative surprises. 
 "I think we're going to have a choppy market here for a while as the earnings come out," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "But the tone of the market is still optimistic." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 59.63 points, or 0.6 percent, at 9,654.61, after recovering from midday losses.
 The broader market also reversed course to close higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.39 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,907.85. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.90 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 1,039.25.
 Trading was quiet as many investors were waiting for third-quarter earnings reports. Companies were beginning to report results this week, starting with Alcoa after the close of markets and Yahoo today. Many analysts think earnings will have to not only meet, but exceed, estimates for stocks to move higher after six months of gains.
 After the close of trading, Alcoa, the nation's largest aluminum manufacturer, said its earnings had risen 45 percent, beating analyst expectations by 4 cents a share.
 Investors were pleased with the news. Alcoa rose 96 cents in after-hours trading, after losing 8 cents, to close at $28.19, in regular trading.
 Few companies have issued earnings warnings, which bodes well for the market in the next few weeks of third-quarter reports, said Neil Massa, an equity trader at John Hancock Funds. The lack of news has not exactly enticed investors, he said, but low trading volume is normal for a time like this.
 "I don't think there's any worry here," Mr. Massa said. "People are just taking some money off the table, and that's a natural progression, not a fundamental shift in sentiment."
 Arnie Holzer, senior investment strategist at Deutsche Asset Management Americas, said investors were wary, but it was not because they did not think there was a recovery under way. 
 Stocks appeared to be getting some support from the dollar, which weakened slightly against the Japanese yen, trading at 109.79, down from 111.03 Monday. Analysts said this could be good news for large-cap companies, technology concerns and industrial goods producers that rely heavily on exports that are cheaper to buy when the dollar is down.
 McDonald's gained 62 cents, to close at $24.72, after the Smith Barney unit of Citigroup upgraded its rating to buy from hold, citing good sales prospects.
 PepsiCo was down 10 cents, to close at $47.40, in spite of its reported 13percent rise in profits, which met analysts' expectations.
 El Paso fell 20 cents, to close at $7.65, after the Securities and Exchange Commission notified the company that it was investigating some of its filings.
 Terayon Communication Systems closed up $1.50, or 24.2 percent, at $7.71, after the broadband equipment provider said its third-quarter revenues would beat estimates.
 LookSmart slid $1.58, or 52.3 percent, to close at $1.44, after Microsoft said it would end a licensing agreement with the company in January 2004.

Treasury Prices Fall
(Reuters)
 Treasury bond prices veered lower yesterday as a flood of new supply and a fresh slide in the dollar diminished the allure of government debt.
 A slew of corporate issues were brought to market this week, including a highly rated 10-year offering from Goldman Sachs that was met with such great demand that its size was nearly doubled.
 Traders were also worried that the market might have a tough time absorbing the $16 billion auction of new five-year Treasury notes today, after last week's rise in payrolls prompted a sell-off in bonds.
 By late in the day, the 10-year note fell 23/32, to a price of 99 29/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.26 percent from 4.17 percent. And the 30-year bond fell 1 10/32, to 103 6/32; its yield climbed to 5.16 percent from 5.07 percent.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

U.S. Sees Gas Heating Costs Roughly at Last Year's Levels

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
The natural gas price spikes of last winter will not be repeated in the coming months if temperatures are normal, the Energy Department predicted on Tuesday. 
 Even so, people who heat their homes with natural gas will have slight increases in their bills, the department predicted, while those who use oil or propane will have slight reductions. 
 In an annual report, the Winter Fuels Outlook, the department predicted an average cost for residential customers of $9.17 for each 1,000 cubic feet, up from $8.39 last year, but said they will use less. Last year was about 3 percent colder than average, and 8 percent colder in the Northeast; the Energy Department is assuming an average winter this year and lower fuel consumption as a result. 
 Heating oil will sell for an average price of $1.33 a gallon, the same as last year, the department said, and propane for $1.21 a gallon, up a penny from last winter.
"On average, the U.S. consumer will be paying less," said Guy Caruso, the administrator of the Energy Information Administration. 
 He called the prediction for this year "basically a neutral outlook."
 That is considerably improved from earlier in 2003, when inventories of oil and natural gas were extremely low. Natural gas supplies are now in the normal range, and Mr. Caruso said he was surprised at how fast they had been rebuilt. High natural gas prices last winter stimulated drilling and resulted in a 2 percent increase in domestic production this year, he said. In addition, a wet, cool summer held down demand for electricity made from natural gas, and an economic slowdown depressed industrial demand for gas.
 But some of last winter's run-up in gas prices will be reflected in the prices charged by distributors this winter, he said.
 Oil inventories, which were lower because of reduced production from Venezuela during political unrest there, have also recovered.
 Residential consumers may still find this an expensive winter by recent standards, he said. "Eight of the 10 years in the 90's were warmer than normal," Mr. Caruso said. "Consumers tended to get used to those." 
 The department projected that the commodity price of oil would stay near $30 a barrel for the American benchmark, West Texas intermediate crude oil, slightly lower than last winter. Natural gas at the wellhead will average around for 1,000 cubic feet, about 30 cents less than last year, it forecast. For all of 2003, the average wellhead price will be about $4.90, Mr. Caruso said, up from $3 in 2002, and will be about $4 for all of 2004.
 Prices briefly rose to $7 last winter.
 The predictions exclude extraordinary events, like extreme weather conditions or turbulence in oil-exporting countries. Mr. Caruso said Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela could each experience events that would reduce overall oil production.
 He said that oil supplies were still low in this country. Shortages in heating oil can be made up by shipments from Rotterdam, he said. But new rules on gasoline taking effect in New York and Connecticut on Jan 1. will reduce the ability of European refiners to supply markets in those states, he said. The two states will ban the gasoline additive MTBE, and refiners there will have to use ethanol instead to meet a requirement for an oxygenate in gasoline. But ethanol evaporates easily, leading to air pollution, so gasoline that is to be blended with ethanol has to be refined differently, in a way that is not commonly done in Europe.

HEADLINE: China Promises More Investment in Southeast Asia 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct. 7 

 BODY:
The prime minister of China, Wen Jiabao, making his first appearance before Southeast Asian leaders Tuesday, announced that his government would encourage greater investment in the region by Chinese companies.
 This increased corporate presence, combined with the marked surge in trade between China and the region, shows China's desire to "bring tremendous immediate and long-term benefits to Asian countries," he said. 
 Sounding more like a champion salesman than the number-crunching manager of the world's fastest-growing economy, Mr. Wen suggested that in two years China's trade with the 10 Southeast Asian nations could come very close to or even surpass that between the United States and Southeast Asia. The prime minister entered the meeting of business leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as Asean, with his hands clasped above his head. 
 To a region battered by a financial crisis six years ago, and still recovering, his message was: don't fear us, love us. China represents a big market, and is a big investor, and its very size will help lift all boats, he suggested. At the end of his spirited address, he received robust applause from the gathering here on the island of Bali.
 China, Japan and South Korea participate in the Asean summit meeting, although they are not members of the regional group. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan spoke immediately after the Chinese leader, and in contrast, delivered an address in a more subdued tone about Japanese development aid to the region.
 At the opening of the meeting Tuesday, the leaders signed a document to establish an Asean economic community, a move that has been largely forced upon them by the sudden competition from China.
 Two of the Asean leaders, Goh Chok Tong of Singapore and Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand, say they urgently want a common market in Southeast Asia so that the region can face China from a position of strength.
 But in closed-door negotiations Tuesday, Singapore and Thailand were unable to persuade the other countries to move closer the current 2020 deadline for completely forming a common market.
 Timelines were set out for completing liberalization in 11 priority sectors including auto parts, agricultural commodities and tourism by 2010. Still, there were no steps for completing entire market integration of any one sector before 2010.
 The document pledged to "streamline" decision making and to strengthen institutions for enforcing the economic liberalization.
 But in deference to Asean's basic principle of noninterference with each member's affairs, the document said that "consensus" would govern the decision-making by the economic bodies.
 In another indication of China's dominance at this year's summit, on Wednesday the Chinese leader is scheduled to sign three documents with the Asean group. These include a treaty of amity that pledges China and the Asean countries to promote stability and cooperation in the region. 
 Mr. Wen will also sign an "early harvest" agreement that will allow some Asean countries to receive beneficial treatment from China on some products, primarily in agriculture. A third document, called the China-Asean strategic partnership, is similar to agreements Asean has with Russia and the United States.
 Among those in the audience for Mr. Wen's speech were some of the nearly 50 executives from China's banking, auto, telecommunications and advertising industries who came to the meeting. 
 Mr. Wen was not specific about which Chinese corporations would be encouraged to come to the region. Chinese energy companies have already started investing in Indonesia's oil and gas fields, and have announced intentions to buy even bigger interests.
 The prime minister said that direct investment from China to Asian countries was growing at more than 20 percent annually, and in some countries even more than 40 percent.
 "With the further expansion of China's economy, an increasing number of competitive Chinese companies will go to Asian countries and be directly involved in local economic development," he said.
 An American business executive in the audience said the prime minister's statement about Chinese investment in the region amounted to a government directive.
 "When Wen says: 'We're telling Chinese business to come down here,' in the Chinese system that's a mandate," said Ernest Z. Bower, the president of the US-ASEAN Business Council.
 In stressing the fast-growing trade between China and the Southeast Asian region, Mr. Wen said that he believed that a China-Asean free trade area would be completed by 2010. The initiative for the free trade area came from China last year and "positive headway" has been made in negotiations, the prime minister said.
 Trade between China and Southeast Asia had grown by 55.5 percent in the first six months of this year, he said.
 "If it grows at the current speed, bilateral trade volume is expected to surpass $100 billion in 2005," he said.
 Trade between the United States and the Asean countries was $120 billion last year, Mr. Bower said.
 "I got the feeling that China is looking very closely at that U.S. number," he added.

HEADLINE: Grass Is Green for Amazon Farmers 

BYLINE:  ByTONY SMITH 

DATELINE: CAMPO LIMPO, Brazil 

 BODY:
Jose Mateus has placed his hopes for the future in the sweet-scented grass now reaching shoulder height in the fields he farms not far from where he lives with his family of four sons and over a dozen grandchildren in this poor dusty community on the Amazon delta. 
 The grass, known as priprioca, should fetch twice the price of the watermelons and manioc that Mr. Mateus, 52, has traditionally grown in this area, which is a two-hour drive southwest of Belem. If the new crop succeeds, he says, it "will change everything in our lives --better houses for us, better food for our kids." 
 That Mr. Mateus and his equally poor neighbors nurture such hopes at all is thanks largely to Natura, a Brazilian cosmetics company that has helped pay for the planting of the grass and has promised to buy it all to make a new perfume it hopes to sell to environmentally conscious consumers. Natura plans to go global with a range of body care products made from exotic fruits, roots and nuts, all harvested in sustainable forest reservations or on small, traditional plantations like Mr. Mateus's. 
 Executives at Natura, which is based in Sao Paulo, argue that by buying produce from the forest dwellers and also from farmers like Mr. Mateus, they can help preserve the Amazon's rich biodiversity and its intricate ecological balance while still earning a profit for their company. But can they succeed where bigger corporations with deeper pockets, firmly established in the developed world, have failed?
 The Body Shop and Ben & Jerry's, for example, scored runaway commercial successes in the 1990's with eco-friendly products from the Amazon, but then found that they had badly damaged their reputations when they were unable to keep up with demand and were forced to turn to more conventional sources to supply the market.
 Such a test now looms for Natura as it prepares to roll out its Ekos brand of shampoos, soaps, massage oils and perfumes next year in Europe. Sales to the United States should follow in 2005, according to Pedro Passos, the chief executive of Natura. 
 Natura hopes to capture a relatively modest $200 million slice of the estimated $6 billion worldwide market for natural or organic cosmetics, which would lift its current sales of about $500 million within Brazil by about 40 percent. But to do so Natura will have to compete directly with well-known international brands like Yves Rocher, L'Occitane, Bodyworks, Origins and Aveda.
 While eager to repeat the commercial success of the Body Shop and Ben & Jerry's, Natura executives are equally eager to avoid the problems faced by both those companies. Ben & Jerry's Rainforest Crunch ice cream and the Body Shop's creamy Brazil nut shampoos and conditioners were once hailed -- by their producers and consumers -- as products that could help save the Amazon by offering local farmers an alternative to the illegal, and highly profitable, logging of tropical timber and forest clearing for mining, cattle raising or intensive farming of soybeans and other cash crops.
 But as demand exploded, the Amazon cooperative that harvested Brazil nuts for the ice cream could not meet demand and Ben & Jerry's had to buy nuts on the open market supplied by large-scale producers, some notorious for their antilabor practices. Rainforest Crunch was discontinued in 1997.
 The Body Shop ran into trouble when aid groups and its Brazilian representative sharply criticized statements by the company's founder, Anita Roddick, that the Amazon natives were being paid first-world wages for growing Brazil nuts. To add to the Body Shop's troubles, a chief of the Kayapo tribe, a main supplier and symbol of the company's "Trade Not Aid" initiatives, filed suit over the use of his image in Body Shop promotions. The Body Shop now buys Brazil nuts from a larger-scale Amazonian cooperative and also from Peru.
 "It wasn't that the intentions of Ben & Jerry's or the Body Shop were not good," said Jon Entine, a expert on business ethics. "It's just that when they found out just how difficult it was, they took the easy way out and began behaving like any other big corporation."
 The Amazon is still shrinking fast. Last year, another 10,000 square miles of rainforest -- an area roughly the size of Belgium -- were lost mainly to pasture land, soybean plantations and illegal logging, representing a 40 percent increase in deforestation compared with the previous year. 
 So, is Mr. Mateus right in pinning his hopes on priprioca? Certainly, according to Eduardo Luppi, Natura's director of innovation.
 Priprioca, which has long been grown in small quantities in the region, was first spotted by a member of Mr. Luppi's research team hanging on a herb stall at the dockside Ver-o-peso market in the bustling Amazon port of Belem. 
 The researchers were charmed by the plant's scent, but dismayed when they found out the market was supplied by only one tiny farming community that grew just four tons of the grass a year. For an annual run of perfume, Natura needed at least 40 tons.
 Mr. Luppi's team persuaded the farming community to share its expertise with two others, including Campo Limpo. Natura bought bulbs from the original community to plant and promised to buy crops from all three groups.
 "We don't want this model to be valid for just two or three families," Mr. Luppi said. "It has to be more than emblematic, more than a niche. And we have to make money."
 Mr. Luppi is also working on switching all Natura's Ekos soaps from tallow to a vegetable oil base, meaning a potential extra $3,000 a year income -- a small fortune by local standards -- for another 1,000 families in the region.
 As many farming communities already sell fruit and vegetables or milk to regional cooperatives, Mr. Luppi is simply asking those cooperatives to start handling oil pressed from Brazil nuts, andiroba and passion fruit seeds, too. 
 Using a cooperative, however, did not work for Ben & Jerry's. And the Body Shop found it difficult to coordinate supplies from isolated pockets of the Amazon jungle. So why should Natura have more success? 
 "We do have the advantage that we are Brazilian and we are in Brazil," Mr. Luppi said. "If you are in England or America and want to manage something like this in the Amazon by remote control, you can forget it."
 While skeptical that the market for Amazon products can produce another boom like that of the 1990's, experts here say the global niche is still big enough to make it worth Natura's while. 
 "If they learn from others mistakes in the past, they could do it," said Saulo Petean, a former representative for the Body Shop in Brazil. "As long as the social responsibility thing doesn't become just another marketing tool, it is possible to do both things -- be responsible and turn a profit."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET --Stamford; 
An Empire Of Offices Fades Out

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 3 

 BODY:
High Ridge Park, a 38-acre harbinger of the suburban office campus boom of the 1970's and 1980's was sold this week to the George Comfort & Sons Real Estate Company in Manhattan for $86 million. It was the last remaining piece of a 4.4-million-square-foot real estate empire created in Stamford from the mid-1960's to the mid-1980's by the F.D. Rich Company. Much of the rest was lost during the real estate debacle of the late 1980's and early 1990's.
 The High Ridge Park property had been marketed sporadically for the last four years by F.D. Rich and its partners, Hoffman Investment Partners of Stamford, the Samuel Miller family of Stamford, and the Calmon Ginsberg family of New York. 
 Built in the mid-1960's to attract corporations seeking to escape costs, crime and congestion in New York, the park's 500,000 square feet of office space was dispersed among six buildings designed for individual tenants.
 "We were listening when Pepsico, American Can, Olin, and the New York Stock Exchange were talking about leaving Manhattan," said Robert N. Rich, the company's vice chairman. "We built the park for $30 million, including $446,796 for the land. 
 "There was no office market then," he added. "We were the only ones with space. General Time and CBS Laboratories moved in, followed by Contintental Oil, Texas-Gulf, General Signal, Xerox, Citizens Utilities and the American Thread Company." Rents were $5.75 a square foot annually and leases stretched to 20 years. Current rents range from the $20's to the low $30's and leases are generally 10 years. 
 The F.D. Rich Company, founded in 1920 by Frank D. Rich Sr. put the park three and a half miles from downtown, where, as Stamford's designated urban renewal developers, it was supervising a huge demolition project to make way for the rebuilt central business district. 
 While some companies wanted a campus, others wanted to be downtown. Robert Rich and his brother, Frank D. Rich Jr., put up buildings along a mile-long stretch of Interstate 95 and on Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard. Among them were the Landmark Building office tower; Stamford Town Center; the GTE Building; Champion International; the Marriott Hotel; Nos. 4, 6, 8, and 10 Stamford Forum; 300 Atlantic Street; and 177 Broad Street. 
 Almost all passed from the Rich Company's control during the 1980's and 1990's. The company recently sold the remaining three acres of the old urban renewal site to Target. Once dominant in Stamford, the Rich company now retains only a 15 percent interest in the Stamford Town Center. 
 High Ridge Park and its futuristic buildings designed by Victor Bisharat were ridiculed by architecture critics. The General Time Building was likened to a space ship, a flying saucer or a hamburger, and the park itself was deemed the equivalent of a nouveau riche housing project.
 "That didn't stop the public from lining up to get into the General Time Building," Mr. Rich said. "It was open for tours on Sundays." Nor did it inhibit rentals that kept the park going in good times and bad. 
 Some buildings now have multiple tenants and the vacancy rate within the park is the same as Stamford's overall office vacancy rate: 14 percent. Among the longtime single-occupancy tenants are Cadbury Beverages, Citizens Communications and Mead/Westvaco. 
 Marketing of the park was taken over in February by Jeffrey R. Dunne, senior vice president for investments, and his team at CB Richard Ellis, producing seven bids, mostly from New York and Chicago. The offer from George Comfort & Sons' offer was the one accepted.
 "We didn't hit their dream price, but it was pretty good," Mr. Dunne said. The park's location off High Ridge Road and Exit 35 of the Merritt Parkway, its condition and landscaping were cited with its history of high-quality tenants as selling points, Mr. Dunne said.
 F.D. Rich's share of the proceeds will be deployed among new ventures created by the family's third generation, Thomas L. Rich, Robert's son. "There will be no over-leveraging, no repeat of the '80's and early '90's," he said. "We contemplate being active regionally, acquiring and developing primarily commercial properties along the Boston- to-Washington corridor."
 High Ridge Park's new owner, which traces its existence to a small residential firm in 1919, became a strictly commercial owner and manager after World War II.
 "We had been looking for opportunities in the tristate and East Coast regions," said Peter Duncan, Comfort's president, "and we saw High Ridge Park in 1999, but it was taken off the market. When it became available again we returned. 
 "It is our first acquisition in Connecticut," Mr. Duncan said. "We have lots of plans for updating the systems, redecorating and making sure the properties are as current technologically as they should be."

JETBLUE AIRWAYS ANNOUNCES 3-FOR-2 STOCK SPLIT

BYLINE:  By Edward Wong (NYT)

 BODY:
 JetBlue Airways said yesterday that it would issue a 3-for-2 split of its common stock. 
The split will be given out on Nov. 20 to people and institutions holding shares at the end of business on Nov. 10. After the split, the company, based in Queens, will have about 101 million outstanding shares of common stock, an increase of 50 percent. The company has remained profitable since its start, even as larger, more traditional airlines have suffered huge losses during the economic downswing and in the aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. JetBlue closed at $67.70 a share yesterday, up from $27 when the stock was first offered to the public, a year-and-a-half ago. Edward Wong (NYT)
