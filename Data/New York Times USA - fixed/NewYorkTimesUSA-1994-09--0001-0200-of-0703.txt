HEADLINE: Vatican Says Gore Is Misrepresenting Population Talks

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Six days before the United Nations population conference in Cairo, the Vatican made an unusual, personal attack today on Vice President Al Gore, accusing him of misrepresenting the gathering's intentions on abortion.
The accusations were a setback for the Clinton Administration's effort to lower the level of discord with the Vatican over the conference. They also signaled the Vatican's continued readiness to confront the United States over central moral issues. 
 Since preparations for the conference began in April, Pope John Paul II and his aides have taken the lead in condemning it as likely to legitimize abortion as a means of birth control, in direct contradiction of Roman Catholic doctrine on the sanctity of life from the moment of conception.
Today's broadside by Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Pope's chief spokesman, was the first time that the Vatican had formally accused the United States of being the principal sponsor of pro-abortion policies and also the first time it had publicly attacked a high American official by name.
"Mr. Al Gore, Vice President of the U.S.A. and member of the American delegation, recently stated that 'the United States has not sought, does not seek and will not seek to establish an international right to abortion,' " Mr. Navarro-Valls said at a news conference today. "The draft population document, which has the United States as its principal sponsor, contradicts, in reality, Mr. Gore's statement."
Mr. Gore made the remark quoted by the Vatican at the National Press Club in Washington this week. When asked for a response, Lorraine Voles, the spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, said tonight, "As we deal with the Vatican on a host of issues, there is much more on which we agree than we disagree."
But she added, "In this particular area, there are some differences."
To substantiate his assertion, Mr. Navarro-Valls quoted from passages in the conference document referring, for instance, to "the right to have access to methods of fertility regulation which are safe, efficacious, accessible and acceptable." He said the World Health Organization had defined "fertility regulation" as including abortion.
 
Vatican Guidelines
 A Vatican working document containing guidelines for the Vatican's delegation at the conference also alludes to other excerpts from the document saying "pregnancy termination" should be included in the "reproductive health care" services available to women.
The document itself, in a chapter covering "reproductive rights and reproductive health," speaks of "the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of fertility regulation of their choice" -- a notion that the Vatican says is tantamount to abortion on demand. The phrase "reproductive rights" is often used in the United States as a synonym for abortion rights.
At his news conference, Mr. Navarro-Valls repeatedly singled out the Clinton Administration as the sponsor of much of the document's most contentious language, as if seeking to polarize the debate between "this administration," as he called the American Government, and people of different views in the United States and elsewhere.
By stressing the unusual usage -- "this administration" -- Mr. Navarro-Valls seemed to be suggesting that the Clinton Administration was not representative of mainstream governmental American thought and that its policies might therefore turn out to be transitory and lacking in credibility. Certainly, the Vatican was far more comfortable with the anti-abortion policies of the Reagan Administration than with Mr. Clinton's insistence that abortion be safe, legal and rare.
While the spokesman for Mr. Gore argued today that his comments represented American policy, the Vatican is seeking to suggest that the Clinton Administration is saying one thing publicly while advancing different views in the conference document.
 
A Wider Audience
 By attacking Vice President Gore and seeking to highlight inconsistencies in the American position, Mr. Navarro-Valls also seemed to be reaching to a wider audience in the Islamic world and the third world, seeking to win allies for the Vatican's cause by damaging the United States' credibility among those long used to questioning American intentions.
He said the Vatican would seek consensus at the conference, but would not shy from a straight vote among delegations, arguing that a ballot showing dissent from any final declaration would strip the conference's conclusions of "moral authority."
The Vatican has also raised objections to parts of the document on unsafe abortion that state "all governments, intergovernmental organizations and relevant nongovernmental organizations are urged to deal openly and forthrightly with unsafe abortion as a major health concern."
The internal Vatican working document argues: "It is often said that the Cairo conference speaks of abortion only to express concern for the many women who die as a result of 'unsafe abortion,' whether legal or illegal. But the text then asks governments to review their laws on abortion and to provide medical care to women who decide to terminate their pregnancies."
 
A Change in Focus
 The Vatican attack further raised the political temperature in advance of a gathering that has drawn what Italian commentators call the Pope's most determined campaign since his battle against Communism in his native Poland.
At issue mainly is language in the conference draft proposals that has drawn attention away from the gathering's stated aim -- to agree on ways to deal with a global crisis in population growth -- and focused it instead on what, for the Vatican, is the vital question of whether the proposals enshrine abortion and sex outside of marriage as human rights.
Specifically, Mr. Navarro-Valls said today, terms in the document like "reproductive health" and "reproductive rights" introduce the idea of "in effect, abortion on demand" as a proposed international right to be established by the gathering.
In what seemed a thinly veiled allusion to what the Vatican considers excessive influence on the drafting of the proposals by American feminists, Mr. Navarro-Valls said the Cairo gathering risked becoming "a session called to sanction a current life style in minority circles of certain opulent societies" and to impose those values on "the emerging, less developed cultures of our society."
The Vatican's determined position against the document reflects the huge differences in fundamental perceptions of what the conference is all about. For feminists, the gathering represents a potential turning point in elevating the economic and political status of the world's women as a way of encouraging them to curb the size of their families. The feminists also support the idea of making information on birth control available to all, including women who are not married.
For the Roman Catholic hierarchy, though, the gathering is seen as a moment that could enshrine in international agreements amoral notions relating to abortion, adolescent sexuality and the central role that the church believes should be played by the family.
"It is not a casual fact that an institution so natural, fundamental and universal as marriage is practically absent in the document text," Mr. Navarro-Valls said.
 
Backing From Islam
 While the Vatican has denied striking a formal alliance with Islamic countries, it has won significant backing from Islamic scholars who, like some Roman Catholic figures, argue that the effect of the document is to promote adolescent promiscuity, abortion and homosexuality.
Saudi Arabia, the Sudan and Lebanon have announced they will not attend the 170-nation conference in Cairo, where Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists threatened last week to attack participants in what they term the "conference of licentiousness." The Turkish Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, worried by strengthening Islamic sentiment in her own country, has also said she will not attend.
Beyond the arguments over abortion, the Vatican is also fundamentally opposed to the idea that population growth in itself is necessarily a hindrance to development.
According to the United Nations Population Fund, the world's population is set to increase from its current 5.6 billion to 8.5. billion in the year 2025. The Cairo conference is supposed to approve measures to stabilize the world's population at 7.27 billion by the year 2050.
"Population policies are only a part of development policy," Mr. Navarro-Valls said. "In fact they include a whole range of areas: nutrition, medicine, agriculture, education, demographics, economics and politics, together with more profound moral and spiritual dimensions. True development will not be respected if only demographic data is considered as the obstacle to development."
Such arguments reflect the Vatican's deep-rooted opposition to all forms of artificial contraception.

HEADLINE: When Children Kill Children: Boy, 11, Is Wanted in Chicago

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Someone stepped out of the shadows between two storefront churches on the city's far South Side the other night and started shooting wildly at a knot of teen-agers playing football.
When the gunfire stopped, a 14-year-old girl lay dead, killed by a bullet apparently meant for someone else. At first, the shooting appeared to be another senseless, though increasingly common, story of an innocent slaughtered in the street. 
 But the slaying of Shavon Dean has become more than that. It has shaken this city and made many here fear for the future, not because of the victim's tender years but because of the even younger age of her suspected killer, an 11-year-old boy.
The suspect, who police say belongs to a gang, stands 4-foot-8, sports a tattoo that says "I love mommy" and has an arrest record that could belong to a middle-age thug.
And ever since the shooting last Sunday night, the boy has eluded the police and their growing child-hunt.
"This is a tragedy for everybody on both sides," Shavon's aunt, Ida Falls, said today. "That boy is 11 years old. He don't know no better. The gangs tell him what to do and he does it. He's just a child, a child that killed a child."
The boy, who has not been identified by the police because of his age, lived around the corner from Shavon and is known in the neighborhood for causing trouble. He is also a suspect in the shooting and wounding of a teen-age boy earlier on Sunday in another skirmish in what seems like a never-ending gang war here.
But gunplay and funerals are not confined to big cities and their street gangs. In the apple-growing community of Wenatchee, Wash., about 160 miles east of Seattle, two 12-year-old boys were recently accused of killing a 50-year-old migrant farm worker.
The boys, the police say, shot the man 18 times with two stolen pistols after he told them to stop making noise and, they boys said, threw a rock at them.
In each case, the common thread is the ability of children to get their hands on guns.
Shavon Dean lived in a working-class neighborhood of single-story homes with neat lawns. But so much gunfire had rattled the area in the days leading up to her slaying, residents say, that most parents were telling their children to stay on their tree-shaded street -- where it was supposed to be safe. One of the churches on 108th Street had even erected a curbside basketball hoop so that teen-agers on the block would not have to go to school to play and risk being caught in a crossfire.
"When I was coming up," said Kenneth Reed, 22, "I had role models, somebody to look up to. It ain't that way any more. Now, you look up to the person with the biggest gun."
The 11-year-old boy wanted in Shavon's death has the kind of scarred personal background often associated with later violence.
"This is a tragic, tragic case" the Cook County Public Guardian, Patrick T. Murphy, who represents children and the elderly in the courts, said today. "This is a kid who has had nothing going for him his entire life."
The boy grew up amid gangs, drugs and rising unemployment. Mr. Murphy said the boy's mother was 15 when she first gave birth; she was 18 when he was born. Martha Allen, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, said that when the boy's mother was 21 he and four of his siblings were taken from her because of neglect and, in the cold code of bureaucracy, "risk of harm.".
The boy and his siblings were placed in the custody of their grandmother, who is now 46. She told The Chicago Sun-Times: "They are lying that he is supposed to have done some shooting. He's a nice kid, until he gets with the wrong group."
 
'A Time Bomb'
 According to child welfare documents, when the boy was 3 and taken from his mother to be put into his grandmother's care, he had several cigarette burn marks on his neck, shoulder and buttocks and other signs of physical abuse. "This kid was a time bomb waiting to explode," Mr. Murphy said. "He was turned into a sociopath by his family."
In the last eight years, officials say, the boy and an older brother have often run away from their grandmother's home, and late last year the boy was made a ward of the state.
He was placed in a group home on the city's North Side, but ran away in March and stayed on the run for several weeks, when he was picked up in a stolen car and held in a juvenile detention center. He was released in July, but was later arrested on an armed-robbery charge, and two days after that on a burglary charge. At the time of the shootings last Sunday, the authorities were planning to send him to a juvenile center out of the state.
His troubles with the law began at least two years before. In early 1992, he was arrested on a shoplifting charge. That same year, the police arrested him on charges of criminal damage to property and robbery. In 1993, he was arrested on a charge of attempted armed robbery.
At a news conference to discuss the city's crime-fighting programs, the police superintendent, Matt Rodriguez, said that while no motive had been found for the shooting that took Shavon Dean's life, older members of street gangs often recruited children to sell drugs and carry out shootings; this helps older gang members avoid arrest and the harsher sentences that adults receive.
"The 11-year-old is dangerous," Superintendent Rodriguez said, "but he is still an 11-year-old."
Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said the state's juvenile justice system should be changed to "keep kids away from abusive and negligent parents and off the streets."
"This young kid," the Mayor said of the 11-year-old, "has fallen through the cracks."
The 11-year-old knew Shavon, said her aunt, Mrs. Falls, who stood near a street shrine of flowers and handwritten messages of grief and love to Shavon. Mrs. Falls said she took the boy and 12 other children to a local police station about three weeks ago to watch a film on crime. She said that she had liked the boy, who seemed quiet, but that the police had asked her not to bring him back because he had picked fights with some of the other children.
All morning today, neighbors and strangers stopped at the impromptu memorial to Shavon, mourning her but some also finding tragedy in the life of the boy accused of killing her.
"You can't just point the finger at the boy," said Johnnie Williams, 18. "You got to point the finger at the grown-ups who put the gun in his hands. Everybody knew Shavon and everybody knew the boy. We feel bad for both of them. Two lives been cut short here."
Shavon was to have started high school next week. She wanted to work in and maybe someday own a beauty shop. She was remembered as a friendly girl with a smile that could chase a tear.
On Sunday night, shortly before 9 o'clock, Shavon, a cousin and several other youngsters were walking the 50 yards from her aunt's house to Shavon's house when the shooter stepped out of the darkened lot between the First General Assembly Church of the First Born and the True Church of God Holiness in Christ.
As the bullets from the semiautomatic pistol, "too many, too fast to count" in the words of a witness, ripped the air, Shavon's cousin, Felicia Falls, 18, shouted to run. She and the others got safely inside Shavon's house, but Felicia soon realized that "somebody was missing."
"I looked out and saw Shavon lying curled up on the sidewalk," Felicia said. "I knew she was dead. I broke out hollering so God could hear me and stop this craziness."

HEADLINE: For Cubans Trying to Leave Legally, 'Lamentations'

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Just beyond the green-glass offices of the American mission here, a few hundred yards from the seas dotted with the rafts of fleeing Cubans, scores of people gather each morning on a small patch of gravel and cement known as the Park of Lamentations.
Sitting in the shade of almond trees, they have become a steady reminder of how difficult it is for Cubans to travel to the United States by legal means. They are all waiting to see about visas, and under the current procedures, they may keep on waiting for months or even years. 
 "I don't want to throw myself into the sea, but what else can you do?" said Jose Miguel Gomez, a young man in the park who said he had been left behind as one of his siblings after another had left the country in rafts. "You can sit here a long time and nothing happens."
If successful, the negotiations that Cuban and American officials plan to begin on Thursday in New York may not help the raft refugees but could deliver some of "the Lamenting Ones." United States officials say they will offer to quicken the flow of legal immigrants in return for renewed efforts by the Cuban Government to stop those who, as it is said here, "throw themselves into the sea."
 
More Emigration Seen
 Yet after days in which thousands of Cubans have braved sharks and storms in the hope of a better future -- many of them knowing that their best fate might be rescue by the United States Coast Guard and internment at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- many diplomats and other analysts have grown skeptical that such a deal would relieve the growing pressure for emigration.
"If there is a migration deal that satisfies 20,000, there will be 200,000 who want to go," a diplomat said. Speaking of Cuba's President, Fidel Castro, he added, "He will not be able to stop people from leaving now without using force and drawing blood, and I don't think he is going to do that."
Analysts perceive varying degrees of intensity in the desperation that is driving the refugees from the island. But they generally agree that the economic suffering and political discontent that have caused the exodus will not decline significantly over the next several years, barring an unexpected reversal of Government policies.
Legal and illegal immigration are also very different escape valves.
Most of the people taking to sea without visas are young men in their 20's and 30's, starkly pessimistic about their futures and often without family in the United States.
 
Seen as 'Almost Undesirable'
 Describing them as largely less employed and less educated than other members of their generation, a Cuban official called them "almost undesirable" -- an allusion to the several thousand criminals and psychiatric patients sent to the United States among more than 125,000 Cubans in the Mariel boatlift in 1980.
Among some 19,700 Cubans awaiting action on immigrant visa requests, the average age is closer to 50, United States immigration officials say. Relatively few of them represent potential raft escapees or important threats to the governing Communist Party. And when they pass through the system, American officials suggest, there may not be that many more qualified applicants behind them.
Only three weeks ago, in an interview on Cuban television, Mr. Castro dismissed talks on immigration as a pointless exercise that "would be a pastime taking up months, years in order to accomplish absolutely nothing."
"It is not a question of getting 1,000 or 10,000 or so extra visas and establishing communication between Coast Guards," he said. "None of these things get to the bottom of the problem."
But since the Clinton Administration abruptly ended the longstanding policy of accepting illegal Cuban immigrants, the Havana Government has seemed to focus more on the claim that the United States has reneged on a 1984 agreement that set an annual ceiling of 20,000 legal Cuban immigrants.
 
Misinterpretation Seen
 American officials respond that Cuba misinterpreted the accord.
Rather than a commitment or quota for any specific number of immigrant visas, they say, the figure -- which has since been raised to 27,845 -- was merely an upper limit that put Cubans on equal footing with other preferred countries.
The answer to why the United States Interests Section has granted only 2,059 immigrant visas over the last 10 months and even fewer in some recent years depends on who is asked.
Around of Park of Lamentations, which American diplomats prefer to call Liberty Park, there seems to be little question that the United States immigration authorities are making things tougher than necessary, perhaps to make them tougher for the Cuban Government.
"Maybe 300 people go in there every day," Gloria Ventana, a retired clerical worker, said, gesturing toward the United States mission. "The most they will ever give out are two or three visas!"
The diplomats say part of the problem is simply that with only seven consular officers, the mission is overwhelmed by a flow of paper that included more than 72,000 applications for non-immigrant visas in the fiscal year that ended in the fall of 1993.

HEADLINE: A Midlife Crisis at Kroll Associates

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
For years, Kroll Associates was Wall Street's private eye, specializing in digging up dirt in heated takeover battles. When merger mania cooled, Kroll kept its grip on the top rung by snaring such high-profile assignments as a request by the Kuwaiti Government to search for Saddam Hussein's hidden riches and revamping security at the World Trade Center after the 1993 terrorist bombing.
Along the way, Kroll redefined itself and its industry by offering crisis management advice to corporations, negotiating kidnapping cases in Brazil and uncovering computer criminals in Tokyo. 
 Now, faced with tough new competition from lawyers, accounting firms and other investigative agencies, the New York-based business and its cigar-chomping founder, Jules B. Kroll, are trying to reinvent themselves again. This time, he wants to be a full-line global provider of planning and analysis on every aspect of security and risk management the way that McKinsey & Company, the top-drawer global consulting operation, and Goldman, Sachs & Company, the financial services firm, offer strategic planning and investment banking services to the business world.
By the end of this decade Mr. Kroll wants to more than quadruple his firm's revenues. But achieving that lofty goal will not be easy, and changing the company's focus does not come without risks. In recent months, Kroll has trimmed its worldwide staff to 230 from 240, stirring rumors that it was in financial trouble. Mr. Kroll said the mix of people was changing to reflect the new business emphasis.
But the new makeover has left Mr. Kroll, who makes a very good living off other people's troubles, with a crisis of his own. Veteran employees have left or been eased out. Some long-term clients complain that Kroll has forgotten its roots as an investigative firm, and others grouse about the firm's high fees. Competitors, well versed in the art of corporate gamesmanship, stand ready to exploit any rumor of weakness in the leader of the pack.
Mr. Kroll blames unnamed competitors for spreading false rumors about the company's financial condition recently, touching off a round of crisis management at Kroll itself. Concerned about the consequences of the turmoil in a business that depends so heavily on reputation, Mr. Kroll made himself and top executives available for interviews, discussed the company's finances, and provided a window on the inner workings of the secretive, privately held company that operates in the gray area between gumshoe and government.
Combined with interviews with former Kroll employees, competitors and clients, the result is both a portrait of Kroll Associates and a snapshot of a booming industry that increasingly affects the way business and government operate.
Most work still comes from corporations. But more governments are turning to private firms for some tasks like monitoring court-ordered efforts to clean up corrupt industries, like Kroll's work to keep the Gambino crime family out of the trucking business in New York City's garment industry, and the attempt to break the mob's hold on Long Island's carting industry by Kroll's Michael Cherkasky, a former senior aide to the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
Experts like Robert D. McCrie at John Jay College of Criminal Justice see opportunities for government to save money and get better results by hiring private investigative firms like Kroll. However, Mr. McCrie cautioned that dangers exist because these surrogates are less accountable than government employees.
Mr. Kroll wants to jettison the image of private eyes snooping through trash bins and bugging offices. He talks about building relationships with corporations to advise them on security and risk management.
The audacious plans of Mr. Kroll and his comparison of the company to such gold-plated firms as McKinsey and Goldman, Sachs even drew some good-natured skepticism from Robert J. McGuire, the former New York police commissioner who is Kroll's president.
"No matter what we do, people want to put a fedora and a trench coat on us," Mr. Kroll complained.
After all, Kroll is not an investment bank or a consulting firm. And there is no escaping the seamy side of investigative work.
Mr. Kroll acknowledged that the company had occasionally obtained telephone and bank records of investigative targets, violating company rules and probably the law. Two South African intelligence agents held by the Swiss police for bugging an office in Geneva in 1991 were sometime-employees of Kroll, but Mr. Kroll said they were not on Kroll business when they were arrested.
 
'Biggest Black Eye'
 The company's "biggest black eye," he said, came four years ago when investigators misrepresented themselves while interviewing former employees of a chemical company. A Delaware judge was so angry that he issued sanctions against two lawyers who had hired Kroll, but the action was later reversed.
Mr. McGuire instituted ethical guidelines when he became president in 1989, but he acknowledged that mistakes still occurred.
"The main issue is, 'Are you institutionally committed, without winks and nods, to complying with the law?' And we are," Mr. McGuire insisted. "Our reputation is all that enables us to function."
Since its founding in 1972 by Mr. Kroll, a former prosecutor, the firm has functioned exceptionally well for the most part. As Kroll became the leading investigative firm for takeovers in the 1980's, revenues grew fortyfold.
Growth has slowed dramatically, but still appears healthy, and Mr. Kroll said the company had remained profitable with a pretax profit margin of about 12 percent. Revenues were $40 million in 1990 and are on a pace to exceed $60 million this year, according to Kroll's figures.
The business mix has changed, too. In the 1980's, three or four big cases could generate half of the firm's annual revenue, and the company shunned small cases.
 
A $20,000 Fee
 Today the firm handles hundreds of smaller matters, with an average fee of $20,000, Mr. Kroll said. Company figures show the number of new clients has grown 78 percent since 1990 to 755 this year and the annual caseload is approaching 2,500, compared with 1,000 or fewer before.
Still, there are some mega-cases. The Kuwaitis paid Kroll as much as $100,000 a week for months in 1991 and 1992 to search for the hidden assets of Saddam Hussein. Over the last two years, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has paid Kroll $2.5 million to overhaul security at the World Trade Center and evaluate procedures at the agency's bridges, tunnels and airports.
Such expertise does not come cheap. Clients pay an average of $1,500 a day for the services of a Kroll agent. And the company's employees are well paid by industry standards. Senior managers earn $100,000 to $300,000 a year and top executives make as much as $500,000 a year.
Whether the company is worth its high fees depends on who is talking. "They saved us a lot of money," said Thomas E. Workman Jr., general counsel of Amgen Inc., the biotechnology company.
After receiving an internal memo warning that one of its scientists was stealing the formula for epogen, an Amgen product used in kidney failure, the company hired Kroll investigators last spring. They identified the suspect and, accompanied by F.B.I. agents, confronted him in the laboratory early one Sunday morning, Mr. Workman said.
 
Building Fortunes
 Mr. Kroll has become a wealthy man, with a limousine and an estate on Long Island Sound. In 1989, the company borrowed $20 million in 10-year notes from a teachers' pension fund, wiping out its bank debt and enabling Mr. Kroll, who then owned 100 percent of the firm, to pocket in excess of $7 million.
Last year, American International Group Inc., a leading insurance organization whose product lines including kidnapping coverage, bought 23 percent of Kroll for $15 million. Mr. Kroll and Maurice R. Greenberg, the chairman and chief executive of A.I.G., said there were no plans for the insurance giant to take a bigger share of Kroll. But both men see the partnership as a launching pad for new products that combine A.I.G. insurance expertise with Kroll's investigative and risk-analysis skills, such as providing coverage and security advice to a company entering a politically unstable part of the world.
Another area where Kroll expects growth is in its crisis-management business. "We're expanding the geographical and functional frontiers of the company," said Brian M. Jenkins, a former director of the RAND Corporation's program on political violence and terrorism and now head of crisis management at Kroll.
Crisis management, ranging from developing procedures to reduce security risks to analysis of political and economic stability in foreign countries, now provides about 20 percent of Kroll revenue, but it must grow sharply if the firm is to meet the $250 million mark by the year 2000.
Some clients complain that Kroll's zeal for new business has come at the expense of longtime customers. One morning this week, Mr. McGuire had to remind Mr. Jenkins that they had promised a business proposal a month ago to the chairman of a major European company.
"Sorry," Mr. Jenkins replied. "I'll add it to my list of 800 things to do."
 
Industry Getting Crowded
 As Kroll has refocused, it has left the door open for the many competitors who have sprung up in its wake.
The competition has also changed in recent years. As corporate snooping has become more accepted in the business world, a handful of law firms and accounting firms have gotten into the business.
"There's an increasing willingness on the part of corporations to acknowledge fraud and other problems and deal with them," said Michael D. Carey, a former British fraud investigator who is director of KPMG Peat Marwick's seven-member forensic and investigative services.
However, Kroll is still the one to beat. Last year, Kroll was chosen over three other companies to advise the Port Authority on a redesign of its security procedures.
"We have such confidence in them that I have followed every one of their recommendations," said Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority executive director.

HEADLINE: Cuba Reported to Encourage Convicts to Join the Refugees

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Fearing a repetition of an unwelcome aspect of the 1980 Mariel boatlift, Clinton Administration officials said today they had evidence that the Cuban Government had released several dozen prisoners and encouraged them to join the flood of Cuban refugees.
State Department officials said they would seek an explanation from Cuban diplomats in talks Thursday in New York about what they described as "indications" that the Cuban Government had granted two- or three-day furloughs to the prisoners and urged them to set out to sea. 
 "There are enough clear indications that prisoners are being given passes for a few days and are being told that they'll have to go back to jail if they come back," one official said.
Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, said that during his visit today to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, where more than 13,000 Cubans are being held, he had learned that there was "evidence that criminals have been unloaded on the United States." A State Department official said Senator Graham's estimate of 100 suspected prisoners was a reasonable number.
 
Prisoners Segregated at Base
 Senator Graham said the former prisoners had been segregated from the other Cuban refugees at Guantanamo and were being kept in a concrete blockhouse that had been used to store ammunition during World War II. He said those Cubans should be put on a United States Navy ship and sent into Havana Harbor, "with or without Castro's consent."
Administration officials adopted a cautious approach, saying they were trying to find out whether the newly arrived prisoners were hard-core criminals or political prisoners, and whether they were released recently or some time ago. According to these offcials, the Administration has not yet decided whether to seek to repatriate the refugees believed to be former convicts.
Administration officials said they had also received credible reports that Cuban authorities were providing some prisoners with the materials needed to build rafts.
For over a decade, successive administrations have unsuccessfully pressed President Fidel Castro to take back more than 1,500 former Cuban prisoners that American officials say the Cuban leader sent into the United States as part of the Mariel boatlift. An estimated 125,000 Cubans came to the United States during the boatlift. American officials also protested that Mr. Castro had sent mental patients and people with serious diseases.
 
U.S. Prepares for Talks
 As concerns grew about reports of prisoners joining the refugees, the Administration team handling the Cuba crisis put the finishing touches today on its bargaining position, based on their assessment that Mr. Castro may be willing to halt the exodus of refugees because it has in many ways backfired on him.
The offer, which will be presented to Cuban negotiators in New York on Thursday, is intended to persuade Cuba to stop the flood of boat people in return for the Administration's pledge to vastly increase the number of Cubans who are granted entry rights to the United States each year.
In the Administration's view, the mass migration has hurt Mr. Castro's image and he is feeling pressure from the Administration's measures to tightening the economic embargo on Cuba.
In an interview, Michael Skol, the State Department official who will head Washington's negotiating team, said, "We are working on the assumption that Cuba understands that it is in its interests as well as ours to curtail unsafe, illegal immigration."
 
Cubans See Pressure on U.S.
 But Cuban diplomats insisted in interviews today that it was not Mr. Castro who was feeling pressed to end the crisis.
"The real pressure is on the United States," said Rafael Dausa, spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section, which is in the Swiss Embassy in Washington. "The United States is having a real problem handling all the illegal people coming here."
The pressure grew today as the United States Coast Guard reported that 2,134 Cubans were picked up at sea by midnight, compared with 1,582 who were rescued Tuesday.
A senior Pentagon official said today that the military plans to begin flying some Cuban refugees from Guantanamo Bay to safe havens in Panama during the next week. Similarly, the official said, the Administration plans to fly some Haitian refugees from Guantanamo Bay to Suriname during the next few days. These moves represent the first time that Washington used third-country safe havens for refugees who tried to come to the United States, State Department officials said.
The plan is to send a planeload of refugees, or about 300 people, each day. Venezuela announced today that it would grant entry rights to 10,000 Cubans who have relatives there.
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas said in Caracas that his country was ready to grant entry to two family members of each of the 5,000 Cubans living in Venezuela.
And Costa Rica announced today that it would take for up to 24 months an unspecified number of Cubans who have relatives there.

Federated-Macy Filings Offer Preview of Union

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Federated Department Stores Inc. and R. H. Macy & Company jointly filed statements in United States Bankruptcy Court in New York late yesterday that provided a broad blueprint for the structure of what would be the nation's largest department store company. The filings project conservative earnings growth, dramatic cost savings and significant debt reduction, as well as ambitious plans for store renovation and expansion.
The filings offered some detailed sales projections for the next five years, as well as information about what Macy creditors would receive and the settlement of about $4.7 billion in estimated claims against Macy. 
 Federated also announced that it had received commitments from Citibank and Chemical Bank for $1.1 billion of the necessary $2.8 billion in financing that would be used to pay for the Macy purchase and to refinance existing Federated debt. The source of the the rest of the financing remains unclear.
 
More Data to Come
 But the documents did not disclose the most eagerly awaited information about the new company: the number of stores to be closed or sold, and how many jobs would be eliminated. That information will be filed in one or more amended disclosure statements during September, Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated, said.
Yesterday's filings project increases in earnings of 3.6 percent a year for the next three years in stores open more than a year. The statements predict cost savings of $71 million in 1995 from the merger, increasing to $122 million a year thereafter before inflation, or $500 million by the end of the 1998 fiscal year.
"We think the earnings may be 5 or 6 percent, so the projection is very conservative, which is appropriate," said Isaac Lagnado, principal director of Tactical Retail Solutions, a market research and retail consulting company in New York. "The cost savings are very impressive, a monumental achievement that vindicates the wisdom of creating a department-store operation that is national in scope."
The statement also projects earnings before income, taxes and depreciation as 12.8 percent of sales by 1998 for the combined companies, up from 9.9 percent in the 1995 fiscal year. Net income would increase 73 percent, to $422 million in 1996 from $243.6 million in the 1995 fiscal year.
Total debt for Federated, as the combined company would be known, would decline from $5.1 billion in 1994 to $3.5 billion in 1998.
 
Plans for Expansion
 In addition, the statements hint at plans for future expansion and renovation: The company intends to spend 21 percent of its $2.8 billion capital budget from 1995 to 1998 to open between five and eight new stores a year, and 11 percent of the capital budget would be spent on technological improvements like computer systems. But existing stores would hardly be neglected, as 68 percent of the capital budget would be earmarked for upgrading and maintaining existing stores.
According to the filings, Roger N. Farah, who became president and chief operating officer of Macy in July, would receive $14 million should he leave the combined company, and would be free to work for a competitor. Mr. Farah had been caught in the middle of battle between Federated, his former employers, and Macy.
The merger, which is expected to be completed in December, would get Macy out of bankruptcy court protection. Before then, the plan requires the formal approval of Macy's creditors, although they have informally given their support, and of Judge Burton R. Lifland, who is presiding over the Macy case.
The companies have asked the court for a Sept. 29 hearing on approval of the statement. After that, the creditors will be asked to vote in mid-November. Federated's shareholders will also have to approve the merger plan.
 
Dismissals at Macy
 Macy has already dismissed about a third of the 300 administrative employees at its corporate headquarters on Herald Square in Manhattan, according to Ms. Sanger of Federated. The combined company will spend about $32 million on severance packages and performance bonuses, according to executives close to the company.
Although the Federal Trade Commission effectively approved the merger, the plan awaits approval from the New York Attorney General, G. Oliver Koppell.
"I suspect that some of the delay in filing details in the disclosure was caused by Mr. Koppell, who has created some waltzing around and negotiation," said Arnold Aronson, a former chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue who is a partner of Levy, Kerson, Aronson, a retail-industry industry consulting firm.
Mr. Koppell has threatened to bring suit against the two retailers unless they sell 12 Macy's stores in the New York area. Macy competes with three units of Federated in the region: Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's and Stern's.
Mr. Koppell said through a spokesman that he had no comment on yesterday's filings.

HEADLINE: Legislators In U.S. Differ Over Haiti

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
A day after the Clinton Administration issued its strongest threat to date of a military invasion of Haiti, two leading members of Congress expressed sharply divided views on using force to restore democracy there.
"I think we're right at the point of invasion," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "I don't think you can send two high-ranking officials to the Caribbean making the kinds of comments that they made yesterday without following through." 
 Mr. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat, was speaking of a visit on Tuesday by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch to Jamaica to confer with representatives of 13 Caribbean nations. The countries agreed to contribute a token force of 266 troops to support an American-led invasion to restore Haiti's exiled and ousted President, the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide.
 
Disagreement in Congress
 Mr. Hamilton, who made the remarks on the CBS News program "This Morning," said he believed Congress and the public would support an invasion. But Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly disagreed in comments on the NBC News program "The Today Show." .
"The American people are not convinced that we have vital interests in invading Haiti, despite immigration, which we believe might continue even if Mr. Aristide was restored," he said. "And we've really not had a policy of forcing democracy on a country, however despicable that regime might be."
In a news conference at the State Department, Mr. Talbott and Mr. Deutch repeated a message to Haiti's military rulers that they must leave or will soon be forced from power.
But a contradiction still undercuts the Administration's threats. Senior American officials say the Haitian generals must go soon, or face an invasion. But they also say they want to exhaust all other options, including a trade embargo and other economic sanctions imposed against Haiti since Father Aristide's ouster in 1991.
 
Time for Sanctions
 If the United States is serious about giving sanctions a chance it could be several weeks or months before President Clinton orders an invasion. An 88-member, multinational observer force that is supposed to help the Dominican Republic seal its border to prevent smuggling into Haiti has yet to begin its mission and will not be operating fully until mid-September.
Training for the 266 troops from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Belize will begin over the next two weeks at a United States Navy base in Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, but will take two to three more weeks to complete, a senior Pentagon official said today.
About 30 United States Army special operations trainers stationed in the Caribbean who have special language skills will instruct the troops in crowd control, first aid, roadblocks, communications, peacetime rules of engagement, and the use of weapons.
The Caribbean troops are to form part of a 10,000-member, American led-force that would go into Haiti whether the generals leave on their own or are ousted.
 
U.S. Aid for Force
 The Caribbean troops would perform police work in the days after an invasion, military officials say. They will bring their own small arms, but the United States will provide vehicles, uniforms, helmets and water trailers, a Pentagon official said.
Lawmakers acknowledged today that an invasion is not likely soon but said that the Administration remains on that track.
"I would not say that it's imminent in the sense of the next few hours or days, but I do think it's getting very close," Mr. Hamilton said. "It's a matter of days, weeks away, before some kind of decisive action has to take place."
 
Ultimatum Is Suggested
 Randall Robinson, the leader of the lobbying group TransAfrica, said today that Mr. Clinton should immediately give Haiti's military leaders 48-hours notice to leave or be ousted. It was a 27-day hunger strike by Mr. Robinson that galvanized the public and the Congressional Black Caucus to press Mr. Clinton for a more aggressive policy this year.
Representative Kweisi Mfume, a Maryland Democrat who heads the Congressional Black Caucus, said "It's no longer a question of whether or not it's inevitable. It's a larger question of whether or not we find ourselves with reasons as to why we should not invade."
But Senator John S. McCain, an Arizona Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said he worries about what would happen after an invasion. "It is the post-invasion circumstances that I fear will bog down U.S. forces in a low-level, open-ended, ill-defined conflict which will require servicemen and women to serve as a virtual palace guard for President Aristide once he is returned to power," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Order Higher Bank Reserves

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Taking the first big steps to discourage banks from speculating in derivatives, Federal regulators said today that they were planning to require some banks to hold more capital to cover possible losses on such investments.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, part of the Treasury Department, announced that it would issue the proposed new rules on minimum capital standards Friday. And the Federal Reserve System, which also regulates many banks, quietly proposed a virtually identical set of regulations last week for a public comment period that will also end on Oct. 21. 
 Federal bank regulators usually put into effect the rules they propose, but sometimes make modifications based on the comments they receive.
 
A Volatile Product
 Derivatives are volatile financial securities or contracts based on assets like Treasury bonds, foreign currencies, or stock indexes. Their value can swing dramatically with small changes in the markets they are linked to. They are controversial because mutual funds and limited partnerships have suffered billions of dollars in losses from investments in derivatives this year.
The nation's biggest banks have reported relatively modest losses from derivatives up to now, although regulators say that a small community bank, which they refuse to identify, lost a quarter of its capital because of unwise investments in derivatives. But banks have received the most attention from regulators and from Congress because under Federal deposit insurance, the Government must reimburse depositors for losses if a bank failed.
The proposed new rules for minimum capital standards would penalize banks for trading in the most speculative derivatives by forcing them to tie up more of their net worth in safe investments like Treasury bonds instead of using it to make loans on which they can often make more profit. But banks that conducted most of their derivatives deals with only a few institutions would be allowed to hold less capital.
Susan M. Phillips, the Federal Reserve governor with the greatest expertise in derivatives, said in an interview that the proposed rules get "us closer to having the firms' capital more closely reflect the actual risk composition of their assets and liabilities."
But Ms. Phillips, a former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, added that she and other regulators did not view derivatives as especially dangerous. "I don't think there is any greater risk to their derivatives activity than there is to the rest of their activities," she said of the banks.
 
Curbs on Commodities Deals
 The new rules would make it more costly for banks to trade any derivative that fluctuates in value based on stock market indexes or the prices of precious metals, oil or other commodities.
The rules would also make it more expensive for banks to trade long-term derivatives, which fluctuate in value with the level of interest rates or currency exchange rates over the course of five or more years.
But the new rules would allow a bank to set aside less capital than before if it and another financial institution engaged in a number of derivative deals with partly offsetting effects. For example, this could occur if the bank agreed to buy French francs from the other institution at one price and sell francs to the same institution at a different price.
Under the new rules, the bank would be allowed to allocate capital based on the combined credit risk of all these deals, instead of on each transaction. So conducting 10 derivatives deals with another bank could be cheaper than one deal with each of 10 banks.
 
View From Banking Industry
 James D. McLaughlin, the director of Federal agency relations at the American Bankers Association in Washington, said that few banks were active in the derivatives market and that the overall effect of the new regulations on them would not be great. "We're not opposed to it," he said.
The derivatives market has supported the new rules. Many deals are carried out between a few institutions and will qualify for the lower capital requirements, while relatively few deals involve the most speculative derivatives that will be subject to higher requirements, according to derivatives dealers.
But Douglas E. Harris, a senior deputy comptroller of the currency, said it was unclear whether the overall effect of the new regulations would be to increase or decrease the capital that banks must hold in reserve against possible losses. Banks try to hold as little capital as possible, while still meeting Federal standards, because they earn less interest on this money than on their loans.
A few proposals have also circulated in Congress to introduce broader controls on derivatives, and not just for banks. But no action is likely this year because Congress will be in session for only a few weeks between the August recess and adjournment for the November election campaign.

Little Change in Prices Of Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were nearly unchanged as two Commerce Department reports issued yesterday gave more fresh evidence that the economy is losing momentum. The Fed has raised short-term rates five times this year in an attempt to keep the economy from growing too fast and stymy inflation..
The index of leading indicators, which is intended to forecast the direction of growth over the next six months, stalled in July, while factory orders posted the sharpest drop in nearly two and a half years. 
 But with the the Labor Department report on August unemployment due tomorrow, investors remaind cautious and the Treasury market did not rally on the weak economic data.
Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist for CS First Boston, suggested that another reason for the caution in the market was its continued obsession with inflation. Three reports yesterday showed that while growth is slowing prices seem to be still inching higher.
Corporate purchasing managers in both the Chicago and New York areas reported higher readings for August in their indexes of prices paid, while a Commerce Department tally showed a sharp jump for July in the price of materials particularly sensitive to the pace of business activity.
"The question now is how much higher can prices of products go if overall economic activity is waning?, Mr. Alexy said. "This is the issue the bond market faces now and it will be of some concern for a while." This is a worry the Fed also faces, he said.
"The situation in the market is that the economy is not overheating, but as always the market remains on an inflation watch," Mr. Alexy added. "I think if we were to get inflation numbers favorable to the market, we could make a significant move to lower rates."
The 30-year-bond rose 4/32 , to a price of 10020/32 , for a yield of 7.45 percent, down from 7.46 percent on Tuesday and the lowest since Aug. 17, a day after the Fed raised short-term rates for the fifth time this year. The yields on intermediate maturities moved slightly higher, while the rates on shorter-term bills were mixed.
A firmer dollar, which was higher against both the German mark and the Japanese yen, also helped to give Treasury securities a lift.
The no change in the index of leading indicators last month followed a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in June. New orders for factory goods fell 2.3 percent in July, the first decline since February. "Today's factory orders revealed that the second-quarter surge in the pace of inventory accumulation continued through July, which bodes well for the third-quarter G.D.P. figure," said James Hale, fixed-income analyst with MMS International. Factory orders posted a nine-tenths of 1 percent increase in July, which he said appeared to imply a gain of roughly seven-tenths of 1 percent in overall business inventoriers for the month.
In the municipal market, where the demand for bonds issued offset worries about inflation and higher rates, the New York State Thruway Authority sold $196.09 million of local highway and bridge service contract bonds through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The issue was initially priced to yield a maximum 6.324 percent for an issue due in 2014, while another long maturity due 2013 was priced to yield 6.09 percent. For shorter-maturity serial bonds, yields ranged from 4 percent in 1995 to 5.30 percent in 2000, 5.55 percent in 2005 and 5.95 percent in 2010.
Some maturities that are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corp are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Corporation, while noninsured issues are rated Baa-1 and BBB, respectively.
The following are the results of yesterday's 16-day cash management bill auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.796
Discounted Rate . . . 4.58%

HEADLINE: Naohiro Amaya, 68; Helped Industry in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Naohiro Amaya, a major architect of the industrial policy that has contributed to Japan's dramatic economic growth, died here on Tuesday, one day before his 69th birthday.
The cause was lung cancer, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. 
 Mr. Amaya worked at the ministry, usually known as MITI, from 1948 until 1981, rising to Deputy Minister for International Affairs, the highest post available to a career civil servant. Starting in 1987 he served as executive director and then chairman and chief executive of the Dentsu Institute for Human Studies, a research organization affiliated with Japan's largest advertising agency.
At MITI, Mr. Amaya was instrumental in drawing up plans by which the Government aided the development of Japanese industry. These measures included protection from imports and financial support to favored industries.
 
Criticized by U.S. Industry
 Economists have long argued whether such an industrial policy helped or hurt Japan and whether it should be adopted by the United States and other countries. Many American Government and industry officials have criticized the Japanese policies as unfair.
Mr. Amaya was frank in acknowledging that Japan was not a free trader and outspoken in defending MITI's industrial policy to the world. He argued that Japan would not have been able to rise from its impoverished condition after World War II had it relied solely on free-market forces. "We can't take that happy-go-lucky attitude," he said in 1985.
But in more recent years Mr. Amaya, arguing that times had changed, became a critic of too much government control of industry and of the bureaucracy of which he was a part. "What Japan needs now is a 'negative industrial policy,' " he said in 1993.
Mr. Amaya was particularly noted for his role in drawing up MITI's vision for the 1970's, which moved Japan into electronics and other "knowledge intensive" businesses from the heavy industry favored in the 1960's.
 
Negotiations in Washington
 As deputy minister from 1979 to 1981, Mr. Amaya led negotiations with Washington that resulted in Japan's voluntarily restricting exports of automobiles to the United States from 1981 until last March. Mr. Amaya urged the voluntary restraints as a way of heading off passage of a bill by Congress that would have imposed even harsher limits.
"For his efforts in the negotation, he was described by some auto magnates in Tokyo as a 'running dog' of the Americans," Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former United States trade negotiator, wrote about Mr. Amaya in his book "Trading Places." But, Mr. Prestowitz added, "in fact, he deserved a medal for an oustanding act of industrial statesmanship."
Mr. Amaya studied politics at Tokyo University, graduating in 1948 and immediately joining the trade ministry. He was an author of many books and articles, mainly in Japanese, and was a frequent commentator on Japan's domestic and foreign policies.
He is survived by his wife, Kimiko; two sons, Taro and Jiro, and a daughter, Yukiko Amaya Yates.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Insider Selling Trims Auto Stocks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Share prices of the Big Three auto makers tumbled yesterday, as reports of insider selling at the Chrysler Corporation apparently rekindled fears that the peak in auto sales and profits might have passed.
Chrysler's stock was the first to get pounded, but investors later broadened their selling to shares of the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation as well. 
 At the end of the day, Chrysler stock was off by $1.50 a share, to $48. Ford shares lost $1.375, to $29.25. And General Motors declined by $1.75, to $50.25 a share.
A number of auto analysts said the market reaction was extreme and had nothing to do with the industry's underlying fundamentals, which they said remained positive.
The report of insider selling first appeared on Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal. Citing data compiled by CDA/Investnet, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company that tracks and analyzes trading activity of corporate insiders, the article said that late last month 13 Chrysler vice presidents sold a combined 146,710 shares at prices ranging from $47 to $49 a share.
 
Earlier Insider Selling
 Earlier this year, Chrysler insiders also unloaded a big chunk of stock -- more than 100,000 shares. But at that point the stock was trading at around $60 a share, close to its 52-week high of $63.50.
"We expect to see insiders sell when the stock is going up, and we have seen selling when the stock was rising," Bob Gabele, president of CDA/Instinet, said yesterday.
"But when we see selling on a pull-back in the stock price, it indicates the insiders may not be waiting for the stock to come back. In fact, at times when stock prices are consolidating, you might expect to see insiders buying."
With sales off unsustainably high levels recorded earlier in the year and interest rates moving up, the report added to the concern of investors, who have been skittish about auto stocks for some months.
Rita McKay, a Chrysler spokeswoman, defended the insider sales as prudent portfolio management. Even with the sales, Chrysler stock is still a big part of managers' portfolios, she added.
"All officers are required to hold the equivalent of their annual salary in stock," she said, "and all officers do have an equal amount in stock."
 
Analysts Like Stocks
 Maryann N. Keller, who follows auto stocks for Furman Selz, said, "If I thought we were near the end of the cycle, I would have taken the stocks off our recommended list."
And the market has made adjustments to the stock prices," she added, "which are down about 15 percent from their highs, to levels that I think makes them all buys."
Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said: "Insider selling in the auto industry has never been a perfect predictor of future stock performance, and it in no way implies that Chrysler's management is anything but confident in their future. Rather, Chrysler's management is just cashing in on the rewards that have come since the company has come back from bankruptcy."
In Mr. Kirnan's view, sales have slowed from their earlier breakneck pace because showrooms are fairly empty. Demand, he contends, is still strong. And even though interest rates have been rising, compared with the relatively recent past they still remain low.
"Inventory levels are the leanest they have been in 10 years," he said. "There is no product to sell.
"There is no way the cycle is over. If it is, then the broader economy has some problems."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Modest Gains Ahead of Employment Data

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended firmer against most other leading currencies yesterday, helped by expectations that tomorrow's report on United States employment will show the economy is growing at a steady pace.
Prospects that Germany's central bankers will lower interest rates at a meeting on monetary policy today also helped the dollar gain, traders said. Lower German rates could bolster the dollar by making mark-denominated deposits less attractive. 
 "People are looking for signs of steady growth this Friday," said Lynn Tierney, a trader at Shawmut Bank of Boston. "Too-strong growth would shock the bond market."
Recent strength in the stock and bond markets has helped the dollar hold onto gains it made last Friday, when the Government said the United States economy grew at annual rate of 3.8 percent in the second quarter, up slightly from a previous estimate of 3.7 percent.
At that pace, many traders said, the economy can grow without spurring a rise in the inflation rate any time soon. Bonds rallied after that report, driving the dollar higher. Now traders are looking for more signs of steady, noninflationary growth.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5816 marks, up from 1.5760 marks on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 100.18 Japanese yen, from 99.57 yen on Tuesday.
Traders said they were wary of selling the dollar before today's meeting of the Bundesbank. Some traders are still hoping for a rate cut, despite an increase in lending rates by France's big banks on Tuesday.
 
Have Rates Bottomed Out?
 The increase fueled speculation that European rates had bottomed, after falling for almost two years.
"People are clinging to the idea that the Bundesbank could cut rates," said Steve Flanagan, a trader at Paine Webber Inc.
Such speculation persists because this week's meeting is considered to be one of the central bank's last chances to cut rates before parliamentary elections in Germany in October, Mr. Flanagan said. After this week, a rate cut might seem politically motivated, because many members of the Parliament have called on the Bundesbank to cut rates to spur economic growth. The central bank is loath to appear subject to political control.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Major health care change may be dead, but something may pass.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
MAJOR health care reform, everyone now concedes, is dead for the year -- conceivably for the decade. But nobody is volunteering, as Hamlet put it, to lug the guts into the neighbor room. Indeed, it is dawning on initially exultant Republicans as well as disappointed Democrats that the politics of stalemate could be a lose-lose situation.
The image of Bill Clinton as the ineffectual big spender may reinforce hostility among those who already dislike the President. But it could be more than offset by the stain on the Presidential hopefuls Bob Dole, known in some quarters as the dark angel of gridlock, and Phil Gramm, who is working on his Marie Antoinette impersonation. 
 That's why Barry P. Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution and veteran of the Washington policy wars, predicts that Congress will still scramble to come up with something to prove it has been wrestling with reform -- and that the President will be almost obliged to sign anything written on a prescription pad.
Something, but what thing? Contrary to intuition, said Joseph Newhouse, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, "little reforms aren't necessarily easier than big ones." Mr. Newhouse notes, for example, that health insurance subsidies for low-income families ineligible for Medicare -- even modest subsidies -- could lead to "a raid on the Treasury" as employers drop what they are offering.
Still, it is possible to assemble a list of possibilities that pass economic and political laugh tests:
MEDICAID EXPANSION. The Feds, with more than a little financial help from the states, already provide passable medical care for the very poor who are eligible for welfare. And a primary goal of every major reform effort has been to expand Government-aided coverage to the near-poor who don't make the cutoff.
The catch, as Congress spent the last few months learning from its Budget Office, is that financial incentives to buy insurance -- as opposed to mandates to employers or individuals to buy insurance -- would cost the taxpayers a bundle. A more frugal way to extend coverage would be to focus on a few additional groups, rather than the millions of Americans who don't receive insurance from employers and can't afford their own policies on family incomes under, say, $20,000.
One target group that has the sympathy of the public would be children living under the poverty line. Another, Mr. Bosworth suggests, would be families currently eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit -- America's little-understood negative income tax for the working poor. To keep down costs, this group might be asked to cover part of the cost of medical services, as most privately insured and Medicare patients do today.
Any of this would cost money. But one part of the Democrats' health care tax package -- the levy on tobacco -- could probably be resurrected without losing many votes in Congress. The revenues from anything less than a gargantuan sin tax would be inadequate to carry substantial numbers of enrollees for long. However, once the new constituency has a toehold in the budget, the politics of finding still more revenue would probably change.
MALPRACTICE REFORM. Most of the heavy-duty health care reform plans made a bow toward limiting malpractice liability. In political terms, this represented a sop to hospitals and physicians who would be under pressure on other fronts to cut costs, and who would therefore be willing to run interference against trial lawyers who want no part of malpractice reform.
Mr. Newhouse, however, notes that changes well short of, say, abolishing awards for pain and suffering could make a difference. One possibility would be "enterprise liability" in which hospitals would insure anyone providing care on the premises. That would limit legal fees by consolidating legal defense activities. And it would give health enterprises more systematic incentives to weed out dangerous practices -- and practitioners.
Enterprise liability is being tried voluntarily in a handful of hospitals, Mr. Newhouse reports. But one could imagine regulation toward this end, or perhaps other malpractice changes that do not tread heavily on the perquisites of America's plaintiff bar.
COMMUNITY RATING. One of the core ideas of health care reform is to spread the costs among people with vastly different prospects of ending up in the intensive care unit. But Mr. Bosworth points out that you can't just order insurers to cover everyone at the same dollar premium.
Apart from the obvious problems of preventing insurers from finding every possible excuse from serving a high-risk clientele, there is also the issue of what economists call moral hazard. "You can't allow people to decide when they want insurance," Mr. Bosworth said; that gives them the option of waiting until they are very likely to become sick.
There is, however, a halfway house. Insurers might be permitted to link premiums only to broad categories like age. And Mr. Bosworth would require insurers to take on smaller employee groups at prices comparable to larger groups -- and to take them without checking the health of individuals and excluding those in high-risk categories.

HEADLINE: Shalala Praises Bipartisan Health Plan as Worth Serious Attention

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
With Congress in recess, the search for a compromise health care bill is focusing on a proposal devised by a bipartisan group of 20 senators, and a senior Administration official said today that the proposal deserved serious attention.
The official, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said she was reasonably pleased with the plan after hearing extensive discussion of it at a conference of health policy experts in Jackson Hole, Wyo., over the weekend. 
 In addition, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, chairman of the National Governors' Association, said in an interview, "Governors are very enthusiastic about this proposal and will probably support it when they see all the details."
But a coalition of 35 business groups, including the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, issued a statement saying the bipartisan proposal would do more harm than good, would increase health costs for many employers, would create strong incentives for companies to stop paying for their workers' insurance and would encourage an explosion of costly lawsuits.
 
Moderates Take the Stage
 The proposal, devised by a group that calls itself the "mainstream coalition," does not promise universal health insurance coverage, as President Clinton initially demanded. It would not require employers to buy insurance for their employees, but would require them to offer a choice of three or more health plans. Under the proposal, the Federal Government would regulate the practices of private health insurance companies, which are now regulated by the states, and it would provide subsidies to low-income people to help them buy insurance.
The group that drafted the mainstream proposal was led by Senators John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. While Congress is away, aides to the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell, are meeting with aides to Mr. Chafee and Mr. Breaux, seeking areas of agreement.
Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican who is a member of the coalition, said today: "The mainstream proposal is the main vehicle for staff discussions about incremental health care reform during the Congressional recess. It's the only game in town."
Mr. Durenberger explained the mainstream proposal to Dr. Shalala and others who attended the meeting of the Jackson Hole Group, a conclave of health policy experts, business executives, insurers, doctors, hospital officers and economists. The Jackson Hole Group has been meeting periodically since 1972, and President Clinton adopted some of its ideas in developing his health plan last year.
 
'It Could Be a Real Phoenix'
 In an interview today, Mr. Durenberger said: "Clinton-style health care reform had to die in order for sound health reform to rise up and get passed. The only viable health plan still on the table, the bipartisan mainstream proposal, isn't half-hearted or half-baked. It could be a real phoenix."
Dr. Shalala agreed. In an interview today, she said: "This is a serious proposal that needs to be looked at very carefully. It reflects a lot of knowledge and a lot of thought. I don't fully understand the financing. It is not the approach we originally favored, but it has the same goals and some of the same themes."
In the House of Representatives, where partisan lines are more sharply drawn, an eerie silence prevailed today. "It's unreal how quiet it is," said a health policy specialist on the House side of the Capitol, who was playing solitaire on his computer terminal. "We're on hold till the powers that be decide what they want to do next."
House Democratic leaders unveiled their health care plan on July 29, and detailed legislative language has been available since Aug. 10. But Democrats have been reluctant to take the bill to the House floor because unofficial vote counts suggest it would not pass in its current form, and many House members want to see if the Senate can agree on anything.
 
50-50 Chance of Passage
 Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, president of the Jackson Hole Group, said today: "We have better than a 50-50 chance of getting passage of health reform legislation based on the mainstream proposal this year. The Administration has constructed a solid rationale for accepting it, namely, this doesn't do any harm, and it's a first step toward longer-range objectives.
"The discussion, as usual at Jackson Hole, was mainly based on the question, 'Will it work?' I don't think we spent three minutes on politics. Our members thought it would work from top to bottom. These are very significant reforms. They're modest only by comparison with what President Clinton proposed."
But Julie L. Gackenbach, a lobbyist for the Chamber of Commerce, said businesses disliked the part of the proposal requiring companies to offer at least three health plans to employees. In addition, she said, "The mainstream proposal takes away the employer's flexibility to design a health plan that meets the employees' needs," because it would require companies to offer benefit packages prescribed by the Government.
Ms. Gackenbach said companies with 100 or fewer employees disliked the mainstream proposal because it would prevent them from serving as their own insurers. This ban would disrupt the health insurance arrangements of many small companies that are now self-insured, she said.
The chamber and other business groups also object to the Chafee-Breaux proposal because it would limit the ability of employers to take tax deductions for employee health benefits. The maximum deduction would be 10 percent above the average cost of health plans in the local market.
Mr. Chafee and Mr. Breaux say this limit would encourage employers and employees to choose lower-cost health plans. But employers denounce it as a new tax.
The bipartisan proposal would also restrict medical malpractice litigation, which doctors say contributes to rising health costs. The proposal says patients injured as a result of a doctor's negligence could not recover more than $250,000 for pain and suffering. It would also limit punitive damages and fees for plaintiffs' lawyers.
The Association of Trial Lawyers of America, one of the more influential lobbies on Capitol Hill, is fighting these proposals. Linda A. Lipsen, a lobbyist for the association, said: "The proposals frustrate people's rights to seek remedies when they've been injured. Medical negligence is rare, but when it occurs, consumers should be able to get full damages."
On the other hand, Frederick H. Graefe, a Washington lawyer who represents hospital insurance companies, praised the malpractice proposals, saying they would "reduce medical costs by reducing defensive medicine," the tests that doctors do to protect themselves against lawsuits.
Another section of the Chafee-Breaux proposal would give consumers new rights to challenge the denial of health insurance benefits. The Labor Secretary could impose a civil penalty of $750,000 on a health plan that repeatedly denied claims "without any reasonable basis."
In several decisions over the last decade, the Supreme Court has severely restricted the rights of consumers to recover damages when their claims were improperly denied or delayed by insurers.

HEADLINE: Reports Imply Somewhat Faster Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
The barrage of late-summer statistics pointing to slackened economic growth now exhibits a pattern that could imply somewhat faster inflation as well, according to various Government and private-sector reports published today.
While not yet setting off alarms, the price pressures seem to support the persistent credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve this year in its effort to prevent inflation from accelerating. 
 Today, corporate purchasing managers in both the Chicago and New York areas reported higher readings for August in their indexes of prices paid, while a Commerce Department tally showed a sharp jump for July in the price of materials particularly sensitive to the pace of business activity.
Indeed, excluding the price component, The department's index of leading indicators, which is designed to predict the course of the economy at large, has not risen at all since March. Higher prices for so-called sensitive materials, though not necessarily welcomed, are regarded as a harbinger of a stronger economy.
"We believe that inflation likely will surprise on the upside," Salomon Brothers told clients today, contending that the Federal Reserve would likely raise interest rates again at its November policy meeting.
In still another report today, the Commerce Department said new orders for factory goods fell 2.3 percent in July, the first decline since February. Nearly all the drop reflected durable goods, which were estimated last week to have skidded 4.2 percent and now show a 4.3 percent drop. Orders for nondurables, goods lasting less than three years, eased one-tenth of 1 percent.
Although reports of purchasing managers are seen by some analysts as unreliable inflation gauges -- as poor predictors of the present, much less the future -- the Chicago group raised eyebrows in citing "tremendous strength" in prices paid as this index jumped to 79.3 from 71.9 in July. Production also rose sharply, to 75.2 from 69.9, while new orders showed a small decline.
The New York chapter of the National Association of Purchasing Management said, meanwhile, that its price index climbed three points, to 60 percent, in August to match the highest reading since the survey began in mid-1993. A sharply higher proportion of members -- 58 percent, up from 50 percent -- reported slower deliveries from suppliers.
Still, analysts were not yet inclined to argue with the Clinton Administration in asserting that the economy remained in a healthy deceleration to a pace approximating its long-term potential.
Everett M. Ehrlich, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, called today's figures "consistent with a no-surprises growth path" with scant evidence of revived inflation.
The department's forecasting index, which was unchanged in July after negligible gains in May and June, showed 6 of 11 components pressing downward while only two components besides sensitive materials prices made positive contributions. The other two, the money supply and order backlogs of factory durables, changed so little that their effect rounded to zero.
The negatives were lower orders for manufactured consumer goods, sagging consumer expectations, faster deliveries to companies from their suppliers, a shorter workweek, a decline in contracts and orders for plant and equipment and lower stock prices.
The positive elements were the huge jump in the price of sensitive materials, a small rise in building permits and a small decline in first-time claims for unemployment insurance.
 
Other Indexes Mixed
 Two companion indexes were narrowly mixed. Coincident indicators, which generally change direction at the same time as the economy at large, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July while lagging indicators edged down one-tenth of 1 percent.
"We're looking for fairly modest growth in the second half" of about 2 1/2 percent, said Michael W. Keran, chief economist for the Prudential Insurance Company. He added that while job growth would be stronger than most analysts foresee, inflation worries were unfounded.
"They're not very good indicators of future inflation," Mr. Keran said of the price figures reported by purchasing managers.

HEADLINE: In Hartford, an Insider, and Proud of It

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 31

 BODY:
In a state that has recently been fertile ground for insurgent candidates attacking the political system, John B. Larson's campaign for governor is preaching a novel message: Government works.
In conversations with voters, Mr. Larson, the Democratic president pro tem of the State Senate, rattles off his legislative accomplishments to counter complaints that government is a quagmire. His commercials focus on his efforts to pass laws to immunize children, provide family medical leaves and ban assault weapons. 
 And while Mr. Larson acknowledges that unemployment, high taxes, crime and faltering schools are plaguing Connecticut, his stump speeches emphasize that it will take a skilled insider to deal with those problems.
"These days, a lot of candidates do a good job of scaring people, portraying government as a hydra-headed beast," he said in an interview. "But we're just regular people trying to do the best we can. I'm proud of what I've done, and I'll stand by it."
It is a position that contrasts sharply with some of the most successful campaigns of the last four years. In 1990, Lowell P. Weicker Jr. was elected governor on a third-party ticket, promising to turn the political world upside down. Two years later, Jerry Brown, the former California governor, won the state's Democratic presidential primary with a much more radical version of the same message.
 
A Tough Primary
 This year, Mr. Larson faces a tough Sept. 13 primary against State Comptroller William E. Curry, a self-styled outsider who hopes to tap voter dissatisfaction with the leadership of the state government. The two men come from different wings of the Democratic Party, with Mr. Larson winning the party organization's endorsement, and Mr. Curry being a favorite of progressives and grassroots citizens groups.
The winner of the primary will join a three-way race, including the winner of the Republican primary between former United States Representative John Rowland and Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer and the nominee of Mr. Weicker's A Connecticut Party, Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark.
Mr. Larson announced his plans to run for governor more than a year ago, and since then he has been cultivating an image as an effective legislator in touch with working families. He has spent more than $500,000 on commercials with the tagline, "Listening, leading, getting things done."
The commercials cut back and forth between shots of Mr. Larson working as a legislator -- swinging the gavel and writing at his desk -- and Mr. Larson out talking to people. One biographical spot ends with the lines: "We know he'll fight for us because he's one of us. We know he'll get things done, because he already has."
In his stump speeches and meetings with voters, Mr. Larson offers a long list of the bills he has passed.
He regularly cites the family and medical leave bill, the first in the nation to allow parents to take a leave of absence from work to deal with medical emergencies. He often refers to his efforts to protect special benefits for the elderly to buy medicine, his success in promoting Head Start programs and his work in establishing family resource centers in Connecticut schools to offer day care and other social services to parents.
 
Sturdy Democratic Themes
 Michael Meotti, a State Senator who supports Mr. Curry, said: "John's message is a very traditional Democratic message -- a great deal of concern about social services and state services that give you the boost up the ladder, the helping hand in government. There clearly is a link between John and the themes that most Democratic candidates have used for much of the post-World War II generation."
In campaign appearances, Mr. Larson, 46, often begins by describing his background as a "product of public housing, public schools and public service." One of eight children, the son of a firefighter at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, he grew up in a Federal housing project in East Hartford and was a star quarterback in high school.
He has never left that blue-collar town, and in campaigning, he appears to relish spending time with workers like those he grew up around. On Saturday, he perked up noticeably when he arrived at a carpenters' union picnic in West Haven.
"I could stay with those guys all day," he remarked later, after reminiscing about high school sports with several men.
 
A Package of Incentives
 "This campaign is about jobs," he told the carpenters, and he drew loud cheers when he promised that, under him the state would not be hiring out-of-state companies.
Mr. Larson has proposed a package of incentives to spur economic growth and talks about turning Connecticut into a cradle for high-technology industry. In one speech, he said that bringing the "information superhighway" into the public schools would be the equivalent of the New Deal's W.P.A. program, and that completing major highway projects would give the economy a boost.
The jobs package includes tax incentives for small businesses and a 25 percent cut in the income tax for middle-class families, using $287 million in savings from pared-down computer operations, revised agreement with government contractors, more efficient management and monies no longer needed to repay the state's debts.
 
A Dissenting View
 But Richard T. Mulready, co-chairman of the General Assembly's finance committee and a Democrat who has not taken sides in the primary race, said the specifics of Mr. Larson's income-tax proposal "did not add up."
And Mr. Curry's criticism of Mr. Larson goes even deeper, into a questioning of his leadership ability.
In debates between the two, Mr. Curry pointed out that Mr. Larson presided over the State Senate in the late 1980's as Connecticut raised taxes and racked up the largest deficit in proportion to its budget of any state in the nation.
And he questioned the relevance of Mr. Larson's repetition of the bills he had passed. "Are any of these initiatives making a difference in people's lives?" Mr. Curry asked.
 
Opponents With Similarities
 But supporters of both men say their similarities are greater than their differences. Both talk about hiring more police officers, holding down taxes, improving child care services and schools and saving more state funds through better management.
A Quinnipiac College Poll of 602 registered voters earlier this month showed Mr. Larson ahead in the race with the support of 23 percent of registered Democrats to 9 percent for Mr. Curry. (The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.)
But the large number of undecided voters and the difficulty in predicting the turnout for a primary makes it hard to handicap the race.
Kevin Sullivan, a State Senator and Larson supporter, said the primary may test voters' attitude toward government.
"I think people may be tired of candidates who run against the system," he said. "John is clearly in a different school."

HEADLINE: Ben Chavis Wasn't The Problem

BYLINE: By Michael Eric Dyson; Michael Eric Dyson, professor of communication at the University of North Carolina, is author of the forthcoming "Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X."

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
If the N.A.A.C.P. thinks it has solved its problems by dismissing Benjamin Chavis as executive director, it is avoiding a couple of tough lessons. First, it has lost touch with many African-Americans, especially the working-class and the permanently poor. Second, it has strayed way too far from its radical roots.
The N.A.A.C.P., like most civil rights groups, made racism its focus in combating the forces of inequality that strangled opportunities for blacks at the beginning of this century. Its specialty of attack was painstakingly shaped in our nation's courtrooms. Its piece de resistance -- the legal brief -- was fashioned by scholars and advocates like Charles Houston and Thurgood Marshall, who raised the defense of black interests to high, dramatic art. The results were sometimes revolutionary. 
 One was the monumental decision in Brown v. Board of Education -- the nation celebrated its 40th anniversary this year -- which attacked the destructive myth of separate but equal schools. With such cases, the N.A.A.C.P.'s place in history is guaranteed.
But times have worsened for the people the organization so nobly defended. Racism undeniably continues to haunt and hurt black lives. Its lethal trace can be discerned despite subtle changes in the DNA of racial bigotry. But a specter hardly anticipated in the heyday of the civil rights movement has tragically materialized.
Sharp class divisions, which were masked and partially absorbed by the illusory uniformity imposed on black life under segregation, have ripped black communities apart. The gulf between have-gots and have-nots has only widened with the strategies the N.A.A.C.P. used to bring blacks into the economic mainstream. An unintended consequence of its success has been the trumpeting of differences among our nation's blacks even as it sought the social ground for common experiences between the races.
Until Mr. Chavis was hired, this fact seemed lost on the N.A.A.C.P. Increasingly consumed with its corporate financing, the organization lost track of its less fortunate kin. The rank and file may have been working class, but its public face flashed the smile of smug bourgeois achievement.
Meanwhile, the poor, and particularly black youth, came under attack in political arguments that blamed their failures on their "pathological" culture, as seen in teen pregnancy, welfare dependency and violence.
Like most black institutions limited by an exhausted liberal vocabulary, the N.A.A.C.P. had little energy or inclination to defend people whose experience was alien to its core constituency. For many poor and young blacks, it has become a relic, an ethnosaur.
Mr. Chavis's elevation promised a new day in the N.A.A.C.P., with someone who would swell membership rolls with the young and disaffected. But as he reached out to gang members, rappers and controversial leaders like Louis Farrakhan, he curried disfavor with the organization's elite and mainstream black leaders. His critics arsaid he was aborting the group's traditional goals of mainstream acceptance and interracial cooperation.
But such logic reveals a huge non sequitur. Dialogue is not capitulation; conversation is not conversion. When black leaders speak to one another, even argue with one another, that doesn't mean they can't do the same with white allies. The idea that Mr. Chavis should not have met with or talked to certain kinds of blacks is a poisonous surrender; after all, during the civil rights movement, black leaders often met with white figures who were explicitly, violently racist.

Even more troubling is the notion that to get along with the nonblack side of its constituency (read wealthy white and corporate donors), the association must steer clear of the vital issues that mold the lives of most black people. If this idea perisists, N.A.A.C.P. will stand for national association for the advancement of corporate privilege, comfortable positions and complacent policies.
Such a fate can be avoided if black people who can afford it will give to political and social organizations. It would then be less likely that groups like the N.A.A.C.P. would be straitjacketed, silenced or bought off by interests inimical to black communities. Such patronage would bolster the prophetic and independent posture these organizations might adopt, especially if they are critical of big businesses and market machinations.
Though many African-Americans are displeased with what happened to Mr. Chavis, how many of us have given recently to the N.A.A.C.P., the National Urban League, the Rainbow Coalition, the Progressive National Baptist Convention and similar groups?
Mr. Chavis may be guilty of poor administration and personal missteps, but he cannot be faulted for trying to change the organization's direction. Its guardians have it only half right when they claim that the N.A.A.C.P. has drifted from its base. They overlook the radical democracy and political progressivism of founding figures like W. E. B. Du Bois. This pioneering historian and cultural critic expressed with eloquence a complex vision of justice and equality.
The N.A.A.C.P. must recapture its radical dimensions precisely because the problems of black Americans -- unemployment and urban violence, neoliberal rebuffs of racial progress and neoconservative assaults on young blacks, economic collapse and revived racism -- are most assuredly not moderate. To insist that the N.A.A.C.P. needs to be its old moderate self once again contradicts its glorious, and radical, legacy.

HEADLINE: Awe-Struck U.S. Executives Survey the China Market

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 1

 BODY:
John E. Bryson, chairman of the Southern California Edison Company, looked at the power-industry requirements of this country and was staggered by the scale of building that must occur in order to sustain China's extraordinary economic expansion.
"This is the largest power market in the world," says Mr. Bryson, one of 24 American chief executives who accompanied Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown to China over the last week. Mr. Bryson visited China for the first time, though his company's Mission Energy unit is negotiating power-plant deals in three southern Chinese provinces. 
 The American executives who traveled here on an aged Air Force Boeing 707 with Secretary Brown lent their names and corporate prestige to his barnstorming tour for "commercial diplomacy." With the visit ending, Mr. Brown spoke in Hong Kong today of building a new commercial relationship between China and the United States.
The businessmen arrived in China on Saturday with a variety of questions about how to fit their business strategies to the fastest-growing emerging market in the world. They left understanding that the answers to almost any question about succeeding in China are time and money.
During a whirlwind of meetings in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the American executives found China's leadership enigmatic, and the notion of political risk never far from their thoughts now that Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount leader, has passed his 90th birthday.
The businessmen said they were comfortable with President Clinton's new human rights policy, which is based on the idea that sustained development of China's economy will lead to greater political freedom.
"Commerce breeds industry, and as you increase the quality of life of a people, freedom follows," said Edwin Lupberger, a close friend of Mr. Clinton from Arkansas and chairman of the Entergy Corporation, a large electrical utility in the Southern United States.
Herded together as a United States delegation, some of the visiting corporate chiefs seemed lost without their limousines, executive jets and coattails of staff. When their plane broke down on Tuesday, many of them sat in the bar at the China World Hotel and actually wasted time.
In hot and dusty Beijing, there wasn't a power lunch to be had. But these executives know a market when they see one.
Robert S. O'Neil, chief executive of the engineering firm De Leuw, Cather & Company, which helped build the Washington, D.C., subway system, has looked out across China's backward urban landscape and counted 19 subway systems and 82 airports that are moving into design, construction or reconstruction phases in the next few years.
"We know there is a market here for us," Mr. O'Neil said. His firm has been working on Shanghai's subway project since 1987.
 
Highly Competitive Market
 Little of this has been easy. Last winter, his negotiators were close to winning a huge contract to provide engineering services for the subway system in Guangzhou, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany "came over here with his concessionary loans and took the contract away from us," Mr. O'Neil said.
His firm, a subsidiary of the Parsons Corporation, has now formed a consortium with other American companies like Motorola and General Railway Signal to compete better by tailoring their integrated products and systems to what China's rail projects are not able to develop domestically, like modern train control systems, communications and operating systems.
Mr. Bryson of Southern California Edison was awe-struck by the statistic that China plans to add 12,000 megawatts of installed power plant capacity each year to keep up with the country's fast-growing demand for electrical power.
"You know in our whole system," Mr. Bryson said of the Southern California region, "we operate 18,000 megawatts of generating capacity." It has taken his company several decades to develop its grid, which is only half again as large as China's annual growth in power.
Other figures bear out Mr. Bryson's enthusiasm. Just to turn the lights on in the thousands of factories rising out of the ground each year in this country, the Ministry of Power must build the equivalent of 15 to 20 large American power stations every 12 months.
Richard J. Swift, chairman of the Foster Wheeler Corporation, has been selling boilers and related equipment to the Chinese since 1984. He figures that the state-owned power industry will be able to manufacture the equipment for about three-quarters of the plants that need to be built each year.
"So you're looking at 2,000 to 3,000 megawatts of outside source power plants per year," Mr. Swift said. Though his company has been just an equipment seller in the past, he said he is now considering teaming up with Mr. Lupberger's Entergy Corporation and Mr. Bryson's Mission Energy to take equity positions in some of China's power-plant projects.
 
Deals Concluded on Trip
 Mr. Lupberger signed one of the many memorandums of understanding here to go forward on a big power deal, though he may be facing a year or more of negotiations over rates of return.
Entergy has agreed to buy into the aging Datong No. 2 power station in Shanxi province west of Beijing and double its capacity from 1,200 megawatts to 2,400 megawatts.
With a Hong Kong partner sharing the risk, Entergy would have a 22 percent stake in the project, putting up $70 million in equity and bringing along nearly $400 million of United States Export-Import Bank financing.
"Our business is not just capital, but technology and expertise," Mr. Lupberger said, "so we bring something to the party other than money."
But the businessmen acknowledged the long road ahead. There is a continuing dispute within the Chinese Government on what kind of profit foreign companies should be allowed to make selling electricity in a country that still considers itself socialist.
"If there is one thing we have learned," Mr. Lupberger said, "it's that the Chinese don't move fast on anything."

HEADLINE: Miami Beach Journal;
The Gold Coast Fights for Its Image

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Aug. 30

 BODY:
Men who walk the tide line on the white sand, nude-bathing beach here say they have come to look for Cuban refugees washing up on American shores.
Why they gaze inland instead of out to sea is a question that compromises the sincerity of their mission. 
 The nearest Cuban refugees, some 700 of them, are locked up in a detention center nearly 20 miles away, on the edge of the Everglades. But most residents of Greater Miami, population two million, expect it is only a matter of time before they are released and absorbed locally, soon to be followed by tens of thousands more held by the American authorities at Guantanamo Bay and from Cuba proper.
South Florida is still coping with the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, which struck the peninsula below Miami two years ago this month, and with an epidemic of highly publicized shootings of tourists within the past year. The latest influx of refugees is just one more trial for a metropolitan area that not too long ago promoted itself worldwide as the Gold Coast.
The story of Gerald and Pam McLaughlin testifies to the tarnishing of Miami's image. The couple, artists from the town of Cejax, outside Toronto, said today that they had to overcome their travel agent's objections when they told her they wanted to spend two weeks in South Florida.
"Florida gets a really bad press in Canada," said Mr. McLaughlin, 35, a tall man with gray eyes and a drooping walrus mustache. "All you hear about are tourists being shot."
The McLaughlins were having lunch at Mad Max, a cafe in one of the Art Deco hotels on the southern end of Miami Beach that opens to spill people out on the sidewalk beneath umbrella-topped tables.
Then, in words that could send shudders of pain through local boosters, Mr. McLaughlin said: "Our agent advised against flying into Miami. Much too dangerous, she said. Why didn't we consider flying to Havana for our holiday? Much safer there."
A blood-red parrot with green-tipped wings used as a prop for a sidewalk photographer nearby let out a squawk that could be heard uptown at the Chamber of Commerce.
As it turned out, the couple spent their two-week vacation avoiding the Miami area, stopping in Miami Beach only for lunch before catching a plane home this evening.
But Miami and Miami Beach, like punch-drunk fighters, gamely keep fighting back.
"Those of us who are part of the past, and hopefully part of the future, take these setbacks in stride," said Mayor Seymour Gelber of Miami Beach. "The natural attractions of climate, ocean and beach that brought people here for the better part of a century will continue doing so."
The Mayor says Miami Beach is a gentler place than it was a decade ago. That was when mostly penniless Cuban refugees from the 1980 Mariel boat lift were settled here by public agencies, producing what he said was "an influx of crime and drugs in the South Beach area." South Beach is about a 12-block area at the south end of Miami Beach.
But those same refugees, the Mayor pointed out, are now "part of the success story" of this city of 93,000 people. Most have moved into the work force and contribute to the economic and social vibrancy of Greater Miami, the Mayor said. Crime has dropped in Miami Beach in recent years, and millions of dollars are being spent to rejuvenate the convention and tourism industry, he said.
Lincoln Road, which in the Gold Coast's heyday in the 1950's offered gold-plated shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf-Goodman, is replacing its reputation for a moribund retail industry with one as a home for the arts. Both the New World Symphony and the Miami Ballet Company use Lincoln Road as a home base. Fittingly, two old tourist hotels, the Plymouth and the Ansonia, are being rebuilt into apartments for the young musicians and dancers.
But starving artists, while good for the soul, did not compensate for the business lost when German tourism dropped 36 percent this year after nine foreign tourists, including one German visitor in Miami, were attacked and killed while vacationing in Florida over the past two years.
Two new hotels, one with 800 rooms and the other with 250, will rise next to the Miami Beach Convention Center, the Mayor said, the first hotels to be built on Miami Beach in 30 years.
And some famous home-grown Floridians have selected South Beach for their restaurants. Burt Reynolds plans to open a new eatery this week not far from the one owned by Gloria Estefan. More important, said Brad Anderson, the 33-year old manager of the Mad Max cafe, who came here three years ago chasing an elusive singing career, more and more young people are being drawn to the area, which previously drew only Social Security pensioners and was dubbed "God's Waiting Room."
Still, all that is happening here is only modest reinvestment, compared with the activity across Biscayne Bay on the mainland.
In non-Hispanic Miami, the name of H. Wayne Huizenga is treated with the same deprecation on some radio talk shows as that dished out to Fidel Castro on the many Spanish-language stations here. Most of the resentment is aimed at the speed with which Mr. Huizenga (pronounced high-ZEEN-geh) has used his $700 million-plus wealth, mainly derived from his ownership and investment in Waste Management Inc. and Blockbuster Video, to snap up three of South Florida's four professional sports franchises -- the Miami Dolphins (football); the Florida Marlins (baseball), and the Florida Panthers (hockey) -- that represent the last icons of diminishing pride in the region.
But it is the tycoon's plan to build a $1 billion sports and entertainment complex on 2,500 acres of wetlands on the fringe of the Everglades that is generating the most acrimony. It may turn out to be the most costly private project in Miami history since receding waters lifted the peninsula from the ocean depths.
Mr. Huizenga sees his project, inevitably dubbed "Wayne's World, as a real competitor to Disney World, the Orlando-area attraction that has been detouring visitors away from South Florida for nearly a quarter of a century and turned the Gold Coast into the Old Coast.

HEADLINE: Tourism Enriches an Island Resort, But Hilton Head Blacks Feel Left Out

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C., Aug. 31

 BODY:
One day when he was a small boy and this was an undeveloped dream world of salt marsh, beach front and pine forest where all the inhabitants were black, Gene Wiley saw something he had never seen before -- a white man.
"I mean no disrespect, but I couldn't figure it out -- a nose like Bob Hope, hair that the wind blew all over his face like it didn't have no strength in it," recalls Mr. Wiley, who is 68. "We felt sorry for the guy; we felt like he was the victim of a plague or something. Then one day my father took me to Savannah and the whole damn town was white, and I knew this plague had taken the whole town and pretty soon it would be on Hilton Head Island, too." 
 As Mr. Wiley sees it, his boyhood forebodings have all come true. His island has become overwhelmingly white, in the form of a celebrated resort largely controlled by giant corporations serving affluent vacationers and Northern retirees. As for the few native islanders who have not left Hilton Head, they have largely been pushed to the margins, some of them working in low-paying jobs in the hotels and restaurants that have overtaken the island.
This weekend, though, the presence of Hilton Head's black minority may be more readily recognized, if fleetingly. The reason is an event that will be one in a seemingly endless series of showdowns over the symbolism of the Old South; in this case, a demonstration against flying the Confederate battle flag over the state Capitol in Columbia.
Blacks, many coming in buses from the mainland and led by the state branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, will march on Saturday. They are threatening to call for an economic boycott of the state unless the flag comes down; Hilton Head was chosen for the demonstration because of its lucrative tourist industry. Whites, who will hold a countermarch the next day, say removing the flag would be an insult to their heritage.
Tourism officials here are exasperated. They say that Hilton Head has nothing to do with the flag dispute and that the marches and the proposed boycott will hurt not only the tourism industry here but also the blacks who work in it. And yet the demonstrations are more than a fight over historic symbols. The marches will also serve as a reminder that to a large extent, even on this generically upscale resort island, the discontent and tensions that the South has always known are alive and just beneath the surface, unresolved.
 
The Ever-Present Plantation
 Once, blacks picked the long-strand cotton and worked the fields here among the South Carolina Sea Islands. Now, they clean linens, scrape deviled crabs off dirty plates and trim azaleas on private, gated resorts with names like Shipyard Plantation, Port Royal Plantation, Wexford Plantation, Colleton River Plantation and Hilton Head Plantation.
"The concept of the plantation hasn't changed," said Billie Burn, a landowner and local historian on Daufuskie Island, just across Calibogue Sound. "It's just reversed places. It used to be you couldn't get off the plantations. Now you can't get on."
To be sure, many blacks have shared in the prosperity. Those on the plantations include wealthy blacks like the sports star Michael Jordan, who has a house here. The N.A.A.C.P. recently held a convention on Hilton Head. But for many blacks, development has meant only low-wage jobs and displacement.
"I used to be in the resort industry myself until I realized just how apartheid-like our system is here," said Bill Ferguson, Hilton Head's only black town council member, who owns a landscaping design business. "Those who have money and wealth have not paved the way or even allowed the local people to take part in economic development and become self-sufficient or self-sustaining."
 
Civil War Watershed
 Before the Civil War, the Sea Islands were home to some of the wealthiest plantations in the South. But that world ended seven months after the fall of Fort Sumter, when landowners fleeing Union gunboats left behind 10,000 slaves who began a precarious existence as freed men and women.
After the war, some blacks remained on plantations as hired help. But many, particularly on Hilton Head, bought land and lived and worked in self-contained communities, many of which spoke the lilting mixture of English and African dialects known as Gullah.
Reachable only by boat until the 1930's, the Sea Islands remained largely isolated until well into the 1950's, when the development began on Hilton Head. Since then the population of the islands has exploded. Hilton Head alone has a permanent population of about 28,000, about 2,300 of them native black islanders.
Unlike most of seaside resorts in the United States, the South Carolina coast has a sizable black population. According to the Penn Center, founded on St. Helena Island in 1862 as the nation's first school for former slaves and now an educational and advocacy group, blacks still make up 36 percent of the coastal population in the state. If heavily white Hilton Head is discounted, the figure is 43 percent.
But the proportions are rapidly changing. The white population on the South Carolina coast increased by 72 percent from 1980 to 1990. The black population grew by 1 percent. Overall, blacks earn about a third of what whites earn.
 
The Tourists Arrive
 Nostalgia aside, the Sea Islands have never been a utopia. Minus air conditioning and luxury condominiums, they were places where the heat, mosquitoes and rattlesnakes were as much a part of life as the warm sun and bountiful sea. For decades, young people have been leaving to look for work. Most of those who stayed lived in poverty.
Many people, black and white, say the tourist boom has finally provided the jobs that can allow many people to stay on the island.
"Unemployment in Beaufort County is at record lows," said Cliff Charnes, chairman of the Hilton Head Visitors and Convention Bureau and president of the Sea Pines Company, the pioneer developer on Hilton Head. "You might go three counties inland, and it may be a 12-to-15 percent unemployment. Here it might be 2 to 3 percent. In every way I can think of, the life style is healthier and economically more solid in the coastal communities than inland across the South."
Ronald Stewart works at one of the hotels as a maintenance supervisor by day and drives a cab at night. He finds the "plantation" terminology demeaning but said he felt lucky to be able to work and rear his children on Hilton Head. "I wouldn't live anywhere else," he said.
Still, few places have institutionalized inequality to the degree that Hilton Head has. Because most services are provided by the plantations themselves, there are two Hilton Heads, the luxury world inside the plantations and the world outside, where residents are still seeking municipal water, sewer service and paved roads. Because of growth restrictions, much of the land owned by blacks cannot be fully developed.
For many who work on Hilton Head but live elsewhere, the situation is worse. Often a job means a three-hour commute each way, resulting in a workday that is longer than when work was done in the fields.
Wilhelmina Green, 45 years old, has six children and one grandchild and a husband who gets medical disability payments. She leaves her home on St. Helena Island about 1 P.M. for her job as a kitchen worker on Hilton Head. She catches the bus that serves the plantations, riding for three hours on a bus full of other black cooks, dishwashers, maids and waitresses. She arrives about 4 P.M. and works in a restaurant on one of the plantations until midnight. With less traffic late at night, she gets home about 2 A.M. Her pay: $6.50 an hour, with benefits.
Some black residents who have sold their land have made out well. Many have not. As the islands have been developed, taxes have skyrocketed, forcing some blacks to sell off their land or see it auctioned off for back taxes.
Similarly, loses are incurred on many properties called heirs' properties, land held in the name of the estate of the original landowner, often going back to the 19th century. Under South Carolina law, if one heir chooses to sell his interest, the buyer can have the entire property sold at auction to get his portion. As a result, developers often seek out distant heirs, often finding them out of state. The developers offer modest amounts for the heir's share of the property and then force a partition sale for the rest, at which they can expect to be the top bidder.
"They don't want black people around," said Mr. Wiley, a former member of Hilton Head's planning commission. "They want you to live on the mainland in some housing project, put a badge on you with your picture on it, come on a bus to work and then get the hell off."
 
Daufuskie's Example
 Most island blacks, including James Mitchell, a financial consultant and head of Hilton Head's N.A.A.C.P. group, say that development overall has been good for the island but that not enough has been done to allow blacks to participate fully. In that sense, Mr. Mitchell said, the flag protest reflects the same struggle for respect that African-Americans routinely face.
For a worst-case example, Hilton Head's blacks need only look across the water to Daufuskie. The island was once largely black, but its native population has been in decline since 1959, when pollution from the Savannah River ruined the shellfish beds that were the basis of its economy. Now, the old road to the beach has been closed and a new one rerouted around a golf course. The old African-American cemeteries are hidden on the edges of golf course fairways, and only about 60 old-time residents live outside the plantations that are the island's future.
One day this summer, Yvonne Wilson, whose roots on the island date from the time of slavery, drove her pickup on the unpaved roads from the dense, green glades of the old Daufuskie to the manicured fairways of the new one, giving a history tour as she went. She passed the remains of slave quarters, the 127-year-old United Baptist Church, the brick ruins that once served improbably as the local jail, and the Silver Dew winery.
"I want to make sure my kids can be a part of this as well," she said. "My biggest fear is that before long, we'll all be gone, and other than a marker here or a graveyard there, there will be nothing left to say that at one time black people were ever here."

"Now you can't get on;" Gene Wiley, 68, a native of Hilton Head, says he was taken aback when, as a boy, he first saw a white man; the island's population was all black back then. Now the resort area's white population is growing quickly. (Photographs by Alan S. Weiner for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: North Korea Invites Carter To Mediate

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Kim Jong Il, the reclusive Communist leader who is expected to succeed his father as absolute ruler of North Korea, has sent a letter to former President Jimmy Carter inviting him to Pyongyang to mediate the dispute with the United States over the North's nuclear ambitions, American officials said today.
The reports on the invitation are part of a slow broadening of contacts with North Korea, as the United States leads efforts to halt Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program and North Korea seeks to end its isolation with economic assistance and broader diplomatic recognition. As part of that process, the Clinton Administration announced today that, as expected, it would begin technical discussions with North Korea on Sept. 10 to fill out some of the details of an agreement reached between the two countries last month in Geneva. 
 Clinton Administration officials said that one group will meet in Pyongyang to discuss how the two countries will establish liaison offices in each others' capitals, a step toward diplomatic recognition. Another group will meet in Berlin to discuss details of North Korea's request that the United States supply a modern, light water nuclear reactor to generate electricity and replace North Korea's existing nuclear facilities.
Though Mr. Carter has reportedly not yet accepted the invitation, his second in recent months, the letter gave some insight into the thinking of Mr. Kim, who dropped out of sight shortly after his father, Kim Il Sung, died in early July.
Mr. Kim reportedly indicated in the letter that he would continue to follow the flexible policy on the nuclear issue that his father adopted shortly before his death from a heart attack. But he expressed no interest in rescheduling what would have been a first meeting with the South Korean President, Kim Young Sam.
The invitation was reported here today in a major daily newspaper, the Joong Ang Daily News, and was confirmed by an American official in Washington, who said that the letter had been received several weeks ago and that Mr. Carter had yet to accept the invitation. Mr. Carter is reportedly in Liberia, where he is expected to help mediate a bloody dispute between feuding tribal groups.
But it was clear that the American Government -- which, thanks to an earlier effort by Mr. Carter, is already engaged in high-level negotiations with North Korea -- was unenthusiastic about the prospect of Mr. Carter's opening a new and uncertain channel to the Government in North Korea. The South Korean Government has been little short of hostile to the idea and to Mr. Carter personally.
 
A Negative View
 "This has to be looked at a little negatively," a South Korean official said. "At this stage, what can he do in Pyongyang? Clearly, North Korea has been trying to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea."
In Edgartown, Mass., a senior aide to President Clinton said today that the White House understood that Mr. Carter had a standing invitation from North Korea to return there, but that the former President had no plans to travel there in the foreseeable future.
The White House also sought to play down the significance of the talks between the United States and North Korea that are to begin Sept. 10 in Pyongyang. Dee Dee Myers, a spokeswoman for Mr. Clinton, said in Edgartown that the discussions about the possible opening of an American liaison office in North Korea were intended simply "to allow us to be prepared" if the dispute over nuclear weapons is resolved.
"This is not any kind of diplomatic conversation," Ms. Myers said. "It is a technical conversation." She said the purpose of discussing logistical arrangements was that "if a decision was made to open a liaison office, we would have enough information to be able to move forward quickly."
Separate talks are also to begin in Berlin on Sept. 10, and will focus on providing North Korea with technology to build a safer nuclear reactor. The high-level talks between the two countries are to resume on Sept. 23 in Geneva, Ms. Myers said.
Relations with North Korea have been in a tense and critical phase for 18 months, ever since North Korea refused inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency access to nuclear sites. The refusal stoked fears that North Korea was producing plutonium for building nuclear bombs. The C.I.A. estimates that North Korea already has the materials to build two nuclear bombs.
 
Carter Visited in June
 The United States threatened to impose economic sanctions if North Korea kept its sites closed, and North Korea warned that such action would be taken as an act of war.
In June, Mr. Carter visited Pyongyang and met with Kim Il Sung. Mr. Carter's effort was played down in both South Korea and Washington because of worries that he was overly sympathetic to North Korea's view, but he seemed to have extracted several concessions from Mr. Kim that led to a new opening.
North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear program and to allow inspectors to monitor where some spent reactor fuel rods were being stored. In return, the United States agreed to resume negotiations with the North Koreans without other conditions.

HEADLINE: Stocks Down For 2d Day; Dow Off 11.98

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For the second consecutive day, the stock market pulled back from recent gains and closed down on leading indexes -- especially the Nasdaq composite index, which has a large number of high-technology stocks that were hurt by a troubled outlook for the computer business. Bond prices were steady, and the dollar fell.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 11.98 points, to 3,901.44, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2.32 points, to 473.17. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell a steep 6.67 points, to 758.95. 
 In the last two days, the Dow has fallen nearly 16 points. But the market often rallies, however modestly, on the Friday before the long Labor Day weekend. Last year, for example, the Dow rose nearly 8 points, to 3,633.93.
 
Employment Data Due
 This morning, before the stock market opens at 9:30, traders will scrutinize the Labor Department's report on employment. Wall Street economists have had a poor record of predicting the volatile unemployment rate and other jobless data, so the market could be surprised by the figures.
A higher-than-expected figure implies a slowing economy and would be bullish for bonds and for some stocks, but a lower-than-expected figure implies possible inflationary pressures and would be bearish for both stocks and bonds because a too-strong economy could prompt further rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The consensus Wall Street estimate is for an August rate of 6.1 percent, unchanged from July.
Technology stocks were the newsmakers yesterday, with four of the top five industries in the Standard & Poor's 500 showing major price declines coming from high-technology areas. They were semiconductors, software, computer systems and local telephone companies, which are major purchasers of computer equipment.
The exception was the top price mover, electric utilities, whose shares were hurt, in part, when an analyst at CS First Boston lowered his assessments to "sell" on Consolidated Edison and Niagara Mohawk Power. The analyst noted that the New York Public Service Commission staff had recommended to regulators a rate cut for Niagara, which could affect Con Ed's pending rate case.
 
Decline for AST
 Of the technology stocks, AST Research, a large maker of personal computers, showed one of the sharpest falls, down 415/16 , to 131/16 , after AST warned that product delays and lower prices for computers would hurt results in the quarter ending on Sept. 30. AST, which was the most active stock yesterday at 14.9 million shares, made the announcement after the market closed on Wednesday. The AST announcement called into question whether industry sales would rise over the next few months.
The AST warning also cast a pall on a wide range of computer-related stocks, including Compaq, which fell 2 1/4, to 35; Microsoft, down 2, to 56 1/8; Intel, down 1 1/2, to 64 1/4, and Cisco Systems, down 5/16 , to 24 1/2.

HEADLINE: Lawyers' Repute Has Faded, but Desire to Be One Hasn't

BYLINE: CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Adam Bonin has read all the horror stories about lawyers -- how hard they work, how little respect they get, how thankless their profession has become. Yet from the first time he saw "L.A. Law," Mr. Bonin says, he knew he wanted to be a lawyer.
"That show made law look so cool," said Mr. Bonin, a 21-year-old Philadelphian recently accepted by the University of Chicago Law School. "I like being on the spot and being in the spotlight, and that means law or politics." 
 Becky Pennell, 23, of Richmond, Wash., who is at Stanford Law School, takes the cautionary tales about the profession more to heart. But Ms. Pennell said she planned to work with the homeless and did not think the public images of lawyers would apply to her.
"Yes, it's discouraging when people don't differentiate between ambulance chasers and legal aid attorneys," she said. "But in public interest law you are not working to get more billable hours or to make partner, but to have a positive impact on the world."
It is almost impossible to pick up a law journal without reading yet another story about how miserable the lot of lawyers has become. They work 80 hours a week or more, yet their chances of making partner are getting slimmer every day. Many feel like hypocrites, increasingly forced to defend, say, environmental polluters by day, even if they attend Sierra Club meetings by night. In place of the respect once accorded lawyers, they cannot attend a cocktail party without hearing yet another lawyer joke.
 
No Dearth of Law Students
 In such an environment, law schools should be facing a tough sell to undergraduates wary of spending three years and probably close to $90,000 to pursue a reviled profession.
And in fact, the flood of would-be lawyers has declined to about 85,000 this year from a peak of 94,000 in 1991, according to the Law School Admission Council.
But such drops can easily be pegged to the economy and the aging of the nation's population. And at the top schools, applications are stable or even rising.
"We're going to be in business for a while," said Nan McNamara, assistant dean for admissions at New York University School of Law, whose applications were up this year.
At Yale Law School, officials are bracing for too many students. While applications are holding steady, the yield -- the number of students a school accepts who actually enroll -- turned out to be 217, instead of the 175 students Yale had expected.
"Our yield rate has been going up each year," said Jean K. Webb, Yale Law School's director of admissions. "Is it the recession? Is it the continued belief that lawyers get high salaries? Is it a spillover from the medical profession, where morale is even worse? We've looked at all these possible reasons, and the truth is, we don't know what it is."
Gerald L. Wilson, a pre-law adviser at Duke University's Trinity College, where more than 20 percent of the graduating class goes on to law school, said of the applicants, "They all know the job market is bleak, the profession is changing, but each one thinks he or she will be the exception.".
Law school admissions deans say they are picking up the same attitude. "None of our applicants are saying, 'Gee, I didn't know there are unhappy lawyers out there,' " said Richard I. Badger, dean of students and head of the admissions committee at the University of Chicago Law School, where applications were up 8 percent this year. "They say they know what they want to do and these other unhappy people did not."
In interviews, admissions deans and law students said that many students assumed, with some justification, that backbreaking hours and backbiting environments are largely the hallmarks of big-city law firms handling huge corporate cases. These students are looking to careers in public interest law, as legal aid lawyers or environmental advocates, for example, or to careers with smaller firms in medium-sized cities.
At Stanford, for example, the proportion of students joining law firms immediately after graduation has decreased by about 9 percent over the last five years, while the proportion going to judicial clerkships has increased 7 percent and the proportion going into public interest law is up 3 percent.
"Students increasingly realize that what they are losing financially by going into public service, they are getting back in triplicate in job satisfaction," said Madeline Kochen, director of public interest law programs at Stanford.
Even students going into conventional law firms insist that they can find the ones that will not force them into moral dilemmas.
Kevin J. O'Connor, 27, who will graduate from Rutgers University School of Law at Newark next year, has already accepted a job with Porzio, Bromberg & Newman in Morristown, N.J. Mr. O'Connor says "everyone seems happy" at the the 40-member corporate law firm, which specializes in litigation and environmental law.
He added: "I don't think I will feel uncomfortable defending corporations in product liability suits. It is the plaintiffs' attorneys who usually bring the cases without merit."
Indeed, law students seem to have a penchant for differentiating between "them" (the lawyers who give the profession a bad name) and "us" (those who will restore the law to its former prestige).
Amy C. Hagen, 24, of Troy, Mich., worked as a paralegal in a New York firm before joining the Class of '97 at Chicago Law School. The 90-hour weeks she saw people working did not faze her, and the work excited her. "Even my father believes all lawyers are crooks, and that can be pretty discouraging," Ms. Hagen said. "But I learned that the lawyers solving corporate problems or negotiating mergers and acquisitions are not the same ambulance-chasing lawyers doing infomercials on television."
 
A Professional Accessory
 There was a time, admissions deans say, when paralegal experience was about the only experience that law students had. No more.
"We get nurses interested in malpractice law or bioethics, psychiatrists who want to be expert witnesses, engineers and military officers driven to intellectual property law by defense cutbacks, all kinds of people who fear their careers are stagnating," said Giles W. Kennedy, director of law admissions at the University of Georgia School of Law.
Mark Rozman, a 26-year-old electrical engineer from Haverhill, Mass., is a case in point. He knows that law jobs are getting harder to find. But he does not see much future in his current job with a military contractor.
"Sure the bad publicity about the job market and the erosion of prestige scares me, but I'm hoping patent law will be different," said Mr. Rozman, who is studying intellectual property law at Georgia. "And down here in the South, the pay may be lower, but so is the stress."
Actually, many older students now in law school say they do not intend to practice law at all. They see the extra degree as a way to make themselves more valuable in their current jobs, and thus shield themselves from employee cutbacks.
"Many of our students plan to go back to their jobs and do copyright research or offer patent advice, without ever even taking the bar," said Olga Hunczak, director of admissions at the Rutgers law school. "They are not worried about getting a job; they have a job. In fact, many of their companies paid their tuition."
 
'A Delaying Tactic'
 Others see it as a way to postpone making career decisions. "For many, law school is a delaying tactic, a holding pattern," said Mr. Wilson of Duke. "Even if they don't practice law, they feel a law degree is a marketable credential, where a Ph.D. in English is not."
Part of that holding-pattern mentality is driven by the fairly bleak job market for college graduates. And students who decide in their senior year that they need more education have a pretty narrow field of choice.
"They can't go to med school because they haven't taken physics and chemistry, and business schools almost always require a lot of work experience," said Faye Deal, director of admissions and financial aid at Stanford Law School. "In a sense, for these students a law degree is the most accessible choice."
It is also, other school officials point out, an intellectually stimulating environment. And they say that jokes notwithstanding, lawyers still command their share of respect. "Society has a love/hate relationship with the legal profession," Mr. Wilson of Duke noted. "We may hate lawyers in the aggregate, but as individuals they are still the ones we choose as our community leaders."

HEADLINE: 11 Stowaways Found on Ship In Container

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Eleven stowaways endured four days locked in an oven-hot shipping container with little food or water and no bedding, apparently dreaming that their voyage from the Caribbean to the United States would bring good jobs. But it appears that all they will get for their agony is a quick trip home to the Dominican Republic.
The 11 were discovered this morning when a deckhand aboard the Carolina at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal heard them yelling and pounding on the sides of the container, which was stacked about 40 feet above the deck. Firefighters, ambulance technicians and seamen let the stowaways -- 10 men and a woman -- out of the container before dawn today. 
 None of the stowaways have requested political asylum, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said today, which means that they will almost certainly be sent back immediately to the Dominican Republic.
"They were emaciated," said Paul Visoskas, head of an emergency rescue team from University Hospital here. "I don't know how they survived. God only knows what those people must have suffered, with the heat and the ship rolling on the ocean."
 
Three Days at Sea in Foul Box
 Capt. John J. Reinke of the Port Authority police said three of the 11 were semiconscious when rescue teams took them from the foul-smelling container shortly before 3:15 A.M. today.
"They were all very scared and all very weak," Captain Reinke said.
The 11, who ranged in age from 18 to 53, had endured three days at sea in the container and another at the dock in Elizabeth before help came. About three-fourths of the container was filled with boxes of clothing, leaving the 11 squeezed during their journey into a little cubicle measuring perhaps 8 by 10 feet, the captain said.
Daytime temperatures may have reached 130 degrees, said Dr. Arthur Calise, who treated four of the stowaways at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center here. What little food and water they took into the container at the port of Rio Haina in the Dominican Republic on Saturday night was gone by Monday, two days before the Carolina docked in Elizabeth, Nancy Pacheco, a nurse at the medical center, said.
 
Deportation Being Arranged
 Four of the 11 remained hospitalized tonight, including the oldest stowaway, Juan Feliz, 53, a diabetic. Officials at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center said he was suffering from severe dehydration and would require perhaps two more days of medical care. All the others suffered milder degrees of dehydration.
The seven who were treated and released during the day were questioned immediately by agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. By early this evening, none had requested political asylum in the United States, paving the way for the agency to order them returned to their homeland in short order.
During an afternoon news conference, William R. Tillman, deputy director of the immigration office here, said preparations were under way to return them on the Carolina when she sails from Elizabeth for the Dominican Republic at 10:30 P.M. Friday. But tonight, Mr. Tillman said that those released from hospitals might possibly be flown home.
The owner of the Carolina, Puerto Rican Marine Management Inc. of Edison, N.J., is responsible for paying for their return trip under immigration law. If it does not return them, the company is subject to a fine of $3,000 per stowaway.
Mr. Tillman said the return could be delayed if any of the stowaways asked for asylum while still in the United States. If such a request were made, he said, the agency would take formal custody of the stowaways from the ship's owner until a hearing had been held by an immigration judge. The stowaways' upkeep pending the hearing would be paid by the immigration agency.
Until a policy change this month, the I.N.S. had required the owner of a ship or plane that stowaways took to the United States to pay for their food and lodging before asylum hearings.
 
Eligibility Seems Unlikely
 Mr. Tillman said he doubted any of the 11 would seek asylum because they did not satisfy the criteria. He and other immigration officials said several of the stowaways said during interviews that they came to the United States in hopes of getting work.
Economic hardship is not grounds for asylum under the agency's rules. Those eligible for asylum must be fleeing political, religious, racial, or ethnic persecution in their homeland.
Mr. Tillman said investigators were still trying to learn how and why the 11 came to enter the cargo container in Rio Haina sometime on Saturday. The ship had arrived there from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
"Some of them indicated they had assistance in identifying the container and getting into it," he said.
One of three stowaways treated at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Elizabeth told medical personnel someone was paid at the Dominican port.
"He said they paid a lot of money to be brought here," said Susan Diamond, a hospital spokeswoman. "They wanted to work. They thought they would be fed and cared for and brought into the United States."
Mr. Tillman said officials believed dockworkers got the money. He expressed doubts that anyone aboard the Carolina was involved.
The stowaways told medical officials they carried one bottle of water and a few snacks into the container Saturday. They all shared the water, each drinking a capful every few hours before it was gone on Monday, Dr. Calise of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center said.
The little amount of food was eaten quickly, too. "They all looked as if they hadn't eaten even before the trip," said Ms. Pacheco, the nurse at Newark Beth Israel.
The Carolina docked in Elizabeth at 7:15 A.M. Wednesday and was not unloaded immediately. The container remained where it had throughout the three days at sea, the fifth highest in a stack of six on the ship's open deck.

HEADLINE: A Mixed August for Retailers

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The nation's leading retailers reported mixed results for August yesterday, as consumers continued to demonstrate a penchant for bargain-based shopping.
Still, analysts said last month's retail sales supported the notion that consumers, who are responsible for about two-thirds of the economy, are spending enough to maintain growth at a moderate pace. 
 "If you look at most merchandise lines in most stores, consumer spending has not held up badly," Sandra Shaber, a senior vice president at the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said. "What the job market is generating in terms of checks, the consumer is spending.
"The missing link at this point is cars," she added. "And the real thrust to consumer spending has to come from car sales."
 
Part of a Larger Data Picture
 The retailers' reports come as the economy's growth appears to be cooling off. A survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management showed manufacturing growth slowing in August, though there were signs of rising prices. [Page D5.]
Separately, the Government is to report today on the nation's employment in August, and economists are expecting the figures to show that the economy created fewer new jobs than the 259,000 added in July.
Economists, analysts and investors are reviewing these data for signals about the economy and the direction of the bond and stock markets. They hope to discern how much the economy may slow in the second half of the year from its second-quarter pace of 3.8 percent and whether the slowdown will take pressure off price increases. If it does, the Federal Reserve may avoid another rise in short-term interest rates, which many analysts expect in November.
 There were some indications of strength in the retailers' August sales. Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said the firm's composite index of sales at 22 leading retailing companies rose 4.9 percent in August, following a 3.9 percent increase in July.
"But the gains are not as big as they were earlier in the year," Mr. Feiner said.
August is often viewed as an indicator of how retailers will perform in the fall, their most important season, because of the back-to-school sales during the month.
But analysts said what happens in August is less useful a barometer than it was a few years ago.
"Back-to-school sales are hard to gauge these days because school starts at various times in various parts of the country," Mr. Feiner said. "September should provide a better read on fall clothing sales."
Of the big chains, analysts said they were particularly impressed with sales at Sears, Roebuck & Company and the J. C. Penney Company.
Sears said same-store sales rose 5.2 percent, and overall sales were up 5.1 percent. At Penney, same-store sales increased 10.9 percent, while total sales, including its drugstore and catalogue operations, rose 10.7 percent. And Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said same-store sales rose 6.6 percent from a year ago, while total sales were up 22 percent.
Same-store sales, or sales from stores open at least a year, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's strength. They exclude the results of newer stores, where sales tend to be unusually high. Same-store sales also exclude results from stores closed in the past year.
"The fact that Sears and Penney did terrifically suggests that Americans are willing to go out and buy, but at stores that are very moderately priced," said Kurt Barnard, a retailing consultant in Berkeley Heights, N.J. and publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report.
Federated Department Stores Inc. also posted robust results. The company reported a 5.9 percent increase in same-store sales, an an 11.6 percent gain in overall business. It said its results were helped by strong sales of items for the home like bedroom and bathroom furnishings.
Cost-conscious shopping was the theme at even the toniest stores.
Mr. Barnard said he was taken aback by an 11.3 percent increase in same-store sales Neiman Marcus reported for August until he noticed the high-priced chain was running clearance sales last month.
Consumers bought clothes last month, but they did not do their shopping at specialty apparel chains.
Wayne Hood, a retailing analyst at Prudential Securities, said same-store sales at the specialty retailers he tracks fell 1 percent in August, following a 1.1 percent drop in July.
Among specialty retailers, Limited Inc. said same-store sales were unchanged in August, while its overall business rose 7 percent. At Gap Inc., same-store sales fell 5 percent, while total sales rose 6 percent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: The Snack-Food Frontier;
Chinese to Get a Taste Of Cheese-Less Cheetos

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
At last, Cheetos, the snack, has come to China, the country. The catch? They don't taste like Cheetos.
The maker of Cheetos, Pepsico, announced a $1 million joint venture yesterday to produce the little crispy-tasting cheese puffs in Guangdong province, where the per-capita income is among the highest in China. It marks the first time a major snack-food brand will be produced in China for Chinese tastes, Pepsico said. 
 But these Cheetos don't taste like cheese, which is hardly a mainstay of the Chinese diet. "We are offering two flavors, Savory American Cream and Zesty Japanese Steak," Jeffrey Goh, general manager of Pepsico Foods International, said in a telephone interview from the city of Guangzhou.
In focus groups for more than 1,000 people in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing, the cheese-ish taste of American Cheetos did not, as they say, test well. Pepsico had to try more than 600 flavors, ranging from Roasted Cuttlefish to Sweet Carmel, before settling on Savory American Cream ("a buttered popcorn flavor," Mr. Goh said) and Zesty Japanese Steak ("a teriyaki-type taste").
But is a Cheeto a Cheeto if it doesn't taste like cheese? "It's still crispy, it has a Cheeto shape and it's fun to eat, so it's a Cheeto," Mr. Goh said.
Among those who tried the first run of Chinese Cheetos yesterday were the United States Secretary of Commerce, Ronald H. Brown, and a group of American executives visiting Guangzhou as part of a trade mission to China. Mr. Brown's reaction was not reported by the foreign news media assembled to cover the tour.
The estimated market for Western snack foods in Guangdong province is $40 million to $70 million, Mr. Goh said. The province, with 70 million consumers, represents a market that is one-third the size of the United States population. If the snack foods are a success, the line will expand to Hong Kong and the rest of China.
"With the Chinese economy gaining momentum and work hours increasing, between-meal snacking is rising as rapidly as disposable income," Mr. Goh said.
The introduction of Cheetos will be backed by television and print advertising and promotions based on Chester Cheetah, the brand's feline brand symbol, riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The packages will carry the Cheeto logo in English along with the Chinese characters "qi duo" (pronounced CHEE dwaugh).
"Luckily," Mr. Goh said, "the translation is 'new surprise,' instead of some phrase that might offend people."

HEADLINE: Inflation Still Discerned In a Cooler Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The economy cooled in August but not enough to put the freeze on inflation, a widely followed survey of industrial companies showed yesterday.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's report for August showed activity at the nation's factories expanded at a much weaker pace than any time in the last eight months, suggesting that the economy is slowing down. 
 But the survey, considered a leading economic forecasting tool, disclosed that the number of companies reporting higher prices for raw materials rose to the highest level in six years, suggesting that inflation pressures still menace the economy because those price increases could be passed on to consumers.
Economists said the data did not necessarily mean that a surge in prices was imminent. Rather, they said, the survey reflects the inflationary effects of strong economic growth in the first half of the year.
"We probably won't see a real slowdown in prices until a few months down the road," said Bernie Markstein, chief economist at Meridian Bancorp, a large regional banking company in Reading, Pa.
The purchasing managers' report coincided with the release of other economic data that presented a mixed picture. Weekly unemployment insurance claims hit a six-week high. Leading retailers said sales were mixed in August. And construction spending rose moderately in July.
 
Focus of Financial Markets
 The financial markets will be focusing today on the Government's report on employment in August for further signs of inflationary pressures.
The purchasing managers' manufacturing index, based on responses from purchasing managers at 300 large industrial companies, fell 56.2 percent in August from 57.8 percent in July.
An index reading above 50 percent indicates an expansion, while a reading below 50 percent indicates a decline.
Factory production grew at a lower level than in July and new orders were down at more companies than the month before, the survey showed.
But the purchasing managers' price index, closely watched by the financial markets, jumped to 74.5 percent, from 73.1 percent in July, its highest level since August 1988.
"This increase in material prices is one of the strongest concerns of purchasers," said Ralph G. Kauffman, chairman of the purchasing managers' business survey committee and manager of procurement at the Oryx Energy Company.
Among the other economic reports yesterday, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 9,000 last week, to 332,000, but the increase largely reflected an end to many summer vacation jobs.
The figure was slightly smaller than economists expected. They did not expect the dismissal of seasonal workers to affect the August unemployment figures.
Meanwhile, spending on construction projects rose moderately in July despite a drop in residential building because of heavy government spending.
 
Rise in Construction Spending
 The Commerce Department said construction spending was up six-tenths of 1 percent in July, the fifth straight gain, after advancing three-tenths of 1 percent in June.
Spending on residential, nonresidential and government projects totaled $510.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from a revised $507.5 billion in June.
The gain in construction spending was a little more than analysts forecast, but they noted the advance was concentrated in the public sector. Private construction spending was weaker than anticipated.
"At this point, it looks like residential construction outlays will decline in the third quarter while nonresidential construction will be up slightly," said economists for Merrill Lynch & Company in a statement.
The residential spending decline included a four-tenths of 1 percent drop in outlays for single-family houses. Apartment outlays fell eight-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Slightly Weaker; Jobs Report Today Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened slightly yesterday in thin, technically driven trading as most currency dealers avoided taking new positions ahead of today's report on United States employment.
The dollar followed the bond market, which dipped after a national manufacturing survey indicated sharp and potentially inflationary increases in raw material prices last month. The dollar recouped most of the early drop as bond prices recovered. 
 Bond prices, which are highly sensitive to signs of inflation, fell after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its price index rose to a six-year high in August. In recent months, currency dealers have increasingly watched the prices of dollar-denominated assets in order to gauge demand for the dollar.
 
A Movement in Tandem
 "Capital markets now seem more important than trade flows," said David Durst, a vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company. "The question is whether funds are going to be deployed in dollar, yen or mark assets. That's why the bond and the dollar have been rallying and falling in tandem."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 99.71 Japanese yen from 100.18 yen on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 1.5750 German marks, from 1.5816 marks on Wednesday.
The decision yesterday by the Bundesbank to leave interest rates unchanged appeared to have little impact, although some market participants said the lack of action by the German central bank had helped support the mark.
In any case, few dealers were willing to make major bets on the dollar in advance of today's employment data for August.
The British pound advanced broadly yesterday on speculation that the Bank of England would raise interest rates and on hope that the Irish Republican Army cease-fire would yield a permanent settlement in Northern Ireland.
Jim Blackwelder, a vice president at NatWest Financial Markets Group, said, "If the I.R.A. situation bears fruit, it could make the U.K. investment environment look a lot more favorable." .
In New York trading, the British pound advanced to $1.5455, from $1.5340 on Wednesday.
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.3225 Swiss francs, down from 1.3325 francs on Wednesday; at 5.3905 French francs, down from 5.4135 francs, and at 1,583 Italian lire, down from 1,589 lire.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Rollbacks An Issue For Union In Talks

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Negotiators for the National Hockey League and its Players Association met for four hours yesterday at the league headquarters in Manhattan and bargained over terms of a new collective bargaining agreement.
No settlement was announced but when the meeting ended, Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the union, expressed displeasure over rollbacks of benefits imposed by Commissioner Gary Bettman. 
 "It's a blatant economic attack on the players, and I don't think it's good for the relationship," Goodenow said. "But he's made his decision. Anything he would do to make it more difficult is not in our mutual best objectives. He's got his reasons. Ask Gary Bettman."
Bettman said he was surprised that Goodenow complained about the rollbacks.
"They never raised the issue," Bettman said, referring to the bargaining session that had just ended.
Bettman said that both sides have set tentative dates for further negotiations next week.
Asked to characterize yesterday's session, Bettman replied: "The fact that we are continuing to meet is positive. We're committed to try to make a deal. The fact that we've gotten into bargaining for the first time in five months is a positive."
Referring again to the benefit cutbacks, Bettman said: "My goal is not to punish the players. My goal is to make a deal."
Referring to the baseball strike now in its fourth week, Bettman said "I don't want to be in that situation."
As of yesterday, Bettman unilaterally slashed player benefits, including insurance and pension contributions, and he eliminated per-diem expense money for training camp.
The 26 teams are returning to camp next week in preparation for the regular season, which begins Oct. 1. An expected lockout of the players was averted Wednesday when the league announced that the training camps would open as scheduled. The union has been working without a collective bargaining agreement since last Sept. 15.
Among the major issues is a salary structure that is based on team revenues. Bettman has not used the term salary cap, which he helped develop as an executive with the National Basketball Association in the 1980's. But hockey players have said they are wary of any salary structure based on revenue because they fear it will amount to salary restrictions similar to those in the National Football League which have caused roster disruptions this summer.
Although top league officials and union officials attended yesterday's session, no players were at the table. This is an indication that talks are at an early stage and that tradeoffs and decisions are not about to happen soon.
It is possible that the benefit cutbacks imposed by Bettman could be rescinded and restored to the players on a retroactive basis if an agreement is reached before the season.

HEADLINE: Summer's Last Hurrah: The Final Fling Before the Fall;
Recircling the Globe

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
Here are 10 ways to celebrate the Labor Day weekend in the New York metropolitan region. (An introduction appears on page C1.)
If you're a Unisphere, the world is a lonely place. You're one of a kind. Your youth is gone. And to tell the truth, you were never very popular in the first place. When the World's Fair packed up and left Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, it left you behind to stew in a pool of stagnant water, like a soda can from the Pepsi Pavilion. 
 The Unisphere is 30. The immense stainless steel globe, the symbol of the 1964-65 New York World's Fair, is not the most handsome work of public art in New York City. Nor is Flushing Meadows-Corona Park the city's greatest outdoor space. The landscape has so little variety of scale that walking through the park can bring on the kind of panic you may have experienced in a nightmare: you trudge and trudge and go nowhere.
In theory, the Unisphere represents "peace through understanding," but its real theme is size. That's a World's Fair archetype: the biggest wedge of cheese, the world's most powerful light bulb. Twelve stories high, weighing 900,000 pounds, the world's biggest globe was designed and executed by United States Steel, and it commemorates a moment when steel led the American industrial economy, that economy was the strongest in the world and the nation stood on the verge of conquering the universe. From the rim of the reflecting pool, the globe presents an image of the earth as it would look from a distance of 6,000 miles.
Today, the Unisphere looks poignantly isolated within a time warp of faded optimism. Though the park is heavily used, the area around the globe is often gripped by a strange, ominous silence. This object was made to be surrounded by bustling crowds, snapping flags, gushing fountains, colored lights and nightly displays of fireworks overhead, not to mention the strange menagerie of 150 pavilions that once stood here in jumbled profusion. Nothing can compensate for the loss of context around this metallic centerpiece.
But since last May, thanks to a $3 million renovation sponsored by the office of the Queens Borough President, the Unisphere has gleamed with something like its former high spirits. The reflecting pool has been patched up, with new fountain jets that shoot the water to a height of 22 feet. New lighting illuminates the fountains at night. Rose gardens now bloom where the New England and New Jersey pavilions once stood.
The best way to get there is, of course, by Ford Mustang. The original model was unveiled at the fair in April 1964. And pack some Belgian waffles. Not the world's biggest dessert, perhaps, but surely one of the heaviest, this sandwich of pastry, strawberries and whipped cream was the culinary craze of the 1964-65 World's Fair, and can still be found on the menus of many coffee shops in town.

HEADLINE: The Real Truth of Poverty

 BODY:
Demonizing welfare mothers has become political sport, with politicians everywhere blaming them for moral decline, budget deficits and even poverty itself. A report this week by New York's Citizens Budget Commission challenges this stereotype in useful and enlightening ways. It shows that women on welfare make up a far smaller percentage of the poor than popular wisdom would have it. It also confirms what previous studies have shown: Medicaid, not welfare, is the prime source of runaway spending on poverty.
Welfare mothers are routinely portrayed as slackers who make up the bulk of the poor and soak up more money every year. The fact is that only one in four poor households in New York City is headed by a single parent; welfare payments, when adjusted for inflation, have actually declined by 30 percent since 1972. 
 The poor in New York are also more ethnically diverse than commonly supposed. Among the elderly, for example, nearly half of all households in poverty are headed by whites. Like earlier studies, the commission's report suggests that the failure of welfare payments to keep pace with inflation contributes to homelessness.
For years, Gov. Mario Cuomo has proposed that New York State assume the share paid by local governments for Medicaid, the program of medical insurance for the poor. That is because New York is one of the few states that makes local governments pick up part of the tab for Medicaid. The Governor's plan foundered partly because he would take back local sales or income taxes in exchange for picking up Medicaid, a prospect that worried many suburban legislators.
Medicaid siphons off money that might be devoted to education, training, infrastructure. Because it has a large poverty population, New York levies onerous state and city taxes that become a major factor in persuading businesses to locate elsewhere. This, over time, erodes the tax base.
New York City will spend about $2.5 billion on Medicaid in 1995. It ought to pay nothing. The nation's poor should be a national responsibility, with Washington paying the entire tab. Short of that, the state should pay Medicaid bills for all its poor citizens.
The commission's report provides a fresh rationale for a state takeover of Medicaid. Medicaid, it says, is the "largest and most rapidly growing expenditure for the poor." Again, welfare mothers and their children account for far less spending than one might think. The elderly and disabled make up less than a quarter of New York's Medicaid population but account for nearly 60 percent of total Medicaid costs.
New York City taxpayers have been hit hard by the need to pay for programs that cater to a large poverty population. But welfare mothers are not breaking the city's back. The costs of providing housing, education and police protection to an economically disadvantaged population are huge -- as are the runaway costs of health care for the elderly and disabled.

HEADLINE: Long Baseball Timeout Gives Edge to Players

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When employers such as baseball owners are confronted by a union such as the players' union, resolution of their disputes is not subject to the market forces of supply and demand, but to their ability to tolerate a long shutdown. Here the players have an overwhelming advantage because the cost to them is the loss of after-tax income, subject anyway to the highest tax rates. 
 The owners not only lose income, but also their high overhead costs continue whether they are open for business or not. Millionaire ballplayers can survive even if they never play another game in their lives.
I see at least three ways to approach this high-stakes economic game between intractable disputants, and give the taxpayers a break too.
(1) The owners continue the season with minor-league players, as they did when umpires went on strike.
(2) The Government breaks the baseball monopoly by permitting more major-league franchises, thus tending to put a lid on player salaries.
(3) The Internal Revenue Service disallows the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds used to finance the building of sports facilities; after which professional sports are totally privatized, that is, cities will not be permitted to help build or to finance the building of sports facilities.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman wisely declined to let New Jersey help finance a new stadium in Camden for the 76ers basketball team. If the owners can afford million-dollar salaries, they can pay for building their own facilities.

HEADLINE: A Slaying Shows Ulster Peace Is Still Elusive

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Sept. 2

 BODY:
It was a killing like hundreds of others over the last 25 years in Northern Ireland: a group of gunmen approached a man repairing a car on a Belfast Street, shot him dead and fled. The victim was Roman Catholic; the killers were members of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, a Protestant paramilitary group.
But for politicians and church leaders here, the bluntly sectarian killing Thursday night -- the first blood spilled since the Irish Republican Army declared its unilateral cease-fire nearly 24 hours earlier -- was less a shock than a cold-blooded reminder of how distant any real or lasting peace is in the divided province. 
 Still, in a vote of confidence and an expression of hope that peace will hold, President Clinton promised today to increase United States aid greatly both to Ireland and to Northern Ireland. [Page 3.]
Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A., vowed today that the I.R.A. would not be provoked into breaking its commitment to its cease-fire. But the leaders of the province's militant Protestant paramilitaries have said nothing about their own long-term intentions to either abide by the truce or step up the violence against Catholic and republican targets.
"There is, among these men, a lot of apprehension and uncertainty, and I don't believe they know themselves yet what they will do," said the Rev. Roy Magee, a Presbyterian pastor who keeps lines of communication open to the secretive Protestant paramilitary groups that have grown in both size and menace in recent years. "My hope is it will be positive and they will abide with the truce."
The one thing that is certain, he said, is that whenever the Loyalist community feels its back is against the wall, the rosters of the outlawed militant organizations swell. The Ulster Freedom Fighters, which took responsibility for the killing of the Catholic, John O'Hanlon, on Thursday night, has a hard-core membership of about 500 to 600, police estimates show, and the rival Ulster Volunteer Force about 350 to 500.
From the tumbledown neighborhoods of the Protestant ghetto in Shankill, where the unemployed young men idling on street corners provide rich fodder for the Loyalist gun squads, to the rolling green countryside of rural Londonderry and Antrim, where the monied Loyalist gentry presides, Northern Ireland's majority Protestants are feeling very much on the defensive these days.
While only the smallest and most militant minority of the Protestant population favors a resort to violence, there is at nearly every level a palpable suspicion and fear, a growing conviction that the I.R.A. cease-fire is the latest step in some much larger, undefined conspiracy directed at loosening Ulster's ties to London.
In this view, it is Ulster against what they call the pan-Irish republican movement, from the I.R.A and the Irish-American lobby to the Dublin politicians, each of them abetted by a weak and duplicitous British Government that wouldn't mind shedding the enormous cost -- about $5.1 billion this year alone, twice what it was in 1989 -- of keeping the troubled province afloat.
"I am a British subject, not an Irish one," said Jean Arbuthot, a 48-year-old woman taking her grandson for a walk in Shankill today. "I say we have been betrayed by London. Why else would the I.R.A. have called a cease-fire?"
 
Signs of Double-Dealing
 Even while the British Government insists there will be no constitutional change in Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority of people living there, the militant Protestants see new signs of double-dealing, like London's grudging acknowledgement last year, after repeated and persistent denials, that it had engaged in secret talks with the I.R.A.
On Thursday, their ire was raised again by reports that four republican prisoners convicted on terrorist offenses had been suddenly moved from jails in England to Northern Ireland, to be closer to home. The British said no deal was made; the Loyalists don't believe it.
Demographics, too, will work against the Protestants in the long term. While they now make up about 57 percent of the 1.6 million people who live in the six counties of Ulster, studies here suggest Catholics may have a voting majority before the middle of the next century, as a result of higher birth rates.
If Protestant politics in Ulster sometimes suggest a kind of siege mentality, Ulster's own history begins with a celebration of a siege: the defiant stand in Derry of a band of Protestant settlers, loyal to the new King William and Queen Mary of England, who held out successfully for 108 days against Catholic forces of the deposed King James II.
 
'Have to Stand for Something'
 Even now, says Gregory Campbell, a Unionist politician in Londonderry, the party is too often perceived as being on the defensive and reactionary, a champion of the Northern Ireland status quo. "We've got to go on the offensive," he said. "Be more innovative, progressive, effective, dynamic. We've got to push our British ties the way the republicans push their Irishness. We have to rally support from Scotch-Irish in America. We have to stand for something instead of just reacting to something."
But Paul Bew, a professor of Irish politics at Queen's University in Belfast, says he always wonders to himself, when he hears such talk, "why the heart sinks and the mind knows that the mission is unlikely to succeed." Unionism, he says, has been stripped over the years of its public respectability and credibility.
While Unionists took the largest share of the vote in the 1993 local elections, winning 46 percent of the vote to 34 percent by republicans, their ranks are deeply divided, split by a long and enduring feud between the fiery fundamentalist preacher, the Rev. Ian Paisley, and the more mainstream James Molyneaux.
At the same time, said Pastor Magee, many young Protestants regard both men as hopelessly out of touch with their own increasingly desperate situation, reflected in jobless rates of 50 percent in Shankill and other inner-city Protestant neighborhoods.
 
No Jobs for Protestants
 "Twenty-five years ago, it was the Catholics who complained they didn't have jobs and decent living," said George Young, 44, who lives in Shankill. "Now it's the Protestants who can't find work either, and the politicians don't seem to care."
One British journalist who had covered the outbreak of what the Irish call "the troubles" wrote this week that the fear and loathing he detected in Protestant neighborhoods reminded him of what it felt like in the Catholic Bogside.
"It was like throwing a switch and waking up in 1969 again," said Richard Kay of the Daily Mail. "After 25 years fighting and fearing the I.R.A., will Ulster's police now face the menace of Protestant gunmen?"
But Pastor Magee says the very specter of gun battles between Protestant paramilitaries and members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, whose officers themselves are overwhelmingly Protestant, is one reason he believes the Protestant gunmen will show restraint. "For years, the Loyalist paramilitaries have said they were avenging the deaths of policeman and soldiers killed by the I.R.A.," he said. "To do battle with them now would be a recipe for disaster, and give Gerry Adams the profile of a peace general."
Police officials in Belfast offer another reason why the Protestants might eschew a campaign of violence: if the I.R.A. keeps to its cease-fire, there are 12,000 police officers and 18,000 soldiers who will have more time to keep an eye on Protestant gunmen.

HEADLINE: A Republican Candidate Shrugs Off Spoiler Tag

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Pauline Kezer slipped back and forth between roles as she worked the crowd in Bushnell Park, where state office workers flock at lunchtime. One moment she was a Republican candidate for governor, seeking votes in the party's Sept. 13 primary. The next, she was Connecticut's Secretary of the State, encouraging people to register to vote, explaining how to do it, and sending an aide to bring registration forms from her office.
Mrs. Kezer, who was elected Secretary of the State in 1990, has also embraced a divided role in the race for her party's nomination. To the public, she offers herself as a good-government candidate, promising to "return political power to the people." Within her party, however, she is attacking the record of the leadership's candidate, John Rowland, a former Congressman who nearly won the 1990 race and who has held large leads in polls this year. For that, she has been derided as the party's Tonya Harding -- a woman willing to hurt -- for the sake of her own ambitions -- the party's best chance to elect a governor in more than 20 years. 
 Mrs. Kezer, who says her involvement in politics grew out of an interest in helping battered women in the 1970's, makes no apologies for taking on Mr. Rowland. She says he is simply too conservative to win in a moderate state like Connecticut, where only two Republicans have won statewide elections since 1970 -- herself and former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a liberal who left the party in 1990 to make his successful run for governor as an independent.
She also contends that Mr. Rowland is a weakened candidate, because the only qualification he has added to his record since 1990 is that of lobbyist, paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the state's military contractors as they laid off thousands of employees.
 
Personal Attacks
 She has also attacked his participation in the House bank, which was closed in 1992 after a scandal over its practice of covering overdrafts until members made their checks good. Mr. Rowland's 108 overdrafts during his three terms were more than twice those of any other House member from Connecticut.
"Our strategy," Mrs. Kezer said, "is simply to say this person has a record he is going to have to live with, and two parts of it are very unsettling."
Party leaders have angrily denounced Mrs. Kezer for a radio ad that says Mr. Rowland "peddled his influence" and bounced checks, saying it broke her pledge to stay away from personal attacks.
The state chairman, John Mastropietro, called Mrs. Kezer "a poster child" for how not to conduct a primary. "Nasty and distorted advertising campaigns are beneath the intelligence of voters," he said.
 
A Counterattack
 Mr. Rowland at first responded by saying that the House bank's practices were a regrettable mistake, but that no harm ultimately was done; he defended his work as a consultant for corporations, saying he was helping them avoid more layoffs.
But in a recent letter to local and state Republican leaders, he deplored what he called the "negative, distorted radio ads."
"It is extremely unfortunate that Pauline has chosen to sink to this depth in her desperate attempt to advance her personal agenda," he wrote. "The truth is, she's helping the Democrats and A Connecticut Party by playing the spoiler."
The primary winner will face two opponents in November, Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark of A Connecticut Party, the party Governor Weicker founded, and either State Senator John Larson or State Comptroller Bill Curry, who are running in the Democratic primary.
Those campaigns all say that Mrs. Kezer has raised potentially damaging issues, especially Mr. Rowland's transition from Congressman to highly paid consultant.
"So many people have become distant from their government simply because they feel it's been taken over by lobbyists, special interest groups and PACs," said Mr. Curry's spokesman, Roy Ochiogrosso. "So when someone comes out of that environment to run for office, he bears a heavy burden of proof to say he's now going to represent your interests."
Mrs. Kezer says she is cast as a spoiler because there is nothing to attack in her record of eight years as a state representative from Plainville and four years as Secretary of the State. All she is doing, she says, is comparing her record of service to Mr. Rowland's. And how can she be the spoiler, she asks, when she is the one Republican who won in 1990?
"I kept saying to party leaders, 'How do you know John can go the distance?' " she said. "And they said, 'He's the only one who can raise the money.' I said, 'He raised $3 million last time and he still lost.' "
 
A Risk
 But in attacking Mr. Rowland after barely qualifying for the primary, she has risked appearing combative and shrill. With little money for advertising, she has striven to extend the controversy over her ad, broadcast only a few times by a handful of radio stations, by calling news conferences to protest the counterattacks on her.
As a challenger forced to conduct a low-budget campaign, however, she spends her days shaking the hands of strangers and arriving early at town committee meetings and sitting through the officers' reports to show she is not there just to make her speech.
"My mother always told me, it's not polite to eat and run," she said.
At age 52, she often campaigns with her family, including grandchildren who wear T-shirts that say "I Like My Grandma" on the front and "You Will Too" on the back. She pledges to restore Connecticut's economic competitiveness by cutting the state budget 10 percent in her first two years and by cutting the personal income tax by 10 percent each year for four years. Mr. Rowland says he has a plan to eliminate the tax. Her proposals for economic development also call for cutting business taxes and focusing the state's investment resources on specific industries.
 
Voters Promised a Role
 In a state where huge deficits and the imposition of the income tax in 1991 have fueled widespread unhappiness with government, Mrs. Kezer is also promising voters a larger voice by allowing referendums on new laws, putting term limits on elected officials and placing more restrictions on lobbyists and political action committees.
As Secretary of the State, she says, she reduced her budget 25 percent without layoffs while improving the office's efficiency.
In Bushnell Park, across the street from her office, Mrs. Kezer met state employees who are angry that legislators rejected pay raises they had won in arbitration this year. She told them the state budget could be cut further. Chief executives, she said, have a responsibility to plan for contingencies like arbitration awards. Real savings, she said, must come from reorganizing state government to make it more efficient, and that must involve the employees themselves.
"If I'm lucky enough to be governor," she said, "you'll have a voice in the decisions that have to be made."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Cuba Make Progress on Refugees

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 2

 BODY:
United States and Cuban negotiators made progress today in talks focusing on a proposal by the Clinton Administration to vastly increase the number of Cubans who would be granted entry through legal means if Havana agreed to halt the chaotic flow of boat people, American officials said.
 Meeting for eight hours on the second day of talks, the Administration gave the Cubans a formal written offer that would commit the United States to admit at least 20,000 Cubans a year through legal immigration, far more than the 2,700 who received visas over the past 12 months, the officials said.
 
 The Administration's hope was that this offer, which meets a longstanding demand of Fidel Castro, would induce him to halt the latest surge of Cubans, which began last month.
 One Administration official said the two sides appeared close to agreement, with the Cubans carefully analyzing the American offer. But another official warned that so many details still needed to be worked out that an accord could easily fall through.
 "We're not there yet," said one Administration official.
 Tonight American and Cuban officials announced that the talks would be adjourned until Sunday so the two sides could take stock and consult with their respective capitals.
 The number of Cubans picked up by the United States Coast Guard dropped today from Thursday, but it remained high. The Coast Guard reported that 1,271 Cubans had been picked up in the Straits of Florida by 10 P.M. today, compared with 1,921 on all of Thursday.
 One official said the flow slowed because a backlog of Cubans waiting to flee after last weekend's storm had dissipated.
 David Johnson, a spokesman for the United States delegation, told journalists huddled outside the Cuban mission to the United Nations, where the meeting was held, that the session today was "a thorough, in-depth discussion of possible solutions."
 From the public comments of the two sides, it appeared that the Cubans' insistence that the talks address not just immigration issues, but also ways to ease Washington's economic sanctions against Cuba, could become a sticking point.
 
Disputes Over Focus
 On Thursday, Ricardo Alarcon, Cuba's chief negotiator, suggested on the ABC News program Nightline that the two sides might reach a partial solution "that will help each side get out of this situation."
 The White House has pledged to limit its discussions with the Cubans to immigration matters. Another factor reducing the Administration's bargaining flexibility is Mr. Clinton's promise to Cuban-American groups that he would step up sanctions against Havana.
 Mr. Clinton took such actions -- stepping up anti-Castro broadcasts and banning almost all remittances to Cuba -- after the powerful Cuban American National Foundation complained that his decision to end the 28-year-old American practice of allowing entry for all Cuban refugees punished the Cuban people without punishing Mr. Castro.
 
Reaching the 20,000 Mark
 United States officials said they formally proposed today three ways to admit more than 20,000 Cubans a year -- visas, refugee programs and the Attorney General's discretionary power to admit people for humanitarian or emergency purposes.
 To reach the 20,000 mark, American officials said they would probably grant quick admission to the 19,700 Cubans on a list of more than 3 million people worldwide waiting for visas. Then, they say they would relax the traditionally strict standards for political refugee status so that more Cubans could qualify.
 Another likely step will be for the Attorney General to admit a sizable group of Cubans who do not, under the complex web of immigration preferences, qualify for visas, including cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents of Cuban-Americans. Current immigration law allows in only members of immediate families: spouses, children, parents and siblings.
 Administration officials said today that the Cubans had assured them in the talks that no dangerous criminals were being released and encouraged to flee by boat.
 
Prisoners Released in Cuba
 State Department officials have said in recent days that they had indications that the Cuban Government had released an estimated 100 prisoners and urged them to set to sea. On Thursday, Mr. Alarcon said on television that some criminals may have taken to rafts during brief prison furloughs, but said it was "preposterous" to suggest that Havana was encouraging criminals to leave.
 Throughout the day, several dozen demonstrators shouted anti-Castro slogans and carried anti-Communist placards across the street from the Cuban mission at 38th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.
 This morning scuffles broke out between some anti-Castro demonstrators and a few protesters who were part of a group of more than 100 people demanding an end to the embargo against Cuba.

HEADLINE: Ulster Truce Could Bring A 'Dividend'

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EDGARTOWN, Mass., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Interrupting his vacation to meet with Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister, President Clinton signaled today that he intends to reward the turn toward peace in Northern Ireland with a substantial increase in United States aid.
 Neither Mr. Clinton nor the Irish envoy, Dick Spring, made any public mention of a specific figure for aid, which would be aimed at promoting economic development both north and south of the border. But Mr. Clinton said he believed that the parties who called a halt to violence on Wednesday deserved a "peace dividend," and Mr. Spring said he felt "very satisfied" that the Administration would increase its assistance.
 
 The United States contributes $20 million a year to the International Fund for Ireland for projects on both sides of the border, and Administration officials have said they are considering expanding that figure to $100 million. While key lawmakers have said that it is not likely that new aid would be approved this year, aides to Mr. Clinton said he would seek in coming months to expand trade and investment in the region.
 
A Break From Vacation
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, nevertheless sought to damp expectations that any new aid might be immediate or vast. Ms. Myers said the President had reminded Mr. Spring that his options would be limited by constraints on the Federal budget.
 Mr. Clinton spoke briefly with Irish reporters after the meeting, and his remarks about the possible aid increase were his first of any substance since he began his vacation here a week ago. But the President declined to take questions.
 Mr. Clinton has steered clear of the American press. In a brief discussion before the meeting with Mr. Spring, one journalist tried to turn a conversation about crossword puzzles into one about growing tensions over Haiti, but Mr. Clinton backed away, gazed at the sky, shook his head and said, "Not today."
 The President was plainly eager to share the glow from Wednesday's announcement of a cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army, and he won particular praise from the Irish envoy for his decision last spring to allow Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, to make a two-day visit to the United States. Sinn Fein is the political wing of the I.R.A.
 
Adams Visit Recalled
 The British Government and the State Department had both recommended against that move. But Mr. Spring said today that it was instrumental in exposing the Sinn Fein leader to Irish-American sentiments and "played a significant role in showing Mr. Adams the path to follow."
 At a news conference in a school gymnasium here, Mr. Spring said that Mr. Clinton "has a very strong personal commitment to helping in any way possible to end the conflict in Northern Ireland." The Irish official, who is also Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that sentiment had "come through very strongly" in this morning's 45-minute meeting, which took place in the main residence on the 25-acre compound where the President is staying -- an unpainted, wood house next to a horse paddock.
Minutes after the meeting adjourned, Mr. Clinton resumed a more familiar vacation schedule, jogging through a state forest along a paved bicycle trail, then joining his family for an afternoon trip on a boat owned by Robert Day, a friend of Mr. Clinton's political ally and close friend, the Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan. The trip took them to Naushon Island, south of Cape Cod, to visit Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, who has a family residence there.
 On Thursday night Mr. Clinton shared a microphone with the singer Carly Simon to bid happy birthday to Ms. Myers, who turned 33 years old, then took up a tenor saxophone to jam with the singer and a Jamaican band, Jamaica Me Crazy, for half a dozen songs, including a raucous version of the Motown hit "Respect."

 BODY:

The Economy
Job growth slackened as the nation's unemployment rate stood unchanged in August, at 6.1 percent. The report confirmed a slowdown in the economy. Only 179,000 new jobs were added to the payroll -- the smallest rise since January. At the same time, the growth in factory and other jobs was sufficient to blunt concern that the economy was slowing too much. [Page 1.] 
 The job market improved in New York, with the state's unemployment rate falling to 6.9 percent from 7.1 percent in July. The unemployment rates in New York City and New Jersey also declined. [47.]
 
Companies
First Financial Management made a bid valued at $1.07 billion for Western Union Financial Services, the world's largest money-transfer business, topping a bid by Forstmann Little. [35.]
Virtual mayhem has been a winner for Id Software, a company whose oldest owner is 30. The company produces software games like Doom and Castle Wolfenstein that pulsate with full-color 3-D comic-book-style animated graphics of violent battle. [35.]
Chrysler opened a new plant that will produce the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus compact cars that the auto maker hopes will make inroads against competitors like the Toyota Camry, the Honda Accord and the Nissan Altima. [37.]
Colgate-Palmolive is planning a $100 million revamping that would eliminate up to 3,000 jobs, a news service reported. [37.]
Metropolitan Life reassigned a top executive. [37.]
 
International
Is it still a Swiss Army knife if it is made in China? The American distributor for Victorinox, which makes 80 percent of the Swiss Army knives sold abroad, has sued in New York to stop Chinese knock-offs. The case is being closely watched in Ibach, Switzerland, population 3,500, the home of Victorinox. [35.]
Brazil is experiencing a franchising boom as United States companies -- particularly fast-food chains -- take advantage of its new free-market policies and economic stability. [35.]
 
Markets
Bond traders managed to find hints of inflationary pressure despite a soft employment report for August. Treasury prices slumped in a shortened trading session after an early surge. [35.]
 Stocks were mixed in thin trading ahead of the holiday weekend. Although the employment report initially lifted stocks, a slowing economy is sure to affect the outlook for fourth-quarter corporate profits. The Dow fell 15.86 points. [36.]
The dollar followed the bond market downward, weakening against the German mark and Japanese yen. [46.]
Cocoa prices tumbled on news of rain in the Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer of cocoa. Natural gas prices fell. [46.]
Your Money The costs of college certainly include housing, and the purchase of an apartment for a daughter or son in college is an idea whose time may have come -- again. The concept gained popularity in the mid-1980's, when parents thought they could profit from a rising real estate market as well as offset college costs. But few parents who buy today have such expectations. If they are interested, it is often because owning may be cheaper than renting. [33.]
 Individual retirement accounts are protected from creditors in New York and a growing number of other states. [33]
The way stockbrokers are compensated will be examined by a high-profile Securities and Exchange Commission committee. [33.]
Mortgage lenders are more forgiving of applicants with a history of late payments, delinquencies -- even bankruptcies. [34.]

HEADLINE: Anglers Ignore Hudson Warnings;
Most Either Don't Know of Cancer Concern or Don't Care

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YONKERS, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Tommy Jackson has heard all the warnings against eating the striped bass, white perch and eel that he pulls from the PCB-polluted waters of the Hudson River.
And yet, seven days a week, he sits on a graffiti-scrawled cement block on this city's waterfront, fishing for his dinner. Unemployed for five years, Mr. Jackson, a thin and weathered man of 52, said he had little patience for state guidelines recommending that he eat no more than one meal a month of most of the fish he catches. 
 "I think it's a big fairy tale," he said of the advisories, which are based on studies that have linked PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls) to cancer in animals and to nervous-system disorders in humans. "I'm trying to survive off this river."
No one knows how many anglers may be risking their health by regularly tapping the lower Hudson River as a means of subsistence. But Mr. Jackson says he knows about 50 people in Yonkers alone who do so, many of them using the fish to feed their families. And a survey released last year by the environmental group Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, which interviewed 336 fishermen at 20 popular spots between Staten Island and Troy, found that more than 35 percent ate more fish than the state recommended. A vast majority of the families, the survey said, were poor.
"If the people are consuming the fish on a daily or somewhat weekly basis, there is a long-term risk," said Larry Skinner, an official who monitors fishing for the Department of Environmental Conservation. "There is an increased risk of cancer. There is also an increased risk to the unborn and to young children."
Some anglers, like Mr. Jackson, have read the recommendations but choose to ignore them. But most, the Clearwater group contends, do not know about the advisories because state health and environmental officials have not done enough to reach those most in need of information, particularly immigrants who speak little English.
"There's a lot of people that have no clue, who believe that if a fish looks healthy it is healthy," said Hannah Kalkstein, a Clearwater volunteer who helped prepare the survey. "The reality is that PCB contamination does not show."
The primary source of the PCB's is believed to be the General Electric plants in Hudson Falls and nearby Fort Edward that used the chemicals from the 1940's until the 1970's as a fire retardant in capacitors. Ever since 1975, when the chemicals were first discovered in the Hudson, the state has banned the commercial sale of the river's most prolific fish, the striped bass, and issued strict advisories on eating bass and other fish.
The state sends annual news releases to media organizations detailing the guidelines, and includes them in the packet that anglers receive when they buy fishing licenses. But according to state law, no license is required to fish the Hudson. State officials say that they have to do a better job of getting the word out, but that they lack the money to do so.
In July, the Department of Environmental Conservation created a position for a "citizen participation specialist," to develop a program to educate anglers on the dangers of eating too much fish from polluted waters, Mr. Skinner said. Using $163,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency, the department will also hire up to four seasonal employees next spring to discuss the issue with anglers at popular points on the Hudson and on Lakes Erie and Ontario.
While the department began to distribute advisory pamphlets to tackle shops and public parks in July, the literature is only available in English. Mr. Skinner said that officials were planning to add a Spanish translation and were considering versions in Vietnamese and Chinese, based, in part, on the finding by Clearwater that these groups were among the least-informed on the issue.
Because of elevated levels of PCB's found in Hudson River fish over the years, the state recommends that people eat no fish -- other than American shad -- that have been caught between the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in Catskill and the Troy Dam, the stretch with the highest PCB concentration.
For all areas south of Catskill -- including New York Harbor and the Harlem and East Rivers -- the recommendations are these: people should eat no more than one meal a week of shad, Atlantic sturgeon, blueback herring, blue crab, bluegill, pumpkinseed and yellow perch, and no more than one meal a month of all other fish.
The guidelines also recommend that women in their childbearing years and children under 15 eat no fish caught in the Hudson. But Carolyn Aryee, a 30-year-old mother of two who usually uses food stamps to buy food, said she had heard no such warning. Fishing for white perch off the Yonkers city pier with her father, Johnnie LeGrand, and her sons, ages 4 and 9, Ms. Aryee said she planned to feed her family that night by frying their catch in onions and seasoning salt.
"I'm still alive," she said, the family's four rods leaning against a metal fence, the lines baited with earthworms and cast into the water. "They must be good. They taste good when I eat 'em."
"It's a free meal," she added. "I don't have to buy anything."
A few moments later, Rudolph Driver, 65, a retired carpenter, was chatting with several friends as they fished off the city pier a few yards from Ms. Aryee. But his rod was nowhere in sight. Asked why he had come empty-handed, Mr. Driver cited the state recommendations and a fervent desire not to get sick.
"I'm an old man," he said. "And I got a bad heart."

HEADLINE: Citing Safety, U.S. Bans Airlines of 9 Nations

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration has barred airlines from nine nations from flying to the United States because of poor safety procedures.
The unusual action, announced today, is a response to safety questions from consumer groups. Officials say they hope the economic fallout of the ban will encourage the airlines to follow safety guidelines. 
 The aviation agency surveyed safety procedures in 30 of the 93 countries that have commercial flights to the United States. The agency sought to determine if the aviation authorities in each country were meeting the safety requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency. Its rules are less strict than those of the Federal Aviation Administration.
The aviation agency did not reveal details about the safety deficiencies that had prompted it to ban the nine airlines.
The banned airlines are from Belize, the Dominican Republic, Gambia, Ghana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and Zaire. Four other countries were allowed to continue flying into the United States, but under increased supervison by the aviation agency. They are Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Netherlands Antilles.
 
Survey of Other Countries
 A survey of the 63 remaining countries is under way and is expected to be completed in late 1996.
In the past, airlines have been barred from flying to the United States only for political reasons, like the embargo against Cuba. The Federal Department of Transportation and the aviation administration have been focusing more on safety since 1990, when 73 people were killed when a Colombian jetliner ran out of fuel and crashed on Long Island while waiting for clearance to land at Kennedy International Airport. The review began in 1991.
Representative Robert A. Borski, a Pennsylvania Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, praised the aviation agency's action.
"More than half of all international passengers are United States citizens," Mr. Borski said. "We're the marketplace for the world. All we want is the proper oversight."
Arnold Barnett, a professor of operations research and statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his research showed that the chances that an air traveler would be killed were 25 times higher on a foreign flight than on a domestic one.
 
Likely Effects of Ban
 Countries with economies that depend on tourism, like Belize and the Dominican Republic, are likely to suffer most from the ban.
David S. Stempler, the executive director of the International Airline Passengers Association, a consumer group that had been urging the aviation agency to release the survey, said of the banned countries, "If they want to do business in the United States, the ticket for admission is these procedures."
The survey looked at compliance with all air safety guidelines, but particularly focused on pilot training, aircraft maintenance and air carrier certification.
The three African nations whose flights have been banned have said they will not try to comply with the safety requirements. Telephone calls to the remaining six nations' air carriers and embassies were not returned.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Declined in New York Region in August

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Unemployment dropped in the New York metropolitan region in August, the Government reported yesterday, enabling the region to catch up slightly with the rest of the nation.
The jobless rates in New York and New Jersey fell last month, while unemployment held steady nationwide. Northeastern states have generally lagged behind the rest of the country in recovering from the recession. 
 The Labor Department said the unemployment rate for New York State declined to 6.9 percent, from 7.1 percent in July. For New York City, the rate fell to 8.5 percent, from 8.8 percent.
New Jersey's unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level of the year: 6 percent from 6.4 percent in July.
The national jobless rate was stable in August at 6.1 percent.
Connecticut is not among the 11 states for which the department provides separate figures when it releases the national jobs data each month.
While the August jobless rate in New York City declined, there appears to be little sign of consistent improvement, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
New York City's jobless rate reached double-digit levels earlier in the year, and has stayed in a narrow range of 8.4 to 8.8 percent since May, he said.
In New York City, 278,000 people were unemployed in August, while almost three million people held jobs. A total of 598,000 New York State residents were jobless last month, with slightly more than eight million holding jobs.
New Jersey's situation looks brighter. The state's jobless rate has been declining all year, and the August number was the first monthly figure below the national level since November 1993.
Mr. Ehrenhalt attributed New Jersey's gains to growth in trade and in the service and construction industries, as well as to a slowdown in factory job losses.
There were 246,000 unemployed New Jersey residents in August, with 3.85 million people holding jobs. Mr. Ehrenhalt said August was the third consecutive month of strengthening employment in New Jersey.
Joseph Seneca, professor of economics at Rutgers University, said, "This is a consistent improvement and indicates the recovery is for real."

HEADLINE: DROP IN NEW JOBS SIGNALS A SLOWING FOR THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Employment figures released today provided the clearest evidence to date that the economy has slowed from last year's unsustainable pace, but that it retains enough strength to avoid braking too severely.
Job growth slackened in August as the unemployment rate, 6.1 percent, stood at essentially the same level for a fourth straight month, the Labor Department reported today. The rate had fallen markedly early this year. 
 The data, which provide the first broad view of economic performance for the month, seemed to reduce further the chance that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates again at its policy meeting in September.
At the same time, the growth in factory and other jobs was sufficient to blunt concern that the economy might sink to an unsatisfactorily low pace of expansion, because of tighter Government spending, higher taxes and higher interest rates.
Merrill Lynch called the employment figures "constructive" on the whole. The report showed a smaller-than-expected rise of 179,000 payroll jobs last month, the lowest increase since January. That rise was far below the average of 293,000 so far this year and below the 259,000 jobs created in July.
The Clinton Administration, meanwhile, took the occasion to boast that 3.1 million jobs had been created since Labor Day of 1993.
"The U.S. economy continues to enjoy healthy growth in incomes and employment," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said. Moreover, she added, "there is no sign of an intensification of inflationary pressures in today's report."
The report initially cheered the bond market, but traders looking for any hints of inflation soon found other reasons to sell. [Page 35.]
Private analysts noted that average hourly earnings rose a skimpy 2 cents last month, cutting the annual rate of increase in the latest three months to just 1.5 percent. This suggested lackluster consumer spending as the holiday shopping season approaches.
"With wages falling below inflation, consumers are not going to have the discretionary buying power to give the economy much support," said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at HSBC Holdings Inc. in New York. The Consumer Price Index rose at a 3.3 percent compounded annual rate for the three months that ended in July.
What seems to be happening, economists and business people say, is that companies facing sharp increases in the cost of various commodities -- but unable to raise their own prices -- are stoutly holding the line on wages, their biggest expense.
As has become common this year, partly because of new methods involving the Government's survey of households, commentators and securities traders found elements of the labor-market report hard to interpret, or, in the case of inflation, at odds with other readings.
 
Columbia Inflation Index Up
 For example, a Columbia University index intended to predict inflation jumped today to 111.4 in August from 109.5 in July, with all four available components contributing to the rise.
"It is evident," the university's Center for International Business Cycle Research concluded, "that the leading indicators of inflation are still locked in cyclical upswings and continue to point to a cyclical upturn in U.S. inflation this year."
When this result was published, the bond market gave up its early gains.
The 179,000 new payroll jobs included a 32,000 increase in factory jobs. The factory sector showed more vigor than many expected, even allowing for the reopening of automobile plants that were closed for retooling in July. The factory workweek and factory overtime, both already at near-record levels, edged up by 6 minutes and 12 minutes, respectively, also reflecting activity in the auto industry.
On the other hand, construction jobs eased 6,000 in August after 13 straight months of growth that swelled payrolls by more than 300,000, the department noted. Analysts pointed to this as a reflection of the toll that rising interest rates have taken on housing in recent months, although some jobs were also lost to exceptional rain in the South.
 
The World Cup Effect
 Employment in the retail trade was essentially unchanged after two months of robust growth. Some of the 29,000-job decline at bars and restaurants was attributed to the end of the World Cup soccer tournament.
The temporary-help sector added an unusually small 15,000 jobs, less than half the average of the preceding 12 months. But health services added 38,000 as employment rebounded at hospitals.
The so-called bias adjustment, a figure representing the estimated number of jobs at fledgling companies that the statistical mechanism does not yet capture, is 158,000 this quarter, or 88 percent of the August gain.
The department's index of aggregate hours for production workers edged down two-tenths of a point, to 129.1, while 57 percent of industries reported adding workers, compared with 58.8 percent in July, the survey of payrolls also showed. Also, the average workweek in the private sector fell by 12 minutes.
Although unchanged nationally, at 6.1 percent, the unemployment rate edged down in the Northeast, to 6.4 percent; in the South, to 5.8 percent, and in the Midwest, to 5.1 percent. The rate in the West edged up, however, to 7.5 percent. None of these moves was more than two-tenths of a point.
 
Skepticism Over Big Gain
 Among the 11 largest states, the jobless rate eased marginally in eight and rose marginally in North Carolina and Michigan. The Massachusetts rate remained at 5.9 percent.
The jobless rate in California, whose economy has been sluggish, fell to 8.9 percent in August from 9 percent in July. New York now shows a jobless rate of 6.9 percent, down from 7.1 percent, and New Jersey slipped to 6 percent from 6.4 percent.
According to the department's survey of households, the basis for calculating the unemployment rate, the labor force soared by 732,000. And 714,000 of those people -- a stunning number -- found jobs. But economists, who have long favored the payroll survey and have been particularly skeptical about the reliability of the household survey since it was overhauled early this year, tended to dismiss these increases as probably little more than partial catching-up from earlier lags.
One fact that suggests that seasonal adjustment distortions are involved is that the labor force fell by 422,000 and employment fell by 10,000 last month when no adjustment for recurring seasonal patterns is made.
The household tally also showed 489,000 workers too discouraged to look for jobs, 7,079,000 workers with two or more jobs (including 260,000 with primary and secondary jobs both full-time), and 4,284,000 people working part time who would have preferred full-time work. There was a 253,000 decline in the number of people idle for less than five weeks.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bonds Sag on Hint Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slumped yesterday in a shortened trading session after a quick, early surge, as traders managed to find hints of inflationary pressures even though August's employment report was soft.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond ended the day down 16/32 of a percentage point, at 1004/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.49 percent, from 7.45 percent on Thursday -- back to where it was a week ago. 
 Yesterday's reversal reflects how sensitive the bond market has become to the slightest suggestion of inflation.
 
 
Opening Surge
 Bond prices surged when trading opened after the Labor Department reported that job growth slackened in August. The report appeared to confirm other signs that the economy was slowing, thus easing the potential for inflation.
Only 179,000 new jobs were created last month, a figure well below expectations and below July's 259,000 jobs. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent.
The report also suggested that wage pressure remained moderate and that the Federal Reserve would be inclined to leave monetary policy steady for now.
Normally, the report should have encouraged bullish investors to commit more cash to the bond market.
But inflation-obsessed traders quickly discovered reasons to sell, and the bond market gave back all of its gains within about an hour.
Some traders noted that the employment report showed hourly wages rising 2 cents in the month, even though the growth rate was less than in previous months.
The biggest factor in the selling, traders said, was a report by Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research, which showed higher inflation in August.
Traders consider the Columbia index to be forward-looking and note that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, pays attention to it.
The center said its inflation index rose to 111.4 in August, its highest figure in five years, up from 109.1 the previous month.
 
 
Producer Prices
 "The problem, of course, is next week, with new inflation numbers that may not be so friendly to the bond market," said Stephen Slifer, chief financial market economist for the fixed-income division of Lehman Brothers. The Government reports on producer prices for August on Friday.
"We're expecting the Producer Price Index over all will rise 0.4 percent, while the core rises 0.3 percent," Mr. Slifer said.
The bond market was also weighed down yesterday by the dollar, which fell against the Japanese yen and other leading currencies. A falling dollar has capped many bond rallies this year, a bond trader said.
For investors from overseas, a weaker dollar reduces the value of dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities.
 
 
10-Year Note Falls
 Other Treasury issues were pulled down by the bond market's retreat. The 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32 of a point, while its yield rose to 7.19 percent from 7.16 percent.
The discount rate on three-month bill rose one basis point, to 4.54 percent, while the rate on the six-month bill gained four basis points, to 4.82 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Many traders left early yesterday after the Public Securities Association recommended that the market close at 2 P.M. in observance of the Labor Day weekend.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Loses Early Gains After a Bond Rally Fizzles

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most other leading currencies yesterday, giving up early gains after a rally in the Treasury market evaporated.
Bonds jumped in early trading, pulling the dollar higher, after the Labor Department said the economy added 179,000 jobs in August. The smaller-than-expected increase spurred speculation that inflation in the United States was not poised to accelerate. 
 The bond rally turned into a loss because the report failed to convince investors that wages and prices were not rising more quickly as the economy grows. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds.
"The bond rally faded, and the dollar faded with it," said Peter Gloyne, manager of institutional foreign-exchange trading at the First National Bank of Chicago. "The outlook for the dollar appears a little bearish again."
Recent strength in American stock and bond markets helped the dollar recover from lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark. Currency traders watch bond prices for clues about foreign demand for American assets, and the dollars needed to buy them.
"The dollar won't rally unless there is demand for U.S. stocks and bonds," said Earl Johnson, foreign-exchange adviser at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.5537 marks, down from 1.5750 marks on Thursday, its biggest one-day slide in three weeks. It rose as high as 1.5833 marks as bonds surged in the wake of the jobs report. The dollar fell to 99.20 yen, from 99.71 yen on Thursday.
Traders said the dollar's fall was exaggerated by investors who sold the currency before the Labor Day weekend.
"People weren't confident enough to hold dollars while they were away for three days," said Karl Halligan, vice president for strategic trading at CIC New York.
The dollar fell further after Germany's Transportation Minister, Matthias Wissmann, said the economy grew 2.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with the quarter a year earlier.
With signs that German growth is picking up speed, the Bundesbank will have little reason to lower interest rates anytime soon, a move that would make mark-denominated deposits less attractive.
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 5.3235 French francs, down from 5.3895 francs on Thursday, and at 1.3055 Swiss francs, down from 1.3226 Swiss francs. The British pound rose to $1.5485 from $1.5461.

HEADLINE: With Brazil's New Prosperity Come Arby's and Pizza Hut

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 27

 BODY:
On Avenida Paulista, a canyon of corporate headquarters in South America's largest city, office workers looking for lunch can choose among four McDonald's, a Pizza Hut, an Arby's and a KFC.
In the next couple of weeks, Fred DeLuca, who directs an empire of 9,400 Subway restaurants from Milford, Conn., is to open Brazil's first Subway on this street. 
 With franchising nearing saturation in the United States, Latin America's largest economy is experiencing a franchising boom as American companies take advantage of Brazil's new free-market policies and economic stability.
"Brazil is where Mexico was two years ago," said Guilherme Affonso Ferreira, who opened the Arby's last year. "Volume is going to be the name of the game. Whoever arrives at the year 2000 without 300 or 400 fast-food restaurants in Brazil is going to be out of the game."
With fast-food chains leading the way, franchising is spreading. Based on a survey of its 640 members, the Brazilian Franchise Association estimates that the number of outlets will expand by 44 percent this year, to 25,600 nationally.
Evidence of the boom could be seen on the crowded floor of the association's annual fair late last month. Compared with last year, the number of exhibitors increased 50 percent, to 179, and paid attendance doubled to 27,000, largely prospective franchisees. By contrast, virtually the same number of people attended a show in Washington in April, with almost three times as many franchisers.
"I've never seen so many people at a franchising fair -- the big one in Washington was nothing like this," said Mark Baccash, a New Yorker who directs international expansion for Office I Superstore, a chain of office-supply stores.
For decades, legal restrictions and economic instability fenced off Brazil from foreign franchisers. But two years ago, the Government eased rules on the international remittance of royalties and speeded the process for the registration of foreign franchising contracts.
"There are no rules and regulations that impede us now in Brazil," said William B. Cherkasky, president of the International Franchise Association, a Washington-based trade group. Mr. Cherkasky, who has visited Brazil four times over the last decade, added, "Brazil has become a lot friendlier in the last two years."
In broader terms, Brazil may be returning to the high growth and low inflation that made it a "miracle economy" in the early 1970's. Last year's 5 percent growth rate is expected to be duplicated this year. A new economic plan has reduced monthly inflation from 50 percent in June to 5 percent in August.
Business confidence has soared, and all public opinion polls now indicate that in October's presidential elections, voters will choose Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former Finance Minister from Sao Paulo, the country's financial center. In a recent survey of business executives, 97 percent favored Mr. Cardoso's election.
Brazil -- with 154 million people, about half the population of South America -- is where United States franchisers say they want to first plant their flag before branching out in the region. There are about 65 United States franchisers in this country.
"If you succeed in Mexico and Brazil, it opens up all of Latin America," said Aaron Cano, international marketing manager for the Ziebart International Corporation. "We have 12 franchises in Brazil. We have decided to have 60 more locations here in the next two or three years."
 
Growth Is Predicted
 Other American service franchisers predicted similar growth.
Avis plans to quadruple its car fleet to 6,500 by the end of next year. Jani King, a commercial cleaning company, plans to expand its Brazil franchise to 600 from 54 by the end of 1997.
Postnet, a Las Vegas-based office service company, recently opened its first outlet here. By the end of 1998, the company plans to have 200 outlets in Brazil. Tuffy hopes to open its first auto service center here in January, part of a plan to expand to a dozen by the end of 1995.
Over all, the biggest growth is expected to be in fast food. With about 75 percent of Brazil's people living in cities and with increasing numbers of women in the work force, Brazil seems ready for fast food.
Some 1,265 new fast-food outlets are to open this year, an increase of 56 percent. Virtually every major American fast-food franchiser is in this country.
"Over the next seven years, we plan to open 200 stores," said Mario Silva, operations director here for Subway. To cater to local tastes, Subway has included espresso coffee and ice cream on its menus.
Even so, a local newspaper, Folha, had difficulty describing some new sandwiches. The paper reported that they were "cold sandwiches, 30 centimeters long, known in the United States as 'submarinos.' "
Brazilian franchising experts warn that Americans interested in this market should do research here and be flexible.
"If a company wants to come down here and sell bagels, they should see if there is a market first," said Bernard Jeger, president of the Brazilian Franchise Association and the founder of a frozen-yogurt chain, Nicecream. "You have American franchisers who think they can sign a $500,000 contract without even investing $5,000 in coming down here to get to learn the market," said Mr. Jeger, an immigrant from Belgium.
Another hurdle is finding a local partner who will aggressively expand a Brazilian franchise.
Rogerio M. Marques, the Brazil franchiser for Radio Shack, agreed, adding, "You have to find someone who shares the same values and culture -- forget the financial part."
 
Expanding by Franchising
 A United States-educated Brazilian, Mr. Marques will open Brazil's fifth Radio Shack, in October in Brasilia, the capital. The 73-year-old company owns its stores in the United States, but decided to speed expansion here through franchising. By the end of 1998, Radio Shack wants to have 58 franchise outlets in this country.
With new franchisers from the United States complaining about the limited amount of English here, longtime American franchisers say training is a major hurdle.
"It takes time to train people to a new business, a new system," said Gregory J. Ryan, president of Restco, a company that franchises 75 McDonald's restaurants in the southern half of the country. Intending to open 20 restaurants a year through the end of the decade, Mr. Ryan plans a Hamburger University in 1995, the regional training centers for McDonald's employees.
To convey quality, fast service and low prices, many of Brazil's 565 home-grown franchisers have adopted English-language company names.
"There are Brazilian franchisers who put American flags in their logos to win credibility," said Paulo Cesar Mauro, a franchising broker.
Mr. Baccash, who has been visiting this country for almost 20 years, said: "I feel a tremendous opening to American products. Anything American is a plus."

HEADLINE: MORTGAGES;
Lenders More Forgiving Of Poor Credit Records

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
PEOPLE with smudged credit records are finding it easier to buy a home these days as hard-pressed lenders seeking customers become more forgiving of applicants with a history of late payments, delinquencies and even bankruptcies.
 Mortgages are usually graded "A" through "D" for risk. An "A" mortgage conforms to the standards set by the major mortgage buyers in the secondary market, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Until recently, applicants with these types of nonconforming loans usually had only one recourse: "hard-money" lenders, mortgage bankers or finance companies that require huge down payments and charged credit-card rates with several points. (A point is a fee equal to 1 percent of the loan.) These loans were also generally available only for second mortgages and refinancings. 
 Now, though, lending terms for "B" and "C" loans are becoming much less onerous, and, more important, they are being offered on first mortgages, too. ("D" loans still carry astronomically high rates and require large equity levels and are generally used only for second mortgages.)
"It used to be that if Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae wouldn't buy their loans, applicants would be rejected and left to the sharks," said William Steed, president of Home Mortgage Center, a mortgage banker in Alexandria, Va., that began offering nonconforming mortgages six months ago. "But with the downturn in the economy, it left an awful lot of people out there who were behind in their payments, and it wasn't entirely their fault. They were laid off, downsized, maybe had a medical problem."
Today, they are back on their feet "and they are the same backbone of the economy that they always were," he said.
What constitutes a "B," "C" or "D" loan varies widely among lenders, as do the rates and minimum down payments. A typical "B" loan applicant is often someone who has missed a few payments but has had a stable credit record for the last 12 months, as well as a steady stream of income. A "C" rating can range from several missed payments to a bankruptcy that's two to four years old, though some applicants with bankruptcies may qualify for a "B" loan.
"The 'B,' 'C,' 'D' market is very fragmented, and there are many people in it," said John Romeo, vice president of Prudential Home Mortgage in St. Louis, one of the nation's largest mortgage bankers. "The important thing is that you have cleaned up your act," he said.
Terms for "B" and "C' loans range from an adjustable rate starting at about 7 percent with an annual cap of 2 percent, a lifetime cap of 6 percent and 3 points to fixed-rates of 11 or 12 percent and 3.5 points. A minimum 20 percent down payment is needed to avoid private mortgage insurance. As much as 35 to 40 percent may be required for some loans, however.
"In two to four years, if they have kept a clean credit record, they refinance into an "A" loan," Mr. Romeo said.
Part of the growth in "B" and "C" mortgages comes from investors are looking for higher yields in the secondary market and are willing to take the additional risk of nonconforming loans.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
New Offerings Reach the Market

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
Elizabeth Bramwell ran the Gabelli Growth Fund from its inception until earlier this year, when she set up her own shop. The first of her new funds, the Bramwell Growth Fund, looks for companies with new products or markets. It invests mainly in common stock and convertible securities.
Up to 25 percent of the fund can be invested in foreign securities, including closed-end country funds. Additional overseas exposure comes from investments in American companies with large revenues from abroad. The fund has a long-term orientation, meaning that investors should plan to hold shares for at least three years. 
 The T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Funds are a new trio in the growing all-in-one-package of fund investments. The Income Fund aims mainly for income by splitting its assets among stocks (40 percent), bonds (40 percent) and money markets (20 percent). The Balanced Fund, more growth-oriented and volatile, owns 60 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 10 percent money markets. Most aggressive is the Growth Fund, split among stocks (80 percent) and bonds and money markets (20 percent).
These investment mixes cannot vary more than 10 percent. The portfolios themselves are diversified. For example, the equity segment comprises large- , small- and mid-capitalization stocks chosen from the value and growth camps. The funds also own foreign securities.
The Pioneer Emerging Markets Fund invests in developing markets such as India, Mexico and Hong Kong. Remember that many of the usual problems of investing abroad, like economic and political risks and illiquidity, are magnified in emerging markets funds. You must be willing to leave your money invested for the long term and limit investments in these regions. Pioneer advises allocating no more than 10 to 20 percent of the growth portion of your portfolio to emerging markets funds.

Players' Union Questions Teams' Roster Moves

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The baseball strike, which began its fourth week yesterday, has idled 768 players. But the union plans to challenge the status of up to 18 players and force their clubs to pay their salaries for the rest of the season.
With no sign of negotiating life on either side in the dispute, which is on the verge of wiping out the season's last four weeks, lawyers for the Players Association scrutinized a list of players they believe might have been unfairly added to major league rosters to avoid paying their salaries. It will be an economic battle within economic warfare. 
 "We have to analyze each situation," said Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel. "It's within the realm of the theoretical that clubs could point to other considerations for the moves."
In the week before the players walked out on Aug. 12, clubs called up 10 players from minor league teams. In the past few days, they have called up eight more players. Once the union decides which cases do not seem to have a reasonable explanation, they will file default notices and grievances, very likely by next week.
The default notices are the more immediate of the two actions clubs would have to confront. When such a notice is filed, a club must remedy the default within 10 days or risk losing the player as a free agent. Probably the best known default notice ever filed was on behalf of Catfish Hunter of the Oakland Athletics in 1974. That's how he became a free agent and signed with the Yankees.
In filing a notice, the union would be contending that the club did not pay the player as his contract required. In the grievances, the union would ask the arbitrator, George Nicolau, to order the clubs to pay the players their salaries.
Of the 18 players affected by the call-ups, 4 are with Boston, 4 with Texas and 3 with Cleveland. Their general managers did not return telephone calls yesterday seeking explanation for the timing of the promotions.
Joe Ausanio of the Yankees is on the list. The Yankees recalled the rookie relief pitcher last Monday, saying they wanted him on their roster by the Aug. 31 deadline for post-season rosters. But they could have waited two more days to make the move for that reason, and then they wouldn't have had to make it because the two sides agreed not to stick to that deadline.
 
Saving an Option
 The more likely reason the Yankees recalled Ausanio was that they wanted to bring him back inside of 20 days from the time they optioned him to Class AAA Columbus (Aug. 11, the day before the strike). By doing that, the Yankees saved the option for future use. The Chicago Cubs acted similarly with one of their pitchers, Steve Trachsel.
Saving the option most likely would be considered a legitimate reason for recalling the two players. Other moves did not seem to have as legitimate a purpose.
The Pittsburgh Pirates, for example, recalled pitcher Randy Tomlin, who had been in the minors since May 23, on Thursday, the day major league rosters were permitted to expand to 40 players. But at the same time they recalled him, the Pirates placed him on the disabled list. Tomlin has a $975,000 salary. By putting him on their roster and thus on strike, the Pirates would save $170,492 of his salary.
Also added to major league rosters in the past few days were Jeff Huson, David Hulse, Rob Ducey and Hector Fajardo of Texas, and Gar Finnvold of Boston. The Red Sox recalled Finnvold, a rookie pitcher, yesterday because the trade of Scott Bankhead to the Yankees left them one under the roster minimum of 24 players.
The Rangers could save a total of $164,923 on salaries they would not have to pay Huson, Hulse, Ducey and Fajardo.
 
A Potential Savings
 The Red Sox also called up Todd Frohwirth, Rick Trlicek and Greg Litton in the days before the strike began. They could save a total of $251,038 on their salaries. The Indians could avoid paying $260,820 to Jerry DiPoto, Rene Gonzales and Russ Swan, whom they added to their roster before the strike. Gonzales and Swan, in fact, were added Aug. 11, a day the Indians didn't even have a game scheduled.
The other players on the union's questionable call-up list are Kent Bottenfield of San Francisco, Erik Pappas of St. Louis, Tom Bolton of Baltimore and Bob Wells of Seattle, all promoted before the strike began.
Lou Melendez, a lawyer with the owners' labor relations committee, said he had spoken with Orza about the union's concern.
"He said if the clubs took players from the minor leagues simply to put them on strike and not pay them, he felt that violated the basic agreement," Melendez said. "We said we understand your position, but we don't agree with it. The clubs have a right to make moves in the normal course of business. This may not be the normal course of business, but who's to say clubs don't have economic concerns? If we're wrong, Nicolau will tell us."

And Bear in Mind
(Editor's Choices of other recent books of particular interest)

 BODY:
BLOW: How a Small-Town Boy Made $100 Million With the Medellin Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All
By Bruce Porter. Harper, $5.99.
George Jung was a low-level American marijuana dealer when he met a Colombian drug lord in prison in 1974. This book chronicles his rise as the Medellin cartel's ambassador to the United States criminal market and his eventual fall: he's now an ex-con delivering fresh fish instead of cocaine. Last year our reviewer, Joe Queenan, said the author "has done an excellent job telling the tale of a very unusual entrepreneur." 

 BUTTERFLY STORIES: A Novel
By William T. Vollmann. Grove, $11.
These interconnected short fictions relate the adventures of a journalist who travels to the Far East, where he immerses himself in the company of prostitutes. His complicated relationships with these women unfold against a backdrop of political turmoil. "The book is very well written," Geoff Ryman said here last year. Grove has also reissued Mr. Vollmann's THIRTEEN STORIES AND THIRTEEN EPITAPHS ($12), a collection of fictional journeys and brief scenes detailing life -- often at its most desperate and depraved -- in locations ranging from the United States to Afghanistan. Last year our reviewer, Catherine Bush, said, "When Mr. Vollmann turns his hallucinogenic yet documentary eye on the landscapes that he travels through, streets can quiver on the page."
21ST CENTURY CAPITALISM
By Robert Heilbroner. Norton, $10.
A noted economist examines the state of the free market in the wake of Communism's collapse, arguing for increased public investment to help support capitalism. His perceptions are offered "in a style largely penetrable and pleasing to ordinary mortals," Robert Eisner said here last year. Postwar capitalism's failure to fulfill its promise to the baby-boom generation is the subject of DECLINING FORTUNES: The Withering of the American Dream, by Katherine S. Newman (Basic Books, $12). Last year our reviewer, Robin Toner, called the book, which focuses on a pseudonymous New Jersey suburb, "a poignant portrait of how broad economic trends affect individual lives."
CRAZY IN ALABAMA
By Mark Childress. Ballantine, $11.
Twelve-year-old Peejoe has a lot to handle in the summer of 1965: his aunt has just beheaded his uncle and lit out for Hollywood, and the civil rights movement is disturbing the complacency of his Southern town. This comic novel "seems not only fresh and original but also positively inspired," Robert Plunket said here last year.
BLACK WOMEN IN AMERICA: An Historical Encyclopedia
Edited by Darlene Clark Hine, Elsa Barkley Brown and Rosalyn Terborg-Penn. Indiana University, $49.95.
This huge two-volume reference work includes biographical information on historical figures from Josephine Baker to Sojourner Truth, as well as sections on professions, organizations and political movements. Last year our reviewer, Lena Williams, called it "an exhaustive effort . . . long overdue." One of the women celebrated in its pages, the feminist poet Audre Lorde, is the author of THE MARVELOUS ARITHMETICS OF DISTANCE: Poems 1987-1992 (Norton, $8.95), a volume issued after her death in 1992. Nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award, it includes poetry dealing with her battle with cancer and her identity as a black lesbian. The collection offers "arresting and often unabashedly political imagery," one critic said last year. There is more on the experience of black Americans in UP SOUTH: Stories, Studies, and Letters of African American Migrations, edited by Malaika Adero (New Press, $12.95), which captures the waves of resettlement from the rural South to the industrial North in the first half of this century. Last year the reviewer for The New York Times, Herbert Mitgang, praised its "fascinating stories of the frustrations, achievements and dreams of migrating families."
SIMPLE PASSION
By Annie Ernaux. Translated by Tanya Leslie.
Ballantine, $8.50.
This slim, autobiographical novel is the painstaking history of an obsessive two-year love affair between the narrator, a French writer and teacher, and an Eastern European businessman. It is "irresistibly readable," Caryn James said here last year.
AMERICAN DAUGHTER GONE TO WAR:
On the Front Lines With an Army Nurse in Vietnam
By Winnie Smith. Pocket Books, $12.
This memoir recounts the author's harrowing experiences trying to save lives in a Saigon field hospital nearly 30 years ago -- and her equally desperate attempt to regain her equilibrium after returning to the United States. In 1992 our reviewer, Linda Bird Francke, said, "Vivid and unrelentingly painful, it is a book you want to put down -- but can't." A male soldier's difficult re-entry is detailed in CHICKENHAWK: BACK IN THE WORLD. Life After Vietnam, by Robert Mason (Penguin, $10.95). A sequel to Mr. Mason's 1983 memoir, "Chickenhawk," the book reveals his disastrous attempt at marijuana smuggling. He "is still in command of his ripsaw prose," Tom Graves said here last year. Vietnam is also depicted in DREAM BABY, by Bruce McAllister (Orb/Tom Doherty, $13.95), the story of an Army nurse who becomes a C.I.A. pawn after she develops clairvoyant powers. It is an expansion of a 1987 novella, which our reviewer, David Bradley, described as "good fiction . . . powerfully metaphoric."
SPIDERTOWN
By Abraham Rodriguez Jr. Penguin, $9.95.
Miguel, a teen-age drug hustler on the streets of the South Bronx, struggles to escape the criminal world that threatens to rob him of his soul -- and his life. This first novel is "a redemptive and absorbing work," Peter Finn said here last year. LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: CRIME

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
Fat chance of missing Stephanie Plum in ONE FOR THE MONEY (Scribners, $20). A Jersey girl with Bette Midler's mouth and Cher's fashion sense -- big hair, gold hoop earrings, Spandex bike shorts, tons of turquoise eye shadow and attitude out to here -- Stephanie kind of glows in the dark in Janet Evanovich's hip-swinging genre debut.
Stephanie sashays into the crime-busting business when she is laid off as a discount lingerie buyer. Reduced to cadging meals from her mother ("The urge to scream told me I was home"), she blackmails her cousin Vinnie for a job with his bail bonding company. Her prey call her "the bounty hunter from hell," but she keeps losing her big prize, hunky Joe Morelli, a New Jersey vice cop who skipped out on a homicide rap the same way he skipped out on Stephanie after sweet-talking her out of her virginity when they were in high school. 
 "I was going to have to get smarter faster," it finally dawns on Stephanie, who decides that the way to hang on to Morelli is to buy a gun, get tough and smoke out the real killer. If she doesn't get maimed or murdered first.
The plot has more potholes than a street in downtown Trenton, and Stephanie's investigative procedures are pretty slapdash. (Morelli has her number: "Lots of energy, not much control, sexy as hell.") But with her brazen style and dazzling wardrobe, who could resist this doll?
A mother dies, a father goes to pieces, a home wrecker is murdered and two children, old and wise before their time, take charge of the domestic ruins in THE MASTERS OF THE HOUSE (Scribners, $20). Robert Barnard pitches his voice to a whisper to narrate this sad, sweet horror of a story, which is set in the northern industrial city of Leeds during England's economic upheavals under Margaret Thatcher in the late 1970's.
Thirteen-year-old Matthew Heenan and his 12-year-old sister Annie assume control of their shattered household when their mother dies in childbirth and their unemployed father has a breakdown. Annie, who is the managing type, runs the house and takes care of the younger children. It falls to Matthew, a sensitive and intuitive lad, to hide their father's catatonic state from the neighbors -- and to solve the murder of Mr. Heenan's girlfriend, whose body the children bury in a nearby field. "We'll have to be really clever," Matthew cautions Annie. "Dead cunning."
The suspense is delicious, especially when a kindly relative of the dead woman decides to move into this house of secrets. But along with the thrills, Mr. Barnard delivers the chills with his lament for a working-class family struggling to survive without the work and the workers that give such families their structure and integrity.
"Some people's families want them to be doctors. Others would like them to be lawyers. Mine wanted me to be a gangster." Anthony Russo, who croons this lament in Peter Blauner's generational crime novel CASINO MOON (Simon & Schuster, $21), tries to escape his destiny by going into the fight game, one of the few legit business in Atlantic City open to a mobbed-up guy. But Anthony doesn't figure on the corruption that pervades this "honest" sport. He also underestimates his stepfather's determination to initiate him into the family business, which is in serious trouble. Factor in Anthony's miserable marriage, his depressing affair with a hooker and his wistful belief in the verity of casino signs like "Take a Chance" and "Dreams Come True," and you have one sorry sucker for a hero.
Mr. Blauner, the author of "Slow Motion Riot," is a honey of a writer. You could cut a lip on his dialogue, and his noir descriptions of Atlantic City have that nice, sickly sheen of morbidity. He also has a great eye for the telling detail that can define a character. (A mobster's wife puts a plate of food in front of him and scuttles away "like a terrorist leaving a car bomb.") But because the author, like Anthony, has no heart for the rackets and takes no joy in the wicked people who work them, his dour fathers are no more fun than their sour sons.
Louie Bronk, the poet and serial murderer whose execution date looms in Mary Willis Walker's suspense novel THE RED SCREAM (Doubleday, $19.95), is what you might call a poster boy for capital punishment. The infamous "Texas Scalper" committed a string of homicides before catching a conviction for the job he did on the wife of an Austin businessman. Molly Cates, a true-crime writer who made a lucrative little industry of Bronk's violent career, would be happy to wave goodbye to this monster and his creepy doggerel. But the murder of the businessman's present wife by a copycat poet-killer unnerves Molly, who suspects that Bronk will die for the one crime he did not commit.
To support the reporter in her lonely crusade to stop the execution, Ms. Walker gives Molly firm convictions against the death penalty. "It was comforting," she observes of her ideological adversaries, "to pretend that all the random violence in the world was concentrated in one evil man." Although well argued, all this rhetoric about the criminal justice system bogs down a book that is already too much talk and not enough action. Also missing is the sense of danger that makes you want to crawl away from a killer in fear and loathing. Bronk writes scary verse, but he is too pathetic to give anyone nightmares.
M. C. Beaton has a foolproof plot for the village mystery: Seductive stranger arrives, throws town into tizzy; interloper is murdered; sleuth nips corrosive alien values in bud; village heaves sigh of relief. Next!
With minor deviations, the author has applied her magic formula to an enchanting series set in a pretty hamlet tucked in the Scottish Highlands and protected by a sweet, shambling policeman named Hamish Macbeth. The visitor who comes to a neighboring village in DEATH OF A CHARMING MAN (Mysterious Press/Warner, $18.95) is a handsome young man who stirs the longings of every woman in this dreary place. He is dead in no time, but not before his poisonous wiles have awakened folks to the beauty and romance missing from their lives.
Ms. Beaton's trademark plot also works like a charm in AGATHA RAISIN AND THE POTTED GARDENER (St. Martin's, $18.95), from a more recent series set in the English Cotswolds and presided over by an amateur sleuth who is crude and rude, but nobody's fool. "A stocky middle-aged woman with a round, rather pugnacious face and small, bearlike eyes," Agatha is no match for a lovely divorcee who comes from nowhere to conquer local society. Bushwacked by her beguiling ways, the smitten villagers are blinded to her subtle cruelties -- until someone sees through her and strikes.
From the author's sure-fire plot comes this fail-safe moral: It takes an outsider to open people's eyes to the beauty -- and the evil -- within.

HEADLINE: China's Rush to Riches

BYLINE: By Sheryl WuDunn 

 BODY:
Before many more years go by, China is likely to surpass the United States as the world's biggest economy. It already is the fastest-growing economy, one of the consequences of a new Chinese revolution. Sheryl WuDunn and Nicholas D. Kristof watched that revolution from the inside as The Times's correspondents in Beijing from 1988 to 1993 and won a Pulitzer Prize for journalism in 1990.
In a new book, "China Wakes" (Times Books), they describe a society that is at once politically repressive and economically freewheeling. The regime still allows a prisoner to be asphyxiated by the fumes from his own uncollected excrement, turns the family members of imprisoned human rights campaigners out on the streets, forces young women to undergo sterilization and abortion. At the same time, the Government is overseeing a breathtaking transformation of individual lives and institutions that is rapidly making China richer than ever before. The following excerpts, written like their book in alternate chapters by the two authors, portray today's moneymaking frenzy -- and China's future as a global economic giant. 
 THE STATE SecurIty Ministry secretly runs a dry-cleaning establishment that caters to foreigners in Beijing. Initially I was suspicious, thinking that this was a way to plant bugs in the suits of foreign diplomats and journalists. My Chinese friends laughed at my suspicions.
"Of course not," one said. "State Security just wants to make money."
For the same reason, State Security also ran a bakery, and the national police went into hotel management. The Army General Staff Department became part owner of one of China's best hotels, the Palace. For a time, a local army unit ran a travel service that operated a brothel. The army also runs scores of factories that make televisions, refrigerators, clocks and other products. The Public Security Ministry runs a fascinating pair of shops selling night sticks and electric cattle prods.
What happened is that Government offices felt that they had been left out of the money game. So they decided to go into business, often taking advantage of extra land, well-placed contacts or special skills. Even schools began to run their own factories or farm yards to raise extra money for chairs and textbooks and teacher salaries.
There's a downside to all this, of course. Many school principals seem to devote more energy to their sideline businesses than to the curriculum. And when a liquor bureau runs a bar on the side, rival taverns may have reason to complain about the fairness of the regulations. Yet there's also a benefit: These companies give the bureaucrats a stake in the market economy. Officials at every level now depend for their personal incomes and benefits on the progress of the reforms and the economic system. Only a thriving market can satisfy their hunger.
Everyone in China, it seems, has gone into business or is moonlighting: waitressing at night, writing articles for popular magazines, teaching English or aerobics, consulting on computer programs or giving seminars on stocks and bonds. If they don't already have an evening job, Chinese intellectuals and officials are taking night classes to train for a second career. This way, they are able to triple or quadruple their salaries and, at the same time, keep their "iron rice bowl" -- with its job security, housing and health insurance.
China today is something of a cross between Dodge City and Dickensian England. It's a lawless place motivated by a strange mix of greed and apprehension that this wonderful money-making opportunity could end at any moment. China may not use little boys as chimney sweeps, but the textile and garment industries work children 14 hours a day, seven days a week, and often they sleep by their looms. If you lose your arm in the loom, you're fired. That may sound grim, but 19th-century capitalism is a big improvement over 18th-century feudalism.
Some people say China is not really moving toward Western-style capitalism because the capital still belongs to state-owned banks that assign it for noneconomic reasons. In other words, the price of capital in China isn't interest. It's a bribe. Or it's the work that has gone into cultivating guanxi, or connections, with the bankers and local officials. They are right, to some degree, but then again 19th-century capitalism didn't operate exactly by the book, either. Some of the vast fortunes were collected through monopolies, which in turn were frequently awarded because of bribes or connections in Washington or the state capitals.
The same kind of manipulation of economics and politics is happening today in China, and there is a strong sense throughout the country that now is the time in which the great financial empires will be made, before the system becomes more rigid and the opportunities fewer.
The analogy with the industrializing United States is also a reminder that a country can endure enormous shocks and turbulence at the same time it is enjoying economic growth. In the 19th century, Americans saw appalling inequity, gross manipulations of the political system, lynchings, bank collapses, brutal repression of labor and leftist activism.
A visitor to the United States in the 19th century might easily have been overwhelmed by the injustice and disorder. He could have interviewed penniless immigrants in the crime-plagued slums of Boss Tweed's New York, chatted with dispossessed farmers in the Great Plains during one of the several depressions, toured the cotton plantations of the South and the manufacturing cities of the Northeast and listened to the rage. And he could well have concluded that the center would never hold, that America would be swept by war and revolution. Instead, the history of the United States underscores how much abuse a country can absorb when it is growing economically.
China now enjoys that kind of economic growth, and perhaps it too will demonstrate this kind of resiliency. There is, however, one big difference. The United States had established a civil society and enjoyed a far more flexible political system, one that could respond to popular pressure without exploding. A free press had always flourished, and elections were regularly held everywhere, even if they were sometimes rigged. However inadequate the political and legal system was in the 19th century, it was far more responsive than China's is today. In China, the question remains: Will this era's emperors allow their system to evolve in similar ways?
AH CHANG IS A MAN IN his early 30's, 5 foot 2, with thinning hair, a wrinkling smile and a thickening waistline. Nick and I met him through friends, and I looked him up whenever I visited his hometown of Guangzhou (Canton). Each time I dropped by, he was engaged in a different line of business. Each time he was richer.
Ah Chang, a nickname used by his Cantonese friends, never went to college. After he finished high school, he spent a year sawing boards and soldering wires in an electronics shop. From there, he was transferred to a job stoking a coal-burning furnace, where he shoveled coal all day long, breathing the moist dust each time he inhaled. When he came home, his hair and face clouded by a veil of black soot, his mother would look at him and cry.
He made his first fortune in the late 1980's as a restaurant owner. But he worried that the environment might change after Deng Xiaoping's death, and so he was looking for a way to move abroad. Then the 1989 Tiananmen movement gave him a chance. He was simply one of the millions of passive supporters of the Tiananmen movement, and he was in no danger of being arrested. Nevertheless, he had heard through the grapevine that America was giving political asylum to anyone who claimed involvement in the movement.
He sold his business and bought a false American passport for $20,000. The passport was a good forgery, but even so Ah Chang was worried about being caught. Instead of flying directly to the United States, he flew throughout Asia, stopping in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo, where he stayed a few days before he made his way to San Francisco. Once he arrived in California, he thought he had made it. He destroyed his passport, because he was afraid of being caught with a forgery, and turned himself into the immigration authorities. He claimed political asylum.
The Immigration Service detained him for several months and then determined that he was not a genuine political refugee. It returned him to China. Once there, Ah Chang bribed and ingratiated his way out of trouble, but his money was gone -- he had spent $30,000 on his passport, air tickets, bribes and other costs -- and he had no business.
He started again from scratch, opening a small restaurant and bar in Guangdong, paying off the authorities so that he could run a cable from a satellite dish on a nearby roof. That enabled him to show Hong Kong television in his bar, and business improved. Even so, he wasn't making as much money as he wanted. His big break came when a major foreign developer wanted to buy out his restaurant and demolish it as part of a large construction project. The foreigners handed over $40,000 to Ah Chang.
"It wasn't a very good restaurant," he told me over dinner one evening. "I didn't manage it very well. I had all my friends over and they ate cheaply. But I had a good location. In a flash, I had $40,000."
Ah Chang took the money and bought a large apartment, which he furnished lavishly. His total assets were now about $70,000. He hardly cared about politics but he did like his freedom and he did want to travel. He had hooked up with a Hong Kong Da Laoban, or Big Boss, and was helping him hunt for property deals. He had also begun trading in shoes, contracting with factories and selling the shoes in other cities in China. He had his eye on a car and he had plunked down nearly $45,000 to buy a lakeside summer home.
Ah Chang was always devising ways of making money, like selling medicines. He happened to befriend the factory manager of a large pharmaceutical manufacturer, and the manager agreed to supply him with one of the latest kinds of intravenous solutions.
"I've known the guy for an entire year," Ah Chang explained. "He calls me practically every day and I accompany him wherever he wants to go. I eat meals with him and run around and have fun with him. So he trusts me and I trust him. Then I took the purchaser at a hospital out to lunch, and he says he'll buy the medicine from me. I'll slip a little to him on the side."
"How much will you give him?" I asked.
"I'll give him 50 percent."
"How much will you give the factory manager?" I asked.
"I'll give him about 20 percent."
"But then all you have left is 30 percent," I said.
"But 30 percent isn't so bad. If I get 30 percent here, 30 percent there and 30 percent somewhere else, that's not so bad. There's really no other way. I have to give them a cut to make them happy. At least I make something. After all, the law doesn't allow individuals to trade in medicine, so I need a way to hook up with someone who has a license."
Ah Chang's newest moneymaking scheme is smuggling dogs into China. He is bringing in dogs as pets, not as food, which is how Cantonese traditionally viewed dogs. "In fact, this is good for society," he said. Chinese should stop looking at dogs as dishes and should start looking at them as companions, he added. There was a great demand for pets, but there was a rule against importing dogs: you simply couldn't bring them in for sale.
"Everyone smuggles, and I'm just a pea in the business," Ah Chang explained. "It may be against the law, but the law is ridiculous. You see, I'm not cheating anyone, really. I'm cheating the Government, but that's nothing. The Government has cheated the ordinary people for years, and it still cheats us because it doesn't let us import many things. Anyhow, I'm not smuggling drugs."
I was always curious how these smugglers operated. Were they the Chinese mafia? Were they an organized network of people who carried cellular phones and wore black suits? Ah Chang explained that a friend had introduced him to a maritime smuggler, a man who lives in a large multistoried brick house with lots of privacy. Most farmers use their land to grow rice or dig fish ponds. This man, an uneducated peasant who knew the sea but couldn't even write his name, had converted his plot of land into a nice lawn. His entire family had quit farming to work in the family smuggling business. No big networks. This guy fended for himself. His family owned two big boats that they kept hidden by the coast. Even Ah Chang didn't dare ask where the boats were.
"How does he actually smuggle the stuff into China?" I asked.
"I tell him what I want, where to get it, who to pick it up from in Hong Kong," Ah Chang said. "Then I give him a deposit, and when he brings the merchandise to me, I pay him the rest."
The whole family invited Ah Chang over to the house and then treated him to a fancy meal at a dimly lit restaurant with beautiful, and available, women.
"Each time we go out, he pays several thousand yuan," or hundreds of dollars, Ah Chang said. "He needs to find customers, too. Is this the underground mafia? Hmph! I don't know what this mafia is that everyone refers to. You call my small-time peasant fisherman the mafia? I don't think so. He just wants to make some money. Would you say I'm dealing with the mafia? I don't think so. What's the mafia, then? Maybe it's the people who smuggle heroin, maybe it's the pimps and prostitutes, the weapons dealers. Maybe that's it. In America, you know what's illegal. Your laws are clear. Not in China. In fact, in China, the police, they're the worst of them all. They're linked to the smugglers, too. China is a crazy country now."
ORGANIZED CRIME SEEMED, IN part, organized by the state. Everyone knew that the police and the customs officials were involved in smuggling and other illicit practices. There was Fangcheng, for instance.
Fangcheng, a small port in Guangxi Province, suddenly became one of the most popular harbors in China. The reason was that the local customs officials were involved in small sideline broker companies that offered to handle all the paper work for importing goods. These broker companies set up offices along a street near the port, and the importer simply handed shipping documents to the company, which then filled out all the customs forms, obtained the import licenses and ushered the goods through customs. For this the officials took a fat commission, but the buyer didn't feel the pinch. The customs officers never assessed the true substantial duties on goods handled by the sideline companies, so importers saved large sums on duties and the brokers could then skim some for themselves.
The central Government realized that something was up when cargoes destined for all parts of China lined up to use this one small port in Guangxi. There were huge delays for ships to get into the port, and hardly any duty was being paid. So the authorities investigated and temporarily closed the port in mid-1993.
The Government has had occasional successes like Fangcheng, but on a broader scale it is unable to come to grips with the country's rampant corruption. Rather, money and resources have gone into feeding the national obsession -- the expansion of the economy. And this frenetic growth may be brokering a true revolution in China.
WHEN THE historians of the world gather 100 years from now, they may well conclude that the dominant trend of our age was the rise of China.
From the vantage point of someone with a long view, the ascendancy of the West is a recent phenomenon -- dating from about 500 years ago. For much of history Chinese philosophy, poetry, science and government were more sophisticated than those of Europe, and China's standard of living may have been higher. If China can raise its standard of living and education, if it can squeeze out of its present ideological straitjacket, then -- who knows what it may have in store for the world?
China's economic revolution is more significant than the Maoist revolution of the 1940's and 50's, and the best way to appreciate its magnitude is to squat in the fields in rural villages, chatting with peasants. The World Bank calculates that since the reform era began in 1978 a total of 170 million Chinese have risen from absolute poverty. That marks a 60 percent decline in the number of the destitute in China -- impressive by any standard. In the Philippines, the number of absolutely poor people in 1990, 13 million, is the same as in 1970.
Xing Yisheng's life offers a window into the scope of the change for the poorest Chinese. I met him in a mud-brick village on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northwestern Gansu Province. Xing, 74, was wearing a much-patched and faded Mao suit. He was hobbling down a rutted dirt path, and he invited me into his shack a few doors away.
The shack had two rooms, each dominated by a kang, a platform bed with a fireplace underneath. The dirt floor was swept clean and the furniture consisted of three rickety wooden chairs set around a crude wooden table. The mud walls were papered with newspapers, with pictures from old calendars providing a bit of color. Xing grandly commanded a daughter-in-law to bring tea, which she carefully poured into a couple of cracked cups.
"Before Liberation," he recalled, referring to the Communist takeover in 1949, "I was just a farmhand, working for the landlords, because I didn't have any land. I had two sons then, but I had to sell them because I didn't have any money. I was ill with typhoid. So I sold my two boys for 400 pounds of rice each. I never saw them again.
"There's a huge difference between life now and the way it was then," Xing added. A grown son -- one of four children born after 1949 -- sat quietly a few feet away, looking bored, as if he had heard it all before. "Our life today is better than a landlord's life in the past. But I tell this to young people and they don't want to hear. They say, Go away! They don't know about the old life."
Xing pointed reproachfully at his son, who appeared to be in his late 30's. "Young man," Xing declared, his voice rising, "now you're living in heaven! You dress well, you eat well." Xing turned back to me and waved dismissively at his son. "Why, last year this young man wanted to buy a stereo cassette recorder for 700 yuan [about $80 at the unofficial exchange rate]. I said: 'No, that's too much. We should buy a mule.' A mule can work. It's useful. A stereo isn't. And a mule is so big, while a stereo is so small."
It was clear who had won the argument. A nice stereo occupied the place of honor in the middle of the room. Despite Xing's misgivings, the family was doing more than subsist; it was beginning to enjoy a bit of leisure. A similar change is unfolding in most of the million-odd villages in China.
SINCE DENG XIAOPING took over in 1978, the Chinese economy has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of a bit more than 9 percent. That is triple the average growth rate of the United States in that period, and about 70 percent more than the growth rate in India or Indonesia.
China is now the biggest producer in the world of coal, cement, grain, cotton, meat and fish. It ranks third in steel production, after Japan and the United States and fifth in crude oil output, after the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran.
To get a sense of the giddy pace of change in China, just consider the process of industrialization around the world. Britain was the first country to enjoy an industrial revolution, beginning in the late 18th century, and it then took 58 years for per capita British gross domestic product to double. The American industrial revolution was a bit faster, with per capita output doubling in 47 years from 1839. Beginning in 1885, Japan doubled its per capita gross domestic product in 34 years.
Now, in the late 20th century, China is roaring along with its own industrial revolution, doubling its per capita output every 10 years. The "Four Dragons" -- Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea -- managed similar growth rates, or even slightly higher ones, in peak periods of their development, but together they are no more than the size of a Chinese province. For such growth rates in such a huge country as China, there's been nothing like it in history.
Last year, the World Bank published a major study on East Asia, concluding that there was only one chance in 10,000 that so many economic miracles would be located so close to one another. There are some important common threads among the region's success stories, and they may shed some light on China's prospects.
Like its neighbors, China began its reform program with an effort to boost agricultural incentives. Japan, Taiwan and South Korea also underwent a land redistribution in the aftermath of World War II, and the relative equality seems to have been a factor in their growth. Again, like its neighbors, China has opened itself up to foreign investment and management, and its export drive in the coastal provinces has forced it to compete with other manufacturers around the world.
The high saving rate in today's East Asia is particularly striking. China has a personal saving rate that ranges between 35 and 40 percent, compared with about 5 percent in the United States. These savings generate the capital for new factories, roads and shops that, in turn, boost economic growth.
The other kind of capital necessary for sustained growth is human capital -- a healthy, educated work force that can run assembly lines and figure out how to do things better and faster. The Communists have done well in primary education, and nearly all children get at least a few years of elementary school. Perhaps 95 percent of all children start school and more than 80 percent graduate from elementary school. Because of the Communist Party's traditional suspicion of intellectuals, China has a low university enrollment, only 1.7 percent. But even there China manages to focus its training on the specialties it needs; every year it manages to graduate more than 200,000 engineers, nearly twice as many as the United States.
Literacy is still low, but it is much higher than ever before. Wang Chigang, a 76-year-old peasant in central Anhui Province, typifies the country's many illiterates. He grew up as a landless peasant and beggar, never went to school and still cannot write his name. "I don't like the city," he said, sipping a cup of dark tea in his shack. "Too crowded. Nobody has time for you. And it's embarrassing when I have to go to the toilet -- I don't know which is which. Since I don't know the characters for 'man' and 'woman,' I have to ask for help finding the right one." Yet Wang's children and his grandchildren have all gone to school. Pointing to a grandson who finished high school, Wang boasted, "He can write really well."
While some local governments ignore the illiteracy problem, others are actively campaigning to teach people to read and write. In the villages of Xiping County in Henan Province in central China, students stop visitors and ask them to read a few characters on a blackboard. Any visitor who cannot read the characters is not allowed to enter the village. This means that illiterates are effectively grounded, and in frustration many have joined the special reading classes offered in each village. Now in Xiping County, according to local officials, only 1.7 percent of those between the ages of 20 and 40 are illiterate.
The other crucial kind of human capital in which the Communists have invested is public health care. The Chinese medical system is in many ways a model for developing countries. While China spends less than 4 percent of gross national product on medical care (compared with 15 percent in the United States), its health statistics are comparable to those of much richer nations. And in the cities, health statistics are as good as those of American urban areas. In Shanghai, for example, the most recent figure shows that 9.9 out of every 1,000 infants die in their first year of life. In New York City the infant mortality rate is 10.2 per 1,000. A baby in Shanghai can expect to live 76 years, while average life expectancy in New York is 73.8 years.
To get a better sense of how Chinese doctors achieve such health statistics, I spent a day with the perpetually sorrowful Dr. Su Ke in the villages of Xishuangbanna District, a tropical region near Vietnam. A 46-year-old with a graying crew cut, Dr. Su works out of a rural clinic but regularly hikes with the other doctors into the mountains to see the peasants who don't believe in doctors. As we drove into the mountains in my hired car, he explained the difficulties.
"When we go out and try to inoculate babies, some of the peasants are very frightened and hide their kids," Dr. Su said. "Or they turn their dogs on us to bite us and drive us away." Even if Dr. Su manages to get his needle into the derriere of a local child -- a task made easier because none of them wear pants -- he is likely to get in trouble. "We give them injections against measles, and then the kid gets a cold. So the parents come and complain. They say, 'You promised that my child wouldn't get sick!' "
We stopped the car by a roadside one-room clinic operated by an 18-year-old peasant who had just opened up shop as a doctor. The peasant was trying to pull the abscessed tooth of a teen-age girl, but he wasn't making much headway. Blood was all over, and knives and pliers were scattered about, and both the doctor and the patient looked a bit discouraged. There was no Novocain, but the young woman was using some Chinese medicine that seemed to deaden the pain pretty well. Dr. Su took over the pair of pliers, rapped away with a chisel, and after about five minutes the tooth came out.
Instead of allocating resources for dental offices or complex procedures like coronary operations or dialysis, China has channeled its money to basic care -- an approach that is far more cost-effective. For example, basic treatment for leukemia costs about $5,000 and on average adds a bit more than a month to a patient's life. The same $5,000, used to buy vitamin A supplements for children, adds a total of 10,000 years of life expectancy.
WHAT DO THESE improvements in health, education and living standards add up to? For all the brutality of the Chinese regime, it is presiding over an economic revolution that is scarcely fathomable. Never before in human history have so many people -- or even such a large share of humanity -- risen from poverty so rapidly.
China's economic gains are mirrored in a broader phenomenon: the rise of a "Greater China" as an increasingly integrated economic entity. Greater China consists of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan; despite their political differences, their economies are being melded into one. Taiwanese companies have moved entire assembly lines across the Taiwan Strait into southern China. Most of the Taiwan shoemaking industry has relocated to Guangdong and Fujian Provinces; much of the garment and sportswear industries have moved as well. Once Taiwan allows direct flights across the strait, that air route from China to Taiwan may well become one of the busiest in the world, the Asian equivalent of the Boston-New York-Washington corridor.
The global economy is sometimes said to be tripolar, revolving around the United States, Japan and the European Community. But Greater China is rapidly becoming a fourth pole, a new pillar of the international economy. According to World Bank projections using comparable international prices, Greater China in the year 2002 is projected to have a gross domestic product of $9.8 trillion, compared with $9.7 trillion in the same year for the United States. If those forecasts hold, Greater China would not just be another economic pole. It would be the biggest of them all.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CHINA will fall apart during the succession struggles after the death of Deng Xiaoping. But, for all the risks, there is a strong chance China will succeed over the coming decades in sustaining an economic boom. If so, the ramifications would not only be economic; the global diplomatic, political and military balance may also have to be recalibrated.
Continued economic growth also means that China will demand far more of the world's energy resources. It will add substantially to the world's problems with acid rain, chlorofluorocarbons and other environmental hazards. China may come to dominate a number of sports and sweep the medals chart in every Olympics. Already China has the largest army in the world and the most rapidly increasing military budget.
Some would argue that China's Government cannot sustain its economic revolution because it is so despotic. But that is probably faulty thinking. In determining economic growth, repression may matter, but savings rates matter more. There is a historical parallel that underscores how one can harbor hopes for China while retaining an antipathy for the present leadership.
The dynasty in Chinese history most like the present one is the Qin, founded in 221 B.C. by an emperor who was a brilliant military leader and a cruel tyrant. The Qin emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, but he also unified the country and linked border fortifications to create the Great Wall. Mao Zedong himself acknowledged (and was flattered by) the similarities in vision and ruthlessness between him and the Qin emperor.
Partly because the Qin emperor was so harsh, his dynasty lasted just a few years after his death. Yet the Qin emperor laid a foundation that served China well. The next dynasty was the Han, which lasted more than four centuries and was a golden era -- a flourishing age for the arts and scholarship as well as for the economy.
The Communist dynasty, like the Qin, may well have inadvertently laid a foundation for the next dynasty. The Communists' brutality and incompetence killed tens of millions of Chinese, and torture continues today in prisons around the country. But the party also united China, redistributed land and wealth, and destroyed the special interests that were stifling economic growth. China now has a chance to grow and prosper and become a major international power, perhaps eventually a superpower such as the world has never known.

BYLINE: By Nicholas Wade 

 BODY:
Not so long ago, high technology was seen as the likely handmaiden of totalitarian government, with surveillance systems and central computers tracking every citizen from cradle to grave. By a strange turn of events, what is now in progress is the very opposite of that nightmare. So many powerful technologies are streaming into private hands that Government is struggling to protect even the bare minimum of its legitimate domains.
Once only governments could launch photo-reconnaissance satellites; now the C.I.A. is anxiously trying to curb commercial systems that can discern objects as small as a yard across, high enough resolution to interest generals as much as geologists. A fleet of navigational satellites designed to give military commanders their exact position anywhere in the world is now in essence available to anyone; the Pentagon has let the public listen in on a degraded signal, but commercial vendors with clever algorithms can restore it to near-military accuracy. 
 The computers that tie together the Government's information systems have become increasingly porous. The better their security systems, the more tempting the challenge. Earlier this year the Pentagon discovered that a coterie of computer hackers had penetrated large parts of its sensitive though unclassified computer network and had even taken control of several military computers.
Think tanks and academics have warned for years, quite erroneously, that terrorists would avail themselves of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; it hasn't happened, because none of these items are easy to use and simpler means have always been available. But the samples of stolen Russian uranium and plutonium that have recently been captured in Germany are a clear warning that this blithe era of security may now be over.
The samples seem to have come from reactor fuel and laboratories, not nuclear warheads. But that is small comfort, especially in view of new calculations that only one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of plutonium is needed to make a bomb, not eight kilograms as was generally assumed. And the smugglers caught by the German police were hawking four kilograms for a mere $250 million.
PERHAPS THE MOST SURPRISING democratization of high technology is that of cryptography, once an elite art of those who guarded Government's most precious secrets. The first serious challenge to the National Security Agency's ability to crack almost everyone else's ciphers came from an ingenious coding approach created in academe in the mid-1970's and known as the public key cryptosystem. The commercial sponsor sold the program to American companies but was not allowed to export it. Then in 1991, a Colorado computer expert, Philip R. Zimmermann, produced a program apparently based on this system, which he named Pretty Good Privacy. A copy of Pretty Good Privacy found its way onto the Internet, free to takers from all countries, and all of a sudden Government-class security became available to everyone. Zimmermann's next project is to develop a pretty secure citizen's phone that scrambles conversations.
At this point, of course, it's possible to wonder if the humiliation of Big Brother isn't being taken beyond reasonable limits. Some Government monopolies are not so bad: the use of force, for one. If you believe the F.B.I. is bugging your conversations, you'll want to see Zimmermann in the inventors' hall of fame; if terrorism and organized crime seem the more immediate threats, the universal right to absolute privacy looks less compelling.
Is it possible for the state to get too weak in relation to its possible adversaries? That's the last thought that occurs to Americans across a wide spectrum of opinion, from free market economists to civil libertarians. From a variety of motives, they persistently call for governmental power to be curbed. The present headlong democratization of high technology is the flower of a decade of economic deregulation, and of the fading influence of military procurement as a driver of technical progress.
The state is so familiar a political structure that its endurance is hard to doubt. For economists and political analysts, it is the only unit of account. Yet in his recent book, "The Transformation of War," the noted military historian Martin van Creveld argues that since modern states are no longer able to fight each other for fear of nuclear war, conventional warfare, too, has become outmoded. Since the purpose of states (at least in the view of military historians) is to fight each other, states that cannot do so must sooner or later yield to organizations that will, like sects, tribes or cults.
"In North America and Western Europe, future war-making entities will probably resemble the Assassins, the group which . . . terrorized the medieval Middle East for two centuries," van Creveld predicts. Regular armed forces, as has happened in Lebanon, will degenerate into police forces or mere armed gangs; the day of the condottieri will return.
Van Creveld is not the only analyst to fear for the state. From quite different reasoning, the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argued in a widely read essay in Foreign Affairs last year that world politics would be shaped in future by clashes between cultures and religions. As the West loses its military and economic predominance, the counterresponse from the rest of the world will be couched in religious and cultural terms: "The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future," he wrote.
Even without fully embracing these forecasts of the state's eclipse, it's hard to ignore such recent incidents as the bombing of the World Trade Center or the car bombings of Jewish organizations in Buenos Aires and London. Terrorists with secure phones, satellite maps, accurate positioning and a sophisticated understanding of modern communications systems could bring down not just a few buildings but large sections of a modern economy.
Big Brother is dead. The only serious likelihood of his resurrection lies in reaction to the chaos and disintegration that an era of Little Brothers might bring.

Hotel Safety: Out in the Open

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
HOTEL detectives have emerged from behind the lobby palm. In fact, security staff members are virtually on display these days as advertisements for hotels. In a few years, the hotel-motel industry has reversed itself, from shunning the topic of protection against crime, lest it cause guests to worry, to talking about safety openly.
"Security is a big issue in the industry," said Lisa Garb, spokeswoman for Howard Johnson's. "If it's not the top priority in guest surveys, it's the second." 
 Once the issue received public attention, after a widely publicized settlement in a motel rape in Texas in 1991 and an increase in crime against tourists in Florida and elsewhere, no hotel could afford to fall behind.
One strong indication is the rise in door locking systems that use plastic cards, mechanical or electronic. Electronic door locks, which cost about $250 each installed, are opened with cards with magnetic strips and are reprogrammed automatically when a guest checks out; the nonelectronic key cards do not change combinations automatically but can be reprogrammed if a guest fails to return a key. Because these cards do not have room numbers on them, they are useless to anyone who finds one.
Thom Davis, an operations consultant to the American Hotel and Motel Association, says the major security advantage of electronic key cards is that "a lot of places don't have good key control" and the automatic reprogramming feature eliminates employee neglect -- failure to change a tumbler lock after a key is lost, for example -- as a security risk. Mr. Davis, a former police officer who is a partner in Hospitality Risk Controls in Dublin, Ohio, says that locks are only one part of security. He said his 1,500 clients nationwide included motel chains with effective security that still used metal keys.
 
 
Locks and Plastic Cards
 Anthony G. Marshall, dean of the School of Hospitality Management at Florida International University in Miami, said virtually all motel and hotel chains had set deadlines for their properties to switch to card locking systems.
On Aug. 17, according to Mercedes A. McDonnell, a spokeswoman for Choice Hotels, the participating motels of four chains in this group set a deadline of Oct. 1, 1996, for conversion to electronic locks: These are the Quality, Comfort, Clarion and Sleep Inns. Sleep Inns, an economy brand begun in 1988, describes itself as the first chain that started out with "state of the art" door security: These motels, now numbering over 100, use the guest's credit card as the room key. But the company making this technology, Ms. McDonnell said, is not doing as well as others in the field and Sleep Inn owners are being given the option of changing to their own electronic keys.
Holiday Inns has set Jan. 1, 1996, as a worldwide deadline for its properties to install reprogrammable card-keys. According to a spokeswoman, all hotels joining the chain must now have such a system.
Howard Johnson's deadline for franchise holders to install electronic locks is Jan. 1, 1996, according to Ms. Garb. Two other chains in the same group, Hospitality Francise Systems Inc., have set deadlines: Ramada Inns in the United States for Jan. 1, 1996; the Days Inns for Jan. 1, 1997. This group's Super 8 chain still uses metal keys, but management is discussing a change, she said.
Budgetel Inns, according to Steve Marcus, the chairman, had shifted its company-owned properties, now numbering 80, to electronic locks by the end of 1993; the end of 1994 is the deadline for its 22 franchise operators, which he said were nearly allconverted.
Sheraton's deadline was August 1993, and all 272 properties in North America met it; "a couple" of the 124 overseas properties were granted extensions, according to Lisa Dickason, a spokeswoman. According to the chain's security chief, Richard Hudak, 60 to 70 percent of Sheratons have electronic keys; the rest have mechanically reprogrammable ones. All domestic Marriott hotels, Courtyards by Marriott and Fairfield Inns have new locking systems, according to Chad Callaghan, Marriott's senior director for loss prevention.
Residence Inns, another Marriott brand, still use metal keys but Mr. Callaghan said each unit was small enough to maintain tight key control.
 
 
Deadbolts and Peepholes
 Kris Krause, director of industry evaluation for the American Automobile Association, said the membership of 36 million began telling the organization in 1991 that it expected deadbolts, in addition to regular latches, on hotel room doors. The A.A.A. responded in 1993 by raising its minimum standards for being listed in the 23 regional Tour Guides. A requirement was added that room doors and connecting doors have deadbolts, 1 to 1 1/2 inches long, and that room doors also have chains and peepholes. The deadline was set for the inspections on which the 1995 guides would be based. The inspections will be finished in October and by mid-August, Ms. Krause said, 7,000 of 22,000 were complete. She said 447 lodging places had been told they were out of the book because of the security requirement, a rate of 6 percent.
"Most of the hotels recognized that these requirements were long overdue," Ms. Krause said. "The ones that did not were in remote places, independent motels that could not afford to get them installed, or places that conceived that they had no crime problem."
The A.A.A. has given up on enforcing its requirements for places listed in "Caribbean Travelbook." "We would have retained 5 percent of our listings," Ms. Krause said. "Most places there say they do not lock their doors. They say crime is not a problem. They are in deep denial." She said the A.A.A. was considering stating in the entries which places did or did not have room security.
 
 
Need for Guests to Be Alert
 Hotel security experts point to another reason that safety discussions have become so audible: In a time of prevalent crime, hotels want guests to be alert to safety issues. There is no point in having a peephole if a guest does not use it before opening the door, Mr. Davis said. Don't flaunt jewelry, Mr. Marshall said. Don't leave the motel door open while fetching your luggage, Ms. Krause said.
Alice M. Wisel, editor of the seven regional Mobil Guides, estimated her guides eliminate on security grounds 1 percent of the 23,000 places they inspect in a year. Although inspection standards do not specify deadbolts, peepholes or type of keys, she said that overall security was carefully checked, particularly location. "We just drop a place if the inspector says, 'This is not an area where I would send a guest.' " she said.
Hotels and motels in the United States are probably now the safest in the world, Mr. Marshall said, because courts have made it costly for those who do not exercise "reasonable care." Mr. Davis, who represents many motels in lawsuits, said that the question of "foreseeability" was getting more acute; that is, even if a motel has not experienced a particular crime, if the neighbors have, the motel must take precautions on that score.

HEADLINE: Opening New Fronts At Battery Park City

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
ONLY a decade ago, the word "City" in Battery Park City seemed misplaced; not because the project's scale and ambition were insufficient but because this new 92-acre neighborhood on the Hudson River had little of the drama and combustion that characterize truly urban life.
While its plazas are crossed today by streams of ferry-borne commuters and its playgrounds are filled with squealing children, the development still has an insular quality that attracts those seeking a respite from Manhattan and bothers those who wish it were more public. Whether Battery Park City will ever be fully integrated into the fabric of New York remains to be seen. 
 However, it is beginning to earn the "City" in its own title. There are new trophies and simmering headaches. Plans are in a state of constant evolution. And almost everywhere, from the southern tip to the northern edge, construction is happening or impending.
South Park, embroiled in controversy a few years ago, is being built. To the north, New York's Holocaust memorial -- known formally as the Living Memorial to the Holocaust-Museum of Jewish Heritage -- is to begin rising next month, following numerous course changes since 1986.
The South Cove has just reopened after a landscape renovation. The North Cove is getting a new park, now under construction, which will link the southern part of Battery Park City to the Hudson River Park.
Overlooking the North Cove is the site of the new headquarters of the New York Mercantile Exchange, which will include two large trading floors; one for Nymex and one for Comex, the Commodity Exchange. This plan was announced a month ago and the ground lease is now under negotiation.
At the north end of Battery Park City, four sites are being offered for residential construction, with a potential total of almost 1 million square feet of space. Proposals from developers are due Sept. 16.
Nearby, the Battery Park City Authority is planning its own development, combining a public school for about 700 students (kindergarten through the eighth grade) and a tower with some 200 two- and three-bedroom apartments, 30 percent of them subsidized for middle-income families.
"The idea is to encourage families to move to Battery Park City and live here for a very long time," said David Emil, president and chief executive of the authority. "If we can do that, it will be one of the most successful things we do."
So this is one vision of the future Battery Park City: a family place of parks, schools and large apartments; a business place whose role is underscored by the new exchange; a cultural place with its own museum and expanding collection of public art, like the waterfront pylons by Martin Puryear that are to arrive next spring.
That is not to suggest an idyllic present, however. For instance, owners at the 107-unit Hudson View West condominium have been in a state of open rebellion against the authority since June 1993, withholding their ground rent payments and their payments in lieu of real estate taxes.
The president of the board of managers, Arthur J. Sikula, said an average one-bedroom apartment at Hudson View West had dropped in value over seven years to $100,000 from $200,000. Meanwhile, he said, monthly maintenance costs had risen to $1,200 from $650. That has left about half the owners in arrears. "What's going to happen," he said, "is that in the coming months the building is just going to go under."
(Because the issue is in the courts, the authority will not comment.)
Until the fate of Olympia & York is settled, a question mark will also hang over the World Financial Center, which it operates.
At present, Olympia & York "is doing a spectacular job of maintaining the project and we're very happy with the relationship," Mr. Emil said. "Olympia & York has been current on every rent payment and obligation to us. They have never been a day late. They have told us that they regard this as their most valuable asset."
LAST year, in a financial prospectus, the authority cautioned prospective bond buyers that if the United States subsidiary of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. followed its Canadian parent into bankruptcy, "a cessation of payment obligations" was possible that might "continue for a significant period of time."
But Mr. Emil said last month that the authority is confident that it would be able to collect rent from Olympia & York's subtenants at the World Financial Center in the event of bankruptcy.
And Harry W. Albright Jr., the chairman of the authority, said that the refinancing eight months ago of more than $850 million of the authority's debt "included significant reserves for any potential problems with our major tenants, including Olympia & York."
Technically, all developers and owners at Battery Park City are tenants or subtenants of the Battery Park City Authority. Tenants are charged rent ($9.2 million last year for the World Financial Center; $8.8 million for all of the residential projects) and payments in lieu of real estate taxes ($59.3 million for the World Financial Center; $11.9 million for the residential projects). Olympia & York is the tenant at One, Two and Four World Financial Center; American Express is the tenant at Three World Financial Center.
Mr. Albright said the debt refinancing would result in savings of $13 million a year and called it the most significant recent event at Battery Park City. "That debt restructuring guarantees the future financial integrity and safety of Battery Park City for a long, long time to come," he said.
The authority is undertaking a major development of its own: a $60 million public school and apartment tower at the north end of Battery Park City, across Chambers Street from Stuyvesant High School.
The school, with about 100,000 square feet of space, would occupy four or five floors at the base of the building and the 250,000-square-foot apartment building would rise above it. Construction is to begin next spring. The architects are Pasanella & Klein Stolzman & Berg and Costas Kondylis.
"We want a design oriented toward family use," Mr. Emil said. "Children under 18 don't need a marble-lined bathroom or a bedroom the size of their parents'."
By forgoing a development profit, the authority calculates that it will be able to subsidize up to 30 percent of the apartments, making them available to families with incomes between $40,000 and $60,000. A two-bedroom unit might rent for $1,000 a month.
The district manager of Community Board 1 in lower Manhattan, Paul Goldstein, said the board had long favored the idea of an elementary school and family-sized apartments at Battery Park City and was pleased to see the authority moving in that direction.
Also in the north neighborhood, the authority has issued a request for proposals from developers for four residential sites. The largest potential development, on the same block as Stuyvesant, would be a tower up to 350 feet high, with 320,000 square feet of space (roughly 35 stories and 300 units).
Two sites are on River Terrace, overlooking Hudson River Park. These could accommodate buildings of 200,000 and 240,000 square feet. The other, on North End Avenue, could be developed with 220,000 square feet.
Buildings are to follow new design guidelines devised by Ralph Lerner, Alexander Gorlin and Machado & Silvetti Associates. Mr. Emil said one goal was to create a link between Battery Park City and TriBeCa.
For example, North End Avenue was originally intended to invoke something of Park Avenue. But Musa Train Klebnikov, director of project development, said the consultants suggested developing North End Avenue as more of an extension of the blocks to the east, with lively street-level uses and the distinctive long canopies, or marquees, that overhang many TriBeCa sidewalks.
Mr. Emil said the authority also asked its design consultants what could be learned from the south residential neighborhood. "It appears in the current market at Battery Park City," Mr. Emil said, "that you need something greater than 200,000 square feet to get economies of scale."
Another set of guidelines is being developed for two key sites by Polshek & Partners, Robert A. M. Stern and Menz & Cook.
One of the sites, immediately north of the World Financial Center, could accommodate an office building with some 2.5 million square feet of space. The other site, between the World Financial Center and the Hudson River, is where the $225 million New York Mercantile Exchange is to rise.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a month ago that the Mercantile Exchange, newly merged with the Commodity Exchange, would move to Battery Park City. Mr. Emil said a letter of intent had been signed. "We expect to have a lease before the end of the year," he said.
THE deal has ended a decade-long search for new space by the Mercantile Exchange, now at Four World Trade Center. Daniel Rappaport, chairman of the exchange, said that "an extraordinary amount" of thought had been given to moving to Jersey City.
To prevent that, New York State and New York City offered a $125 million contribution toward construction of the new building, plus $23 million in real estate tax abatements, $9.8 million in rent abatements, $6.3 million in mortgage-recording tax abatements, $4.6 million in sales tax abatements and $15 million in savings through the use of electricity from the New York State Power Authority.
The building is to have about 500,000 square feet of space, Mr. Emil said, with two 25,000-square-foot trading floors. It would overlook the North Cove park, which is now under construction, to designs by Mitchell/ Giurgola and Child Associates.
From Olympia & York's standpoint, "any development -- so long as it's in keeping with the standards and objectives of the World Financial Center -- would be a plus," said Tom P. Falus, executive vice president.
Mr. Falus said the office towers were close to 100 percent occupied. The largest recent deal involved the subletting last year of some 320,000 square feet of Merrill Lynch space to Deloitte & Touche. The World Financial Center will lose a major office tenant next summer when Daiwa Securities moves to Financial Square, at Old Slip and South Street.
"That's the only departure we've ever had," Mr. Falus said. "The reason, quite frankly, is that we didn't have the space to accommodate them." He said deals had already been made for about half of Daiwa's 100,000 square feet of space. "As a general rule," he said, "the World Financial Center is still the first choice of any financial-services tenant in lower Manhattan. The problem is that it's not available."
Retail space at the World Financial Center is quite a different story. Up to 250,000 square feet of space is designated for retail use but only about 180,000 square feet of that is "viable," Mr. Falus said. The rest is poorly situated, often downright remote. Of the "viable" space, 85 to 90 percent is rented.
"Ann Taylor has just about doubled its space," Mr. Falus said, "and food operations are generally doing very well, but some of the smaller specialty operators are having a difficult time."
Difficulties are also plaguing the Hudson View West condominium at 300 Albany Street. Mr. Sikula, the board president, traced the problem to a ground lease that he said was disproportionately high, contrasted with nearby buildings. That, in turn, affected payments in lieu of real estate taxes, which are based on assessments of apartments in surrounding buildings where the rent is not as high and where values are stable or rising.
Mr. Sikula said the rent strike and an unsuccessful lawsuit were efforts to get the authority to undertake a reevaluation of assessment and payment policies. Instead, he said, the authority has gone to court seeking to compel the owners to pay.
Speaking generally about the south residential neighborhood, and excepting Hudson View West specifically, Maria S. Crouch, president of the Battery Park City Owners Association, said: "The market has started to come back, albeit slowly. We've seen an increase in sales throughout the community and an increase in value and prices."
Ms. Crouch, who also heads the Battery Park City committee of Community Board 1, said the development had matured and was "really becoming a neighborhood."
Among other things, she cited the Holocaust memorial and museum, a two-story, 20,000-square-foot building designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo Associates. Ground is to be broken on that project Oct. 16.
EIGHT years ago, the New York City Holocaust Memorial Commission entered into a lease with the Battery Park City Authority for a 64,000-square-foot parcel at the southern end of the development. At the time, the idea was to finance the memorial in part by the sale of development rights.
That plan collapsed with the real estate market. The commission scaled back the project and returned some 42,000 square feet of the site. "I believe they gave up something of great value," Mr. Emil said. "So do they."
In return, the authority committed itself to paying half the construction costs, matching private contributions dollar for dollar, up to $10 million. This is, in effect, an advance against future revenues expected from the site that the commission gave back. When the site is developed, the authority will pay another $7.5 million to the commission.
Near the memorial is South Park, 3.5 acres of rolling and formal lawns, flower beds, tree-lined allees and one-story brick pavilions, joined by a little bridge, with a cafe and viewing deck. The architects are Machado & Silvetti Associates, the landscape architects are Hanna/Olin and the garden designer is Lynden B. Miller.
Mr. Emil said a cafe operator would be selected through a request for proposals. The park is to open in the summer of 1996.
Overlooking South Park is a site earmarked for a luxury hotel, with up to 700 rooms. A request for proposals was issued in 1990 but Mr. Emil said it was never possible to achieve a successful lease negotiation. There are no current plans.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Reducing Water Usage

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
THE right to an abundance of domestic water at little cost is something Americans have traditionally taken for granted, like free speech. And they revel in the opportunity.
Several studies have shown that per capita water usage in the United States is higher than almost anywhere else in the world, with New York City, incidentally, near the top of the list. 
 It's a legacy, historians say, of the work of reformers at the turn of the century who promoted heavy water use to improve personal hygiene and control epidemics. Pressure from those reformers and the economical manner in which water could be brought into multifamily buildings also discouraged the installation of individual water meters. The costs were therefore never clearly recognized.
The resulting legacy of carefree usage is now coming back to haunt boards of condominiums and co-ops. For without personal accountability (and that may be impossible, since individual water meters are prohibitively expensive to install because many water lines come into each unit), it's going to be tough to persuade people to modify lifelong habits.
It's serious, since water costs are going up the way fuel oil costs did in the 1970's. For instance, the water bill at the 161-unit Elmwood Park Condominiums II in Staten Island rose from $16,000 in 1986 to $52,000 in 1994, without any substantial increase in consumption.
Ultimately, these increases could affect real estate values. Buildings that continually raise carrying charges to keep up with rising water bills may become less appealing compared with, say, a neighboring complex with a usage control program.
But it's not going to be easy. Consider the Toilet Rebate Program introduced earlier this year by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Designed to encourage owners and boards to install low-flush toilets, it offers a rebate of $150 each for every 5-gallon-per-flush toilet replaced by a 1.6-gallon model. (For details call the Toilet Rebate Program at (212) 685-5575.)
But it may be money down the drain because there's no great rush to sign up.
"None of my buildings want to bother," said Martin Filler, president of Island Condo Management, which manages some 30 buildings on Staten Island. "They don't want the mess."
Others scoff, insisting these toilets don't really work. Thus ongoing educational programs will be needed to change attitudes. And these many have to be combined with regular monitoring of building-wide usage so that any sudden spurt in demand never goes undetected for long.
In this manner, leaks -- as formidable an enemy as wanton consumption -- can be quickly detected and repaired. The introduction of new technology alone will not do the job, experts have found. Some people have quietly even removed their low-flow shower heads.
Despite these obstacles, there are some interesting success stories. Philip Howard Apartments, a 600-unit co-op on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, gained the cooperation of its shareholders for the new toilet installation program by having the contractor install one of the new models in the co-op's offices (free of charge) and letting residents test it themselves. Units of matching bathroom colors were also offered.
Board members or residents might also be persuaded to visit the laboratory and showrooms of a plumbing concern that does these installations. In New York City, for instance, there's the exhibit at Water Savers Inc. at 451 West 46th Street.
To constantly remind residents of the water consumed by even a minor drip, Doug Kleine, executive vice president of the Soil and Water Conservation Society, headquartered in Ankeny, Iowa, recommended setting up a display in the lobby that shows how much water is lost when, say, even 5 drips a minute are left untended. It's done by showing how quickly those drips fill a large container. A calculator could then interpret those losses in dollars on a building-wide basis for an entire year, perhaps on a colored chart.
"You have to continually remind people and find ways to eliminate obstacles to behavior change," Mr. Kleine said. "You can't just tell them once."
Mr. Kleine has studied the conduct of condominium residents for more than a decade as the former director of research for the Community Associations Institute. He suggested that if the condominium or co-op consisted of several buildings, then a similar chart or contest might regularly report on one building's usage over another's, assuming each building had its own water meter. Peer pressure, he noted, might then do the rest.
At the four-building, 1,500-unit Watergate at Landmark condominium in Alexandria, Va., thousands of gallons are being saved through an innovative maintenance program that might be duplicated in almost any setting. The board hired a national consultation and contracting company, Metropolitan Water Saving Inc., of Bethesda, Md., to check each apartment for leaks and repair those leaks as detected.
To avoid heavy upfront costs, an agreement was worked out whereby the company would be paid on a cost-saving basis. Its fee would equal 75 percent of the saving on water bills compared with costs a year earlier for the first three months after completion and 50 percent for the next 33 months.
Should usage suddenly spurt during the term of the three-year contract, the company would be responsible for detecting the leak and making the repair, with its incentive based on restoring the cost savings to a point where it continued to collect a monthly fee.
The goal is also to assure ongoing monitoring of consumption. The company agreed to make that check on a twice-weekly basis. The condominium now plans to reactivate the repair program every six or seven years so it becomes a regular part of operations.
David Wilborn, president of Metropolitan, said the deal made financial sense based on its own research, which indicated that a toilet -- the heaviest domestic water user of all -- normally increased consumption to 185 to 200 gallons a day after five to seven years as a result of minor leaks. More normal usage is
125 gallons a day. Ninety percent of the toilets in the first phase of Watergate project were found to have either small or major leaks.
After completing repairs on only two of the Watergate buildings, its water saving for May and June alone totaled $11,956, reports Ron Kirby, president of Community Management Corporation of Fairfax, Va., the managing agent.
Access to all apartments was assured, he noted, because the condominium's lawyers explained to residents that saving money on water usage was a board responsibility since water charges were part of monthly maintenance. Thus the board had a fiduciary responsibility to keep those costs down. And even small, undetected leaks could raise everyone's costs even if the fixtures themselves belonged to the unit owners.
A newly published, easy-to-read, 112-page book on the topic, "How much is enough? Controlling Water Demand in Apartment Buildings," by Peter H Judd, offers excellent ideas, too.
Dr. Judd was formerly the chief of conservation in the New York City Bureau of Water Registry and a conservation planner with Northeast Utilities in Connecticut. For a copy of the $31 book call the American Water Works Association at 1-800-926-7337 and refer to catalogue number 20291GK.

HEADLINE: Welcome Business, Unwelcome Change

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
WHEN you ask people in Mystic what they want their community to look like 20 years from now, their answers go something like this: "More toward Nantucket than Coney Island." Or, "I don't want it to become the Southeastern Connecticut Gift Shop." While these descriptions may be imprecise, they show a concern for preserving the charm as Mystic grows as a tourist attraction.
Southeastern Connecticut, and Mystic with it, is certainly in a tourism boom. This is the region that includes Ledyard, where Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino is situated; Montville, where the Mohegan Indians plan to open a gambling casino; Norwich, which recently became home to a minor league baseball team, and New London, which is being promoted for development as a vacation destination. And so, Mystic Marinelife Aquarium and Mystic Seaport Museum plan to expand. If the demand for tourist information is an accurate indicator, vacationers are reacting to southeastern Connecticut's attractions. Connecticut's Mystic & More, a travel promotion bureau, has had requests for 88,733 information packets this year, up 24 percent from the 1993 total, according to the bureau's chairwoman, Rita Schmidt. 
 When Stonington's First Selectman, David S. Burdge, started spending summers in Mystic 40 years ago, there were only three motels and a few restaurants in the area. Today, there are 4,000 rooms in hotels, motels or bed and breakfast establishments and dozens of eating places. The quiet, seaside community of Mr. Burdge's youth has been transformed as families and groups of school children flock to the aquarium and seaport. The downtown business district is a hubbub of window shoppers and traffic. Crowds of people in T-shirts, shorts and sneakers amble along the narrow sidewalks, ice cream cones in hand, pointing out shops and historic homes to each other.
 
Another Atlantic City?
 As they watch all this activity, residents say they are torn between a desire to preserve the beautiful shoreline and small-town atmosphere that inspired them to settle in Mystic and excitement about the new business opportunities in tourism. Some people say they fear the problems associated with casino gambling may spread to Mystic. Others argue that zoning regulations and the legal limits on gambling protect Mystic from becoming another Atlantic City or Coney Island.
Niel Spillane, who moved to Mystic 33 years ago, said he fought hard to preserve the residential character of his neighborhood near downtown Mystic. As the influx of vacationers started in the early 1970's, he said, complaints about tourist traffic became staples of cocktail party chatter. But controversy really boiled up recently around a proposal by the Mashantucket Pequots, owners of the Foxwoods casino, to build a two-story private club in downtown Mystic that would include a store, public restrooms, a meeting room, bar and outdoor deck. The tribe plans to transport Foxwoods patrons from Ledyard to Mystic by bus and run boat trips from the club's dock on the Mystic River. More than 800 residents signed petitions opposing the project. The Stonington Planning and Zoning Commission, which held four public hearings on the Mashantuckets' application, must make a decision by Oct. 7. Some people involved in the debate raised the broader question about what type of place they want Mystic to be in the years ahead and how they can make their vision a reality.
"Who's looking out for the needs and future of this region?" asked Susan Duncan, who moved to Mystic with her family three years ago. "I'm not sure anybody is. I've talked to a lot of people over the last three years, and there's not as much vision as I would like to see."
Mrs. Duncan and her husband, David, organized Mystic Residents for Compatible Development, a group of about 40 families who oppose the Mashantuckets' plan. Members say the proposed club would add more traffic and noise to already congested downtown streets, and its connection with Foxwoods would create an environment for crime. The group is not against all development, said David Duncan, who added, "Change is not bad as long as it's well planned and thought out."
 
Building a Resort
 But a lawyer for the Mashantuckets, Jackson T. King, said gambling in Mystic is out of the question. "It's a hundred percent illegal and not what the tribe wants to do," Mr. King said. "The tribe is engaged in building a full-scale resort, so when people come in, they have things to do in the whole region. The tribe has for a couple of years now been encouraging guests at the casino to visit Mystic Seaport. Many residents and merchants tell us they're happy with the proposal and that it's something they would welcome."
But William Yates, who has lived in Mystic for 27 years, said he wonders how much development is enough. "The more people you add, the more attraction there is to add services," he said. "It's a snowball."
Anything they do at the Foxwoods casino, he said "adds to the potential for people to come down here and for more hotels, motels and amusements."
Solving land-use problems is complicated in Mystic, since the community is divided by the Mystic River into sections that lie in the towns of Groton and Stonington. A dense commercial district surrounded by stable, historic residential neighborhoods lies to the west on the Groton side of the river, and large tourist and retail attractions, including the seaport, aquarium and the Olde Mistick Village shopping center, are on the east bank in Stonington. The two downtowns are connected by a drawbridge, which is raised every hour, putting another bump in the traffic flow.
The Groton side of Mystic is in a historic district, which allows regulation of changes to buildings, parking lots and the appearance of streets. Stonington, however, voted down the idea of a Mystic historic district.
 
Traffic and Parking
 Although Groton and Stonington have undertaken several planning efforts and studies over the years, both jointly and separately, traffic and parking problems persist. And there is no formal way for the towns to work together on land use decisions, Groton's Mayor, Dolores E. Hauber, said in a report she gave last May at the Mayor's Institute on City Design.
Yet, decisions made over the years by one town have affected the other. Ms. Hauber mentioned as an example the opposition of Groton residents to a plan to place the word "Mystic" on the Exit 89 sign on Interstate 95, which would have directed tourist traffic through one of Groton's residential areas. The state's Department of Transportation is expected to present several alternatives at a meeting this month, Mr. Burdge said.
Another example of a decision that had an impact on both towns, Ms. Hauber said, was Stonington's approval of contemporary condominiums directly across the river from the stately Greek Revival homes in Groton.
The towns are beginning to value collaboration more, however, as shown in the purchase of property on the Stonington side of the river for a waterfront park. And Groton's town manager, Ronald P. LeBlanc, noted that officials and business owners from both towns are meeting to find solutions to transportation and parking problems. Stonington's director of planning, Blanche Higgins, said, "I think the towns are working more closely now than they have in a long time."
Although Foxwoods has brought badly needed jobs to southeastern Connecticut, the casino, which has its own hotels, restaurants and shops, does not appear so far to have had a direct effect on business in Mystic. Sales this summer have been about the same as last year, depending on the type of business, a member of the Mystic Chamber of Commerce, Donna Williston, said. Mrs. Williston, who owns a frame shop and gallery, is chairwoman of the chamber's Downtown Committee. "Some say business is flat, no better than last year. Others say it's better. I can't say I've seen a trend or a high percentage of increase in traffic," she said.
"People are taking their disposable income and going to Foxwoods," said Ms. Schmidt of Connecticut's Mystic & More group. Mystic, then, must build an identity that stands on its own and attracts tourists year after year for reasons other than gambling, Ms. Schmidt said. Orderly development may mean drawing a steady stream of vacationers throughout the year instead of encouraging jam-packed streets in July and August.
The only valid question concerning the Mashantuckets' private club, Ms. Hauber said, is whether or not the building complies with zoning laws. Mr. King said the building would allow only about 30 parking spaces. A number of boats, the largest carrying about 60 people, would operate several trips daily from the dock.
Even though Groton and Stonington are communicating more than ever, the towns respect each other's autonomy. "We can't tell Stonington what to do," Ms. Hauber said, referring to the Mashantuckets' plan. "Tourism is here to stay. How do we work with it?" she asked. "What effect will Foxwoods have on all this? I'm glad the Mashantuckets are doing it. And it's on the reservation. We'll watch to see how it goes. We're not in Ledyard."
As the region moves from an economy dependent on military contracting, the changes in the way of doing business seem frightening, Ms. Hauber said. "We always had tourism, but more people are coming in, different people," she explained. "There's been a shift in our economic growth, and when you see all that, you tend to worry if it will work out. I have faith in the tribe."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Art World;
Galleries, Off Critical List, Opening or Expanding

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
WHEN Gary Snyder opened Snyder Fine Arts in SoHo four years ago, the gallery stuck out like a sore thumb. It specialized in American art from the 20's through the 50's, a much better fit with the uptown art scene than with the avant garde art in SoHo. But SoHo space was $16 a square foot and rents on 57th Street were triple that.
Not anymore. Next month Mr. Snyder will move into 2,000 square feet at 20 West 57th Street, a building just off Fifth Avenue that has several galleries carrying traditional art. And he is paying less than $30 a foot. 
 "We did O.K. in SoHo, but a gallery like ours fits better uptown," he said. "And rents have come down so tremendously that we can finally afford to be there."
Mr. Snyder is not alone. Brokers report that in the last six months dozens of galleries have been opening or expanding, particularly in the historically art-rich 57th Street corridor between Park Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, and in the town houses off Madison Avenue in the 70's.
"In the last six months we've made 10 or 15 gallery deals," said E. William Judson, the president of Judson Realty, a brokerage firm that many galleries use. "There's so much activity that space on upper Madison Avenue is actually getting tight."
Other brokers make similar reports. "I did no gallery transactions at all in the last couple of years," said Robert L. Freedman, a vice chairman of Williams Real Estate. "Now I'm handling two expansions."
It is quite a change from the way this decade started out. Indeed, if misery truly likes company, then real estate people probably spent a lot of time hobnobbing with art dealers over the last few years. The real estate market was ailing, but the art market was virtually dead. Many galleries closed their doors as their owners either left the art world or handled their dwindling business from their homes. Many of those that hung in did so only by negotiating slashed rents with their landlords.
Now, thanks to the recovering economy, the seemingly moribund art world is showing a pulse. "The art market in America is really picking up, and all this moving around is just one sign of it," said Gilbert S. Edelson, a vice president of the Manhattan-based Art Dealers Association of America.
Indeed, the art market is looking so promising that many first-timers are opening dealerships. Ian G. Kennedy and Simon Dickinson, both long-time executives at Christies Fine Art Auctioneers, recently opened Simon Dickinson Inc., a gallery specializing in old masters. Mr. Dickinson is handling the London end of the business; Mr. Kennedy has leased space at 14 East 73d Street.
Similarly, last fall James Reinish resigned from the venerable art dealership Hirschl & Adler to join Martha Parrish, another Hirschl & Adler veteran, in a new gallery. For a time they operated out of Ms. Parrish's 600-square-foot office at 790 Madison Avenue, near 67th Street. In July, they moved into 1,400 square feet at 25 East 73d Street.
"We wouldn't have moved if the art market hadn't been doing well," Mr. Reinish said.
For buildings that specialize in art gallery tenants, the change comes not a moment too soon. With more than a third of its space devoted to galleries, the Fuller Building -- 595 Madison, at 57th Street -- is the art industry's uptown fulcrum. The building started the year more than a quarter vacant. Today it has plenty of office space available, but its gallery space is disappearing fast.
"We can pretty much rent any galleries that become available now, and that certainly wasn't true two years ago," said Thomas T. Garden, a vice president of LaSalle Partners and the building's leasing agent.
NEARBY buildings are trying to capitalize on the art market's rebound. A couple of years ago the Crown Building, 730 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street, lost a tenant that had occupied 100,000 square feet at the base. The space has high ceilings and a long, deep layout. To most office tenants, that means a dearth of windows and corner offices; to galleries, it means lots of wall-display space and controllable lighting.
The building's owners courted gallery tenants, at first to no avail. But in the last year Israel Sack, the antiques dealer, has taken 11,000 square feet and the Kennedy Galleries have leased about 8,600, both gargantuan deals by art gallery standards. Kenneth Krasnow, a broker at Cushman & Wakefield who handles leasing for the building, says he is negotiating several more gallery leases.
"Until recently, you couldn't get a gallery owner to listen to what you have to say," Mr. Krasnow said. "Now many are so confident of their future that they are rushing to move while rents are still reasonable."
That mentality is not confined to 57th Street. For several years, Bonni Benrubi ran her photography dealership out of an office on East 74th Street and had hankered to open a public space. This year she finally did it.
"My market has gotten very strong, but the rents are still affordable," said Ms. Benrubi, who recently leased 1,800 square feet of gallery space at 52 East 76th Street.
In a sense, art galleries are a landlord's delight. Most are happy with low floor space that corporations often spurn, or space in town houses that are too noncorporate for most commercial tenants. They rarely expect rich landlord contributions to improving their space, even though some of them install expensive millwork, ceiling effects and the like. Since the galleries thrive on unpartitioned rooms, landlords can generally rerent the space to another gallery if the first one leaves, without making many changes.
And even with the lower concessions, art galleries will often pay higher rents than commercial tenants. Mr. Judson says that gallery space on 57th Street is going for $25 to $35 a square foot. That's lower than the $40 to $50 such space commanded five years ago, but half again as much as SoHo gallery space is commanding. And it is a nice sum for landlords awash in small spaces, and more than most office tenants would pay.
In industry-concentrated buildings like the Fuller Building, rents are even richer. Mr. Garden says he is asking from the mid-$30's to $40 a square foot for gallery space, and tenant representatives say he is achieving those rent levels.
"Galleries pay a premium to be clustered together," said Mr. Freedman of Williams.
UNLIKE, say, supermarkets, which want to distance themselves from competition, galleries have a symbiotic relationship with their rivals. Potential customers are far more likely to plan a buying trip if they can visit several galleries selling similar genres without wasting too much time traveling. In fact, some dealers are teaming up, not only to share the rental expense of a gallery, but also to give would-be buyers a chance at one-stop shopping.
Adam Boxer had been operating a by-appointment-only business selling avant garde photography out of his Brooklyn home. He wasn't going broke, but he certainly wasn't getting throngs of visitors. The Brooklyn location was part of the problem; dealing from home was the other part.
"Somehow, people feel they are intruding when they are in your home, so they feel obligated to buy something," Mr. Boxer said. "Because they hate that sense of obligation, many just don't come at all."
So this year Mr. Boxer joined with three other art dealers. One had closed her gallery a year ago because of the economy, another wanted to try her hand at art, the third has another gallery on 18th Street. Together, they formed the Ubu Gallery, which will officially open later this month at 16 East 78th Street.
"Many of our European clients stay at the Mark Hotel a block away, and many of our New York clients live on the upper East Side," Mr. Boxer said. "We want people to feel comfortable dropping by, maybe to sit in our garden, maybe just to browse."
The supply of well-located and well-appoiinted gallery spaces is dwindling fast. Brokers and art dealers alike report that, aside from space in large 57th Street office buildings, good uptown gallery space is getting harder to find.
Mr. Kennedy discovered that when he went hunting for space this year. One of the first places he saw was the fourth floor of 14 East 73d Street. The space had nice views and a spiral staircase that can accommodate large canvases. But Mr. Kennedy wanted to hold out for higher ceilings.
"Everyone said this was a buyer's market, that it would be easy to find exactly what we wanted," he said. "Well, we looked and looked, and there really isn't a lot of space available for our needs." He took the 73rd Street space.

GALAPAGOS NATURE
Fifty of Katie Lee's illustrations of the flora and fauna of the Galapagos Islands, soon to be published in "A Visit to Galapagos" (Abrams, New York) go on display at the Silo in New Milford today through Oct. 2.
They are remarkable studies in gouache and pen and ink, depicting every last whisker, feather and scale in clinical detail, yet elegant, artful and emotionally compelling. Not only do they hold the attention of the viewer far longer than most paintings do, but they also evoke a welter of thoughts about the world's wildlife, which is what Ms. Lee had in mind. Conveying respect for all of the planet's creatures and plants is her mission. 
 The exhibition also contains paintings of butterflies, flowers and other subjects that she found on trips to Brazil, Venezuela and the Amazon. Her work has been shown in England and Australia, as well as the United States, and has been commissioned for educational television programs and by institutions such as the Smithsonian. A public reception for the artist is to be held next Sunday from 1 to 3 P.M. The Silo, at 44 Upland Road, is open every day from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. free of charge. Call 355-0300 for more information.
 
ILLNESS AND DRAMA
 Something a little different is in store for theatergoers who attend the Second Step Players' production of "Postcards From the Ledge: A Relevant and Irreverent Look at Mental Illness." Performances will be given at 7 P.M. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday at the Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theater Center in Waterford. Second Step Players, based in Norwich, is composed of artists and production personnel who have received diagnoses of mental illnesses.
A certain nuttiness is not unusual in the theater under any circumstances, and this troupe extrapolates on that premise with cheerful abandon. The show is loud, funny, oddball and touching in its exploration of what it means to be crazy in America. In one segment the future of managed health care is raked over the cuckoo's nest at the Mental Health Depot, Your Psychological Superstore. There is group therapy for bikers, and a fashion scoop on what the sartorially correct manic-depressive will wear next season.
Tickets are $14 at the door, $12 in advance, and for people who are under treatment for mental disorders, $10. The theater is at 305 Great Neck Road and the number for reservations or more information is 443-1238.
 
MORE BOGOSIAN
 Eric Bogosian -- the actor, writer, social critic, satirist and humorist who brought us "Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll" -- has a new one-man show called "Pounding Nails in the Floor With My Forehead." It will arrive at the Yale University Theater, 222 York Street in New Haven, on Saturday for two performances, at 7 and 9:30 P.M.
The piece, directed by Mr. Bogosian's wife, Jo Bonney, won an Obie this year for excellence in writing. Mr. Bogosian has been riding a wave of success that began with "Drinking in America" and "Talk Radio," which was made into a film by Oliver Stone. "Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll" was also adapted for the screen, and directed by John McNaughton.
"Suburbia," Mr. Bogosian's most recent play, opened at Lincoln Center last spring to enthusiastic reviews. "The Essential Bogosian," a collection of his work, was recently published by the Theater Communications Group.
"Pounding Nails" is a series of portrayals of men searching for "the baby within," timid men recovering from the women's movement, men fearing deadly disease, and men who obsess about anything and everything. But as Bogosian fans know, the portrayals, while slashing and burning contemporary society, are as hilarious as they are accurate.
Tickets are $21, students $11. Call 432-1234 for reservations or more information.
 
TALKING ANTIQUES
 As a lecture title, "You're Richer Than You Think" certainly gets one's attention. Henry Callan, a well-known appraiser of antiques, will deliver a talk by that name at 9 A.M. on Saturday during the 19th annual Putnam Cottage Antiques Show in Greenwich.
Mr. Callan has collected antiques since he was 12 years old, and over the years he has also collected master's degrees in history, theology and library science. He has taught school, lived in France and sailed around the world.
Culled from all this experience is a keen eye for the worth of things and which ones appreciate over time as opposed to those that do not. Inflation, he believes, has increased the worth of many people's possessions more than they realize, and he will give advice on how to appraise what you have, how to protect it, when and how to sell, and how to invest more wisely.
The lecture and antiques show are to be held at the Old Greenwich Civic Center on Harding Road from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday and 11 to 5 on Sunday. Nearly 60 dealers will display 18th- and 19th-century furnishings, paintings, prints, china, crystal, silver, jewelry and other items.
A china and glass restoration clinic will be available for consultation and repairs, and Mr. Callan will give verbal appraisals during both days for $5 an item. Admission to the show is $5; admission to the show, lecture and light breakfast on Saturday is $10. Call 637-9708 for more information.
 
ROAD RALLIES
 Two road rallies are scheduled this month by the Fairfield County Sports Car Club, sanctioned by the New England Region Sports Car Club. The first, starting at 9:30 A.M. Saturday, will be a 135-mile run over paved and unpaved roads in northwestern Connecticut and southwestern Massachusetts.
Drivers may register and have their cars inspected for $25 from 7 to 9 P.M. Friday and from 8 to 9 A.M. Saturday at the Fairfield Inn, Hartford Airport, 2 Loten Drive in Windsor Locks, where the rally will start and finish. A rally seminar for new teams will be held at 8 P.M. on Friday.
The second rally, on Sept. 24, will be held in Rhode Island, starting at the shore in Misquamicut. To register or obtain more information call 489-6503.
 
FLORAL COMPETITION
 "A Floral Palette," a Garden Club of America flower show presented by the New London Garden Club and the Lyman Allyn Art Museum, will open at the museum on Friday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and continue on Saturday from 11 to 5. Competing floral arrangements will be placed in the museum's various galleries, complementing the paintings, sculpture or decorative arts on display.
A horticulture section will feature rooted plants, house plants, cut specimens, herbs and vegetables. An educational exhibit will depict the biodiversity of the Burnham Brook Preserve in Haddam. In addition, a slide-lecture on the restoration of Harkness Gardens and Mansion in Waterford will be given each day between 2 and 4 P.M.
Admission to the show will be $5, and admission to a preview party on Thursday from 6 to 8 P.M. will be $30 a person or $50 a couple. The museum is at 625 Williams Street in New London. Call 443-2545 for more information. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Community Colleges Gain Students and Some Respect

BYLINE: By JOHN McQUISTON 

 BODY:
OVER half of all freshmen entering public and private colleges across the country this fall are enrolled in community colleges, and at the top of the list are Nassau and Suffolk Community College.
"We're part of a national phenomenon that's occurred over the last two years," said John F. Cooper, the president of Suffolk Community College, which got its start 35 years ago in makeshift classrooms in Sachem Junior-Senior High School in Ronkonkoma. 
 "We're now the largest multi-campus college in the state, with more than 22,000 students, plus an additional 22,000 noncredit students," he said.
Nassau Community College, which held its first classes 35 years ago in the basement of the Nassau County Court House in Mineola, is also in the running for first place, with a total of 44,000 students, half noncredit.
 
Long Island's Largest
 From its campus in Garden City on the site of the old Mitchel Field Air Force Base, Nassau is the largest college on Long Island, according to Sean Fanelli, the college's president.
"There is no doubt that there's a growing trend. Students are making more and more use of community colleges as a means to prepare themselves for four-year institutions," Dr. Fanelli said. "When you compare the cost of tuition and the quality of education available at our community colleges, there is no contest."
"We're hoping the trend will help end one of Long Island's biggest exports, its students," Dr. Fanelli said. He was encouraged by the fact that 6,600 students -- one of every three college-bound students who graduated from high schools in Nassau in June -- were registered at Nassau Community College this fall.
"We've gone from a school of last resort for many students, to their first choice," Dr. Fanelli said.
A similar turnaround in attitudes occurred among high school graduates in Suffolk, Dr. Cooper said. "It's taken two or three generations, but we finally seem to have become legitimate."
"This is a change that's occurred nationwide," he said. "For the first time in the history of education in the United States, the community college is being accepted and people are discovering what it's all about."
Both Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fanelli attributed the change to a variety of reasons, with the cost of education topping the list.
With tuition and fees at both Nassau and Suffolk totaling about $2,000 a year, it remains the least expensive of all public and private colleges on the Island.
 
Numerous Changes
 The recession of the 1980's, the restructuring of the Long Island economy brought on by the end of the Cold War, and a rapid shift from defense-related manufacturing to a service economy, have had a heavy impact on family budgets and left less money available for education, educators say.
There has also been a demographic change in the population of Long Island, a shift reflected in the changing student enrollments at both Nassau and Suffolk Community College. Minority students, including African Americans, Asians, and Central and South American immigrants, make up more than a third of the student body.
"For those just entering our society, the community college remains an affordable path to become a part of our way of life," Dr. Fanelli said.
"More and more immigrants are arriving on Long Island from other countries, and for them to become productive citizens, they need an opportunity to educate themselves. We can provide that opportunity."
"We have a large campus and lots of flexibility in the courses that we offer," he said. "We also have a very talented faculty and a curriculum tied to career opportunities."
"For example, we have a nursing program that has a very strong enrollment of nearly 400 students, with placement in all local hospitals, that's envied nationwide," he said.
A variety of other health-related programs are also available at both Nassau and Suffolk colleges, primarily as a response to community demand.
Because of the shift away from military-related manufacturing at once-large employers like the Grumman Corporation, courses in engineering technology, tailored to the changing job market, are offered by both colleges to many older noncredit students.
"We're willing to set up classrooms almost any place where we are needed," Dr. Cooper said, noting that the college served more than the traditional two-year transfer student. Suffolk's main campus is in Selden, its western campus is in Brentwood and its eastern campus is in Riverhead.
The college opened a satellite facility, the Technicenter, in an industrial park in Hauppauge in 1985, designed specifically for business and industrial training.
 
Most Students Are Women
 The average age of a student at Suffolk is now 27, while at Nassau it is 26. And more than 60 percent of the students are now women, a complete turnaround from 20 years ago.
"As more and more women have emerged into the workplace, they have become aware of what's available to them, and that includes higher education," Dr. Cooper said. "It wasn't all that long ago that many people believed women ought not to go to college."
While both Nassau and Suffolk college are open to any high school graduate, it's now first come, first served.
"It's not as if we're turning anyone away, but if the classes are full -- and we like to keep a ratio of 21 students per class -- then those students who register late lose out," Dr. Fanelli said. "But if they look around, they'll no doubt still find something open to them."
The success of both colleges has, however, come at a price that lawmakers in both counties no longer seem willing to pay.
 
Critics Among Supervisors
 The Nassau County Board of Supervisors late last month grudgingly approved a $111 million dollar budget for the 1994-95 academic year for Nassau Community College, up from $107 million last year and nearly double the budget 10 years ago. But the supervisors said they would reject a proposed faculty contract unless the school made cuts totaling $850,000, or raised tuition by $100, a move that Dr. Fanelli said would "not be fair to the students."
"Over the last four years, the student share has gone up and up, but the county's share has stayed the same," Dr. Fanelli said.
Suffolk and Nassau Community were established under the provisions of the New York State Education Law. They operate under the policies of the Board of Regents and the supervision of the State University of New York.
According to the education law, the financing of a community college is to be divided into three parts, with a third from the state, a third from the county or sponsor, and a third from tuition paid by students.
In both Nassau and Suffolk, the students' share in recent years has increased to between 32 percent and 33 percent, while the counties' share has dropped proportionately.
This and other cost increases have caused tuition to nearly double at both colleges over the last 10 years, but students believe it is still a good deal when compared to private college tuition.
Among the more vocal critics of the teachers' contract was Lewis J. Yevoli, supervisor of the Town of Oyster Bay. He said teaching salaries at Nassau averaged $76,000 a year and were higher than at Harvard or Yale.
"If the teachers' union is serious about entertaining thoughts for another contract, they're going to have to be prepared to give back more than they have," Mr. Yevoli said.
But the teachers' union said the supervisors were using the faculty as scapegoats, arguing that the school budget had not required a tax increase for Nassau voters in six years.
 
'A Slap in the Face'
 "To be blindsided like this at the last moment by the Board of Supervisors, which hasn't even taken a close look at the contract, is a slap in the face to collective bargaining," said Robert Karmon, a vice president and spokesman for the union.
The Suffolk County Legislature late last month approved Suffolk college's $84 million budget for the new school year, but not without first demanding job cuts totaling $900,000.
During a meeting on Aug. 26, trustees at the college agreed to half of the cuts by approving a job freeze on eight vacated positions. However, the trustees voted unanimously to restore 13 of the other job cuts -- all administrative positions.
To pay for the restored positions, the trustees ordered an organizational review of the college by Dec. 1 in hopes of coming up with a plan to save an additional $450,000. Since the salary of the average teacher at Suffolk is $49,100, the Legislature has been less critical after comparison with the teaching costs at Nassau.
The cost to the average property owner in Nassau County is currently $51.80, while the tax bill for a homeowner in Suffolk is $8.40. School administrators say the main reason for the difference is the higher cost for teachers at Nassau.
"But the majority of our teaching staff has been here far longer than the staff at Suffolk, which has had a greater turnover," said Dr. Fanelli, defending the high salaries at Nassau. "If we were talking about the salaries of doctors and lawyers, no one would complain. Why should the teaching profession be underpaid?"
"There are those who say, 'Well, it's just a two-year community college, why should its faculty be so well-paid?," Dr. Fanelli said. "That kind of thinking angers me."
"But I can understand that many taxpayers are now retired, that the population of the Island is aging and that many young people are moving out," Dr. Fanelli said. "But for about 10 cents a week, a taxpayer can invest in one of the great stabilizing forces in our society: education."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Signs of Stability Keep Sao Paulo Hot

BYLINE: By James Brooke 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
WITH one month to go before Brazil's presidential election, a centrist candidate has decisively overtaken his socialist opponent in all opinion polls, setting off a frenzy of investment and pushing Sao Paulo's stock index up 67 percent since the beginning of July.
This year, in fact, the Sao Paulo stock exchange has risen faster than any other exchange in North or South America, thanks in part to foreign investors who pumped $1 billion into the exchange in August alone. 
 Sao Paulo's market has been driven by opinion polls in the Oct. 3 presidential election. Back in May, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a socialist trade unionist, was leading in the polls with more backing than all other candidates combined. That month, the Sao Paulo index lingered at $10, the year's low point. (The index is valued for foreigners at the dollar exchange rate for a composite basket of stocks.)
By late August, when the polls showed Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a Social Democratic candidate of Brazil's establishment, far ahead of the other candidates, the Sao Paulo index reached a high of $23.
"The market clearly believes that Cardoso is the next President," concluded Wayne A. Perkins, vice president for equity investment of Chemical Bank's affiliate here, Banco Norchem S.A.
Behind Mr. Cardoso's surge in the polls is the short-term success of a new economic plan that he designed as Finance Minister before stepping down in April to run for president. On July 1, Brazilians adopted a new currency, the real. Backed by $42 billion in reserves and a precariously balanced federal budget, the real actually appreciated against the dollar. From even parity on July 1, the real now trades for 88 American cents.
At the same time, the real delivered a blow to inflation in an economy where prices rose by 5,000 percent in the year ending on July 1. Monthly inflation plummeted, from 50 percent in June to 5.5 percent in August.
"The election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the success of the real plan would be the best news of the decade for Latin America," Argentina's Economy Minister, Domingo F. Cavallo, said last Monday in Buenos Aires. With monetary stability, he predicted, Brazil will grow by 7 and 8 percent a year for the rest of the decade.
Once markets found the real credible, long-term credit returned to Brazilian stores. Manufacturers of goods like color televisions and motorcycles are operating at capacity, breaking production records.
"Market agents are operating with a future dollar below a real in February," said Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange, Bovespa. "This means a great success."
The combination of economic and political stability has been ambrosia to investors in emerging markets. Foreign participation accounted for 28 percent of Sao Paulo's market in August, up from 16 percent in June. Daily trading averages nearly doubled in August, rising from $258 million in the first week, to $493 million in the fourth week.
On Aug. 15, investors in the Sao Paulo market set a record for trading in one day, $2.38 billion. The following Monday, Aug. 22, investors set another record, for the number of transactions, 17,978.
"Before, people said, 'I won't invest in a country with 50 percent monthly inflation,' " recalled Roberto Serwaczak, director of sales and trading at Baring Securities do Brasil. "Then they said, 'I won't invest because of the political risk.' Now, inflation is down, and Cardoso is going to be elected."
Last September, Brazil's markets suffered a downturn as emerging market money managers sold millions of dollars in holdings to lock in profits. This year, market analysts predict that managers will hold on to their shares in anticipation of a continued rise after a Cardoso inauguration on Jan. 1. Even if Mr. Cardoso fails to win a majority of valid votes and the election goes into a second round on Nov. 15, all polls indicate that he will still win the presidency.
"The market is mirroring the growth of Cardoso in the polls," said Mr. Vidigal of the Sao Paulo market. "The market is acting as if he already has won." This is because investors see a Cardoso administration as offering continuity in the anti-inflation fight and an accelerated program to privatize Brazil's unwieldly state enterprises.
With privatization looking possible in 1995, analysts are recommending stocks in state-run telephone and electric power companies, like Telebras and Electrobras. Low inflation also means increased consumption of paper for packaging and cement for construction.
Some fund managers predict that a Cardoso victory would attract $5 billion more in foreign investment into Brazil's stock markets. From an opening to foreign investment in late 1991 to the middle of this year, net foreign investment in Brazil's markets rose to $10.5 billion.
Predictions are often difficult to make because of Brazil's history of volatility, .
"If there is an economic disaster, like a violent spurt of inflation, the markets will go through an earthquake," Veja, the nation's leading newsweekly, cautioned last week.
In early August, Baring Securities was recommending that investors "take profits in the short term," noting that the market looked overextended.
One week later, Baring was predicting that the index could hit $25. "With Cardoso's phenomenal rise in the polls and almost certain victory in November," it wrote, "Brazil is a BUY."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Confidence Dip Imperils Stocks And Clinton

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE American economy is growing at a nice clip. But public confidence is not. And because many do not think the future will be better than the present, both investors and Democrats may be in for disappointments.
The lack of optimism may seem puzzling. Since President Clinton's election, the number of people with jobs has grown by 4.7 million, or 4.2 percent. Not since Jimmy Carter has a presidential term begun by producing so many jobs. 
 The problem is that Americans are not at all confident that the recent past is prologue. On the job front, they are far less optimistic than they were just after the election. In December 1992, the Conference Board's monthly survey of consumer confidence found that 21 percent thought there would be more jobs available in six months. Now the figure is 13 percent.
Why the change? "A lot of the gains in employment have been in jobs at the low end of the pay spectrum or that don't have as much security," says Jason Bram, an economist at the Conference Board.
At a similar point in the first Reagan Administration, the economy was in recession, and employment was down 1.4 million since the election. But the three forecast questions asked by the Conference Board -- whether there would be more jobs and better business conditions in the economy, and whether the respondent expected higher earnings in six months -- got more positive replies then than they do now. Even in recession, the middle class then felt confident. Now, with white collar layoffs continuing, the Government deadlocked on health care reform and GATT ratification in jeopardy, the future seems less certain.
It is not just consumers who are fretting. Many on Wall Street see signs the economy is slowing. Those concerns probably are misplaced -- David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, notes that the seers wrongly feared weak fourth quarters in both 1992 and 1993 -- but for some purposes perception is reality.
The Conference Board has been surveying consumer sentiment since 1969, and has developed two indexes, one reflecting consumer views of the present situation, and one reflecting the future outlook. In forecasting, what matters is the relationship of the two indexes.
In August, for the first time since 1990, the future index slipped to a point where it is just under the current index. Historically, if it falls to at least a nine-point difference, the stock market suffers. That happened, for example, in September 1987.
In addition, the relationship of the two indexes at the time of mid-term elections has forecast the coming presidential race. If the future looked better than the present, the incumbent party kept the presidency. And vice versa.
If those historic relationships are believed, it poses an interesting dilemma for Wall Street Republicans, which is to say most of those on Wall Street. Should they hope that the mood will improve, providing a positive sign for stocks? Or that it won't, providing a negative sign for President Clinton?

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Merger Made in Heaven? For Now

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla 

 BODY:
IT WAS just hours after the engagement was announced, and the two executives conversed with all the deference and high hopes that are typical of the just-committed couple. "We both offered to step down" as chief executive officer, said Norman Augustine, C.E.O. of Martin Marietta, in an interview on Tuesday. Instead, an office of the chairman would be created to include both of them because, as every starry eyed couple can tell you, "two heads are better than one."
"If we don't (agree on things), Norm's the boss," offered Daniel Tellep, C.E.O. of Lockheed Corporation, which is merging with Mr. Augustine's company. 
 But from the sound of things, such a showdown might never be necessary. The two corporate cultures couldn't be more compatible, Mr. Tellep said, and the companies' technologies, products and services were most complementary.
Prospects frequently look rosiest to the key players when the romance of the deal is fresh. And last week, with heady deal-mania in full bloom all around them, who could blame the two executives for assuming that their companies would be, as they say, a perfect strategic fit?
Indeed, observers of the merger scene are bullish as can be about the prospects for success among Corporate America's latest unions. Equally certain to the merger bulls is that even more deals will ensue in the years ahead. "M&A feeds M&A," said Laurence S. Grafstein, a director at Wasserstein Perella & Company. "Big deals generate activity because they're usually not perfect fits," setting off further combinations.
But will most of them work?
To hear most people talk on the subject, the answer is yes, today's mergers can't lose. So-called strategic deals, in which two compatible corporations -- like Martin Marietta and Lockheed -- become one, make business sense, the argument goes. This is not the indulgent stuff of the late 1980's, where financiers took over and stripped companies to exploit (read: sell) their assets and move on to dismember the next victim.
These are deals that produce improved companies, the optimists argue. And because they largely are deals in which the two companies combine their stock, they lack the 1980's twist of burdening corporations with excessive debt. Or at least so far.
Samuel Hayes III, investment banking professor at Harvard Business School, said that, for the moment, the nation's banks are flush with money but are being choosy about whom they lend it to. "They're going for proven names with particularly convincing stories to tell about a restructuring," he said.
But with the merger movement "straining at the gate ready to pop out as soon as it finds an opening," Mr. Hayes figures that, sooner or later, the banks will lower their standards and begin to rationalize reasons for dicey loans.
Meanwhile, though, Wall Street is full of persuasive explanations that the deal craze is justified, and that it's sane. Leaving aside the question of how you pull off a sane craze, investment bankers say that the increasing pace of mergers is partly a function of pent-up demand during the recession, and partly a response to external factors, such as a gutting of the defense budget or the prospects of a national health care system. There is also the lure of becoming a behemoth, like Lockheed Martin or the combo of Federated and Macy, at a time when lower anti-trust barriers seem to make such mergers easier.
And companies are resorting to mergers because they've squeezed all they can out of their costs, and are aching to find a way to grow revenues at a time when they can't raise prices. "If unit growth is at the two-to-three percent level, and you want to jack that up, you can only do it through M&A," said Steven Wolitzer, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Lehman Brothers.
But companies are paying dearly for those revenues in some cases, raising the question of whether shareholders are getting their money's worth. "Companies are saying 'Holy cow, I've got institutional investors on my back because I'm not growing,' " said one investment banker who requested that his name not be used. "But prices are not cheap, and you may see some shareholders pay too much" for those revenues.
Along with their due diligence on how much is too much to pay for revenues, the firms tying the knot now had better take care to check one another for financially transmitted diseases. That doesn't just mean checking whether there is too much debt on the books, said Lawrence A. Cunningham, a professor at Cardozo Law School. Because of the losses some companies have suffered from their use of financial instruments know as derivatives, Mr. Cunningham said that merger partners should carefully examine any hedging strategies.
Analyzing what's on the books, while perhaps not easy, is at least a more scientific process than that of assessing whether two cultures can mesh -- the big wild card of the mergers boom of 1994. "Whether a specific deal makes sense depends partially on whether personalities can work," said Robert Lessin, vice chairman in charge of investment banking at Smith Barney. "At the end of the day, there is an expectation in these deals that personalities can mesh."
How often does it work? Reflecting a far more pessimistic outlook than most of his peers on Wall Street, Hamilton E. James, chairman of DLJ Merchant Banking, said his guess is that merging companies attain all their synergistic goals about ten percent of the time. Executives in the merger mode aren't much different from the soon-to-be-married man and woman who couldn't imagine they might one day be an entry in the nation's grim divorce statistics, Mr. James said. "Everyone thinks 'It won't happen to me,' " he said. But the stars can vanish from a C.E.O.'s eyes too. And shareholders can be left wondering why the magical synergies that were to have made them richer never quite gelled.

THE ECONOMY
 
The Economy Cools as It Coasts Into Labor Day
In the last flurry of statistics before Labor Day forces everyone to start acting like a grown-up again, the economy is looking pretty much as it has for a while now: it's slowing, but not too much. Consumer confidence eased for the second month in August, and the housing market is still heading down -- as people kick themselves for missing those rock-bottom mortgage rates. As for the unemployment rate, it's coasting along at 6.1 percent -- about where it's been for four months after plunging early in the year. But the slowing trend showed up in a report that just 179,000 payroll jobs were added in August -- fewer than expected. And inflation? Nowhere on the horizon: average hourly earnings rose just 2 cents last month -- nothing to set off a spending spree. Given all this, it seems unlikely that the Federal Reserve will feel the need to raise interest rates again at its policy meeting this month. But you never know. 

Scalper's Price for the Garden?
The folks with calculators decided Madison Square Garden was worth $600 million to $800 million, but Cablevision wanted it badly, so when the smoke from a high-priced bidding war cleared last Sunday, the price to be paid by an ITT-Cablevision partnership had hit $1.075 billion. In cash. For Viacom, which got the Garden as part of its Paramount purchase, that'll make a welcome dent in its debt. But why was Cablevision so eager? Simple: It craves New York sports. It will now own the Knicks and Rangers, plus the cable rights to the Mets and Yankees and sundry other teams -- such a stranglehold on the market, in fact, that New York's Attorney General, G. Oliver Koppell, raised antitrust eyebrows.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Irish Stocks Are Smiling
What's a body to do when, after 25 bloody years, hopes of peace burst forth in Northern Ireland? Some surely raised a toast in the local pub last week, while others -- the type who see a sunset and want to know the investment angle -- found at least one way to put their money where their hearts were. Shares in the Irish Investment Fund, a closed-end fund that has nearly 95 percent of its assets in Irish common stocks, shot up on word of the I.R.A. cease-fire, with daily volume jumping above 100,000 from the usual 15,000 or so.
 
Visiting China, Seeing a Market
When Commerce Secretary Ron Brown traveled to China last week, he added weight to his visit -- a push for "commercial diplomacy" -- by asking 24 American chief executives to tag along. Those executives were properly awed, both by the huge market they saw and by the huge tasks ahead. "This is the largest power market in the world," said one utility executive. But as another put it, "If there is one thing we have learned, it's that the Chinese don't move fast on anything." As the visit ended, Mr. Brown reiterated his theme that he wanted to get going on building commercial ties between the two nations.
 
Times Square on a Diet
You don't think of Times Square as a low-cal sort of place. Everything's big, overdone, high in artery-clogging glitz. And while smoking is practically an endangered pastime, there above the boulevard Joe Camel puffs merrily away. But wait: Joe Camel's gone. (The billboard had served its purpose, R.J. Reynolds said; its removal last week was unrelated to assertions that it enticed children to smoke.) In its place is a very different message, in giant letters: "Cut Fat Intake and Live Longer!" It is a celebration of new nutrition labels by a man named Phil Sokolof, who had once needled fast-food chains for their cholesterol-laden offerings and who now, in addition to renting the billboard for two months, is offering $1 million in a supermarket sweepstakes.
 
A Million-Dollar Leer
Sexual harassment is no big deal. What are a few lewd remarks, the occasional groping, as long as the almighty dollars flow in? At worst, a wrist will be slapped, a few pennies paid. . . . Yes, some people still believe that (probably male people), but they got an ear-splitting wake-up call last week. A former secretary at Baker & McKenzie, the world's largest law firm, was awarded $7.1 million in punitive damages after asserting that a Baker partner had harassed her and that the firm had turned a tolerant eye. It was a staggering sum -- twice what even the woman's lawyer had sought. But as one juror put it, "When you get religion, you should tithe" -- so the jury figured 10 percent of the firm's capital was about right. Now that's a message.
 
Making Sure Directors Care
This is the way it's usually done: a company hands a director a check -- $50,000 or $100,000 a year, say -- and even if the stock disintegrates, that check is good. But Scott Paper had a different idea (well, Travelers had it first): give board members a solid, pocketbook reason to care what happens to a company. Last week Scott said it would give outside directors 1,000 shares a year, period. No fees, no bonuses, no options, no perks. At the news, the stock jumped more than $2 and now stands at $65.50, up from $37.25 since April.
 
COMPANIES
 
Pair of Networks for Sale
In television land, nothing is forever -- or even for very long. A year ago, cable was king and networks the beggars. But price controls have trimmed cable's sails, while those geriatric networks are moving more briskly. So last week there was talk of two deals in the works: Time Warner in talks to buy NBC, Disney looking fondly at CBS. Both deals seem naturals, for NBC has disappointed its owner, General Electric, while it's clear that Lawrence Tisch is more than ready to get rid of CBS. And both Time Warner and Disney would love guaranteed programming outlets.
 
A Cup Too Hot
Many people agree that good coffee at the perfect temperature is, well, one of nature's wonders. And McDonald's, obsessed with giving people what they want, consistently, thought it had found that perfect temperature: 180 degrees. Perfect for drinking, maybe, but not for dumping on your lap -- all too likely in this meal-juggling age. That's hotter than most restaurants serve it, and can cause bad burns far more quickly. And a jury just awarded $2.9 million to an 81-year-old woman who'd scalded herself on McDonald's coffee. Absurd? Let the drinker beware? Perhaps. But the jury was convinced that in spite of previous scaldings, McDonald's didn't seem properly concerned. Pass the iced coffee.
 
The Survivor: Lockheed Martin
Forget those vague descriptions of the post-cold-war world. Here's what it really comes down to: a nation of Fritos and soft drinks. The Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger, announced last week, will create a company about the size of Pepsico. Not that it's a small deal: the $10 billion merger is the largest ever among military contractors. But in these "Darwinian times," as Martin Marietta's chairman put it, joining forces was the only way to survive. The Pentagon's shopping list is awfully short these days, and Lockheed Martin (the new name) will rely on the Government for 60 percent of its revenues. Does the deal raise antitrust issues? Of course. But economic realities may well outweigh them.
 
If Detroit's So Hot, Why Sell?
Times have rarely been better in the American auto industry; Detroit can barely get cars to dealers fast enough. So why would top officers of one of the Big Three be unloading stock? That's exactly what investors asked themselves on Wednesday when they heard that in late July 13 Chrysler vice presidents had sold nearly 150,000 shares -- more than a third of their holdings. Investors quickly dumped Chrysler stock -- and then G.M. and Ford. But maybe the summer bills were just piling up, or tuition was looming, for many analysts saw no end to the good times.
 
Galeries Lafayette Heads Home
Galeries Lafayette thought it could barge into the classiest shopping neighborhood in New York -- the corner of 57th and Fifth -- taking over the old Bonwit Teller site. But last week, less than three years later, it threw in the silk scarf, paid its landlord -- a fellow named Trump -- $20 million or so to get out of its 15-year lease, and started packing up. The verdict was that the store never quite found its market, that it didn't travel well -- that, basically, New Yorkers had plenty of places to buy similar stuff. So what's coming to that high-profile spot? Nike Town, described as a multimedia retail extravaganza. Not, presumably, just a place to buy sneakers.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Facing the Currency Risk Question

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
INVESTING overseas is a two-part equation: the stocks or bonds you bought must perform well, and so must the currencies of the country where they were issued.
This year has proved to be a good lesson in the second half of the equation. The currencies of Japan and Europe soared against the dollar, lifting the returns of mutual funds invested there that had not hedged currencies back to the dollar.
But when the dollar strengthens, unhedged funds could make money abroad in local market terms but lose when the profits are converted into dollars. Hedging would allow the same fund to earn the market return but would neutralize the currency component. 
 Currencies are "volatile and unpredictable," said Mark W. Headley, director of international investments for Litman/Gregory in San Francisco. But whether it pays to erase their impact from your portfolio "is a very gray area," he added.
Mutual fund managers fall into three camps. Some accept currency risk because currency movements cannot be predicted and hedging is a big distraction from picking equities or bonds. More important, some managers argue, currency movements are neutral over long periods.
A notable proponent of this view is Sir John Templeton, who started the Templeton group, which is now owned by Franklin.
"If you intend to keep stock 5 to 10 years," it won't matter whether currency goes up or down, because what you are buying is a share in a business," Sir John said, and what counts is the success of that business.
But even he has had second thoughts. Eight years ago when Sir John bought shares in Cifra, a large Mexican supermarket chain, he wavered in his conviction not to hedge, he said, because he thought Mexico's currency would fall. It did, but the price of groceries outpaced the peso's slide, "and in terms of American dollars, the stock price went up to 20 times what we had paid for it."
By contrast, Sir John does hedge short-term equity investments, which he defines as shares held less than five years, because currency volatility does not have sufficient time to play itself out.
As for fixed-income investments, "If you invest in bonds, you need to hedge because changes in the currency will change the value of the bonds," Sir John said. For example, because British bonds are denominated in pounds, the principal is repaid in that currency when the bonds mature in 10 or 20 years. If the pound is down against the dollar at payment time, investors will lose money.
Nearly all overseas bond funds hedge their investments. The sole exception is the T. Rowe Price Overseas Bond Fund, which normally has very little exposure to the dollar, making it the top-performing overseas bond fund -- down 1.7 percent in 1994 through July, compared with -5.5 percent for its group.
"If one hedges bonds all the time," said George A. Murnaghan, a vice president at Price, "you increase the correlation of overseas bonds to U.S. bonds, factoring out the currency potential and losing some diversification." Even so, the Price Overseas Bond Fund was hedged in 1992-93, up to its legal limit. "On the fixed-income side, hedging is a more complicated question than on the equity side," Mr. Murnaghan said.
Hedging is done with forward contracts or currency options. These have two costs: dealer expenses and premiums pegged to differences in short-term interest rates. The bigger the spread in interest rates between two countries, the bigger the premium; therefore, the more expensive it is to hedge.
Some equity fund managers like David Herro of Oakmark International accept currency risk unless there's a compelling reason not to. Mr. Herro has hedged since the fund's inception two years ago, for instance, because "the economic evidence suggests that the U.S. dollar is strongly undervalued."
To decide whether to hedge, Mr. Herro, a value investor, looks at the differential in short-term interest rates here and abroad, relative economic growth levels and "purchasing-power parity" differentials (the costs of similar goods in various countries).
His analysis was muddled this year as the dollar fell, hurting the fund's performance. He recovered somewhat in mid-July as the dollar firmed, but Oakmark International is still down 1.5 percent through July, compared with +1.5 percent for all foreign stock funds.
The third camp, which includes some excellent fund managers, can't decide whether hedging pays off. "Very mixed feelings," is the way Jean-Marie Eveillard, who runs Sogen International and Sogen Overseas, describes his current position.
Mr. Eveillard, who did not hedge currencies for 14 years, began just over a year ago, as he increased his exposure to foreign equities. "It's one thing if the portfolio is 10 to 15 percent invested abroad, but something else if it's 25 to 30 percent, particularly in Europe," where currencies are not pegged to the dollar. (Many Latin American and Asian currencies are dollar-linked, making hedging unimportant except during turmoil when the link might break down.)
In fact, academic studies show that currency swings have little impact on performance when overseas investments account for less than 10 percent of a portfolio.
So Mr. Eveillard hedged two-thirds of his exposure to European currencies and "at least since the beginning of this year, that's been wrong," he said. The portfolio is still hedged, "probably," he said, "because of sheer inertia."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Siberia Awaits the Onslaught

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: YAKUTSK, Russia

 BODY:
TO a traveler flying in the wake of the turbulent Lena River as it snakes deep into the richest forests of Siberia, the wilderness looks vast, utterly untouched. It must be one of the last places on earth where it is possible to race above the tree tops for hours without seeing anything made by man.
Bear, tigers, sable and wolves roam free here. The physical treasures in the region -- 5 million square miles if one measures from the Urals to the Far East -- are unparalleled, and to many eyes, so is its harsh beauty. 
 But if no place in Russia -- or the world -- is bigger or less developed than Siberia, perhaps no place is under greater threat from oil companies, timber concerns, industrial combines and mining outfits.
Siberia has been Russia's great cash cow for more than 300 years, since Westerners started shipping pelts out of here by the boatload. As diverse as it is large, Siberia has long provided Russia with almost 20 percent of the world's gold and silver, more than a third of its iron and almost that much of its timber.
The exploitation has only deepened over the decades, partly because Siberia has so much to offer and partly because it is almost impossible to grasp how much of it there is. Almost every tropical rain forest in the world could fit within the 2.3 million square miles of forest land in the Russian Far East alone. In Lake Baikal, Siberia doesn't just have the world's largest and deepest lake, but a body bigger than Belgium that holds more than 20 percent of all the fresh water on earth. If the promise of a place this rich has always astounded naturalists, however, it has also caused industrialists to tremble in anticipation.
"This place could become the greatest environmental disaster area ever created by man," said Mark M. Shatz, deputy director of the Permafrost Institute here, which studies the fragile ecology of the massive layer of ice that lies beneath most of Siberia. "The only thing that is saving Siberia right now is we are too big to destroy very easily and Russia is too poor to rip it apart. But they are trying as hard as they can."
There is not much argument on that point. The they he is talking about -- Japanese eager for timber, Americans hungry for oil and Russians thrilled to sell it all to them -- have swarmed across the taiga in search of its great riches. Few people talk about the consequences for the environment. Mining methods most people discarded in the days of the California gold rush are in vogue here: tens of thousands of acres of topsoil have been ruined by methods that rake the earth until it spits out diamonds, gold or silver.
That causes erosion, pollutes rivers and makes land unstable. And in the north -- where the ecosystem is so fragile that it can take 40 years for a birch to grow 10 feet high -- it is particularly devastating.
But mining techniques aren't the only problem. From the fisheries of Magadan to the logging camps outside Khabarovsk, from Mirnyi, where diamonds are as plentiful as anywhere on earth, to the oil fields of western Siberia, which holds almost 20 percent of the world's hydrocarbon reserves, Siberia is slowly being ravaged by developers who have neither laws, regulations nor popular opposition to hold them back.
Oil drilling technology is primitive. There are virtually no safeguards to detect leaks. Millions of trees have been hacked away in places where they are needed most for preservation of the soil and protection of the rivers. Land is wasted on a scale that is hard to comprehend.
 
Patrimony for Sale
 There is little publicity about environmental hazards. Russia has no Environmental Protection Agency, no Occupational Health and Safety Administration, no Bureau of Land Management. If zoning laws did exist they certainly wouldn't mean much in Siberia. Advocates, however vociferous, are often poorly trained, separated by thousands of miles, and rarely effective.
The Government is desperate to earn hard currency, and nowhere can it do that more effectively. Siberia, home to 18 percent of the nation's people, produces nearly 70 percent of its hard currency export earnings.
And the easiest way for Russia to earn money in Siberia is to dig it out of the ground or chop it down. There is always a tension between jobs and the environment -- particularly in ecologically sensitive areas. But there is no strong voice to protect the snail darters and the spotted owls of this country.
Dozens of endangered species are put in greater peril every year on the taiga, the sensitive belt of thinly forested land between the arctic permafrost and the sturdy forests of the more temperate south. When anyone does speak up, he or she is usually drowned out by pleas for the money, money that they hope will appear once Hyundai or Weyerhauser provide new jobs.
"This part of Russia has been in a depression for a very long time," said Aleksei N. Makhinov, director of the Institute of Water and Ecological Problems at the Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Khabarovsk. "People will sell anything they can for security. The forests, the animals, the fish in the sea. Its all money now, and there just aren't many people who want to talk about the consequences."
 
And Now for the Good News
 The only good news for the environment is bad news from other perspectives: the economic problems that have beset the nation since the Soviet Union died are so severe that rapacious development has actually slowed. That has helped alleviate the threat to Lake Baikal, which only a few years ago was starting to feel the strong polluting effect of an enormous paper mill on its southern shores.
But the green light for development is on, and to some degree it has been for 20 years. Oil has invaded the lakes of western Siberia. Reindeer herds have been driven by man and development farther north than they have been in 100 years. Forests have been burned and gouged to make space for villages that were home to workers in oil towns and mining villages. Many of those villages are dying now, thanks to a lack of money from Moscow to finance their endeavors. But no matter how many people leave, their departures don't bring the trees back.
And environmental officials from Moscow to Magadan agree that it won't be easy to fashion a practical safety mechanism for Siberia -- not when there are so few good environmental laws on the books. And when a large company shows up offering jobs to workers who have not been paid in months, it is unrealistic to expect them to put their pristine environment first.
"We want to do it right," said Nikolai T. Yakouba, general director of Russian Far East and Siberian Trade for JK International, an American timber company. "But we can't exactly go in and construct American standard safeguards when competitors are doing things at a third of the price. And we can't be a timber company and stay out of the biggest market on earth. So tell me, how would you protect Siberia?"

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Taking Sausage;
The Art of Reprocessing the Democratic Process

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ALREADY, some pundits and politicians are weaving a tidy narrative around the collapse of health care reform. The Clinton Administration overreached, they say. After a long and vigorous debate about the Clinton plan, people gradually turned away from the idea of a comprehensive overhaul and Congress responded to their will. The Framers, in other words, would be pleased; the system worked.
But there is another case to be made: That the system was simply overwhelmed by millions of dollars worth of lobbying, polling and advertising. That it was whipsawed by two years of strategizing and manipulation by the top consultants and theoreticians in both parties. That Americans were taken on an emotional, 18-month journey that produced not a new consensus but an exhausted paralysis -- and is likely to feed their already corrosive cynicism toward their government. 
 In short, there is substantial evidence that the deadlock on health care is a monument not to the Framers' system, but to what we have done to it: a harrowing example of what happens when the tools, techniques and philosophy of the modern campaign are brought to bear on the policy-making process.
Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who tracked the health care issue for NBC and The Wall Street Journal, said: "The worst of the process worked. Yes, there was a dialogue, but it was so influenced and affected by the special interest groups that the public didn't get a true and honest debate. What they learned is everything they had to fear -- and very little about what they could hope for."
Bob Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health at Harvard, said the public still wants to do something about the faults and failings of the health care system. They grew wary of the Clinton plan, he said, and worried that Congress was rushing to slap together a new one. "But what they say in all the polls is, 'We want an alternative plan, less threatening, less bureacuractic, but still a major plan,' " Mr. Blendon added.
They might not get it. Congressional leaders say they still hope to find a modest, scaled-back alternative when they return after Labor Day. But when policy-making is played out by the rules of modern politics, as the health care struggle has been from the start, it makes compromise -- especially bipartisan compromise -- very hard to reach.
This is hardly the first time that a public policy dispute spilled out of the Capitol and into the venues ordinarily used for election campaigns. The fight over Medicare in 1965, and over President Harry Truman's proposal for national health insurance in 1949, prompted a wave of leafletting and advertising. The fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement had the feel of a campaign. But campaign technique keeps developing, in a kind of arms race, and rarely has there been a more avid group of practitioners than there was in the health care struggle of 1993-94.
Modern politics exalts the grass roots, so interest groups spent $50 million in advertising to cultivate "grass-roots" sentiment, much of it simply to raise fears about the risks of various plans. A study by Darrell M. West and Diane J. Heith, political scientists at Brown University, estimated that "groups opposed to the Clinton program outspent those that favored it by a 4-to-1 ratio in the advertising area." They concluded that "the one-sided nature of the ad expenditures had important consequences for the health care debate."
Modern politics also reveres the lawmaker who is quiveringly sensitive to the folks back home, so the best-organized interests -- like the National Federation of Independent Business, which targeted small businesses in numerous Congressional districts -- have become as powerful as any committee chairmen searching for a compromise.
Modern politics is prefaced on the idea that taxpayers are fundamentally tax-averse, so all the efforts to achieve a major expansion of coverage have been stymied by the fact that almost no one will propose a broad-based tax increase to pay for it. "Rather than educating our constituents about the tough choices, too many politicians in both parties are once again pandering to them -- promising the impossible and then feigning shock when the Congressional Budget Office inevitably weighs in with the painful truth," Representative Dan Rostenkowski wrote not long ago.
"The fact is, if we want more Americans to have better insurance, we're all going to have to pay for it," the Illinois Democrat added.
More than anything, modern politics never goes off campaign footing, which has proven to be particularly damaging to the prospects for health care legislation. Republicans note -- correctly -- that even before the Clinton Administration had a health care package, it had a deeply political strategy to sell the plan, and allies touting it in partisan terms. William Kristol, a strategist for conservative Republicans, asserted in an interview: "That authorized the use of political means to oppose their campaign. And in some respects, it delegitimized them."
The stakes for each party -- as a party -- became very clear very fast. Democratic strategists were telling lawmakers that a health care bill was critical to their re-election efforts; a much-circulated memo by Mr. Kristol in December warned Republicans that passage of the Clinton plan "will revive the reputation of the party that spends and regulates, the Democrats, as the generous protector of middle-class interests."
The news media slipped into the campaign mode as well, said Tom Patterson, a politial scientist at Syracuse University. Much of the coverage focused on whether Mr. Clinton was winning or losing, "as opposed to the merits of health care reform," he said.
The debate, by midsummer, was unrelentingly partisan, evocative of the last days of the 1988 Presidential campaign -- not fertile soil for a bipartisan deal. There are those, of course, who argue that it was a healthy debate, particularly if the alternative is the smoke-filled room. "The alternative to a political debate that engages the public is an interest group-dominated, behind-closed-doors Congressional process of making deals," Mr. Kristol said.
And it can be stipulated that change of this scale is inherently hard. Joseph A. Califano Jr., who lived through the successful effort to pass Medicare in 1965, noted that Lyndon Johnson had just won re-election with 61 percent of the vote, had a 68-vote Democratic majority in the Senate, had Everett Dirksen as the Republican leader and was himself "probably the most effective legislator we've ever had." Even so, Mr. Califano said, "we had to give the doctors and hospitals what they wanted to get it passed."
Still, Mr. Califano said, "the climate is much more partisan today, and the lobbyists are richer and more sophisticated." He added that in 1965, "there was a great deal of confidence in the capacity of government to do something."
 
The Atwater Doctrine
 Today, the public reflects a 30-year trend of lost faith in government. The consultants and the politicians -- and Mr. Patterson would add the press -- responded to that cynicism in the health care struggle and in many instances fed it, as they have in one campaign after another in recent years. "The American poeple are cynical and turned off about all the institutions, and politics is only one of them," said Lee Atwater, the late Republican consultant, arguably the most influential of his era, in an interview in February 1990. "Bull permeates everything."
Now the voters have something else to be cynical about: a two-year-long, fiercely partisan, bitterly divisive campaign that has ended -- at least so far -- in a confusing deadlock. "We had to overcome the fear of change and I think we were unable to do that," an Administration official said sadly this week. While people "intuitively know" that they are being victimized in the current system, the official said, "they're very fearful of government and very fearful of change."
Of course, the problems in the health care system remain: the 39 million who are uninsured, the gaps in coverage for millions of others, the costs that consume a greater and greater share of the Federal budget and the gross domestic product. There are still legislators on Capitol Hill who remember this. In the tactical din of the modern campaign, it is easy to lose sight of the reality outside.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
How the Serbs' Serb Began To Look Like a Diplomat

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: POZAREVAC, Yugoslavia

 BODY:
FOR Bozidar Babic, a designer of window displays here in Slobodan Milosevic's home town, it is quite clear: the Serbian president has become a traitor by abandoning his brother Serbs in Bosnia.
"What President Milosevic has done amounts to an act of treachery," Mr. Babic said. "He has committed high treason by suddenly turning on the Serbs he supported. I have always voted for him, but now I really don't know if I would again." 
 The dismay of this solid citizen of Pozarevac, a provincial town east of Belgrade that is typical of the rural communities that have provided the bedrock of President Milosevic's support, underlines the political risk taken by the Serbian leader in denouncing the Bosnian Serb leadership as war profiteers and severing land and telephone links with the more than one million Serbs waging war west of the Drina River.
The risk is not immediate: President Milosevic's control of state television, the police and the army make his position secure. But it is profound: President Milosevic's near-mythical authority was tied to Serbian nationalist aspirations, his determination to back Serbs marooned in Croatia and Bosnia by the breakup of Yugoslavia, and his image as a man who does not bend. Now, it seems, he has blinked.
The change of heart has proved as perplexing to the international community as it has to the inhabitants of Pozarevac. Russia, apparently trusting the Serbian leader, wants to reward Mr. Milosevic immediately by easing trade sanctions. Opposed to the Clinton Administration's threat to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims next month, Russia sees its approach as an effective way to isolate the Bosnian Serbs permanently from their former patron and ultimately end the war.
But the Clinton Administration is suspicious and wants several hundred international monitors placed on Serbia's border with Bosnia before there is any talk of ending Serbia's isolation.
The debate is an important one. Reward the Serbian leader too quickly and he has begun to escape the world opprobrium linked to the war crimes of the Bosnian Serbs he armed and long supported; moreover, he may take his prize and resume discreet aid to the Bosnian Serbs' war effort. But rebuff his gesture, by maintaining the sanctions or setting politically unacceptable conditions for lifting them, and a potentially decisive turning-point in the Balkan conflict may be squandered.
Faced with this choice, Western diplomats in Belgrade have resumed their favorite game of trying to analyze the motives of the inscrutable and reclusive 53-year-old Mr. Milosevic, who cultivates the air of a deity by remaining largely invisible and offering rare pronouncements designed to carry the force of revelation.
In the most cynical view, Mr. Milosevic's decision to back the latest international peace plan for Bosnia -- and break with the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, for rejecting it -- was completely in character for a leader interested only in his own hold on power and now convinced that economic sanctions must be eased if the Serbian economy is to survive another winter.
"Serbian nationalism was never more than a means to an end for Milosevic, a way to satisfy his lust for power," said Milan Bozic, the dean of the mathematics department at Belgrade University and an opposition member of Parliament. "If he has to sacrifice 15,000 square kilometers of land for that power he will do so, because he is above all a brilliant apparatchik and tactician. Now, in time, he will simply crush Karadzic, as he had crushed others before him."
Other views are that the Serbian leader is merely maneuvering for short-term gains and that he will inevitably resume his drive for a "Greater Serbia." Or that he has never really been interested in "Greater Serbia" -- words he has never publicly pronounced -- but only in assuring that the large Serbian minority in Bosnia and the smaller one in Croatia secured adequate protection and political representation.
"It's simple," insisted Mihailo Markovic, a senior member of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist party. "Milosevic believes half of Bosnia is enough for the security of the Serbs in Bosnia, and that is all he has sought." The American-backed peace plan offers 51 percent of Bosnia to the Muslim-led Government and 49 percent to the Serbs.
But amid all the debate about the Serbian leader, a more fundamental issue appears to have been largely overlooked. It is that over the past two years, the Serbs of Serbia and those of Bosnia and Croatia have simply grown apart. Already divided by their histories, they have found themselves with less and less in common. In this sense, President Milosevic's decision was merely a reflection of the facts on the ground, and, as such, may prove durable.
During the Second World War, the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia bore the brunt of the genocidal assault on the Serbs by the puppet-Nazi Croatian Ustashi and later formed the initial backbone of Josip Broz Tito's Communist Partisan movement. Their unbending attachment to the land they now occupy and the often barbaric violence they have shown in defending it are linked directly to this memory and this trauma.
For Serbs in Serbia, the experience of the war was somewhat different, and many joined the royalist Chetnik movement, which clashed with the Partisans. Thus, even during the Second World War, Serb fought Serb.
The issues, of course, are different today. But it remains true that while many Serbs in Serbia may see a roughly 50-50 division of Bosnia as reasonable, the Bosnian Serbs react in a much more visceral way.
 
Growing Apart
 Moreover, their societies have been evolving differently over the past few years, with Mr. Karadzic stressing traditional Serbian values and the role of the Orthodox Church -- he has introduced compulsory religious teaching in schools -- and Mr. Milosevic retaining the traits of a Socialist and a secular man. Thus any "Greater Serbia" would almost certainly lead to a power battle between them over real ideological splits.
"When in history has a state willingly decided on a course of self-extinction?" asked Jovan Zametica, a close aide to Mr. Karadzic. "And yet, that is what Mr. Milosevic wanted to force on us. This will not be forgotten by the Serbs of Bosnia."
His remark underscored the fact that a profound rift has arisen, rooted in history and now exacerbated by the war. It therefore seems unlikely that Mr. Milosevic will reverse course, however much he has shifted in the past.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Reaching for the Stars in the New Military

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the 1960's, a hard-charging, freshly minted second lieutenant wanted to go to Southeast Asia to experience combat in the Vietnam War. In 1990 and 1991, commanders turned away many young officers who volunteered for action in the Persian Gulf region.
For generations of American warriors, there has never been much of a question: the essence of soldiering is fighting and winning. Officers have been willing, even eager, to put themselves in harm's way, because the surest route to high rank and regard has been to lead troops into battle. But today, in the absence of old-fashioned wars with clearly defined front lines, soldiers who have toiled largely in anonymity are coming to the fore to deal with many non-traditional missions, from combatting drug dealers to pulling riot-control duty. People mastering these skills can be well on their way to the general or admiral rank once largely reserved for the battlefield veterans. 
 The end of the cold war and a spate of peacekeeping and humanitarian missions have thrown open a new set of opportunity-filled fields in unlikely areas. The gulf war made famous an obscure Army logistician named Gus Pagonis, a major general who moved six million tons of equipment into the war zone. Logistics wizards, like those now building tent cities for Cuban boat people at Guantanamo Bay or hauling relief supplies to refugees in Rwanda, have been held in higher regard ever since.
The warriors of the future will also include computer nerds and intelligence geeks guiding troops on a digitized battlefield. Even the once-dreary acquisition corps has acquired cachet as Defense Secretary William J. Perry tries to streamline how the Pentagon buys $50 billion a year in weapons and parts. Suddenly, buying blankets and combat boots is a lot sexier.
 
Less Room for Missteps
 While opening doors in some fields, the cold war's demise has meant smaller forces and fewer opportunities over all. Career paths are more competitive for young officers who need to punch the right ticket at the right time in a system that is less straightforward and far less forgiving than it was a decade ago.
For instance, some young Navy and Marine Corps officers who were investigated in the Tailhook sexual-harassment scandal fell behind their peers, and even those who were cleared now face an uphill struggle. And with America's nuclear arsenal shrinking, officers who supervise missile silos under North Dakota wheat fields -- a prestige-filled mission a few years ago -- may be looking for work. "If you don't hit gates when they swing open, you may never get a chance to do it again," said one Navy commander, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. (Almost everyone interviewed insisted on anonymity to avoid violating a cardinal rule of rung-climbing: no self-aggrandizement in the press.)
Fast-trackers with their sights set on the Joint Chiefs of Staff will still come from the combat arms branches: armor, infantry and artillery in the Army and Marine Corps; submarines, carrier jets and warships in the Navy, and warplanes in the Air Force.
But what's hot and what's not in the military mirrors which branch of each service is on the cutting edge in war-fighting strategy. Because of the Battle of Midway in June 1942, ambitious young Navy people wanted carrier duty -- and indeed for decades carrier men rose to the top more than the brass from other naval branches. In the 1980's, American submariners who waged silent underwater duels with their Soviet counterparts rose to the top of the Navy's chain of command.
Bomber pilots dominated the senior ranks of the Air Force until Vietnam, when fighter jocks shoved them aside, seizing a stranglehold they still hold.
Since the Revolutionary War, the ticket to the top has been command of troops in the field. And if the officer is lucky enough for a good war to come along, all the better. "Command is still the ultimate test of an officer's abilities, and it's as important a factor as it's ever been," said Rear Adm. Patricia Tracey, the personnel director for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Leading troops in a popular war has always produced instant heroes. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf was counting down his final days in the Army at the United States Central Command in Tampa, Fla., a backwater post, when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
 
Soldier-Statesman Is Ideal
 Now, for the first time since Navy gunboats plied the rivers of Vietnam, young naval officers are getting a crack at early commands, this time in small patrol boats like those now helping enforce the economic embargo against Haiti.
The raft of relief and peacekeeping operations has upped the ante for soldier-statesmen. Lieut. Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marine Corps has conducted relief missions in Russia, Iraq and Somalia and is considered such a poster boy for peacekeeping that he testified before a House committee on the Rwanda operation.
In today's grudgingly politically correct military, an officer's record on opening opportunities for women also counts toward promotion. The new emphasis has opened new doors to women themselves -- ushering in female fighter pilots and warship officers. The new Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, notched his warrior stripes directing NATO operations in Bosnia. But he also won the top Navy job because of his progressive views on opening more combat jobs for women.
This attitude has yet to reach the Marine Corps and Army, where crusty generals perpetuate their self-selective club by freezing women out of the only three branches of the service that produce commandants and chiefs of staff: armor, artillery and infantry.
There is no magic formula to the top, a journey that typically alternates field assignments with desk jobs and military schooling. But officers say a few tips help to navigate the shoals of promotion boards.
Tip No. 1 -- Excel at the desk or in the field, but try to get field assignments as often as possible, from anti-drug operations in the Caribbean to peacekeeping duty in Macedonia, and earn command of troops early on. "With things so much more competitive now, there's no real time to grow into a new job," said Capt. Frank Dobrydney, the Navy's head of career-management policy. "You have to hit the deck running."
Tip No. 2 -- Angle for high-visibility staff jobs in major commands or at the Pentagon, where senior civilians as well as the military brass can see your work. Build political connections, a la Brent Scowcroft and Alexander Haig. In the Army and Navy, senior generals and admirals adopt promising young officers as their "sons" and "daughters" and help manage their careers. But avoid tying yourself too closely to one mentor.
Tip No. 3 -- When the time is right, earn a graduate degree and jockey for a position at one of the military colleges, preferably the National War College in Washington. Winning a White House fellowship, as Colin L. Powell did as a young lieutenant colonel, is a career booster. A tour on the military's Joint Staff, the administrative arm of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, helps enormously.
By the time an officer reaches general or admiral, politics and talent figure equally in promotions. It doesn't hurt to hitch your star to a top civilian. Adm. Paul David Miller, the commander of American forces in the Atlantic, leapfrogged over dozens of more senior admirals in the late 1980's when Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. tapped him as a favorite. It pays to have a little luck.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Diplomatic Question: Embargo or Embrace?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NO wonder foreign policy debates these days seem so dull and muddled. "Hawks" and "doves" are out. All anyone wants to know is whether you are an "embargoer" or an "embracer" -- whether you think the way to deal with Bosnia, China, Haiti, Iraq or Cuba is by embargoing them into better behavior or embracing them with trade and tourism until they evolve into good citizens.
But let's face it, it's hard to get excited about denouncing your opponent as a "lily-livered embracer," or as a "neo-conservative embargoer." When one school in a foreign policy debate sounds like an aftershave and the other sounds like a service offered by Fedex, you know you've got trouble. 
 Worse, nobody knows who's on anyone's side anymore. Each day the editorial pages bring a new surpise as the most unexpected people line up in the embargoer and embracer camps. Sigh. Whatever happened to the days when foreign policy was primarily about titanic issues like the use of force and the clash of values, and you could tell the players without badges reading: "Hi, My Name Is. . .and I Stand For. . .?"
Sure, force is still an option today, but no one wants to use it because nothing seems worth using it for, save possibly for nearby brushfires like Haiti. We now have foreign policy by calculator. Hence the constant refrain from American politicians: "How many American lives is Cuba worth?" "How many lives is North Korea worth?"
It has almost become comical, as with Friday's headline: "Pentagon Estimates It Will Cost $427 Million To Invade Haiti." There is no way anyone could know how much an invasion of another country is going to cost with such exactitude. What did they do, put it out for bid?
Such stories matter, though, when American interests in a region are so ambiguous, and the justification for sacrifice so unclear, that people hope a price tag will tell us what our strategists cannot: whether it's worth it. Also, there is something about a spreadsheet that gives the illusion that the uncertainties inherent in any invasion can really be controllable.
But the prospect of using force in Haiti is the exception. For now, American foreign policy seems to have been reduced to the same two options on virtually every issue. One is to impose economic sanctions -- as with Iraq, Serbia, Iran, Haiti, North Korea and Cuba -- and hope that over time these embargoes produce the sought-after political change, with little cost in American treasure and no cost in American blood.
The other is to hold our noses, opt for the embrace, as with China or Vietnam, and hope that by trading with these authoritarian countries, engaging them diplomatically and luring them into political and economic reforms that they will crumble from within.
Both sides point to the cold war as proof that they are right. The embargoers argue that economic sanctions enabled the Jews to leave the Soviet Union, drove the Soviets out of Afghanistan, forced the Vietnamese to adopt capitalism and will eventually bring Fidel Castro to his knees.
The embracers argue that it was actually the web of diplomatic, touristic and economic relations with the Communist world which set in motion reforms that leaders like Mikhail S. Gorbachev thought they could control but eventually consumed them. But policymakers advocating either approach have to know a lot more about the world -- particularly the inner workings of different countries and what happens when you connect the blue wires with the red wires. How would economic sanctions affect political reform in China? In the old days it was easy to be a lawyer or politician and become Secretary of State. The only question you had to ask about the world half the time was "Whose side are they on, ours or the Soviets'?"
 
It's All a Matter of Detail
 To conduct foreign policy today requires a much keener sense of history, an intuitive feel for the rhythms of certain societies and an instinct for what can go wrong when engineering the politics of someone else's country.
This is doubly true now when the main challenge for American foreign policy in many places is not to influence relations between states but rather to influence events within states. To solve the crises in Rwanda or Bosnia or Cuba means getting under the hoods of those countries and manipulating forces within them to produce certain political outcomes. Not only do American diplomats often lack the skill to do that, but they are woefully divided on what the outcomes should be.
In the cold war, everyone agreed that the goal was either to prevent Communists from winning or to oust them from power. Today, there is no agreed-upon purpose in intervening. Should America intervene in Bosnia to produce one multicultural state or a small collection of ethnically pure statelets? It is baffling questions like this which explain why in three years America has gone from the cold war to cold feet. Stanley Hoffmann, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University, calls it the "new humility" of American foreign policy.
This new humility seems to have affected what the public wants from its leaders. As the cold war was coming to a close there was a lot of talk about "the vision thing." A 45-year era was ending and people wanted to know what the future held, what it looked like on the other side of the hill. Well, now they know. It looks messy.
People don't seem to want vision anymore, in large part because they sense that no one has a vision that can encompass a contradictory world, a world that is simultaneously fragmenting politically and consolidating economically. What people seem to want most now is competence, or, more specifically, the ability to protect American interests and prestige in a world where each problem is uniquely difficult and requires a uniquely deft response.
Indeed, if one listens to the Republican critiques of the Clinton foreign policy, it is clear that they have no particular global vision, either. All they offer is a different style of pragmatism and the assertion that "we could manage better."
So the American people find that they are no longer choosing between great architects or ideologues on foreign policy. They are choosing between managers. It is Dale Carnegie does diplomacy, and we are present at the downsizing.

Already mired in an angry debate over abortion and women's rights, the United Nations Conference on Population and Development will confront other equally volatile issues when it opens here Monday.
Can the earth sustain its present rate of population growth? Who is to blame for the destruction of natural resources, profligate consumers in industrial nations or the desperate poor in overcrowded, underdeveloped countries who strip the land of vegetation to survive? If a plan of action is adopted, who will pay for it? And where will the money go, to governments or to grass-roots groups working in villages? Will donor countries try to attach human rights or other conditions to aid? 
 Cultural and political tensions, as well as religious ones, are built into population debates. And while delegates will face urgent and sometimes conflicting demands to cut population growth while also fostering human development, the 20,000 or more people assembling here officially and unofficially know that international agencies and governments work slowly. This will be the third United Nations conference on population in 20 years; in that time, the world has added about 2 billion people.
Resolving at least some conflicts here is crucial to the adoption of a plan that would open the way for governments to spend billions of dollars on programs intended to stabilize runaway population growth.
"This conference is playing for very high stakes," said J. Joseph Speidel, president of Population Action International in Washington, a nonprofit research group that advocates population stabilization. "This is not just another meeting. The long-term fate of this planet is in the balance."
First, there are the alarming numbers. More than 90 million people are being added to the population each year, the highest numerical growth in human history. In only 11 years, from 1987 until 1998, world population will grow from five billion to six billion, adding more bodies to feed, house, clothe and educate than the present combined populations of Europe and Latin America.
By contrast, it took 123 years for the population to grow from one billion to two billion, and at far higher fertility rates. Even in 1950, when the population was half of what it is now, women were having 5.3 children on average worldwide. Though the total fertility rate has since dropped to 3.4 children, the number of new people added each year has doubled because the base has expanded significantly and infant mortality has declined.
More than 90 percent of the growth is in the developing world, much of it in the poorest nations of South Asia and Africa. The developing countries add a million people every five days to lands that are often already overworked and depleted of water and cheap sources of energy.
Because this is the first of the United Nations population conferences to include "development" in its title -- the earlier two were in Bucharest in 1974 and Mexico City in 1984 -- the agenda is open to discussion of the environment, the economy, trade and education.
Carefully covering all the issues the developing countries want on the list of causes to be addressed, the conference's draft program of action says, "Around the world many of the basic resources on which future generations will depend for their survival and well-being are being depleted and environmental pollution is intensifying, driven by the unprecedented growth in human numbers, widespread and persistent poverty, social and economic inequality and wasteful consumption."
 
Effect on Governments
 Will the conference really mean anything to governments, especially if it adjourns without agreement on the most contentious issues? Nearly every delegate and unofficial observer interviewed said it would.
"Conferences and documents like these never get out ahead of where the people who agree to them are comfortable," said Rachel Kyte, an analyst for the International Women's Health Coalition. "What these conferences do is take an aerial snapshot of where we're at. A document like the program of action lets donor countries base policies on it, or go out ahead of it if they want."
Only if the richer nations accept some of the blame for the earth's distress will poorer countries acknowledge their shortcomings in family planning.
The Clinton Administration, in contrast to the Reagan and Bush Administrations, accepts the premise that consumption is an issue for discussion here.
"We wouldn't be where we are today in the conference document if the United States hadn't changed its position," Ms. Kyte said. She said the American position could help build a consensus on the relationship of population growth to poverty and economic development.
 
Debt Relief Sought
 But the task will not be easy. Among demands made by developing countries are an end to trade barriers, access to technology and debt relief.
Mahbub-ul Haq, a former Finance minister of Pakistan and now an adviser for the United Nations Development Program, says population increases in rich nations coupled with their patterns of consumption is the world's primary problem, "not population increase in the poor countries."
"Let us recognize clearly that rapid population growth in developing countries is their national problem, not a global issue," he wrote in April in Earth Times, a New York periodical devoted to environmental issues.
But many Western researchers insist that population is a global issue. Lester R. Brown, president of the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute, says world food supplies are threatened as the supply of irrigation water reaches its limits, seas are overfished and agricultural land in some of the poorest and most densely populated nations is turned over to industry.
"We are also in a situation where farmers are pushing against the limits of the fertilizer existing crops can use," Mr. Brown said in an interview from Washington. "More fertilizer in a lot of places now doesn't make any difference."
 
No Growth in Rice Harvests
 He said there had been no growth in rice production in Asia in four years. In that time, 56 million people were added to the population of Asian countries, led by India, whose population of more than 900 million is expected to grow by 590 million people in the next four decades.
"We have entered a new era, one in which satisfying the needs for seafood, for example, of 90 million people being added each year requires reducing consumption for those already on earth," he said. "Satisfying the demand for grain also means reducing the consumption of those already here."
Migration caused by overpopulation or the social fragility it creates has been studied by the United Nations Population Fund. The organization's 1993 report found the lines blurred between political and economic causes of internal migration and the outward flow of refugees and immigrants. Western nations have already begun to feel the pressures of economic migration, which can reduce tolerance and sympathy for truly persecuted and especially needy immigrants.
Concerns about land use are not limited to Westerners. M. S. Swaminathan, one of India's leading agricultural scientists and the head of a commission that studied population policy for the Indian Government, wrote recently that with land and forests dwindling and 18 million people being added to the Indian population each year, the time had come for an aggressive approach to population and social development.
"If our population policy goes wrong, nothing else will have a chance to go right," he concluded.
But here in Cairo, India is among a group of developing nations -- which also includes Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria -- that strenuously opposes language in the draft plan that would call for "the guarantee of all human rights, taking into account that democracy, development and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing."
 
Western Imposition Opposed
 These countries and others say the richer nations should not be allowed to impose their ideas of rights, democracy and acceptable population growth on others. The developing nations want a greater voice in institutions like the United Nations Security Council, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund so they can better oppose conditions on aid and loans.
Women's organizations from developing countries, whose primary aims at this conference are to expand protections and rights for women in reproductive choice, health care and other areas, have nonetheless joined the call for Western concessions.
Many organizations and government officials will be listening closely on Monday to Vice President Al Gore, who is leading the American delegation, for hints to how far the United States may go in accepting economic disparity as an issue central to population policy.
If the United States is willing to accept at least vague language stating all nations have the right to development, progress is likely, said Gita Sen, an economist at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India.
"This would be more a statement of principle than any specific commitment of resources," she said in an interview.
 
Cost of Contraception
 Also on the agenda at the conference is the potential cost of providing basic contraceptive services to the millions of people who do not have access to family planning. Estimates put the cost at $10 billion to $17 billion annually well into the next century.
In addition, the draft plan says, money will be needed for more health coverage, education and other human resource development. The proposed plan also asks for more money to deal with AIDS and to insure child survival. Poor families often have a large number of children in the fear that several will not live.
Traditionally, up to three-quarters of the money for family planning programs in developing nations has come from the countries' governments. They are now suggesting a sixfold increase in outside assistance, including help in improving social systems with new technologies.
Despite the disputes over abortion and other issues, the conference organizers and the unofficial lobbyists on the fringes say they are not concerned.
Maher Mahran, Egypt's Minister of Population and Family Welfare, said that even if the conference did not take place, it had already done 80 percent of its job by drawing attention to and providing information on world population to the public and policymakers.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS GLUM ABOUT PROSPECTS AS ELECTIONS NEAR

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
As they take to the stump this Labor Day weekend for the traditional opening of the fall campaigns, politicians of both parties share a like-minded view of the electoral landscape: The prospects for Democrats at all levels are bleak. The only unknown is just how bleak.
Democrats held high hopes earlier this year that they could boast to the voters of a major overhaul in the health care system and maybe even the welfare system. At the very least, they thought, they would be able to point to an economy on the mend. 
 But 65 days before Election Day, health care is stuck in Congressional gridlock, welfare restructuring is still a dream, and voters are in no mood to give Democrats more than grudging credit for helping create new jobs. That has left Democratic incumbents clinging to the passage of a crime bill as their only evidence of late that a Democratic majority in Congress can accomplish something of lasting significance. As a result, they can do little but portray the Republicans as obstructionists.
The Republicans, who would have had an upper hand anyway because the President's party almost invariably suffers in a midterm election, now see the Democratic woes as their best opportunity in decades to make gains. Since Democrats have far more seats to defend, the Republicans are counting on the discontent with incumbents to take a much bigger toll on the majority party.
The stakes are high. Although no leading analysts have predicted that the Republicans will gain the 7 seats necessary to win back the Senate, or the 40 seats needed to take control of the House after four decades of Democratic control, they acknowledge that shifts of such magnitude are not inconceivable.
Even if the Democrats retain control of both houses, heavy Democratic losses would dramatically affect President Clinton's ability to govern in the second half of his term. Despite the Democratic majorities he enjoyed in the first half, he was unable to win enactment of his centerpiece health care plan and barely marshaled enough votes for passage of his crime and budget proposals.
Republicans also have high hopes in the races for governor, where the Democrats, who hold 21 of the 36 offices at stake, are again on the defensive. The Democrats' biggest nightmare -- one whose realization is unlikely but possible -- is that the Republicans will keep or win the statehouses in the five most populous states: California, Texas, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania.
Things are so unsettled that Democratic stalwarts like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts face the toughest races of their careers. In the New York metropolitan region, two Democratic Senators -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut -- are considered safe bets for re-election. But a third, Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, is vulnerable.
 
John Glenn the Scolder
 Senator John Glenn of Ohio said that at a recent private luncheon many of his Democratic colleagues were in such despair -- some fretted that they would in fact lose control of the Senate -- that he wound up scolding them.
"When everybody gets their moods so down in the dumps, then I think some of the doom and gloom may become self-fulfilling -- that's what I commented on," said Mr. Glenn, who is not up for re-election this year. "People were saying, 'We're going to hell in a hand basket around here.' But I got rather impassioned. I said, 'If we get our heads so far down, we'll never pick them up again.' "
Beyond the many crucial races that could go either way, the election on Nov. 8 promises answers to other important political questions: Just how powerful have religious conservatives become at the ballot box? Will the voters who chose Ross Perot in 1992 side with one party or another this time? Will they affect the outcomes of races? Will any of the independent candidates for governor who are waging vigorous campaigns in at least five states change the outcome, or even win? Will the election produce a leading contender for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination, perhaps Gov. Pete Wilson of California or Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts?
Then there are some races bound to draw attention during the final nine-week sprint of campaigning simply as particularly spirited clashes. Will Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia, a Democrat whose first term has been marred by personal scandal, survive a challenge from the Republican nominee, Oliver L. North, and an independent bid by his longtime rival, former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder? Will two sons of former President George Bush win races for governor in Texas and Florida? Will Kathleen Brown, a Democrat, unseat Governor Wilson in California and follow her father and brother to the Statehouse?
 
Outlooks in Congress
 In the Senate, the Democrats now have a majority of 56 to 44, and so the Republicans need a net gain of seven seats to dominate the upper house for the first time since 1986. At least nine Democratic seats at stake can be considered tossups, as against three Republican seats. Most analysts are now predicting that the Republicans will pick up three to five.
In the House, where there are now 256 Democrats, 178 Republicans and 1 independent, a Republican gain of at least 20 seats is predicted by most experts. Some put the number closer to 30, a result that would still leave the Republicans 10 seats short of the number they need to end Democratic control that has been a constant since 1954.
But the Democrats have a special reason to be nervous. The anti-incumbency sentiment of 1994 notwithstanding, the advantages of incumbency, particularly in fund-raising, have long been a powerful advantage for members of the House, and this year there are 50 districts, an unusually high number, where the incumbents are not running. Thirty of those districts are now represented by Democrats.
Adding to the nervousness is that nearly a dozen of those districts are in Southern and border states where Mr. Clinton is particularly unpopular with increasingly conservative voters.
Although House races are not generally decided by the popularity of the incumbent President, it does not help the Democrats that Mr. Clinton's approval rating was only 40 percent in a Time/CNN poll taken on Wednesday and Thursday of last week, the lowest level at this point in a Presidency in four decades.
 
An Earlier Start
 The unsettled political environment has already affected the intensity with which campaigns are being waged. Candidates are putting television commercials on the air earlier than in past years, and they are stockpiling more money. (House and Senate candidates had raised $388 million by the end of June, compared with $369 million at the corresponding point in 1990, according to the Federal Election Commission.)
And it is striking, although hardly surprising, that Democratic candidates' advertising does not feature the President.
"The difference between this year and two years ago is like day and night," said Representative Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican who is running for the Senate. "The malaise in the Republican Party two years ago was palpable. The encouragement this year, by contrast, is equally palpable."
Donald R. Sweitzer, who as political director of the Democratic Party has spent much of the year advising candidates around the country, put it this way: "There's anywhere from a cynicism to an apathy out there. I've had a lot of conversations with candidates who say, 'I'm in the race of my life. This is the race of my career. They're really coming after me.' "
Besides the local issues that often decide Congressional races, crime has arisen as an overriding theme almost everywhere. Candidates on both sides are trying to demonstrate that they can build more prisons and keep more offenders off the streets.
Even Senator Harris Wofford, a Pennsylvania Democrat whose upset victory in 1991 led other politicians to emphasize health care, now finds himself stressing crime instead. With a vast health care overhaul all but dead for this year, Mr. Wofford has gone so far as to say that his own state's voters may favor the slower approach that could still be in the offing. "A good first step," he said, "is going to make a lot of sense to people in Pennsylvania."
If the public is dissatisfied with Democrats, it has not absolved the Republicans. A Gallup poll taken in mid-August suggested that Americans were just as exasperated by one party as the other. Asked whether they leaned toward voting for the Democratic Congressional candidate in their district or the Republican opponent, the respondents were almost evenly divided.
And not every Democrat is particularly glum. "I don't think the sky is falling by any means," said one, Representative Martin Frost of Texas. "I don't sense that things are as bad as people are suggesting."
That is easy for him to say. Mr. Frost's district has enough loyal Democrats that he is a safe bet for re-election. "I'm in good shape," he said.
But just in case, he added, he has significantly increased his budget for television commercials this year.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Across the Nation: Senate and Governor Races Considered Tight"
 
Senate
Democrats now control the Senate 56 to 44, so the Republicans would need a net gain of seven seats to become the majority party. There are 35 Senate contests in November; 22 of the seats are now held by Democrats, 13 by Republicans. Nine incumbents are not seeking re-election. Of those nine races, the seats in Arizona, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and Tennessee are held by Democrats; the seats in Minnesota, Missouri and Wyoming are held by Republicans.
 
Democratic-held seats
 
Arizona
Representative Jon Kyl was unopposed for the Republican nomination to run for the seat held by Senator Dennis DeConcini, who is retiring, giving Mr. Kyl a jump in the campaign. The Democrats will pick a nominee Sept. 13, but so far no Democratic candidate has dominated in this relatively conservative state.
 
California
Senator Dianne Feinstein is still the favorite, but a win is far from certain because of a multimillion-dollar television advertising campaign being waged by her Republican opponent, Representative Michael Huffington, a freshman Congressman who is digging into his personal fortune for the campaign.
 
Maine
Representative Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican, is coming on strong in the race for the seat held by the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell, who is retiring. But no one is counting out her Democratic opponent, who is also in the House, Representative Thomas H. Andrews.
 
Michigan
Representative Bob Carr won the Democratic primary for the seat held by Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., who is retiring, but the victory was not decisive. However, Mr. Carr's Republican rival, Spence Abraham, a former state party chairman, also did not win his party's nomination by a large margin. Mr. Carr is a more telegenic candidate, but Mr. Abraham is trying to portray him as an insider who is too much a part of the Washington establishment.
 
New Jersey
Republicans won back the State House here last year, and now they have set their sight on two-term Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who is being challenged by state Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian. Mr. Lautenberg hopes to save his seat by using his large financial advantage and by playing up his chairmanship of the Appropriations transportation subcommittee, a post that has helped him bring projects to the state.
 
Ohio
Joel Hyatt, the Democratic candidate, is the son-in-law of Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, who is retiring. But Mr. Hyatt, who has a chain of low-cost legal clinics, barely won the primary and seems to be having trouble gaining support. His Republican opponent is Lieut. Gov. Mike DeWine, who won his primary by an impressive margin.
 
Oklahoma
Senator David L. Boren has announced that he will retire from the Senate to become president of the University of Oklahoma. That has set the stage for a hard-fought contest between two House veterans, Representative Dave McCurdy, a Democrat, and Representative James M. Inhofe, a Republican.
 
Pennsylvania
Senator Harris Wofford won an upset victory in 1991, in an election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John Heinz, by emphasizing health care. This year, Mr. Wofford is in a tough position now that the White House and Democrats in Congress have given up on a major health care overhaul this year. He faces Representative Rick Santorum, a Republican who is an aggressive campaigner.
 
Virginia
Senator Charles S. Robb is in a bitter battle with the Republican nominee, Oliver L. North. Mr. Robb is trying to overcome damage resulting from publicity about what he acknowledges were personal indiscretions when he was Governor; Mr. North is trying to overcome the tarnished image that resulted from his role in the Iran-contra scandal. Two independent candidates have not gained much support: L. Douglas Wilder, a former Democratic Governor, and J. Marshall Coleman, a former Republican state Attorney General.
 
Tennessee
 Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat who is known for an alternative health care proposal, faces Fred Thompson, a Republican counsel during the Senate Watergate hearings, who is also a movie actor. The seat is now held by Senator Marian Mathews
 
Republican-held seats
 
Minnesota
Democrats have identified this Democratic-leaning state as one of their best shots at winning a Republican seat, that of Senator Dave Durenberger, who is retiring. But the race has not fully taken shape because the primary is not until Sept. 13. But freshman Representative Rod Grams, a conservative, won the endorsement of the Independent-Republican Party, while the Democrat-Farmer-Labor endorsement went to Ann Wynia, a former state House majority leader.
 
Montana
This has never been a particularly strong state for Republicans, and Senator Conrad Burns faces a vigorous challenge from Democrat Jack Mudd, a largely unknown yet appealing law school professor. Mr. Mudd's advisers hope he will not be hurt by President Clinton's popularity problems in the state.
 
Wyoming
Gov. Mike Sullivan was one of the Democratic Party's most sought-after recruits for the seat held by Senator Malcolm Wallop, who is retiring. He is in a spirited contest with Representative Craig Thomas, the Republican candidate. President Clinton is very unpopular in the state, which may hurt Mr. Sullivan.
 
Governors
There are now 29 Democratic governors, 19 Republicans and 2 independents. There are 36 contests in November; 21 of the seats are now held by Democrats, 13 by Republicans and 2 by independents. In 14 contests, incumbents are not running. Of those 14 races, the seats in Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wyoming are now held by Democrats; the seats in Maine, South Carolina and South Dakota are held by Republicans and the seats in Connecticut and Alaska are held by independents.
 
Democratic-held seats
 
Florida
The fortunes of Gov. Lawton Chiles have improved considerably as a result of his leadership in prodding President Clinton to act to stem the flow of Cuban refugees. Still, he will face a strong challenge from Jeb Bush, son of former President George Bush, or other possible Republican nominees.
 
Texas
Gov. Ann W. Richards is popular, but she is facing a tough challenge from George W. Bush, another son of the former President and a former baseball team owner.
 
Kansas
Representative Jim Slattery, a Democrat, is running about even in the polls with Bill Graves, the Republican Secretary of State.
 
New York
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's performance ratings are down, and George Paraki, a state senator who is the likely Republican nominee, could give him his toughest challenge yet.
 
Pennsylvania
Representative Tom Ridge, a Republican, is about even in the polls with the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Mark S. Singel. Mr. Singel is threatened to lose anti-abortion voters from an independent, Peg Luksik.
 
Tennessee
This rates pits two well-known politicians, Representative Don Sundquist, a Republican, against Mayor Phil Bredesen of Nashville, a Democrat.
 
Republican-held seats:
 
Iowa
The voters may be tiring of Gov. Terry E. Branstad, who is seeking a fourth term and won the Republican primary by just a small margin. He faces a strong challenge from the Democratic candidate, Bonnie Campbell, the state Attorney General.
 
Minnesota
Gov. Arne Carlson faces a challenge within the Republican Party from Allen Quist, a former State Representative who has the strong backing of religious conservatives. Mr. Carlson is favored to win the primary, but if he loses, the Democrat who emerges in the Sept. 13 primary could have a good shot at the seat.
 
Maine
The political landscape was turned upside down with the unexpected retirement of Senator George J. Mitchell. The Democratic candidate for Governor is Joseph Brennan, a former Governor; the Republican candidate is Susan Collins, a former state official. Angus King, a well-financed independent who is going after the large concentration of Ross Perot voters in the state, adds to the uncertainty.
 
House
All 435 seats are up for election. The current breakdown is 256 Democrats, 178 Republicans and 1 independent. So far, there are 50 departures -- 27 retirements, 2 defeated in primaries and 21 seeking other offices.

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFICIALS SEE FEW ALTERNATIVES TO HAITI INVASION

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
As the United States moves down its checklist of military and diplomatic preparations for a possible invasion of Haiti, top Administration officials have concluded that the Haitian junta will not be scared into leaving by tough talk and economic sanctions.
Since the spring, United States policy toward Haiti has been driven as much by the hope that preparations for military action would persuade the ruling generals to step down as by the actual need to plan an invasion to restore the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 But Administration officials are more pessimistic than ever about avoiding an invasion, especially after a week in which a Catholic priest and close ally of Father Aristide was slain, the junta refused to arrange a meeting with United Nations envoys and United States officials made their toughest warnings to date.
"We have to plan for the fact they're not going to respond and they're not going to leave," one senior State Department official said.
In a sense, this week's amplified threats by Administration officials merely restated Washington's position that the junta must go. A final decision to invade rests in the hands of one man -- President Clinton.
But a growing number of officials in the Pentagon, State Department, White House and intelligence agencies concede that recent events have produced a momentum that will not very likely be stopped. Most American officials involved estimate that an invasion is most likely to take place in early October.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said this week that options other than invasion were nearly exhausted. Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch said, "The multinational force is going to Haiti."
Earlier this week, a 183-foot Navy patrol boat zoomed across the edge of Port-au-Prince harbor and Navy surveillance planes hovered off shore.
While there are differences between the White House, Pentagon and State Department on aspects of the Haiti policy, agreement on the junta's disinclination to leave is widespread.
"It's almost universally believed both on the policy and intelligence sides now that the Haitians are intransigent and are ignoring all the signs, a State Department official said.
The official said that the ruling generals have "convinced themselves they're home free," that Washington will delay a decision to invade as long as they take steps, as they did this week, to release fuel for relief purposes and allow some Haitians to leave and seek asylum in the United States.
The United States intelligence community, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department's intelligence branch, first concluded more than a year ago that sanctions and threats of invasion probably would not budge the Haitian dictators, officials said.
 
A One-Year Process
 The junta's position hardened for good last October after the U.S.S. Harlan County, carrying 200 Canadian and American military trainers, was turned back by armed demonstrators from the docks of Port-au-Prince just two weeks before the negotiated date of Father Aristide's return. Ever since, Haiti's rulers have not taken American threats seriously, intelligence officials said.
But to gain public support for a possible invasion, and in the hope of that it somehow could be avoided altogether, the Administration felt compelled to exhaust all other alternatives. In May and June, the United Nations Security Council and the United States adopted tougher sanctions, including a comprehensive trade embargo, a ban on flights in and out of the country and tight restrictions on financial payments between Haiti and the United States.
In addition, Washington lobbied hard for the Security Council to approve in late July a resolution supporting an invasion to restore Father Aristide. This week, the 13-member Caribbean Community and Common Market supported using military action as a last resort, and four of the seven countries with armed forces pledged a token force of 266 troops to join an American-dominated invasion force of more than 10,000 soldiers.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said this week that any diplomatic efforts were virtually dead. Early this week, Administration officials held out a glimmer of hope that the new sanctions and tighter enforcement might coax the generals to give up. But by today, that optimism had all but vanished.
"The Haitians still think we just aren't going to do anything," said a senior intelligence official.
 
A No-Win Situation
 Given the threats made by Mr. Talbott and Mr. Deutch this week, ostensibly with White House approval, Mr. Clinton has left himself few options except to invade. A policy reversal would only worsen his foreign policy credentials. Opponents of invasion said Mr. Clinton loses either way.
"If we don't invade now, the Administration will be accused of being wishy-washy," Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said on the CNN program "Newsmaker Saturday." "If we do invade, it will be a historical mistake."
Moreover, Haitian parliamentary elections are scheduled for early November, and many Administration officials want Father Aristide in place by then to avoid having the junta's candidates elected in a rigged ballot.
So the only question now seems to be timing. How long does the Administration officials give tighter sanctions enforcement a chance to work? Will the United States give the junta a final ultimatum, as Mr. Talbott suggested this week? Is Mr. Clinton really willing to commit United States troops to a cause that has little support in Congress or from the public?
"They may have a lot of questions about it, but they'll accept it," Representative Lee Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said about Congress on "Newsmaker."
Some practical details also still need to be worked out before any invasion could likely happen. Training for the 266 Caribbean troops begins in the next two weeks, and will last two to three weeks. They would join the main vanguard in 10 days.
This initial force would be responsible for establishing a "safe and secure environment" in Haiti, and would require several thousand military police and police trainers. Most of the Caribbean troops would do these jobs, but they will not be enough; and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, strongly opposes using American troops as police, largely because of the ill-fated experience in Somalia.
So American officials are scrambling to recruit military police from other countries, including Canada and Britain, for the initial force.

Statistics Cast Doubts On Pataki's Job-Loss Ads

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
State Senator George E. Pataki, Republican candidate for governor, seems to be relentless in his politically motivated reading of job losses in New York.
 Mr. Pataki has repeatedly said in speeches that New York lost more jobs than any other state in the recession. A television advertisement for him last month maintained that the state was "No. 1 in lost jobs."
 
 But even after acknowledging news reports that showed that New York actually ranked second in lost jobs since July 1990, when the national recession began, Mr. Pataki has persisted. In a radio commercial that he started broadcasting last week, Mr. Pataki says: "New York State lost a half-million jobs since 1990. That's the most jobs of any state in the nation."
 Rankings provided by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics show that New York trailed California in the number of jobs lost since July 1990 and trailed Connecticut in the proportion of jobs that it lost.
 Caroline Quartararo, Mr. Pataki's campaign spokeswoman, began her defense of the campaign's use of the erroneous statistic by citing a chart in Forbes magazine that showed that New York's job losses surpassed those of California from June 1990 through June 1992, a period at variance with the "since 1990" claim.
 Then she said the campaign had used the period of June 1990 through June 1994, contending that New York's job losses ranked first during that period. They did not, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Finally, Ms. Quartararo said the campaign had consulted with Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional commissioner, who had pointed out that the Government's methodology for collecting some employment data had changed and that accurate comparisons could not be made between figures before and after January of this year.
 Ms. Quartararo said New York was first in job losses from June 1990 to December 1993. Mr. Ehrenhalt said that was true, but only for statistics gleaned from the bureau's survey of households, which he said was less reflective of economic conditions than its survey of employers. The employers' survey shows that California's job losses exceeded New York's from June 1990 to December 1993.
 Mr. Ehrenhalt added that the Pataki campaign did not get in touch with him until Wednesday, after the advertisement was on the air and after reporters had started questioning the statistics.
 
A Former Speaker Signs On As a Vice President at Nynex
 Stanley Fink, the former Speaker of the New York State Assembly, wasted little time in finding a new job after his law and lobbying firm, Bower & Gardner, announced in late July that it was disbanding.
 Mr. Fink, who remains highly regarded in Albany and New York City political circles, said last week that he would become senior vice president for regulatory and governmental affairs at Nynex.
 Mr. Fink, who was Speaker from 1979 to 1986, compared the work he will be doing there to his legislative involvement in improving New York's infrastructure. "I see a very exciting opportunity where the telecommunications infrastructure is going to have to be built, in how an information highway with entrances and exits for everybody will be built," he said.
 He said his job might include occasional lobbying of former colleagues. "I don't intend to be in Albany, Washington or City Hall on a regular basis," Mr. Fink said. "Will I be there from time to time as the job and circumstances require? That's a real possibility."
 
A Shift Toward a Stronger Bill For a Sex-Offender Registry
 In the wake of 7-year-old Megan Kanka's murder in New Jersey in late July, New York State lawmakers have begun blaming one another for their failure to pass legislation requiring sex offenders to notify local authorities when they move into a community.
 Before they recessed in July, the lawmakers considered a variety of such bills, including one proposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that would have required prison, health care and parole officials to notify local police when convicted sex offenders are released into their towns.
 A version of that proposal, sponsored by Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican of Nassau County, passed the Republican-controlled Senate in June, but died in the Democratic-led Assembly. Both Mr. Skelos and the bill's Democratic sponsor, Assemblyman Daniel L. Feldman of Brooklyn, said they thought their bill had been rejected by Assembly leaders because it was considered a threat to civil liberties.
 "My leadership gave me a clear message that my bill was too strong and I should work on a compromise," Mr. Feldman said.
 But in the wake of Megan's murder, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver of Manhattan said he would propose stronger legislation than Mr. Skelos's bill. Mr. Silver said his bill would make public a registry of convicted sexual offenders living in a town -- so-called community notification. Mr. Skelos's bill would have allowed only the police to review such registries.
 Mr. Skelos and Mr. Feldman said they were perplexed by Mr. Silver's apparent change of heart. "Silver is talking about going beyond the original bill," he said. "I don't have a problem with that. But I find it hard to understand why they were worried about confidentiality before."
 Mr. Silver said the Skelos-Feldman bill did not provide for enhanced supervision and treatment of sexual offenders, as his bill would. He said he did not propose community notification earlier because no one was pressing for it.
 "There was no great push," he said.
 "There might have been," he added, if the New Jersey murder had occurred during the legislative session.

HEADLINE: Inadequate U.N. Effort Seen Against Killers In Rwanda

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIGALI, Rwanda, Sept. 3

 BODY:
United States officials and relief workers here say that before any effective rebuilding of Rwanda can begin, those responsible for massacres in the civil war must first be brought to justice soon. But, the officials add, United Nations efforts toward this goal have so far been inadequate.
A small team of United Nations experts investigated the massacres this week, but they said they had been hampered by a lack of staff and resources. Their final report is not expected until the end of November, and there will be further delays before an international tribunal can be established. 
 "There is a need to set up an international tribunal as quickly as possible," the United States Ambassador to Rwanda, David P. Rawson, said in an interview on Thursday.
He said the establishment of such an international judicial process would contribute significantly to the return of the refugees from Zaire, whose Government on Thursday called for them to leave by the end of September.
John Norris of the United States Agency for International Development said, "There can be no solution to the refugee crisis, no chance for development, no chance for normalization of society until those responsible for the egregious offenses are brought to justice."
 
Uncertainty for Hutu
 Most of the nearly one million refugees in Zaire are Hutu, and a major impediment to their return has been uncertainty about what will happen to them at the hands of the new Government, which is dominated by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front. The Government has said all those who took part in the massacres will be prosecuted, but it has not defined criteria for culpability.
Many Rwandans, perhaps in the thousands, were among the Hutu mobs that carried out the massacres. But many of them say they were forced to go along out of fear of being killed themselves if they did not. Others worry about being unjustly accused of taking part in the massacres by individuals with personal grudges.
On May 31, in report to the United Nations Security Council, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that what had happened in Rwanda "constitutes genocide."
On Wednesday, representatives from the United States Embassy, several international relief organizations and United Nations agencies met to discuss a long-range strategy for rebuilding Rwanda. They later drafted an agenda for what is needed for "development in Rwanda." There are eight items on the agenda, including the call to assist Rwanda in developing its economy, repairing the country's basic services and providing financial support for agricultural projects and education. The first item on the agenda, however, pertains to human rights.
 
'Acts of Genocide Occurred'
 "Widespread acts of genocide have occurred in Rwanda," the statement says in reference to several hundred thousand Rwandans, mostly from the Tutsi minority but including moderate Hutus as well, who were killed by Government soldiers and militia.
"Fully responding to these crimes against humanity is absolutely critical if Rwanda is to move forward," it says. "The response from the international community has been entirely inadequate in dealing with these human rights issues to date."
Last month, the new Government called for the establishment of an international tribunal to try those responsible for the massacres.
"We wish the international community would get moving on this," a senior official of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, Maj. Emanuel Ndahiro, said on Thursday.
On July 1, the United Nations Security Council called on the Secretary General to establish "as a matter of urgency" a commission of experts to investigate the massacres in Rwanda, "including the evidence of possible acts of genocide." A commission of three experts held its first meeting on Aug. 18-19 in Geneva. On Aug. 27, the commission arrived in Rwanda to begin the investigation.
The experts said at a news conference on Friday that they would recommend an international tribunal, and that they would need a staff of at least 200, including forensic specialists and investigators, to carry out an adequate inquiry into the massacres.
 
U.S. Aide Asks More Funds
 In their statement on "development in Rwanda," the diplomats and relief workers acknowledged that the commission "is seriously lacking the resources, personnel and expertise needed to produce a satisfactory inquiry."
Kim Maynard, a member of the United States Office of Disaster Assistance team here, said the investigation and the establishment of an international tribunal must be expedited and adequately staffed and financed.
"There must be internationally recognized human rights lawyers, not just U.N. volunteers," Ms. Maynard said. "Compared to what the international community will spend on the refugees and the relief effort -- probably a billion dollars -- what is needed for the human rights investigation is pretty cheap."
She said that the cost of one C-130 flight with relief supplies was $1 million but that not even that much had been allocated to the human rights investigation
"If the international community is serious about preventive diplomacy and disaster prevention, there must at least be some accountability for those responsible for the human rights violations here," Ms. Maynard said. "This is our chance to show the world we are serious about human rights."

HEADLINE: Cuba Calls U.S. Refugee Offer Inadequate

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
Cuba's chief negotiator in the immigration talks with the United States said yesterday that the Clinton Administration's offer to grant entry rights to at least 20,000 Cubans a year was inadequate. He suggested that this amount would be too small to stop Cubans from setting out in rafts for Florida.
The negotiator, Ricardo Alarcon, said in an interview that his Government would like the United States to admit for a specific time, perhaps a year, all Cubans who have expressed interest in moving to the United States. 
 One way to measure this, he said, was the number of Cubans -- 134,000 -- who applied for travel visas to the United States last year.
According to Mr. Alarcon, letting in so many people would defuse the pent-up pressures for illegal immigration by boat people.
 
Conflict Over Numbers
 During talks in New York on Thursday and Friday, the Administration presented an offer that would vastly expand the number of Cubans granted entry rights each year -- to at least 20,000 -- if Fidel Castro promised to halt the flood of boat people. Over the last 12 months, the United States granted visas to 2,700 Cubans, making Havana complain that this was far below the ceiling of 27,845 visas allowed under American law.
United States and Cuban officials said the Cuban delegation has not made a formal response to the 20,000 figure, suggesting that the talks could continue for several days.
In the interview yesterday at the Cuban Mission to the United Nations, Mr. Alarcon acknowledged that he had not put forward a specific number of how many Cubans Havana wants the United States to allow in each year.
The talks are schedule to resume today at the United States Mission to the United Nations.
Mr. Alarcon declined to predict when the talks would end, reiterating that they should address Washington's three-decade-old embargo against Cuba.
 
'I cannot be optimistic'
 "I cannot be optimistic," he said. "To find a real solution you have to deal with the causes of the emigration and that remains the economic embargo. The other side has refused to talk about the embargo."
Nonetheless, Mr. Alarcon, a 55-year-old former Foreign Minister who is president of Cuba's National Assembly, did not rule out an agreement that did not address the embargo.
"I'd be prepared to accept something on immigration matters even if the economic embargo stays in place -- if the other side shows flexibility on immigration matters," he said.
Mr. Alarcon said Cuba was eager to see legal immigration increased because Havana was convinced this would reduce the pressures behind the exodus, which he said was a destabilizing force for Cuba. As of 9 P.M. yesterday, the Coast Guard had picked up 850 more refugees in the waters between Cuba and Florida.
 
A Veiled Warning
 Mr. Alarcon is widely considered to be one of Cuba's shrewdest politicians and diplomats, and it is hard to tell whether the position he staked out today was a steadfast bargaining position or posturing aimed at exacting more concessions from Washington.
In what appeared to be a veiled warning, Mr. Alarcon said Washington should not expect any slackening soon in the flow of refugees. He said that after three decades of granting entry to all Cubans, President Clinton's decision to keep boat people at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station would not in a matter of one or two weeks dissuade Cubans from heading to Florida by raft.
It was to be expected, he said, that many Cuban refugees remain convinced that their relatives in Florida would pull strings to get them into the United States.
Mr. Alarcon said Mr. Castro's decision to let Cubans emigrate freely was a response to a series of boat hijackings. Those hijackings, he said, were fueled by Washington's longtime policy of not prosecuting Cubans who head to Florida after using violence to steal boats.
'It's not a matter of 'Castro' putting a halt to the exodus," he said, using his hands to make quotation marks. "It's a matter for both sides to accept their responsibilities."
 
Strangling Cuba's Economy
 Repeatedly during the hourlong interview, Mr. Alarcon returned to the embargo and his assertions that it was strangling Cuba's economy and pressuring people to flee.
He argued that it was unwise for Mr. Clinton to maintain the embargo because Cuba is opening its economy to investors worldwide and United States businesses are missing out.
"Cuba is not as big as China in terms of market or territory, but it is a potential market of a few billion dollars that is right across the street," he said.
Mr. Alarcon insisted that Cuba is embracing economic reforms, but he said that the embargo, combined with the collapse of trade relations with the former Soviet bloc, has created such hard times that it is undermining the Government's ability to experiment.
"The main obstacle to the reform process is the United States embargo," he said. "Those who want us to change are doing their utmost to make it impossible."
Mr. Alarcon seemed to enjoy tweaking the United States as he puffed on his thick, six-inch cigar. He chided the Administration for its temerity in pressing his Government to halt the exodus. That meant, he said, Washington was urging Havana to violate his people's right to travel -- although he failed to mention that Mr. Castro has for years stopped Cubans from setting to sea.
Mr. Alarcon scoffed at the belief, espoused by many Administration officials and Cuban-American leaders, that Mr. Castro's Government is on its last legs. Such an attitude, he said, was pushing President Clinton to foolishly embrace tougher sanctions that increase the pain for the average Cuban, even as Mr. Castro remains firmly in power.
"If I were an adviser to the North American Government, I'd remind them that there are people in Florida who have forecast for 35 years the end of the Castro regime," he said. Then, in an allusion to the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, he added, "United States policy against Cuba has had some well-known failures because of such inaccurate perceptions."
"We have severe difficulties, serious problems, but it would be dead wrong to assume that the country is blowing apart," he said.

HEADLINE: Summer Travel Across Nation Shows a Surge

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Inspired by low air fares, economic confidence and the unshakable lure of the road, Americans have been traveling this summer like never before.
Preliminary figures strongly suggest that, from the New Jersey Shore to the Las Vegas Strip, the number of summer vacationers will set a record. 
 Even the long-beset airline industry, with a record 89 million passengers in June and July, is headed toward its busiest year ever. And the nation's hotels and motels are reporting their highest occupancy rates since at least the early 1980's.
"For the first time in a long time, you didn't hear that big, loud snap of pocketbooks and wallets being slammed shut," said Jerry Cheske, a spokesman for the Automobile Association of America. "This summer, people were spending again."
Almost 16 percent of travel agents had their best summer ever, according to a recent poll conducted by the American Society of Travel Agents, while another 50 percent classified the summer as "very good." Bookings were 35 percent higher than last summer at Thomas Cook Travel agencies, and 70 percent of the Carlson agencies said summer travel was "significantly" ahead of last year.
Many industry officials attribute the surge to pent-up demand and confidence that the economy is improving, or at least not getting worse.
"Right after the recession, people bought durable goods," said Shawn Flaherty, a spokeswoman for the Travel Industry Association, based in Washington. "Now they decided it was time to take vacations."
Before the season started, the United States Travel Data Center projected that this summer there would be 230 million person trips (one person traveling 100 or more miles from home), compared with 220 million last summer. That alone would have been a record, higher even than the 222 million in 1992, when the airlines put a frenzied half-price sale on domestic tickets. But the center said on Friday that the final tally would probably exceed 230 million.
There are many reasons. "Instead of putting money into our house, we're living and enjoying our kids," said Gail Hoefer, who works in commercial real estate and was visiting San Francisco the other day with her two young sons.
"We're spending differently," she added. "You change with the times. After the riots, fires and earthquakes, I think people want to get away."
Kevin and Patty Foster and their two children, who live in Newport, R.I., usually take several small trips and one big one during the year, but last year they skipped the big trip. This year they made up for that with a trip to Florida. "The economy is a little stronger," Mr. Foster said. "It's making people feel a little better about their prospects."
Low fares offered by discount airlines and specials offered by the major carriers contributed to the surge in air travel.
Bargain prices helped fill 75 percent of airline seats this summer, compared with an annual industry average of 64 percent in recent years, the Air Transport Association said.
 
International Flavor
 The increase in international travel was particularly dramatic.
"Lots of our domestic flights were heavily booked," said Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the carriers' trade organization. "But bookings on many of our international routes were at or near capacity all summer long."
International air fares accounted for almost 42 percent of total airline commissions in July, compared with 35 percent last year. "Our international business grew tremendously this summer," said Christine Santos, branch manager at the Thomas Cook Travel Agency in Braintree, Mass. London and Italy were especially popular destinations, she said.
Many overseas tours were paid for before the dollar plummeted early this summer against European currencies, travel industry officials said, thereby insulating those American travelers from the currency equivalent of sticker shock.
Ted and Carolyn Leutzinger of Los Angeles, who have visited all 50 states and 100 countries, took two vacations this summer instead of their usual one. They traveled through eight European countries early in the summer. Then they cashed in their frequent flier miles for a trip to New England to wrap up the season.
At every stop they noticed more tourists than usual. "London was quite crowded," said Mrs. Leutzinger, 60, who teaches kindergarten. "Geneva was quite crowded, too. There were many Americans."
 
From Boston to Branson
 In the United States, summer vacationers, who typically account for about a third of all vacation travel during the year, seemed to be everywhere. Two perennial top attractions, Orlando and Las Vegas, retained their drawing power, helped by a new economy hotel at Disney World and by the new MGM theme park in Las Vegas, a gambling city that is rapidly transforming itself into a family destination as well.
The Gulf Coast states of Alabama and Mississippi had a big summer, as did San Antonio, the most popular destination in Texas, and Branson, Mo., the Ozark town that continues to draw families and tour groups in record numbers. In Boston, the Bull & Finch Pub, famous as the exterior of the bar featured in the television show "Cheers," attracted a record number of tourists this summer even though the show's final episode was almost a year and a half ago. "It's gangbusters," said Eddie Doyle, the manager. "We had a record day on a Saturday maybe three weeks ago. Over 5,000 people came in."
In New Jersey, merchants from Ocean City to Cape May have reported a banner season. In New York City, tourism has also been strong, although an influx of visitors from other countries is a major factor.
 
National Parks Popular
 The number of people visiting the country's 50 national parks rose 2.5 percent in July compared with the same month last year, to 11.1 million. Use of the overall National Park System, which consists of 365 sites, including the parks, national monuments, historic sites and seashores, rose 2.8 percent in July compared with the same period last year, to 42.8 million visitors.
But the number of visitors to Grand Canyon National Park fell 12 percent in June and 9 percent in July from the same months a year ago, and the figure was down 4 percent for the first seven months of the year. That falloff was felt by restaurateurs and hoteliers in the nearby Arizona communities of Williams and Flagstaff.
Tom Wade, an analyst with the National Parks System in Denver, said that proposed restrictions on vehicles in the parks might have held down park use, even though those restrictions are still only proposals.
 
Fear and Florida
 Overall, tourist travel to Florida continued to drop, probably because of fear after 10 foreign visitors were killed in the state from October 1992 to April 1994. More recently, another fear has hurt Florida tourism: travelers have been worried that the coastal towns are swamped with refugees from Cuba. Last Sunday the Monroe County Tourist Development Council took out advertisements in six Florida newspapers emphasizing that the Florida Keys are open and eager for tourist business.
But the huge number of travelers this summer suggests that Americans who shun a particular city or state go elsewhere, rather than stay home. And some people seem not to care where they are going.
Thus when Northwest Airlines recently offered 300 same-day-return tickets to mystery destinations for $59 ($99 for two), 2,000 people showed up at the airport in Indianapolis hoping to buy them. Not until flight time a few days later did ticket holders learn whether they were bound for Boston, Miami, San Antonio, Rapid City, S.D., or one of 11 other cities.
One winning couple said it was an inexpensive way to dine out in unusual surroundings. Others may just have been bitten by the travel bug, the same bug that moved Robert Louis Stevenson to write: "For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move."

HEADLINE: Russia and China Act to Cut Arms, Widen Ties

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Formally ending an era of tension between two of the world's most powerful countries, Russia and China agreed today not to aim nuclear missiles at each other, never to use force against each other, and to sharply limit the number of troops stationed along their border.
The declaration was signed at the end of talks at the Kremlin between President Jiang Zemin of China and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. The two men also agreed to work harder on developing economic ties. 
 The Russia-China relationship has been rocky and traumatic. In the early 1950's their leaders dreamed of fashioning a world of Communism. Indeed, it has only been 40 years since Mr. Jiang trained as an engineer in Moscow at the giant Zil automotive factory.
But by the late 1950's, the two Communist giants had entered into such a fierce and dogmatic battle for supremacy that they became bitter enemies. The bloody clashes along their border in the 1960's led many to believe that if there was another World War it would begin there.
"The signing of these agreements are achievements of historic scope," said Mr. Yeltsin today, just back from Germany where he watched the last Russian troops withdraw from Europe. "For the first time in the history of Russian-Chinese relations the border between our two countries is legally fixed."
Tensions had cooled a while ago. Chinese ballistic missiles are not targeted in advance, according to Western military officials, so the agreement is largely symbolic. The Chinese missile system is built largely for retaliation. And the Russians have made a great show of limiting their targeted missiles over the last two years.
The economic agreements signed today were more important than those reached on arms control. China -- despite its stridently Communist political system -- has proven far more flexible economically than Russia was under Communism, or Russia is today. Many Russians now say they look to China as a model of how to apply phased economic reforms.
This is an ironic twist for two countries that have taken such divergent paths. Struggling to find the right route to a successful market economy, Mr. Yeltsin and others sometimes seem to look wistfully at China's remarkable economic growth over the past decade. "We pay much attention to studying the experience of economic reforms in China," Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Jiang.
China has become Russia's second largest trading partner after Germany. Trade between the two almost doubled in the last three years, and according to Chinese statistics, accounted for $7.68 billion last year.
This is tricky ground for a Russian President who must appeal to Western leaders even as he seeks increased partnership with China. Russia has carefully avoided joining the United States and other Western countries in attacking China's human rights record, which most Westerners consider abysmal.
Wu Jianmin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said after today's meetings, "Both leaders stressed that the international community should acknowledge that there is no single pattern for the development of all countries and that all countries should be equal." He said the subject of human rights had not come up.

HEADLINE: Russia Warns Clinton Not to Allow Bosnia Arms

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EDGARTOWN, Mass., Sept. 3

 BODY:
In a new sign of division over the path to peace in Bosnia, Russia has issued a strong private message to President Clinton warning him not to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Clinton said last month that he would press for a lifting of the embargo if the Bosnian Serbs had not accepted a peace settlement drafted by the Western allies and Russia by Oct. 15. The embargo bars arms shipments to all sides in the conflict, but hurts the Bosnian Government most because the Bosnian Serbs are much better armed. 
 A possible opening of the way to arms shipments to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government is among the steps that have been held out since early summer by members of the so-called contact group -- Russia, Britain, France, Germany and the United States -- to induce the Serbs to agree to the peace terms.
But in a diplomatic presentation at the State Department on Friday that Administration officials described as frank, a Russian envoy was emphatic in saying his Government would never agree to that step.
The envoy, who said he was delivering a message intended for Mr. Clinton, said Russia wanted the President instead to permit an immediate easing of economic sanctions against Serbia, Moscow's traditional ally, as a reward for Serbia's new efforts to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace terms.
 
Potential Trouble Seen
 After several months in which members of the contact group have maintained a facade of unanimity, Administration officials familiar with the new Russian appeal described it as potentially troublesome.
They said it might reflect stark differences between the United States and Russia over what steps the group should take next in its efforts to impose a settlement in Bosnia that could bring an end to 29 months of war.
The new Russian stance was conveyed to the State Department only by the charge d'affaires at the Russian Embassy in Washington, and White House officials at Mr. Clinton's vacation residence here would not say whether he had been briefed about its contents.
But Administration officials said that Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia delivered an identical message on Wednesday in a meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, and that high-level meetings to review the status of American policy toward Bosnia would likely be convened by the National Security Council staff next week.
"We've got to decide whether we can hold the contact group together now that Russia is beginning to veer in a different direction," an Administration official said today.
In what will serve as an effort to see if the two sides can find common ground, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, is to meet in Moscow with Mr. Kozyrev on Monday, Administration officials said today. That meeting will be followed on Tuesday with a working-level meeting of the contact group in Geneva, scheduled in large part in response to a Russian request.
 
Summit Meeting Ahead
 But even as Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin prepare to hold a summit meeting in Washington at the end of the month, Administration officials said the failure of their joint efforts toward peace in Bosnia appears to have left the two countries increasingly at odds.
In Friday's diplomatic presentation, known as a "nonpaper," and in recent appeals to other Western governments, Russia has argued that it is time to reward Serbia and its President, Slobodan Milosevic, for moving to block shipments of arms, fuel and food to the Bosnian Serbs. Mr. Kozyrev and other Russian diplomats have said the United Nations should move at least to ease the economic sanctions they imposed on Serbia to punish its Government for the overt support it gave to the Bosnian Serbs in the past.
But the United States has questioned whether Mr. Milosevic and his Government have truly turned against their former clients. Today Administration officials said they would continue to insist that armed monitors be stationed along the Drina River between Serbia and Bosnian Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia before any sanctions are eased against Belgrade. That is a step that both Russia and Serbia have said they would steadfastly resist.

HEADLINE: Newark's New Subpoenas Barely Raise an Eyebrow

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Once again the Newark city government and its dealings with private companies are under investigation by Federal law-enforcement officials, who said last week that they were looking into whether companies had paid bribes to city officials in return for obtaining municipal contracts, tax abatements and zoning changes.
 Federal subpoenas were served in the last week for all of the Newark City Council's records since 1989. After the holiday weekend the records, along with some members of the City Council, will start arriving at the Federal office building a block from City Hall.
 
 That one law-enforcement agency or another wants to examine Newark city records is barely viewed as news around City Hall, because the repeated forays into the files have often resulted in indictments and convictions.
 "The investigations sometimes continue for years, if not decades," said Glenn A. Grant, Newark's business administrator.
 Twice in the last two years investigators subpoenaed city records. Prosecutors later charged three members of the Council with corruption in two cases. One case, which has not yet gone to trial, involves accusations of kickbacks for a towing contract; the other resulted in the conviction of a councilwoman for misusing city money.
 
9 Indicted in Conspiracy Case
 One of the longest-running investigations began during the administration of Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson and culminated years later in January 1993 with the indictment of nine people, including reputed members of organized crime and the manager of Newark's Division of Sanitation. They were accused of conspiring to steal more than $2 million over the previous decade by billing the city for supplies and services that were not delivered.
 In announcing the indictment last year, Michael Chertoff, who was then the United States Attorney for New Jersey, said, "I don't know if this is an indictment of the concept of privatization, but it suggests that no method of delivering municipal services should escape the need for diligent supervision. There will always be a small minority of people seeking to enrich themselves."
 The indictments led to guilty pleas.
 Mr. Gibson, who served three terms before losing to Mayor Sharpe James in 1986, took in stride the attention the city was receiving in the mid-1980's from law-enforcement agencies during an interview more than a decade ago.
 At that time, the United States Attorney was investigating the city's Housing Authority, the Essex County Prosecutor was looking into payments made by the city to some of the companies hired to salt city streets after snowstorms and the State Attorney General was examining the city's purchasing practices.
 
Used to the Scrutiny
 Mr. Gibson said he had become accustomed to such inquiries and was not concerned. "In my 13 years in office, there has never been a month when we're not being investigated," he said then. "But I would point out that not one person in my administration has ever been convicted of any wrongdoing in all that time."
 Corruption charges leveled against his predecessor, Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio, contributed to Mr. Gibson's first election victory in 1970. Eight days before a mayoral runoff with Mr. Gibson that year, Mr. Addonizio went on trial on charges of conspiring to obtain $1.4 million in kickbacks from contractors on city projects. He continued his campaign from a Federal courtroom, but lost the runoff to Mr. Gibson.
 Two months later, Mr. Addonizio and four other defendants were each found guilty on 63 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy. During the trial, he was linked to two reputed members of organized crime, Ruggierio Boiardo and his son, Anthony.
 
$28 Million Tax Abatement
 The latest investigation by both state and Federal prosecutors focused initially on whether Mr. James had lobbied the Council for a $28 million tax abatement for a project financed by Metrobank, a now-failed savings and loan association, in exchange for a $10,000 contribution by Metrobank to a party sponsored by the Friends of Sharpe James, a group of his supporters.
 Mr. James, who was on vacation last week, has said that he knew nothing about the contribution and never met with officials from Metrobank. He has also noted that tax abatements, an incentive used by many cities to spur economic development, must be approved by the Council.
 George Branch, a Councilman from the Central Ward, said that the tax abatement granted for Metrobank's real-estate project was legitimate.
 Mr. Branch said that the abatement had been carefully reviewed and that a vote had even been postponed at one Council meeting to allow more time for study. Asked whether Metrobank channeled campaign contributions to some Council members before the tax abatement was granted, Mr. Branch replied, "Not to me."
 "I don't know what others may have done, but I got no contribution," he said.

HEADLINE: Bradley Combs Jersey Shore for Voters' Opinions

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MANASQUAN, N.J., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Each summer Senator Bill Bradley shakes the dust of Washington from his shoes, then kicks them off and dons an old pair of sneakers for a long walk along the New Jersey shore.
 Most of the four days of walking this week on beaches from Cape May at the state's southern tip to Sandy Hook in the north was spent shaking hands, making small talk and signing autographs on every size, shape and color of ball and baseball cap.
 
 But Mr. Bradley said he finds enough people who tell him what's on their minds to enable him to deal more confidently with the issues of the day when he returns to Washington. "It's like a walking town meeting," he said. "Polls can give you the narrow view, the statistics, but only through something like this do you hear the stories and meet the people."
 "For the past three years most of the talk was about the economy, but this year it was health care, crime and beach erosion," said Mr. Bradley, who has made similar journeys along the shore for more than a decade. "I heard countless stories of people being denied health coverage."
 
Skepticism About Health Plan
 There also were many who thought President Clinton's proposed overhaul of the country's health insurance system was too cumbersome and would prove to be expensive. Douglas Coppole of Kinnelon, who was on the sand at Bradley Beach with his four young children, said, "There really is a level of universal health care in the country already, but politicians want to give everybody everything."
 Carol Ciccarella of Newton, a registered nurse visiting the beach at Ocean Grove, told the Senator that the Clinton plan would put the country on the road to "socialized medicine, like they have in England, and then we won't get quality health care out of our physicians."
 To Tony Marra of Chatham, who was sunning on one of the state's broadest beaches at Sandy Hook, the Clinton plan is a "disaster."
 "All it will do is build a bigger bureaucracy," he said.
 Mr. Bradley told them that he thought there was not time to pass the President's plan in the few weeks left in the current session of Congress and that all that could be done was to make some improvements in the current health insurance system. But he said that unless a system were eventually created that would cover everyone, there would be no opportunity to control costs.
 
Boy Outgrows Braces
 He also wondered how to help the owner of a small business whom he had met a day earlier on another beach. "He has 10 employees, and not only doesn't he have insurance for them, he can't afford it for himself," Mr. Bradley said.
 He also met Leo and Liz Menard of Lebanon, N.J., whose 12-year-old son, Joshua, is outgrowing the leg braces he got through Medicaid that enable him to stand. Joshua suffers from a birth defect affecting the bones called arthrogryposis, Mr. Menard said, adding that the braces were paid for only after a protracted fight with Medicaid officials. Mr. Bradley promised to intercede if the Menards have problems getting larger braces.
 Mr. Bradley also said that Mr. Clinton had tried to do too much too quickly on health care. "You can't do massive changes like that in one and a half years," he said. "It took four and a half years to get tax reform, six years to pass the crime bill; eight years to pass banking reforms and four years to pass a clean-water bill."
 
Assault Weapons Ban
 The crime bill adopted last month got mixed reviews on Mr. Bradley's walk, with some bathers and baskers congratulating him on its passage and others saying they did not like it. Mr. Bradley quizzed the opponents on their reasons and often found that their main complaint was the ban on assault weapons. "Well, you seem to agree with 90 percent of the bill," he told them.
 Many visitors talked with the Senator about the beach erosion that is still evident in some areas following damaging northeast storms of the last two years and an unusual summertime loss of sand caused by southerly winds this year. Mr. Bradley said he would see if a beach replenishment project under way from Sea Bright to Barnegat Light could be accelerated.
 There were other questions of varying import, many involving his former team, the New York Knicks, and whether they would finally manage to win a professional basketball championship next season. "They need a shooter who can score at the end of the game," he said, echoing the thoughts of thousands of Knicks fans.
 "What about the baseball strike?" a beachgoer asked.
 
'We Never Had a Strike'
 "I was a union representative for my 10 years in the National Basketball Association," Mr. Bradley said. "We never had a strike and had pretty good results. I think a long strike endangers support by the fans. I wish they'd go back and play ball."
 He deftly turned aside a challenge to play one-on-one basketball for $100, saying that if he won it might hurt his challenger's feelings. And he heard numerous suggestions, including one for teaching students the techniques of transcendental meditation to improve their test scores.
 One question came from a blond 5-year-old boy who had obviously been coached. "What's a politician?" he asked.
 "Someone who is elected by the people," Mr. Bradley replied.
 "Thanks," the youngster said, as he wheeled and ran back to the wet sand at edge of the surf.

HEADLINE: A Triumph of Faith, and Just in Time

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The Jewish New Year has long been known as the Season of Renewal, but recent events at Congregation Derech Emunoh, the landmark synagogue of the Rockaways, have infused the term with vivid new meaning.
 Eight weeks ago, the 90-year-old synagogue was seriously damaged by a suspicious early-morning fire that tore open holes in its roof, ceiling and walls. Both the neo-Georgian building, set amid a wasteland of empty urban-renewal blocks, and its congregation had begun to crumble years before, and the fire seemed likely to disperse the tiny remnant of members forever.
 
 But after the fire something happened that has amazed even those who bravely bluffed the membership into believing that it could hold together after the destruction. First, the city, which bought the property in the Arverne section of Queens back in the days of land clearance, agreed to pay thousands of dollars for emergency repairs, which synagogue leaders had despaired of affording.
 Then, week after week, dozens of Jewish families from the Rockaways, many of whom had no ties to Derech Emunoh or any other synagogue, began to show up on Sundays to pitch in with the cleanup. And after they had hauled out bags of charred debris, they came back the next Saturday morning for Sabbath services, holding prayer books that had not been opened in years. A group of parents even decided to start a 15-student Sunday school, unknown within the synagogue walls for three decades.
 
Sermons of Hope
 Now, a 600-seat sanctuary that could barely attract the quorum of 10 men was regularly filled with the voices of 25 or 30 congregants. And when Rosh ha-Shanah services begin on Tuesday morning, as many as 80 worshipers are expected to hear the blowing of the ram's horn.
 All talk of the synagogue's demise has ended, and its officials are now daring to contemplate the possibility of raising money to repair the building's earlier structural problems. David Cohen, the synagogue's rabbi, is not ashamed to sprinkle his conversation with risen-from-the-ashes metaphors, since they are rarely so appropriate.
 "For thousands of years, every time the Jewish people felt they were near the end, they found their blessing in their punishment," said Rabbi Cohen, who is having no trouble preparing his sermons this year. "The key to Jewish survival is discovering the solution amid the ashes."
 Many new members said they had long driven past Derech Emunoh (the name means "the way of faith") but had never imagined that the battered old building at Beach 67th Street and Rockaway Beach Boulevard contained a congregation they might find appealing. After learning about the fire, many stopped by to see if they could help, and discovered other families with similar interests doing the same thing.
 "My husband and I had not gone to temple since we were married 10 years ago," said Elise Nadel, who lives about 20 blocks away in Rockaway Beach. "But I'm a Rockaway girl, and it just pulled your heart out to see a temple looking like that. So we started going every Sunday, washing all the soot and tacking down the carpeting, and now it feels good to be back in the faith."
 Ms. Nadel and her husband, Stuart, and her parents will all be in the pews this week, and the couple has enrolled their daughter in Sunday school. Although the previously nonobservant family members are slightly startled to find themselves in an Orthodox synagogue, where men and women sit separately, they have adjusted quickly.
 
The City as Partner
 Those who attend High Holy Day services will see a 20-foot hole in the ceiling, just in front of the altar, but the roof and the exterior walls have been patched by the city to keep out the elements. Mara Neville, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which owns the building, said the city spent $5,000 to $8,000 to repair the exterior, pull down the hanging portions of the ceiling, and remove debris. If the synagogue can raise some of the money to renovate the rest of the building, she said, the city will consider giving it the title to the building for a nominal fee.
 "We are very pleased with the city's cooperation," said Robert Wein, the congregation's president and a third-generation member. "Without their support I doubt if we would have been able to open up for the holidays. And of course I hope they'll go a little further with us."
 The building has no heating system -- vandals stole most of it a few years ago -- and normally closes for the winter after Yom Kippur. But because so many new members now rely on it for regular services, generating some of their own heat through song and prayer, Rabbi Cohen said it would stay open this year for as long as members can tolerate the chill.
 "Who would have imagined that this fire would have a good side?" he said. Invoking the name of the great Biblical prophet of renewal and hope, he added, "Only someone like Isaiah -- he would understand."

The End of 'the Movement'

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
How much influence would the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wield today had he not been assassinated? Not much, I suspect. Dr. King's moral authority rested upon the indisputable fact that African-Americans in the South were disfranchised by a white power structure that stopped at nothing to keep its power. The savagery was evident on the evening news, as when children were set upon with dogs and water cannons in the streets of Birmingham.
The passing of racism's most visible forms -- and the corresponding rise of a black elite -- would have required Dr. King to become more than just a champion of the African-American oppressed. His condemnation of the Vietnam War foreshadowed what might have become a broader strategy. So did his failed fair-housing campaign in Chicago in 1966. There were no dogs and water cannons in Chicago to inspire public outrage. Civil rights rhetoric by itself was no match for a patronage machine that could appear in blackface when it needed to. Dr. King's rallies were anemically attended. The machine, with black underbosses like the legendary Congressman William Dawson, sent Dr. King home defeated. 
 African-American political empowerment nationally would have forced Dr. King to transform himself from a roving savior without portfolio into something less grand -- a Congressman, say, from Georgia. That same empowerment has rendered traditional civil rights rhetoric implausible. African-Americans cannot sing "We Shall Overcome" when so many of them already have.
The black middle class, barely evident in the 60's, is now thriving and clearly visible. At the time of the "I Have A Dream" speech, African-Americans were still struggling to secure the vote, and there were probably fewer than a thousand black elected officials nationwide. Today there are more than eight times that many, including a 40-member Congressional Black Caucus.
The poor have not disappeared. But what afflicts them is not remediable through traditional civil rights strategies. Homicide, drug addiction, adolescent pregnancy, illiteracy -- and the economic despair that drives them -- are not "civil rights" problems per se. Marches and rallies and sit-ins can never reach them. It is not surprising, then, that the civil rights establishment is losing its influence or that the alphabet soup of civil rights organizations -- S.N.C.C., C.O.R.E., even Dr. King's S.C.L.C. -- have ceased to be important.
Enter the N.A.A.C.P., with a declining membership, the largest budget deficit in its history and a growing identity crisis. The Rev. Benjamin Chavis deepened the crisis with his spendthrift style and his bid for an alliance with the black Muslim leader, Louis Farrakhan. But the crisis of purpose predates Mr. Chavis. Consider the deficit. Nearly half -- $1.4 million -- results not from scholarships for the poor or guidance to wayward boys, but from expenditures for the annual N.A.A.C.P. Image Awards, essentially a televised celebrity party. The organization that helped win Brown v. Board of Education has been reduced to sponsoring social activity for the beautiful people.
Mr. Chavis also fell for the delusion that an alliance with Mr. Farrakhan would spark a new, 60's-style movement. Mr. Chavis and Kweisi Mfume, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, apparently envied Mr. Farrakhan for the tens of thousands of people who are said to appear at black Muslim stadium gatherings. At work here was nostalgia for massive crowds like the one Dr. King addressed in Washington 30 years ago. But nostalgia is a liability considering the job at hand.
The N.A.A.C.P. and what is left of "the movement" need fresh direction. Some sound suggestions were laid out in a speech last month by Hugh Price, the incoming president and C.E.O. of the National Urban League. "We must not let ourselves and, especially, our children fall into the paranoid trap of thinking that racism accounts for all that plagues us," he said. Mr. Price proposed a national Youth Development Fund, paid for partly by successful African-Americans, that would broaden opportunities for children of the poor. "We African Americans who have made it must tithe . . . to see to it that those of our children whom the civil rights movement hasn't yet touched also have a real chance to succeed."
The N.A.A.C.P.'s next executive director needs to take a close look at that speech. BRENT STAPLES

HEADLINE: U.S. Broadcasts Keep Cubans Posted in Crisis;
Far From a Failure

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"It should be clear after 35 years to Fidel Castro and his Government that the way he has been managing the affairs of the island is a failure" -- Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff (news article, Aug. 25).
In the last 35 years, Cuba has achieved universal health care, something the United States has been unable, or unwilling, to do. It has a higher literacy rate (near 100 percent) and a lower infant mortality rate than many places in the United States. A larger percentage of its population graduates from college. There is no problem of homelessness in Cuba. Until recently, everyone received basic goods and services, although there have never been many luxuries. Now everyone suffers the same hardships, although priority is given to the care of infants and pregnant women, the elderly and the sick. 
 All this was achieved not because of aid from the Soviet Union, but despite the economic embargo. Similar amounts of aid from the United States to El Salvador during the 80's achieved no such progress -- if El Salvador had the same social agenda as Cuba there would not have been a civil war. By any standards other than the United States Government's, Cuba cannot be called a failure.
American foreign policy is not about democracy or humanitarian concerns; Cuba policy is no exception. It is, however, usually in our perceived self-interest; in this case Cuba is an exception.
There is a persuasive argument that the interests of the United States would be better served by opening trade and allowing American companies to take advantage of the opportunities as they are doing in Vietnam. But our Cuba policy serves no one's interests -- it is simply the implacable vendetta of a schoolyard bully toward the "weakling" who won't knuckle under.

HEADLINE: BOAT SHOWS;
For the Revived Boat Industry, There's Blue Seas, Nothing but Blue Seas

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
The boating industry woke up last winter from a deep recessionary slumber. And now, with sales still looking lively, marine dealers have developed a relatively upbeat mood for this year's fall boat show season.
With industry predictions for a 15 to 20 percent increase in boating retail sales for 1994 -- a figure approaching $13 billion -- manufacturers plan to flood the shows with new models and marine accessories. While the market still is a long ways from its $18 billion peak in 1988, retailers are mixing caution with equal parts of enthusiasm. 
 "It's the old pinch-me theory," said Greg Proteau, spokesman for the National Marine Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group. "Is it really this good? Barring any world calamity -- which could throw ice water on all this real fast -- we think there's another year in it."
Among the first of the fall exhibits is the New York In-Water Boat Show this week, Thursday-Sunday, at the South Street Seaport Museum in lower Manhattan. More than 100 craft are expected to be on display, an increase from about 60 boats at the show's debut last year.
Hemmed in between the museum's historic tall ships, the Peking and the Wavertree, the new boats will include the 72-foot Inspiration, a $500,000 German sailboat that has five staterooms, and the Lazzara 76, a $1.2 million custom powerboat built in Tampa, Fla., with three decks and twin 1,000 horsepower engines. There will also be small boats at the show, including fishing boats, multihulls, inflatables and daysailers.
Display tents at the South Street site will exhibit marine equipment and accessories and will offer information on how to finance and insure a new boat.
"The feeling is that everyone is very positive," said Jeff Holland, spokesman for the New York show. "Everyone certainly has had a very busy summer." Holland's group, Annapolis Boat Shows, also has scheduled its regular shows in Annapolis, Md., this fall: the United States Sailboat Show, Oct. 6-10; and the United States Powerboat Show, Oct. 13-16.
"Virtually every major production sailboat manufacturer has five or six models in the Annapolis shows," Holland said. Hunter Marine, one of the largest American sailboat manufacturers, plans to take 11 models to the Annapolis sailboat show, he said. Among them is the Hunter 26, an innovative sailboat that includes an electric auxiliary engine.
 
Fishing With the Captains
 Besides an increase in volume, the industry also is coming up with new ideas to keep its new-found momentum going. At the Norwalk International In-Water Boat Show Sept. 22-25 in East Norwalk, Conn., a four-day round of fishing seminars by experienced boat captains is scheduled.
And at the Newport International Boat Show, Sept. 15-18 in Newport, R.I., organizers plan to make sailboats and powerboats of 20-40 feet available for cruising by novice boaters. Instructors will be on board.
The Atlantic City In-Water Power Boat Show, this Thursday through Sunday, plans to show new sport fishing boats as well as performance motor yachts at the Frank S. Farley State Marina. For the first time, the show also will have a special section of pre-owned, late-model boats for sale.
 
 
 
MAKING WAVES
 Seven sailors are slated to be inducted Saturday into the America's Cup Hall of Fame at the Herreshoff Marine Museum in Bristol, R.I. Among those being honored are VICTOR A. ROMAGNA, a former member of the New York Yacht Club's America's Cup Committee. Romagna, of Severna Park, Md., was also a crew member on three successful 12-Meter cup defenders: Columbia, in 1958; Weatherly, in 1962, and Intrepid, in 1967. Also being inducted is SIR JAMES HARDY, the Australian cup skipper who raced the 12-Meter Gretel II in 1970; Southern Cross in 1974, and Australia in 1980. Other yachtsmen to be enshrined, all deceased, are: Edward Burgess, W. Starling Burgess, C. Sherman Hoyt, C. Oliver Iselin, and John Cox Stevens.
Twenty skippers from five countries are expected to gather Saturday in Northeast Harbor, Me., for the 1994 International One Design Class World Championship. The 33-foot boat, better known as the I.O.D., was designed in the 1930's by Bjarne Aas of Norway and introduced to racing in the United States in 1938. Twelve of the original 14 I.O.D.'s are sailing in the Northeast Harbor Fleet. The Maine chapter has 27 boats competing on a regular basis, making it the largest fleet of I.O.D.'s in the world, said SYDNEY ROBERTS ROCKEFELLER, an I.O.D. race organizer and competitor from Northeast Harbor. The world championship also is drawing sailors from other United States fleets, as well as from Norway, Scotland, Sweden and Bermuda.

HEADLINE: N.F.L. '94;
25 Years Later, Monday Night Is a Fall Classic

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
At its silver anniversary, ABC's "Monday Night Football" is a certifiable institution. When the Raiders play the 49ers tomorrow night, the game will get its predictably high rating. If form holds, Year 25 will find "M.N.F." in the top 10 of all prime-time series, as it has been since the 1990-91 season.
But before "Monday Night Football" stormed the football kingdom in 1970, before the first team of Keith Jackson, Howard Cosell and Don Meredith yielded after Year 1 to Cosell, Meredith and Frank Gifford, the National Football League entertained thoughts of "Friday Night Football," or "Monday Night Football" on CBS or NBC. 
 "I remember Pete Rozelle and I going to meet Lee Iacocca, when he was at Ford, to sponsor 'Friday Night Football,' and he showed great interest," said Art Modell, the Cleveland Browns owner and longtime chief of the N.F.L.'s television committee. "But then Congress prohibited Friday night football until high school and college games were over for the year. They passed a law."
Roone Arledge, then the president of ABC Sports, first suggested that football air Mondays in prime time, but Rozelle, the N.F.L. commissioner, offered the slot to CBS and NBC. "It was tantalizingly close that we wouldn't get it," said Arledge, now the president of ABC News. But NBC and CBS passed.
 
Back Then, Who Knew?
 Back then, there was no expectation that pro football would work on a prime-time, work-and-school night. Would people stay up for a 9 P.M. (Eastern) game that lasted until midnight? Would sponsors buy? Would viewers accept three in a booth? Would they accept Cosell? Would women watch?
"ABC was a poor third and had nowhere to go but up," said Modell. ABC acquired "Monday Night Football" for a first-season payment of $8.5 million. Inflation and success has caught up with ABC's rights payment: last year, ABC renewed the tenure of "M.N.F." for a four-year total of $920 million.
The "M.N.F." era began on Sept. 21, 1970, with the Jets playing the Browns.
"No one else in the league wanted to host the darned thing," said Modell, who remained nervous until a record crowd of 85,000 fans jammed Municipal Stadium and he knew something different was happening.
"It was about the third week," said Arledge. "Dallas was losing 30-0 to St. Louis. I had had a problem getting Don to be himself. Then Don started talking about what it was like playing for Dallas when they were losing big." The Cosell-Meredith rapport came alive. "And the ratings were great," Arledge said. "It proved you could have an awful game and still have an audience watch."
"Monday Night Football" became more than watching the game. How much would fans love and hate Cosell? When would Meredith sing? When would Gifford get a word in edgewise, or make a factual blunder? Could Alex Karras replace Meredith? What were Fran Tarkenton, O. J. Simpson and Joe Namath doing there? Could Dandy Don return? And on and on.
Since 1987, "Monday Night Football" has had its longest period of stability, with Gifford, Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf the threesome. When Michaels and Gifford were a one-year duo in 1986, Gifford had to give up his play-by-play role.
"It was difficult," Gifford said. "Dan and I in our first year had a difficult time finding where we belonged." Added Dierdorf: "When you share a job, you don't say everything that comes to your mind. It's very difficult. There's a lot of sacrifice in how we do our job."
Arledge, who still watches, is intrigued by how the threesome works together.
"It's remarkable how they've fit three in the booth when their roles aren't as distinctive as Howard, Don and Frank were," he said. "You really don't need three in the booth, and it only works rarely."
 
A Little More Low-Key
 The Michaels-Gifford-Dierdorf combination is less combustible than the Cosell-Meredith-Gifford trio, with the focus trained far less on trying to be outrageous than the earlier team. Michaels is the best play-by-play man the series has ever had, Dierdorf a highly prepared analyst who rubs some the wrong way with his blunt candor. Gifford continues earnestly, retaining the easygoing affability he has had since he was a Giant.
"In a way, I think this is the Golden Age," said Michaels. "I won't diminish what was done in the past, because if it wasn't good then, it would have gone away. The only numbers to go by are the ratings. In prior years, 'Monday Night Football" was a huge success when it was 24th out of 54 prime-time shows. Now we're in the top 10 of 120."
Added Gifford: "We do the game so much better than it was done then. Our memories are clouded with nostaglia. But I was there back then and let me tell you, it wasn't all that good."
ABC nearly altered the "Monday Night Football" chemistry this season when it bid for John Madden. It was virtually a done deal, until NBC bid more, then Fox even more. The move would have shifted Dierdorf to college football, which was not a promotion, but one he never complained about publicly, to his credit.
"Dan is very valuable to us," said Dennis Swanson, the president of ABC Sports. "Whether on 'Monday Night Football,' college football, or in boxing."
ABC has altered "M.N.F." a bit. Halftime will be given over to Brent Musburger and Sports Illustrated's Peter King for an update program. In addition, Lynn Swann will be the game's sideline reporter, and country singer Hank Williams Jr. will be back to sing the opening theme song.
Even in its slightly altered state, "Monday Night Football" is the bell cow, as Jackson would say, of ABC Sports. It's a prime-time vehicle, commanding prime-time dollars.
"We've circled the wagons around 'Monday Night Football' because it's our highest priority," said Swanson, "more than buying Olympic rights, which are an every four-year package, not every week in prime time."

HEADLINE: Economists Know About Bias in Lending

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Redlining Under Attack" (Business Day, Aug. 30) leaves the impression that most informed economists do not believe there is any discrimination in mortgage lending. This impression is wildly inaccurate. The Boston Fed study is highly respected by most experts. Although a couple of studies, such as you cite, have found ways to manipulate away the Boston Fed's findings, the most careful re-examination to date of the Boston Fed data by Carr and Megbolugbe in the Journal of Housing Research (1993) confirms the conclusion of bias.
Moreover, the Boston Fed study addresses only discrimination in mortgage acceptance. Other studies provide clear evidence of discrimination in applications procedures, branch office locations and other aspects of lender behavior. 
 Some economists may, as you say, conclude that discrimination does not exist because it is "implausible" according to their models of lending behavior. They have it backward. Their models clearly are contradicted by the evidence.
You also perpetuate the unsubstantiated conclusion that programs to increase loans to minorities will automatically require subsidies from other borrowers and will "waste capital." Discrimination is denying loans to qualified minorities or setting up branch offices in a way that discourages minority applications. Eliminating these types of discriminatory acts would not require subsidies.
Moreover, the evidence indicates that lenders often rely on outmoded rules of thumb and do not take advantage of all available opportunities to make money. Lending programs around the country based on nontraditional underwriting criteria for evaluating credit risks in low- and moderate-income communities often have rates of return at least as high as traditional loans have. Most of these programs would not exist without the Community Reinvestment Act and other legislation designed in part to increase loans to minorities.
Though you say that incentives to encourage investment in minority neighborhoods may "make lenders more aware of the profit opportunities in neglected areas," you largely perpetuate the scare tactics that some commentators have used to undermine badly needed improvements in the enforcement of fair lending legislation. We should be bending over backward to provide credit opportunities for minority families, not thinking up excuses for retaining the status quo.

HEADLINE: What 2.5 Million Jobs?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I wish Robert Reich would tell us where he gets the 2.5 million new jobs figure (Op-Ed, Aug. 31). Are those more minimum-wage jobs like the 400,000 that President Clinton is fond of quoting?
Those of us who run businesses don't see where all these new jobs are. What we do see is a continuous and persistent dismantling of the middle class. 
 Perhaps our political leaders don't get it; it's the middle class that pays the bills. What happens when this source of revenue is gone? On Labor Day 1994 let the Government commit itself to saving the American middle class.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER EAST SIDE;
Neighborhood Picks Its Issue, And Differences Run Deep

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
The West Side fights itself over a highway project. The East Village implodes between anarchists, neo-punks and young professionals. But there will always be a harmonious Upper East Side, or at least so it seemed until a plan surfaced to hire 500 security guards to patrol from 59th to 96th Streets.
The ensuing clash among Upper East Siders has cast their neighborhood's diverse elements into relief and underlined the inherent tensions between them. Although no one predicts a new era of hostility, the differences run deep. 
 For instance, division over a proposed property tax to finance the plan, which would cost some $20 million a year, has revealed an economic and geographic split between the wealthy areas along Fifth, Madison and Park Avenues, and more modest sections east and north.
Despite the Upper East Side's tony image as New York's wealthiest neighborhood, with multimillion-dollar co-ops, many residents there are middle class, and 6 percent fall below the poverty line.
"Most people say the Upper East Side: isn't everybody there rich, famous and white?" said Nancy Wackstein, director of Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, a charity. "But it's not all Jackie O. We have a homeless shelter, 80 families enrolled in Headstart with a waiting list and many more needs." To win broad support, proponents hope to exempt low-income buildings from the tax and charge others a range from $5 to $35 a month per apartment.
The security plan is the project of a major Upper East Side player: Howard Milstein, a developer whose empire includes Emigrant Savings Bank, the Milford Plaza Hotel and the Douglas Elliman firm, which manages more than 100 Upper East Side coop and condo buildings.
Many of the Upper East Side's block associations and grassroots tenant groups have a populist stripe; to them, the plan's origins made it instantly suspect. Dr. Georgette Bennett, a criminologist for Douglas Elliman, said: "We have to get rid of this elitist bugaboo -- this is not for Park Avenue matrons and their grandchildren, but for everyone on the Upper East Side, poor and rich."
While some Upper East Siders wield influence around the world, they hold no monopoly on neighborhood decisions. Power is split among constituencies like the many civic groups, prominent schools (Dalton, Brearley), the business community and hospitals and museums.
Elected officials have the final say on the security plan, but many are uncommitted as they track the controversy and monitor Community Board 8, the local sounding board.
Of course, the proposal also raises issues that cut across economic lines, like crime and taxes.
Philosophical divisions are also at play. Some see the proposal as a community walling itself off, and as an unseemly display of wealth. Some fear that a large security program, with limited public control, would become a major new force overshadowing existing groups.
"They're afraid we're some sort of monolith that's going to steamroller them, but we're really not in competition and want to work with them," said Dr. Bennett. But Elizabeth Ashby, president of Carnegie Hill Neighbors, which raises donations for its patrol, said: "We don't want to sacrifice what we have now." BRUCE LAMBERT

HEADLINE: Banish Bulldozers, Save the Community

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
Yolanda Garcia leans back in her battered white Camaro and points to a vacant lot surrounded by a fence topped with razor wire. "That's the senior center," she says calmly, surely. "It will have 72 units, and we want to maybe add small rooms to each unit because so many grandparents have children now." Her gaze moves across the street and stops on the line of decrepit two-story storefronts. "That's our one-acre park."
On the scale of obsession, she ranks in the serious business category somewhere between Che Guevara and Carrie Nation, with her highest scores on practicality and the sense of meaning. Her passion is not only Melrose Commons, the development plan for 35 square blocks of the South Bronx that she has worked to modify since she first heard of it in November 1992, banishing bulldozers and bringing in socially aware architectural designs. Her passion is the community she knew the original plan would destroy, a community, threatened by drugs, poverty and disinvestment, that she means to resurrect, if not outright create. 
 It has meant rising at 7 A.M. to work a full day at her family-owned carpet store before going to meetings -- hundreds a year -- that stretch deep into the night. With the group she founded to fight to modify the original plans, We Stay/Nos Quedamos, the meetings go the longest. "We had to make an agreement that the meetings would stop at midnight, because before you knew it, it would be 2 in the morning," she says, amused somehow by her own tenacity.
It means working with few resources beyond her own vision and commitment, and the trust in finding the same in others. And it means outarguing, outsmarting, outwaiting and outlasting some of the city's most accomplished bureaucrats.
"I basically lived at City Hall in late April, May, part of June," says Ms. Garcia, an unprepossessing woman in her 40's whose brown hair is secured with a silky ivory tie.
That was when Joseph B. Rose, the head of the City Planning Commission, tried to amend the review process, inserting language that the commission felt would add necessary flexibility. But Ms. Garcia saw it as an attempt to remove adequate review periods. "That would have torn down everything we created," Ms. Garcia says in her not-surprised, not-tired, not-willing-to-do-anything-but-prevail voice. "I had to meet with everybody!"
Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the commission, said, "She certainly is a visionary. We could use more of them."
By turns, she could be confused with an urban sociologist, a political economist, a city planner or a politician. This last prompts a knowing laugh.
"They would kick me out," she explains. "I have too many new ideas. I would be pro-people, not pro-party." ANDREA KANNAPELL

2 Experts' Collectible-Car Picks

BYLINE: By Charles McEwen

 BODY:
Each year, two experts on collectible cars, Dave Brownell and Rick Cole, put together lists of vintage automobilies that they think are good buys right now.
 The collector-car market has been particularly hard hit in the last few years. Prices had become overheated in the 1980's, driven up by speculators, and once the recession took hold the market deflated.
 Amid the relatively good buys, which are the best of the good?
 Mr. Brownell, the editor of special Interest Autos magazine and Hemmings Motor News, a monthly compendium of ads for old cars, parts and services for collectors, has chosen some "sleepers" that could prove to be solid investments while providing some fun in the meantime.
 Here are Mr. Borwnell's selections and comments:
 1961-67 Lincoln Continental four-door convertible -- "Impeccably understated styling, constructed to nearly Rolls-Royce standards. Current asking prices range from around $2,000 for shaggy unrestored cars to about $17,000 for show-ready restorations. Buy the best one your budget allows because they are very complex and therefore expensive cars to restore."
 1968-70 Dodge Charger R/T -- "A muscle car with some luxurious touches, as opposed to stripped-down corporate cousins like the Plymouth Road Runner." A partly restored '68 was offered in a recent Hemmings ad for $3,500, while on the same page a "recently restored" rust-free car from California, had an asking price of $8,000.
 1961-73 Volvo P1800, 1800S, 1800E and 1800ES -- "Built mainly for style rather than speed, these handsome coupes and sport wagons were Volvo's flagship in the United States for a dozen years." Early models are somewhat underpowered and badly susceptible to rust, he said, and the 2-liter 1800E is known for fuel-injection problems. Prices range from $4,500 to $11,500 depending on condition.
 1973 Corvette L-48 -- "Offers impressive performance even when measured against today's cars. The big difference is that a good '73 L-48 convertible will cost about one-fifth the sticker of a new Vette drop-top." Cars with removable 'T-tops" cost even less than the convertibles. The average asking price for a ready-to-drive L-48 is about $12,000.
 1969-73 Porsche 911T -- "These attractive coupes seem like a giveaway at around $10,000 for excellent examples. To be fair, the 911T is hardly perfect. Older Porsches are no stranger to rust, sometimes chronically so, and such cars should be strictly avoided because they cost the earth to restore.
 Every year for the last 10 years, Mr. Cole, a partner in the World Classic Auction and Exposition Company in Danville, Calif., has published his 'Gold List" of cars that he expects to appreciate significantly in the next five years. Here are his recent selections:
 1972-74 BMW 3.0 CS Coupe -- Current value: $8,000 to $14,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.
 1940's woodie sedans and wagons -- Current value: $22,500 to $27,500. Five-year projection: up to $35,000.
 1951-62 Mercedes-Benz 300 sedan -- Current value: $8,000 to $15,000. Five-year projection: up to $30,000.
 1955-62 MGA 1500 and 1600 roadster -- Current value $8,000 to $12,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.
 1950--51 Mercury Monterey coupe -- Current value: $8,000 to $12,000. Five-year projection: up to $20,000.
 1961-67 Chevrolet Impala and Impala SS convertibles -- Current value: $10,000 to $15,000. Five-year projection: up to $35,000.
 1963-65 Alfa Romeo Giulie, Spider and Spider Veloce -- Current value: $13,000 to $16,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.
 1956-67 Volkswagen microbus -- Current value: $1,000 to $8,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.
 1969-71 Jaguar XKE roadster -- in average condition (to be driven rather than displayed at car shows). Current value: $18,000 to $25,000. Five-year projection: up to $35,000.
 1959-64 Plymouth Fury and Sport Fury convertibles -- Current value: $8,000 to $16,000. Five-year projection: up to $25,000.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Seeking Classrooms That Are Classless

BYLINE: By Anne Thompson; Anne Thompson is a writer based in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
FOR Hollywood executives, deciding where to send their children to school is a test of values.
The fancy private schools are falling into disfavor among many liberal parents searching for educational environments that de-emphasize power, prestige and wealth. Some have opted for alternative schools with progressive curriculums. But as those schools, too, burgeon with student bodies largely from the upper crust of Hollywood, a new group of entertainment decision makers is choosing lesser-known private schools or, of all things, public education. 
 Like New York, Los Angeles offers a range of private schools with traditional programs designed to give students the best chance get into the best colleges. Parents in the Los Angeles area who seek admission for their children to venerated institutions like John Thomas Dye, Curtis and the Harvard-Westlake preparatory school must do the requisite hustle of admissions tests, power-recommendations and promises of large donations on top of tuition that can be close to $10,000.
One movie mogul, whose children went to Harvard-Westlake, described it as a "snob school" where "every kid knew what their fathers did." He remembered hearing the son of one player brag, "My Daddy's movie really opened well last night."
But many entertainment baby boomers who take pride in their liberal credentials reject the prep-school classroom in favor of a more progressive "developmental" education. They send their children to a new breed of private institution that has sprung up in the last 20 years, represented by schools like Crossroads, Wildwood or the Center for Early Education. At these schools, one studio executive said, teachers "talk about the inner child as opposed to getting into college."
Even those schools, however, cost from $7,000 to $10,000 a year and, without large endowments, are highly dependent on generous parents. "At our 7 A.M. interview at Crossroads," one studio production executive recalled, "it was made clear we'd have to write a large check. We liked the school, but my wife and I said, 'forget this.' "
Many entertainment executives have no problem sending their sons and daughters to school with the offspring of other industry heavyweights. One producer proudly confided that he had a top-secret list of celebrity home phone numbers from his child's school, the Center for Early Education, which a less enthusiastic producer called "the Center for Early Materialism." Some parents love to boast that their children go to school with the children of -- it always seems to be -- Steven Spielberg and Bruce Springsteen.
"These kids have more money than they should have," said a screenwriter whose children attend Crossroads and who, like a number of executives, requested anonymity.
"You go to their houses, and they have more toys than they know what do with," the screenwriter said. "There's no getting around it. You work very hard in L.A. to keep realistic values in your kids and not let them feel entitled to this enormous privilege."
One studio president seeking a more "normal" school for his daughter said he refused to send her to Wildwood because it would be "like going to the studio commissary." So he and his wife enrolled her in the Santa Monica private school P.S. 1, "an unpretentious liberal hippie school," he said. "I want her to be someone who likes to learn."
When the producer Dawn Steel ("Cool Runnings") was checking out private schools for her daughter, Rebecca, she realized she was looking for a more socially conscious educational message than what she said she had heard at an orientation for several hundred parents at the Curtis School. When a social studies teacher announced that she told her economics class that "Daddy makes the money, and Mommy spends it," Ms. Steel said she angrily bolted from her seat, turned to her friends in the crowd and said, "If any of you send your children here, I'll never talk to you again."
She selected a private school, Oakwood, in the untrendy San Fernando Valley. "It was recommended by my sister-in-law who was not in the business," Ms. Steel said. "The entertainment industry makes up about 5 percent of the students. There's an economic balance across the spectrum, from middle class to scholarship kids. I don't want my child to have unhealthy values."
Surprisingly, many entertainment industry parents looking for a broader educational experience for their children find the answer in the public schools of Santa Monica or Beverly Hills or even the beleaguered, underfinanced Los Angeles Unified School District. These parents would rather spend the money to move to a neighborhood with a good public school than enter the private school rat race.
One studio production president, who is relocating to Santa Monica for just that reason, said, "I want my kids to stay out of the Hollywood scene."
Caldecott Chubb, an executive at Alphaville Productions who was educated at East Coast private schools, is moving to Beverly Hills and going public.
"I find the private school situation repugnant," he said. "I'm repulsed at the idea of sending our 4-year-old on admissions interviews or to school with the children of people in this business. I want a school where social values are taught."
Rachel Pfeffer, production chief for Robert Redford's Wildwood Productions, said when she tells acquaintances that her daughter goes to Roscomare Road public school, near their home in Sherman Oaks, "people look at me funny. They can't believe the education could be as good as private schools." Not all public schools, she acknowledged, "are this good," adding that she and other parents put money and effort into the school.
One family opted to leave the city altogether to escape the industry influence. Tom Pollock, Universal Pictures chairman, and his family moved up the coast from Los Angeles, and his children now attend Santa Barbara's more diverse public schools.

HEADLINE: New Tourist Lure: Dolphin Watching

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY 

DATELINE: SEA ISLE CITY

 BODY:
IT was a show that almost seemed to be choreographed by Sea World in California, but these leaping, tumbling dolphins, only 10 feet from the bow of Capt. Rich George's excursion boat, Princess, were local performers just being themselves. They are part of New Jersey's latest tourism splash -- dolphin watching.
On a cruise along the shoreline of Ocean City, north of here, the boat came upon two pods of the bottle-nosed dolphins. For 40 minutes, the two dozen or so mammals cavorted along a mile-long strip of the beachfront to the delight of about a thousand people gathered at the water's edge. 
 Each time the dolphins breached, they were met by cheers and screams usually associated with Fourth of July fireworks or roller-coaster rides. Surfers tried to keep up with them, but it was the dolphins that were catching the waves, pulling out only yards from the beach to go back and do it all again.
"What I like best is when they flip over on their backs and go backward," said Jessie Serdikoff, 4, of Brigantine, who was on the Princess with her parents, Beth and Michael, and her 7-year-old sister, Molly.
One of those who caught the dolphin act from the boardwalk in Ocean City was Kimberly Huston of Ashtabula, Ohio. "I was surprised to see dolphins in New Jersey, especially that close to people," she said.
Boat captains, including Captain George, say the dolphins have become so popular that they have converted their sea fishing operations to dolphin- and whale-watching cruises over the last four years. Ron Robbins, owner of the Whale Watcher in Cape May, said this new segment of eco-tourism, concentrated mostly along the state's southern coast, is producing "annual revenues in the millions" for captains and local economies.
In Cape May and Wildwood alone, fewer than a dozen dolphin boats will have collected more than 60,000 fares before the end of summer. Mr. Robbins said his boat would take in $400,000 in passenger fares. The two- or three-hour trips cost about $15 for an adult, less for children.
Although the bottle-nosed dolphin (Tursiops trunkatus) has been the subject of intensive studies, scientists and other observers are just starting to collect data on its population and behavior in New Jersey. Some say the migratory and predatory animals breed, calve and feed here from June to late September; others say April to December.
Nor is there consensus on whether there are hundreds or thousands of dolphins along the coast. Attempts to count them have been mostly local and sporadic, officials say.
"There is not a lot of in-depth information on them," said James Hall, assistant commissioner for natural resources in the State Department of Environmental Protection.
Robert Schoelkopf, the founder and director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, a private nonprofit organization at Brigantine, said there are about a dozen dolphin strandings each year, up from an average of only two a year in the late 1980's. Strandings of all sea animals -- including giant sea turtles, seals and whales, which, like the bottle-nosed, are endangered -- totaled 123 last year, up from about 30 in 1986.
"The total this year for all mammals is already 91," Mr. Schoelkopf said, adding that "many of our strandings come in the fall and winter, so we're far from through." How much of the increase is a result of reporting of stranding through public awareness or growth in the animal populations is not known, Mr. Schoelkopf said.
The rising popularity of dolphin watching has not been without its problems. The Stranding Center, which is the only group in the state licensed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to rescue or even touch these creatures, says commercial and recreational boaters are killing two or three dolphins each year. Boats, as well as water scooters and helicopters, are injuring or harassing many others, Mr. Schoelkopf said.
At the request of the Stranding Center, Assemblyman John F. Gaffney, a Republican from Atlantic County, has introduced a package of three marine mammal protection bills. One would establish state regulations and distances for viewing dolphins and other mammals from the air or water. It sets up penalties of $100 to $3,000 for each offense.
Another measure would provide operating money for the center by creating a $5 renewal fee on state-issued wildlife conservation license plates, which cost $50. Each renewal fee would provide $3 to the center and $2 for research. The other bill would allocate $25,000 to the center for the purchase of a heavy-duty ambulance to replace the 1982 model now used by the center to transport stranded mammals.
Opponents of the measures include the Department of Environmental Protection, which contends that enforcement of the provisions at sea would be almost impossible. "There is a general concern about the ability to actually enforce those regulations and the sense is that there may not be a significant problem to begin with," Mr. Hall said.
All three measures cleared the Assembly's Environment Committee last month and are expected to go to the full Assembly in several weeks.
Although the dolphins and even larger members of the whale family have been playing in the New Jersey surf for hundreds of years, the sightseeing cruises, like the stranding reports, have multiplied significantly only in this decade.
Captains and marine mammal experts said in recent interviews that coastal pollution problems of the 1980's, many of which persist, have been drawing widespread public attention to the health of the Atlantic and its denizens of the deep.
 
Sightings Rare to the North
 Rhona St. Claire, assistant curator of marine mammals for the New Jersey State Aquarium at Camden, said the stranding of four dolphins in the Shrewsbury River in Monmouth County last winter, and the recovery of their carcasses there by the Stranding Center, had increased public awareness of the animals in New Jersey.
Linda Riley, a spokeswoman for the aquarium, which has a living ocean exhibit with 45 species of New Jersey fish and mammals, said an excursion sponsored by the aquarium earlier this summer had been a big success. The group spotted 34 dolphins, she said.
Both dolphins and whales and the availability of excursions appear to be more common as one travels south along the state's 127 miles of Atlantic coast. While the mammals are plentiful in Cape May County, for instance, they are said by National Park Service officials and boat captains to be rare at both Sandy Hook and Manasquan Inlet, in Monmouth and northern Ocean Counties.
"We have not had any reports of dolphins this year either by the public or our staff," said Frank Mills, the chief ranger at the Sandy Hook unit of Gateway National Park.
John Bogan of Bogan's Basin in Brielle said that one of the four fishing vessels there goes whale watching in the winter about 15 miles offshore, but that there are not any dolphin-watching boats in the entire Manasquan Inlet area.
 
A Mysterious Ailment
 Mr. Schoelkopf said the fascination with dolphins and whales in the state began in 1987 when 742 of the animals along the East Coast of the United States succumbed to a mysterious ailment and washed ashore. About 90 beached themselves in New Jersey. The cause, he said, was later found to be a viral infection.
Although no one has been able to prove it, there is lingering suspicion among scientists that the virus was carried by pollution.
Bottle-nosed dolphins are now considered a barometer of the quality of the state's ocean water, Mr. Schoelkopf said. The average person attributes their presence to an observably cleaner ocean in this decade, he said.
Boat captains say pods of bottle-nosed dolphins usually range from 3 to 50 individuals. There were more than 2,000 sightings of the animals along the coast last summer but "we don't know yet if that is the number of animals or that each animal is being counted two or three times," Mr. Schoelkopf said.
Bottle-nosed dolphins grow up to 12 feet long and can weigh more than 400 pounds. They feed on blues and menhaden and mate in spring and summer. Ten to 12 months later, they deliver young that weigh up to 25 pounds.
 
Highly Developed Brain
 The animal is famous for its highly developed brain and ultrasonic echolocation ability, whereby it locates and determines the size of its prey and predators from afar with astonishing accuracy.
The bottle-nosed is the quintessential dolphin popularized in movies and in the television show "Flipper." Even though the animals are playful and seem to have an affinity for humans, Ms. St. Claire of the aquarium cautioned swimmers about getting too close.
"People who see the big smile on the dolphin and jump in the water thinking it is Flipper," she said, "may not realize that they could be getting next to a male that weighs several hundred pounds and is in a bad mood. They could really get hurt."
Then there is the tale, told to the passengers by Captain George, about the young male surfer who decided to jump off his board and grab hold of a dolphin beyond the breakers. Apparently perceiving that the swimmer was in trouble, the dolphin rather violently butted him, pushed him through the water and flipped him out of the water and across his surfboard.
"You can bet the guy never tried that again," the captain said.

HEADLINE: A TRY AT A TRUCE OVER POPULATION

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 4

 BODY:
A day before the start of the United Nations population conference, United States and European officials said today that new language was being prepared to assuage Vatican and Islamic fears that the gathering will enshrine abortion as an international right or as a means of family planning.
The European Union has formulated "reinterpretive language" on the use of the word "right" in the conference's preparatory documents because of Vatican complaints that proposals using the word were intended to impart a binding international right to abortion, said Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs and a dominant voice for the United States in preparations for the conference. 
 "The question of quote right unquote has been a controversial issue," Mr. Wirth said at a news conference. "Some people had interpreted the use of the word 'right' in the document as establishing an understood right as is the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, and there is a language that is being proposed by the European Union to define what is meant by 'right.' "
With agreement obtained on most of the conference's guiding document, the diplomatic effort by officials from the United States, Europe and Canada is driven by a desire to prevent Vatican and Islamic concerns from derailing what is seen as a broader agenda: the management of resources as the planet faces potential disaster from population growth.
Since preparatory discussions began in April, the European Union has sought to serve as a moderating influence, whereas the Clinton Administration has been singled out by the Vatican for harsh criticism on proposals on family planning, abortion, contraception and sexuality.
Michael Bohnet, a senior German official whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, said the organization's position would be presented on Monday . "The document before the conference is 92 percent agreed," he said. "I think we are very close to having language that will move us from 92 percent to close to 100 percent."
While the debate may seem to be a matter of semantics, Vatican officials have been in the vanguard of an intensive campaign by Pope John Paul II to prevent the conference from issuing what could be a formal document with broad international legitimacy directly contradicting Roman Catholic doctrine on the sanctity of life from the moment of conception.
 
An Influence on Spending
 The conference will also carry serious financial weight, since its proposals foresee billion-dollar spending to support measures to stabilize the earth's population at 7.27 billion over the next 20 years from the current estimate of 5.66 billion.
"President Clinton and I think this is a unique and historic opportunity to address one of the world's most demanding challenges," Vice President Gore said when he arrived here tonight. Mr. Gore, who is leading the United States delegation, came under direct, personal criticism last month from the Vatican over United States proposals on abortion.
Today, the conference chairwoman, Nafis Sadik, appealed to the delegates from 170 nations attending the eight-day conference not to permit issues over abortion and adolescent sexuality to "obscure its main purpose," which many delegates and officials here say is the status of women in economic development and the regulation of family size.
The Vatican offered no response today to Mr. Wirth's suggestion that a showdown might be averted by quiet diplomacy. Vatican diplomats were not available to clarify their apparently two-track strategy toward the conference, which has so far focused on abortion while ignoring what the Pope has depicted as equally contentious proposals endorsing the distribution of contraceptives and the use of condoms to fight sexually transmitted diseases.
"There are a number of issues that are being worked on," Mr. Wirth said, "and one of those, for example, is abortion, to make sure the abortion is described not in the area of family planning."
The dispute has in large part distracted attention from many areas where the Vatican has raised no objection, like improvements in health care for women in developing countries and in the quality of family life. Nonetheless, the Pope sounded a fresh warning today from his summer residence south of Rome.
"I view the Cairo conference as an historic occasion to focus international policies and economies towards the achievement of worldwide objectives," he said. "But it is necessary to resist the temptation of a dangerous shortcut -- focusing all efforts on the reduction, by whatever means possible, of the birth rate."
While Vatican diplomats have lobbied furiously against conference proposals on abortion, they have refrained from other clauses in the preparatory documents speaking of the need to supply condoms in the battle against AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and of a requirement for the supply of "essential high-quality contraceptives."
Vatican officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the tactic, devised to focus the full energies of the Pope's campaign against abortion, had divided the Vatican delegation between those who believed that objections should have been registered and those who thought that the antiabortion effort was more important.
The maneuvers do not apparently mean an endorsement of contraception and condoms since any of the 170 delegations may register individual objections to specific proposals, decline to sign off on the final package or, Vatican officials say, force a vote to avoid the appearance of consensus.
"The Vatican has never signed," Dr. Sadik said, referring to the last two world population conferences, in Romania in 1974 and in Mexico City in 1984. "They registered their disagreement and therefore did not join the consensus."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Helping Video Makers To Find Their Niches

BYLINE: By PETER M. NICHOLS 

 BODY:
At National Video Resources, they are eager for the future, and wary of it, too. Set up by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1990, N.V.R., as it is known to independent film and video makers across the country, helps the little guys to produce and market their videotapes. To appreciate that challenge, imagine trying to land a documentary about the Eskimo Olympics on the shelf between "Aladdin" and "Sleepless in Seattle."
N.V.R. works with alternative video: the films and tapes of artists, educators, members of all kinds of minorities and advocates of all sorts of causes. Those kinds of things are not found in video stores. "Of all the entertainment media, video has the narrowest selection," Timothy Gunn, executive director of N.V.R., said. "It's 90 percent movies." 
 Mr. Gunn acknowledges that stores do not have room for everything and that most people would not be interested even if they did. N.V.R. helps producers to get thousands of tapes on a wealth of subjects into the hands of specialized audiences.
 
'An Endless Shelf'
 Until now that has meant cultivating libraries, universities and similar outlets that harbor niche markets within large communities. But Mr. Gunn sees new opportunities ahead in digital technology that will enable a virtually limitless amount of programming to be stored in computers and make videos about everything available to anybody.
"Video on demand would solve the access problem," he said in a recent interview at N.V.R.'s spacious headquarters in a loft in lower Manhattan. "It's virtually an endless shelf."
But, he added, because nothing comes easily for independent video makers, even that prospect is unclear. Just as supply is currently restricted by commercial gatekeepers, so it could be limited by a different set of masters in the future.
While N.V.R. monitors technological developments, it continues to serve as a counselor to independent producers and distributors and as a link between video makers and their audiences. The nonprofit organization, which has a staff of three, including Mr. Gunn, is backed by money from the Rockefeller Foundation and occasionally joins with groups like the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to develop outlets for hard-to-place videos. It spends about $600,000 annually.
N.V.R. does not finance individual productions. Instead it uses its resources to help video makers find the means to produce their tapes and distribute them on their own. That might mean making technical assistance grants to allow distributors to research markets, find audiences and improve their own business practices. One recent grant, for example, helped a distributor of African-American films to develop a catalogue and get its titles to high school teachers.
N.V.R. helps in other ways. One of its biggest ongoing projects is showing distributors how to place videos in libraries. In another effort, N.V.R. negotiated with 16 film archives to provide discounts on their footage for video documentary makers.
N.V.R. also gathers advice from other consultants, commissions studies and then dispenses the information. For example, a series of N.V.R. reports offers counsel on topics like how to make profitable use of an "800" number, the role of video in the college textbook industry and the impact of new digital technology on production and distribution.
"N.V.R. is terrific at organizing discussions with very smart people to show us how to do business," said Kate Horsfield, the executive director of the Video Data Bank, a Chicago distributor of alternative videos.
Ms. Horsfield's nonprofit organization places tapes with museums, colleges and universities. "They aren't mainstream titles," she said. "Mostly it's difficult work, intellectually based, people playing with ideas."
Representative of the 2,500 tapes in the company's collection are "Video in the Villages," about teaching video technology to indigenous peoples in Brazil as a means of preserving their way of life; "Delirium," a video about women, madness and family, and "It Wasn't Love," about fear, violence, lust and guilt.
 
Assistance in Marketing
 Ms. Horsfield said she used a recent N.V.R. grant to identify her market better and upgrade her company's data base -- "what corporations have been doing forever," she said. The result, she added, was that revenue has sharply increased.
While N.V.R. helps independent video makers market their tapes, Mr. Gunn looks ahead to electronic distribution through networks put together by cable, telephone and computer companies. He distrusts the prospect of 500-channel cable systems, several of which are being tested, because access will remain chained to the old commercial rules. "They'll be filled with pay-per-view movies, the kind of thing we have already, only repeated more often," he said.
True video on demand, however, would open the window. "These aren't channels, but a library of videos housed in a giant computer," he said. "Potentially that's much more promising for independent work because there's no space problem."
But there are other difficulties, some of them familiar to independent video makers. "Programs will have to be used with a certain frequency to justify the cost of inclusion," Mr. Gunn said.
There is also the persistent problem of publicity..
 
Preparing for Future
 As part of its preparation for new technologies, N.V.R. helped put together a 30-hour package of children's programming to be used by Bell Atlantic during tests of a video delivery system in Virginia.
Many of N.V.R.'s constituents are skeptical about how their work will fare on such systems. "My vision is that the economic interests will always win out," said Debra Zimmerman, who received an N.V.R. grant in the past and is executive director of Women Make Movies, a New York company promoting female film makers.
"In the new technological scheme of things," Ms. Zimmerman continued, "they might give us a small slice, like we were supposed to get a slice of public television. It will be no larger."
David Rosen, a consultant who helped N.V.R. with its Bell Atlantic package, said that Mr. Gunn's organization was uniquely positioned to be of service. "N.V.R. has no vested interest," he said, "and it has the time and resources to explore the issues, the finances, how it works, how to get access to video-on-demand trials, how to stimulate audiences."

HEADLINE: Surprise in Idaho Governor's Race: Leader Is a Democrat and an Indian

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TWIN FALLS, Idaho, Aug. 30

 BODY:
To be a Democrat in this state, where Bill Clinton barely nudged Ross Perot for second place in the 1992 election with just 29 percent of the vote, is to be intimate with the word underdog.
And to be anything other than a white candidate in Idaho, where racial minorities make up only about 7 percent of the population, would seem a challenge to a politician of any party.
So it comes as a surprise to many people that Larry EchoHawk, a Pawnee Indian and Democrat who counts President Clinton as a friend, is holding a steady double-digit lead in the polls in the race to become Idaho's next governor. 
 Mr. EchoHawk does not shy from acknowledging his ethnic background or his party affiliation. But as he travels between the two time zones that divide this mountainous, lamb-chop-shaped state, he stresses other parts of his background. He is now the State Attorney General. He was a county prosecutor, a Brigham Young University football player and a United States marine.
He is also a Mormon. And while that may help him here in Idaho, which is second only to Utah in the percentage of people who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it has caused trouble among some other Indians.
Even as the tribes here welcome the likely prospect that Mr. EchoHawk will become the nation's first American Indian governor, some of them say his opposition to expanding gambling in the state could deprive them of significant economic opportunity. The Mormon faith has tenets against gambling. But many American Indians see it as their economic salvation and have been using their status as nations within a nation to develop lucrative casino operations around the country.
 
At Odds Over Gambling
 Idaho has a constitutional amendment against casino-style gambling, a law written in part, and defended in court, by Attorney General EchoHawk.
"We have our differences with Larry EchoHawk," said Charles Hayes, chairman of the Nez Perce Indian tribal council. "There is a sense of honor and pride that he might be elected. But there is also real frustration."
Two years ago, the Nez Perce passed a resolution that accused Mr. EchoHawk of working against the interest of Indians because of his anti-gambling stand. The Coeur d'Alene Indians have expressed similar criticism.
Choosing his words with care, Mr. EchoHawk, a trim 46-year-old marathon runner who is extremely soft-spoken, says gambling is not the best way to help Indians, even though it has brought full employment to some tribes in other states.
Idaho's three big Indian reservations have not shared in the enormous prosperity that has come to this state in the last five years, driven in large part by a surge of people from California and growth in high tech jobs and food processing.
"I told the tribes when I ran for attorney general that I could not be the tribal attorney in the Statehouse," Mr. EchoHawk said. "I care very deeply about their issues. I was raised with Indian values. And the strongest of those is family. That's what we have to look at, making the family strong."
Whether being an Indian in a conservative, mostly white state will hurt him is something that still concerns Mr. EchoHawk, even though he won the Democratic primary nearly 3 to 1. His Republican rival in November, Phil Batt, a former legislator and party chairman, asked people in a recent poll how they felt about the possibility of Idaho's electing the nation's first Indian governor. He will not say what the results were.
But Mr. Batt has said he will not make Mr. EchoHawk's ethnicity an issue. During a debate here this week, he mentioned it only in passing, noting that American Indian tribes were among the "outside" influences that were making claims for a share of Idaho's water. The state is in the eighth year of a drought, and farmers, fishermen, environmentalists, industrial users and Indians are all fighting over water use.
Outside Idaho, Mr. EchoHawk's candidacy has energized Indians throughout the West and become a cause for some Hollywood luminaries. Dustin Hoffman, for example, donated $50,000 to his campaign.
At a recent Seattle fund-raising event for Mr. EchoHawk, a Mandan Indian, Tony McGrady, said, "I'm going to move to Idaho and declare citizenship just so I can vote for Larry."
A distant relative presented him with a picture of Mr. EchoHawk's great-grandfather, the warrior Echo Hawk, who posed in the uniform of an Indian scout. Mr. EchoHawk was visibly moved.
"My great-grandfather was known for his bravery," he said. "He was called Hawk, and they echoed his praises, so he became Echo Hawk.
"The Pawnee used to have 23 million acres of land, almost all of Nebraska. Then they were marched to a small reservation in Oklahoma. I never knew Echo Hawk, but I can imagine what it must have been like to be removed to Oklahoma."
One of six children, Mr. EchoHawk was born on Aug. 2, 1948, in Wyoming and grew up in Farmington, N.M. His father, a full-blooded Pawnee, was a land surveyor and worked in the oil supply business. His mother is of German ancestry.
His brother, John EchoHawk, the director of the Native American Rights Fund, remembers his family being harassed on occasion but said the harassment often came from other Indians. "That was Navajo, Apache and Ute country," he explained. "There just weren't very many Pawnees."
Larry EchoHawk says his father struggled with alcoholism until 1962, when a Mormon missionary converted the family. Mr. EchoHawk was a high school quarterback and a standout athlete at Brigham Young. He earned his law degree from the University of Utah. All six EchoHawk children went to college, and three became lawyers. Larry and his wife, Terry, have six children of their own.
"I believe in the promise of America," Mr. EchoHawk told the Indians gathered in Seattle. "My political credo is very simple: to return something for what you've received."
His hero, he said, is Robert F. Kennedy. "In the early years of my life, I never thought I would even go to college," he said. "But in my formative years, I heard Robert Kennedy say: 'Some men see things as they are and say, 'Why?' I see things as they could be and say, 'Why not?' "
He became a tribal counselor to the Shoshone-Bannock tribes in Idaho and was then elected a county prosecutor. In his first year as a state legislator, in 1982, he was one of 17 Democrats out of 84 members of the House.
"If I were to just run as a Democrat, it would be over," he said. "You've got to offer something else."
Idaho Democrats tend to be pro-gun and anti-abortion, a mold that has well served Cecil Andrus, the departing Governor, during a 40-year political career. Mr. EchoHawk takes the same position as Governor Andrus on those two issues.
This year there is an anti-gay ordinance on the state ballot. Both Mr. EchoHawk and Mr. Batt oppose it as unnecessary, but they are both against expanding rights for homosexuals.
"Like many Idahoans, I am opposed to teaching homosexuality as an alternative or normal life style," Mr. EchoHawk said during a debate in Twin Falls. "But that anti-gay proposition is absolutely unconstitutional."
He is also presenting himself as tough on crime, a big issue here as gangs have arrived with the influx of newcomers.
Mr. EchoHawk has been vilified for his friendship with President Clinton, who is extremely unpopular in Idaho. But the President was the host of a fund-raising event for him last spring in Washington.
While disagreeing with Mr. Clinton on some Western issues, Mr. EchoHawk said, "I will make no apologies for my friendship with him."
In recent years, Idaho has received national attention for a small but vocal group of neo-Nazis and white supremacists who live in pockets of the woods, mostly in Northern Idaho. Mr. EchoHawk says he is proof that the state is far more tolerant than it has been perceived.
Idaho, he told the group of Indians assembled in a tribal cultural center overlooking Puget Sound, was the first state to elect a Jew as governor -- sending Moses Alexander to the Statehouse in 1914.
"We can make history again," he said.

HEADLINE: Parents Take Less of a Role As Pupils Age

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA 

 BODY:
A nationwide study of families and schools released today shows that many parents, consumed by making ends meet, are far less involved in the high schools than in the elementary schools, leaving their children with less guidance in the face of a destructive peer culture.
A private research organization in Washington, Child Trends Inc., conducted the study, "Running in Place: How American Families Are Faring in a Changing Economy and an Individualistic Society." It highlights several facts about American families in the 1990's. Among them are these: 
 *Nearly half of American high school students have parents who do not volunteer at school and do not attend Parent-Teacher Association meetings, back-to-school nights, class plays and varsity football games.
*Contrary to worries that conditions for families disintegrate as more mothers work, the study found that working mothers are just as involved in their children's schools as those who stay at home. And many states with the highest percentage of working mothers rank highest on indicators of family well-being like low child poverty rates and fewer births to teen-agers.
*Parents want their children to do well in school and to refrain from smoking or drinking, but these aims are subverted by an adolescent culture that mocks high achievers and promotes cigarettes and alcohol.
*Most families are working hard to stay in place, with wages stagnant; meanwhile, the wages of married women rose much faster than those of married men.
*Asian-American parents tended to be less involved in organized school activities -- 38 percent as against 62 percent of white, non-Hispanic parents. But their children still did better on the whole in school, leading the study's researchers to conclude that Asian parents may supervise schoolwork at home.
 
Drawing on Several Surveys
 The study draws on new analyses of several nationwide surveys, including the 1990 census, two national education surveys and vital statistics like birth certificates, and was conducted by Dr. Nicholas Zill, a psychologist, and Christine Winquist Nord, a demographer.
Dr. Zill said he was struck by the sharp drop in parental supervision of children's education. Involvement in schools falls to 50 percent of parents when children are ages 16 or older, the study said; but when children are ages 8 to 11, the figure is 73 percent.
Dr. Zill said these findings indicated a need to pay more attention to adolescents, particularly in the face of a peer culture made more powerful by television and music and adults who are less confident of exerting authority.
He also said that the study's findings contradicted widespread fears about working mothers. "By no means is there the kind of conservative stereotype that maternal employment means the death of family," Dr. Zill said.
For example, states like Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas, which had high percentages of employed mothers of young children, also ranked well on several indicators of family well-being. These included rates of child poverty, births to teen-age mothers or those with less than high school education, parental unemployment, parental involvement in schooling, and levels of student respect for teachers. The states ranking lowest over all on these indicators were Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and South Carolina.
Over all, the study found, states like Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont offer the best conditions for family life, with the lowest rates of child poverty and repeat births to teen-age mothers and the highest rates of parental involvement and student respect for teachers.

The Economy
Despite the creation of more than four million jobs since President Clinton took office, the wages of men with bachelor's degrees have continued to deteriorate, a research organization has found. The study, by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, is the first to determine that wages of the college-educated lost ground to inflation even after the United States economy began to recover from recession. [Page 33.] 
 With the summer vacation season ending, many tourist destinations that used to board up for the year are no longer content to hibernate. Instead, many cities and states are trying to lure tourists in the off-season. [33.]
As traditional unions scramble to retain some vestige of power, the Major League Baseball Players Association and its cousins in the other major professional sports have achieved a significant amount of strength. But sports unions have also encountered an unparalleled degree of unrest as their members' employers try to regain control over an escalating salary structure. [1.]
 
Companies
Lincoln Electric, the nation's largest maker of arc welders and welding supplies, and its method of tying bonuses to productivity have been studied as a model for motivating workers. But the company is facing a difficult sell: trimming those bonuses even as it reports record profits. [33.]
Only months after settling with his oldest son and former wife, Herbert Haft, the patriarch of a retailing and real estate empire, is feuding again. This time, his younger son has helped depose him as chairman of Combined Properties, one of the most lucrative commercial real estate companies in Washington. [33.]

A few minutes of frank chat accidentally televised across Brazil have cost the Finance Minister, Rubens Ricupero, his job as President Itamar Franco moved to contain a scandal a month before presidential elections. [2.]
 
The Media Business
A subplot to last week's rumors about the possible sale of one or more television broadcast networks is the remarkable financial comeback of the network TV business. Advance sales of commercial time for the prime-time season reached a record high of $4.4 billion this summer. And prices for commercials in fall shows sold on a one-shot basis are only going up. Bill Carter: Television. [33.]
Backers of Asia Business News think the recipe for attracting Asian television viewers is to capitalize on the explosive growth of the region's economies.

HEADLINE: The Scrambling Is On For Off-Season Tourism

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
With the summer vacation season ending today, many tourist spots that used to board up for the year are no longer content to hibernate. Instead, in what travel officials describe as making applesauce out of apples, many cities and states are trying to lure tourists in the off-season.
Alaska is selling itself as a winter wonderland, tempting tourists with the Northern Lights and trips by dog sled. Ocean City, N.J., a seaside resort, is about to start a campaign marketing the city as a year-round destination, complete with performances of "The Nutcracker" in late November. Coastal towns in Oregon and Washington, which draw sports fishermen in the summer, are urging tourists to come enjoy the thunder and lightning storms that batter their beaches in the fall and winter. 
 "You can't believe how many people flock to our oceanfront hotels, where you can watch the coastline erode right before your very eyes," said Patricia Shea, the director of the Chamber of Commerce of Bandon, Ore.
The reason for the strategy is obvious: Travelers spent about $397 billion in the United States last year, according to the United States Travel Data Center, and tourism is among the top three industries in 37 states. This fiscal year, state governments will spend $364 million to promote tourism, compared with $190 million nine years ago. With states seeing off-season tourism as a way to increase jobs and tax revenues, industry officials say a growing percentage of promotional budgets will be going to encourage off-season visits.
Texas, for example, spends about 18 percent of its $3.1 million magazine advertising budget to promote off-season travel. Officials estimate that the state brings in $21.4 billion annually from tourism, with only a small fraction of the total from visitors during the winter. Now tourism officials are analyzing their first comprehensive study of off-season travel.
 
'We Operate Like a Business'
 "Now that oil is not the be-all, end-all, state officials realized how important tourism is," said Michael Kardos, a spokesman for the tourist agency of Texas. "Even though we're a state agency, we operate like a business. We're looking for every opportunity to generate money and jobs, and off-season tourism is an important, growing part of that."
Hundreds of other cities and states also want in on the off-season. Phoenix and its neighboring cities in Arizona's Valley of the Sun, packed with tourists during the winter, are positioning themselves for summer, when temperatures routinely rise into the 100's but five-star resorts and luxury hotels can be booked for two-star prices. The city has hired a London-based tourism agency to pitch summer visits to the British and the Germans, who each account for more than 100,000 visitors a year to Phoenix.
Off-season tourism is also a growing part of Alaska's strategy, spurred by airline and hotel packages that help make the 49th state a bargain in winter -- at least for visitors whom Tina Lindgren, the executive director of the Alaska Tourism Marketing Council, describes as "the more adventurous tourists, who want to experience such uniquely Alaska activities as dog sledding, ice carving and viewing the Northern Lights."
 
 
New Year-Round Resort
 Last week, the first year-round resort in Alaska opened in Girdwood, a snowball's throw from Anchorage (which for two years has used the advertising slogan, "Anchorage, Where Winter Is Wonderful").
When fully open next month, the resort, the Alyeska Prince Hotel, owned by the Seibu Corporation of Japan, will have 307 guest rooms, an indoor pool, a 16-person whirlpool, a 60-passenger aerial tram, an 18-hole golf course and almost 500 acres of skiable terrain available from November to May on Mount Alyeska.
But Alaska will have a lot of competition this fall and winter, and not just from traditional warm-weather playgrounds like Florida, Hawaii and the Caribbean.
San Francisco, hoping to attract more visitors from October through March, is offering, without charge, a visitor's kit that includes discounts and special offers from airlines, rental car agencies, hotels, restaurants, attractions, shops and sightseeing companies.
"And for the first time ever, we'll be promoting ourselves on TV, as a way to attract more visitors," said Lovester Law, vice president of marketing for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau. The $1.5 million promotion, on cable television, will begin on Sept. 19.
 Across the continent in Ocean City, whose population of 15,000 swells to 150,000 in the summer, the city recently renovated its venerable boardwalk Music Hall for year-round use. And it will soon mail 10,000 brochures promoting fall and winter events, from big-band dances to string-band performances to "The Nutcracker."
"We're trying to extend our tourist season, and help fill our hotels and restaurants," said Joanne Delvescio, the executive director of the Ocean City Tourism Commission. "We want to become more than just a three-month resort."
 
Foliage and History
 Rhode Island reaps $1.4 billion from tourism, its second-largest industry. Hoping for more, it is aggressively promoting off-season travel, in part by piggybacking on the popularity of the fall foliage season in neighboring states.
"We don't have as much leaf-changing as the rest of New England," said David C. DePetrillo, associate director of the Rhode Island Department of Economic Development. "So we try to get those tourists to visit Rhode Island, too, for our rich history and cultural activities."
Rhode Island has also induced group tour buses to add the state to their New England itineraries. And it will soon go after individual tourists through ads in 11 magazines and 8 newspapers, mostly in the Northeast. "With the big investments required for hotels and attractions, seasonal tourism is vital," Mr. DePetrillo said.
 From October through February in the Pacific Northwest, whenever bad weather threatens, tourists -- including large contingents of Canadians -- show up at seaside towns to watch Mother Nature's fury.
At Lincoln City, Ore., 1,800 of the town's 2,000 motel rooms provide an ocean view of storms that generate 20-foot-high waves and lightning bolts that illuminate the ocean for hours. "Storm watching is so popular our hotels send out storm-watcher lists offering discounts, and occupancy has increased 40 to 50 percent," said Terry Cowling, the executive director of the Lincoln City Visitor Bureau.
Washington, Idaho and Texas promote environmental tourism in the off-season. Such tourism, which can include bird-watching expeditions and visits to national forests, is especially popular with seniors, who can pursue it at odd times.
"It's also popular because with new technology you can do many things without being uncomfortable," said John Hunt, a professor in the department of resource recreation and tourism at the University of Idaho. "These days, there's everything from snowmobiles to snow-making equipment, and clothing and camping gear that make it livable outdoors year-round."
Another reason for the growing success of off-season strategies is that "states have become a lot more sophisticated with their data bases," said James V. Cammisa Jr., a travel industry analyst in Miami. "They know where the peaks and valleys in their tourism operations are, and they know how to market the off-season effectively."
Kentucky's data base showed that only 350,000 of the 2.5 million Canadians who drove through the state last year stayed overnight.
"Our research showed that 83 percent of them come from January to June, headed for Florida, South Carolina and the beaches of Alabama and Mississippi," said Robert Stewart, the Commissioner of Travel Development for Kentucky. To entice more of them, Kentucky officials will soon hold a news conference in Toronto and Canadians will be offered a card giving them discounts at hotels, restaurants and attractions along three of Kentucky's interstate highways.
Also for the first time, Kentucky is using direct mail to bolster anemic winter occupancy rates in its 15 resort parks that offer overnight accommodations year-round.
"Summer will still always be the biggest vacation time," Mr. Cammisa, the travel industry analyst, said. "But it's been years since the plant closed two weeks in the summer, and the whole family had to take its vacation then. Now you can go pretty much any time of year, so you can be sure states and cities will do what they can to attract you."

HEADLINE: Rethinking a Model Incentive Plan

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EUCLID, Ohio

 BODY:
For two decades the Lincoln Electric Company, the nation's largest maker of arc welders and welding supplies, has been studied by Harvard Business School students as a model of how to motivate workers.
Each year thousands of managers from other companies, even some rivals, journey to Lincoln's modest headquarters and huge factory complex in this blue-collar Cleveland suburb for free seminars on the company's incentive system. 
 They are intrigued because Lincoln has gone further than any other large manufacturer in matching compensation to each employee's productivity and to the profitability of the company. Indeed, since 1934 Lincoln has parceled out almost as much in bonuses as in salaries.
The bonus pool is divided among employees on the basis of ratings of each one's output, quality, dependability and degree of cooperativeness with other workers. The system includes a no-layoff guarantee that the company has never violated. But the system is also brutally demanding, forcing workers into constant competition with each other to produce more with fewer mistakes.
Lincoln offers few of the fringe benefits that many workers take for granted: no pay for sick days or holidays, for example. And managers operate without perquisites like reserved parking or club memberships.
 
An Overseas Mess
 These days, though, problems at Lincoln are forcing Harvard to update its case study. Many stem from the mess the company made of a rapid buildup overseas in the late 1980's. The most immediate concern is how the company can keep domestic productivity growing at past levels while workers here see their bonuses shrink, offsetting the strategic errors and naivete of senior management as to how easily the Lincoln system could be exported.
The resentment was tempered in 1992 and 1993 when Lincoln paid sizable bonuses to American workers despite posting the first overall losses in its 99-year history. Now comes the harder part. Donald F. Hastings, the company's chairman and chief executive, has made a video telling the more than 3,000 workers in the company's main factory here and a sister plant in nearby Mentor that bonuses might decline this year, even though sales seem headed to more than $900 million for the first time and the company expects record profits.
Mr. Hastings, a marketing expert who became the first nonengineer to lead the company when he was elevated to the job at the height of the financial crisis, said shareholders had already given up year-end bonus dividends for two years. He said the workers would have to carry a bigger share of the burden this year to let Lincoln reduce its debts from the expansion abroad and invest in new equipment. Otherwise, he warned, the company could be bankrupted by the next domestic downturn.
 
A Warning to Companies
 "People understand that Mr. Hastings is trying to bring things back in line, but there's a lot of disgruntlement," said Percy Robinson, a tool and die maker for the company. "A lot of people feel ripped off."
Lincoln's predicament is a warning to American companies about how easy it is to underestimate the challenges of other cultures and problem subsidiaries. Lincoln's woes also show how success can allow a company to develop bad habits like continuing to rely on internal promotion even when a change in strategy calls for an infusion of executives with broader experience.
Lincoln's confidence in its vision going into the foreign misadventures was understandable. Lawrence O. Selhorst, chairman and chief executive of the American Spring Wire Corporation and one of several new board members recruited by Mr. Hastings, admiringly calls Lincoln's legendary compensation system "the Babe Ruth of incentive programs."
Under Lincoln's system, line workers generally receive no base wage and are paid only for what they produce. Those without the kind of piecework production jobs that fit easily into such a system get hourly wages or salaries pegged to Lincoln's calculation of the average for similar jobs in the Cleveland area.
If production is interrupted for an extended period of time for reasons having nothing to do with the line workers' performance, supervisors can assign them to other jobs, like sweeping, at an hourly rate.
 
No-Layoff Policy
 On the other hand, a high proportion of the profits go into the bonus pool. The bonuses sometimes lift the income of the most successful production workers to more than $100,000. The average compensation in 1993 was about $51,000.
An even more compelling carrot for many is the no-layoff policy that has been faithfully observed since the pay-for-performance system was installed in 1934. It applies to all workers with three years on the job and guarantees at least a 30-hour week. In the early 1980's, when all of Lincoln's large clients slumped simultaneously and sales plunged by more than 40 percent, Lincoln sent production workers on the road as additional salesmen rather than lay anyone off.
"When you talk about job security, you can't beat Lincoln Electric," said Mr. Robinson, adding that he had been through layoffs and several strikes at unionized Caterpillar and Alcoa plants in this area.
About 25 percent of Lincoln's employees quit during their first year, but the number who drop out after that is lower than average. Absenteeism is low because of its direct impact on take-home pay.
"I don't work for Lincoln Electric; I work for myself," said Lester Hillier, a 17-year welder at the company. "I'm an entrepreneur."
Mr. Hillier figures he turned in nearly 50 cost-reduction suggestions during the spring and early summer, about 30 of which were accepted. Previously, he and a co-worker agreed to treat the daily output of the four machines in their work area as one pool to be split evenly in their records. Both men come out ahead, he said.
 
Preying on a Downside
 By encouraging such initiative, Lincoln grew slowly but steadily for decades. The company had a reputation for high-handed dealings with its distributors, but the quality and price of its products were hard to beat.
Many small companies and a few large ones, including General Electric and Westinghouse, were driven from the market. But some managed to prey upon the downside of Lincoln's system. To maintain its no-layoff pledge, Lincoln was slow to develop new products that required less labor to make, and slow to expand during boom periods.
Those policies let Miller Electric Manufacturing, a family-owned company in Appleton, Wis., until its sale last year to Illinois Tool Works, become the leading supplier of welding equipment, slightly ahead of Lincoln's 35 percent market share.
Miller did not take on Lincoln in its bigger business, the production of the supplies used by welders. As Lincoln saw it, the only true threat it faced from a full-line welding company as it entered the 1980's was from ESAB of Sweden.
As ESAB acquired European rivals, Lincoln, which had small operations in Britain, France and Canada, became increasingly concerned that the Swedish company would establish a fortress on its home ground and then invade the United States market.
From 1986 to 1992, Lincoln expanded from 5 plants in 4 countries to 21 plants in 15 countries. "We did it too fast, paid too much; we didn't understand foreign markets and cultures, and then we got hit by recession," Mr. Hastings said of the strategy in his video presentation.
The extent of the problems was a sobering experience for the company. Mr. Hastings recruited outside board members to bring fresh perspectives to planning, including Mr. Selhorst; Edward E. Hood Jr., the recently retired vice chairman of General Electric, and Paul E. Lego, the former chairman and chief executive of Westinghouse. Mr. Hastings, who is 65, has also moved recently to hire more outsiders for key positions and appointed a younger generation of top managers.
Lincoln has also focused on building a more cooperative relationship with its distributors. And it loosened some rules, like a ban on investing in equipment that could not pay for itself within a year.
The dark cloud over all this is the debt piled up to finance overseas expansion. Initially, the debt load made the company more determined to cram the labor system so successful at home down the throats of its new foreign employees.
But Brazilians, by law, can regard any bonus received for two years as part of base salary. In Europe, workers valued vacation time more than large bonuses, and unions at the acquired companies would have nothing to do with a system that sought to make workers feel like independent entrepreneurs.
In France, the system began to take root but fell apart after a rapid expansion left the subsidiary with no profits to distribute as bonuses, infuriating employees.
Mr. Hastings said the system worked best in "immigrant cultures," noting that Lincoln's Australian unit had used it for decades.
Still, Mr. Hood said, "I doubt that Lincoln's system is exportable."
This year, with the worst foreign operations closed and others trimmed, Lincoln has earned nearly $23 million on sales of almost $445 million in the first six months. It called on workers to give up August vacations to keep up with demand; hundreds did.
The overtime may help those counting on big bonuses. But for many, working more has added to the building discontent, despite the $100 million in bonuses paid during the last two years when the company was in the red.
 
Backed by Heirs
 "The employee attitude has been, 'We didn't create the problem, so why should we pay for it?' " said Richard Sabo, assistant to the chief executive.
Whether that thinking can survive challenges like the need to deal with customers and competitors globally remains in doubt. The current system has the backing of the Lincoln family's heirs, who collectively own about 51 percent of the stock. At least 30 percent more is held by employees.
But some new board members may be interested in chipping away further at the bonus structure until the balance sheet is cleaned up. "Lincoln certainly knows how to motivate people," Mr. Hood said, "but you can make an argument that shareholders get the short end of the stick."

HEADLINE: Hollis B. Chenery Dies at 77; Economist for the World Bank

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Hollis B. Chenery, an economist who served the World Bank and the Agency for International Development and was a Harvard professor, died on Thursday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 77.
The cause was pneumonia, and he had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, said his daughter Teresa Seamster. 
 Mr. Chenery was the World Bank's vice president for development policy from 1972 to 1982. In 1977 the bank, which then administered $40 billion of loans, made a fundamental change in its development strategy by trying to focus more on projects meeting the needs of the very poorest people.
In an interview then, Mr. Chenery said: "We're looking at what governments are doing on income distribution. It's one of the considerations now in making project loans."
Mr. Chenery joined the United States Agency for International Developent in 1961, and rose to become an assistant admnistrator. He left in 1965.
He was a professor of economics at Stanford from 1952 to 1961, a Guggenheim fellow in 1961 and a professor of economics at Harvard from 1965 to 1970, and again after leaving the World Bank.
The books of which he was author or co-author include "Industrialization and Growth," "Patterns of Development" and "Studies in Developmental Planning."
Mr. Chenery was born in Richmond, grew up in Virginia and Pelham Manor, N.Y., and earned bachelor's degrees from the Universities of Arizona and the University of Oklahoma. He was an Army Air officer in World War II and received master's degrees from California Institute of Technology and the University of Virginia. He was awarded a Ph.D. by Harvard in 1950.
His 1942 marriage to Louise Seamster ended in divorce in 1964. In 1970 he married Mary Montgomery; she died in 1993.
He is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Seamster of Santa Fe and Sister Hollis Ann Chenery, a Holy Rosary Sister, of Nova Maraba, Brazil; a granddaughter; a sister, Helen Chenery, of Lexington, Ky., and three stepsons.

HEADLINE: A Degree's Shrinking Returns

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Despite the creation of more than four million jobs since President Clinton took office, many of them for college graduates, the wages of men with bachelor's degrees have continued to deteriorate, a study by a Washington research organization has found. Administration officials say the findings are probably accurate.
The study, by the Economic Policy Institute, is the first to find that the hourly wages of the college-educated lost ground to inflation even after the economy began to recover from recession in the spring of 1991. The deterioration continued at least into 1993, despite an increasingly robust economy. Previous studies had found that wages of college-educated men -- but not women -- slipped during the economic stagnation from 1989 to 1991.
 
A Lingering Pattern
 "I don't see any reason why this trend should have changed since 1993 or will change in the near future," said Lawrence Mishel, research director of the Economic Policy Institute. 
 One message that emerges from the study by the institute, which issues a book-length report on "The State of Working America" every two years, is that the bachelor's degree, like the high school diploma before it, is no longer a ticket to a rising standard of living. Only college-educated women have gained ground on inflation, but their wages are still lower than those of men with bachelor's degrees, whose median hourly wage in 1993 had slipped to $17.62, the study found. Adjusted for inflation, the decline was about 3 percent since 1989.
 
Quantity vs. Quality
 Another message from the study is that putting people to work -- President Clinton has promised to create at least eight million jobs during his four years in office -- no longer translates easily into higher living standards.
Indeed, college graduates have taken jobs in rising numbers, and as a result, the total wages paid to all college graduates have risen, Mr. Mishel said. "But because the money has to be spread over so many people, the typical college graduate finds that his income has not kept up with inflation," he said. And this remains the case even when the amounts that employers pay for pensions and health insurance are added in.
The Economic Policy Institute, which campaigned for Mr. Clinton's election and now criticizes his economic policies, argues that wages have become resistant to a prospering economy, so other steps must be taken to improve them.
Wages, Mr. Mishel said, are held back by "structural" factors -- including weak unions, a proliferation of low-wage industries, competition from foreign labor, too little improvement in productivity or efficiency and a minimum wage that is too low. This in turn pulls down the entire pay scale, he said.
The Administration, and many economists, disagree with Mr. Mishel's diagnosis, although they do not challenge the institute's finding that the hourly wages of college-educated men continued to deteriorate during the recovery. It is a finding that challenges the Administration's view that a growing economy will eventually produce enough wage gains to raise the living standards of those who possess the education and training to function in a high-technology workplace.
"There is a danger in using the Economic Policy Institute's figures as a report card on the Administration," a senior Administration official said. "The institute's wage data are probably accurate, but they go only through the middle of 1993, which is the President's first six months in office. During that time, the priority was to facilitate job growth by lowering interest rates to get the economy growing. And, historically, a growing economy has led to wage growth."
That was certainly the case in the early 1980's. From 1979 through most of 1982, a period of recession, the median wage of the college-educated lost ground to inflation. But from 1983 through 1988, with the economy growing again, the median wage of the college-educated rose by more than enough to improve their standard of living.
During most of the 1980's, the median hourly wage of those with a high school education fell, particularly during the recession early in the decade. Many of the high-school-educated were blue-collar workers in manufacturing, where employment declined.
The two trends gave rise to a huge college-high school wage gap. It grew until 1989, when the nation entered another period of weak economic growth and recession, one that lasted until the spring of 1991. This time, however, the wages of the college-educated did not bounce back when the recession ended. The recovery is now three years old, and the median wage for a man with a bachelor's degree has deteriorated for at least two of those years and probably all three, Mr. Mishel says.
Others argue that Mr. Mishel may be too pessimistic. "The forces at work could be structural or they could be cyclical," said Robert Hall, an economist at Stanford University, referring to Mr. Mishel's view that they are structural and the Administration's that they are cyclical. "We don't know yet. We have to wait a few years."
Whatever the answer, the gap between the median wages of college-educated and high school-educated men is no longer widening, the Economy Policy Institute reports. From 1989 through mid-1993, both groups lost ground to inflation at the same pace, roughly 3 percent annually.
Specifically, the median wage of a man with a bachelor's degree fell to $17.62 an hour in 1993 from $18.16 in 1989, after adjustment for inflation, while the median for a man with a high school education was $11.19 an hour in 1993, down from $11.83 in 1989. The median hourly wage of men with postgraduate study -- $21.71 an hour in 1993 -- has also fallen, the institute says, but only slightly since 1990. The study did not examine women's wages in any detail.
"Yes, it is clear that education is not the only factor at work here," said Lawrence Katz, the Labor Department's chief economist until late last month, when he returned to Harvard University to teach. "But the gap between those who went to college and those who didn't is still huge. You would be crazy not to go to college."
The Administration has argued in recent weeks that a growing economy and rising employment levels have made annual incomes, if not hourly wages, of individuals grow. "Working Americans are much better off than they were one Labor Day ago," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said at a news conference last week.
The Economic Policy Institute's findings, based on analyses of Government data, do not dispute such claims. But Mr. Mishel argues that the income growth has come because more people are working and therefore have salaries and because people are working longer hours to offset their deteriorating hourly wages. The result is higher total annual income for all Americans.
But how much rise is there in the wages at each job? In late August, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics issued an analysis of the quality of the four million jobs that have been created. The study found that many of the jobs were in high-paying occupations, but those occupations were in low-paying industries. "The result is that the trend in wages has basically been pretty flat," said Thomas Nardone, an economist at the bureau.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Home-Grown Business News in Asia

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
Richard Li, an aspiring tycoon and the son of one of the world's richest men, Li Ka-shing, keeps a bank of seven television sets constantly glowing in his Hong Kong office. One of them is tuned to the latest entrant in the region's warming satellite television wars: Asia Business News, or ABN.
"It's a channel for Asia only," Mr. Li said, "and it gives me what I need." 
 With television satellites cluttering the heavens above Asia like beer cans strewn along a forest trail, the great need is not so much for more orbital litter -- although a wave of new satellites is coming -- but for something to beam off them, particularly something that can appeal to a regional, as opposed to a local, audience.
Paul France, a big, garrulous New Zealander who is the chief executive of ABN, thinks he has found a recipe for attracting Asian viewers by capitalizing on the explosive growth of Asia's economies, the huge expansion of trade and investment within the region and the demand for more and faster business news by the legions of executives frenetically shuttling around Asia.
 
'Let's Do a Business Network'
 "The potential in Asia is enormous, but it's still only potential," Mr. France said in a recent interview at the channel's headquarters in a glittering office tower in downtown Singapore. "After looking at all the options, we said, 'Everybody in this part of the world is interested in money. It's part of their lives. Let's do a business network.' "
So in May, from a pristine expanse of journalists' cubicles, control rooms filled with television monitors, satellite control panels, high-powered graphics computers and a broadcast studio designed by Janet Patterson, the costume designer on the movie "The Piano," Mr. France began transmitting the region's only channel dedicated to Asian business news.
For 18 hours a day, news and analysis of the region's multitudinous markets, big and small companies, investments and politics is showered on millions of satellite dishes across Asia, all in English except for a short segment in Mandarin Chinese. (While cable television has made inroads in some Asian nations, like Taiwan, satellite dishes are a much more common means of television reception than in the United States.)
"We are the only regional business network in Asia, for Asia, by Asians," Mr. France said. "Everybody's talked about it, but nobody's done it."
 
Advertising Is Thin
 ABN can be received in Japan, much of China, all of southeast Asia and as far away as Australia and eastern India. But in Singapore, where private satellite dishes are illegal because the Government cannot control the programs received by viewers, ABN was banned from cable until Sept. 1, when the Government decided to permit Singaporeans to see an hour a day of ABN programming. Paradoxically, even as it limits public access to the channel, the Singapore Government owns 10 percent of ABN.
The real question for Mr. France's venture is whether it can succeed as a business. So far, advertising has been thin, not only on ABN but also on other satellite programs like Star TV, a channel owned by Rupert Murdoch that features a mix of music, movies and news, and CNN International, the international news venture of the Atlanta-based cable channel.
NBC has just started an Asian satellite service that features programming from the network's United States business news channel, CNBC, but the service is only available from midnight to 8 A.M., and there are few places in Asia where it can be seen.
Nikhil Srinivasan, a vice president at Baring Securities in Hong Kong who specializes in media and telecommunications, said that while there was a need for ABN, its success was not assured.
"If you think about business in this region, intracountry trade has only been growing recently," he said. "There is an increased interest in business news across the region. From that point of view, there should be a major business magazine, but there is no business magazine of note. Television is the next best alternative."
Critical to ABN's goal of being regarded as a regional network, Mr. France said, is the need to be seen as an outgrowth of the region itself.
 
2 American Partners
 "We're clearly seen as not being American," he said. "It's the feeling that there's not somebody in New York telling us the meaning of life. Our reporters come from all over the world, all over the region." The channel has 110 employees, 43 of whom are involved in the gathering of news.
But while Mr. France, a former producer for Television New Zealand, one of ABN's investors, is from New Zealand -- "we're part of Asia, aren't we?" he said -- there are also American interests in the network. Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable operator in the United States, and Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and the owner of Telerate, a financial news service, each own 30 percent of the network, as does Television New Zealand.
While much of the news product is generated by ABN's reporters here and in Hong Kong, Dow Jones requires many of its staff members from The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review, its weekly news magazine, to participate in the network's programs. And Telerate provides ABN with financial data that are automatically updated and displayed in a dizzying array of graphics.
ABN has been pushing hard to gain entry to satellite and cable markets across Asia, which is essential if the network is to attract advertisers. Several agencies try to gauge viewership for satellite channels in Asia, but it is difficult to do so. And without solid viewership figures, attracting advertisers is that much harder.
"One of the problems is that this industry has been stung by extravagant audience claims," Mr. France said. "The difficulties we face are a distrust of the satellite industry in Asia, because of all the hyperbole."
In addition, Mr. France cited difficulties in persuading corporate advertising executives to shift some of their local spending to the broader evolving regional market.
 
Advertising a Critical Issue
 The channel's start-up costs were $20 million. "The shareholders said from the beginning there wasn't any expectation of turning a profit for five years," said Mr. France, who declined to discuss the extent of ABN's losses so far.
Mr. France scooted across the newsroom, past the glass-walled control room and over to the broadcast studio, to have a word with one of the seven news presenters, as the anchors are called. Behind him, graphics displaying the share value of various Malaysian companies were tumbling across several screens while producers kept track of the program on monitors and personal computers. Robot-controlled cameras panned across the studio.
"We don't pretend for a moment it is the most sophisticated operation in the world," Mr. France said. "It's the best combination of high tech and low tech. But I have no doubt that people will get their money back in the long run."

HEADLINE: Growth Seen For Germany

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BIELEFELD, Germany, Sept. 4

 BODY:
The German economy could grow by 2 percent in 1994 and is firmly on the road to recovery, but the central bank must keep a wary eye on prices, the Bundesbank president, Hans Tietmeyer, said Saturday.
But he warned that inflation, currently running at around 3 percent, was still unsatisfactorily high. The Bundesbank will continue to view price stability as its highest priority, he told a business conference here. 
 As for interest rates, Mr. Tietmeyer said that moves toward higher rates in other countries, particularly the United States, Britain, Sweden and Italy, made it difficult for German rates to break free from the general trend and head lower.
German capital market rates moved sharply higher as strong economic recovery in the United States caused inflation worries there and those concerns then spilled into other countries.
German bonds have been unable to detach themselves from these foreign trends despite a general consensus that the inflation rate in western Germany will ease to around 2 percent at the start of next year and that the current economic upturn is not inflationary.

HEADLINE: As Trade Unions Struggle, Their Sports Cousins Thrive

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
As more traditional unions scramble to retain some vestige of power and influence against inroads made by union-busting law firms and replacement-worker tactics, the Major League Baseball Players Association and its cousins in the other three major professional sports have gained a recognition and a power reminiscent of the once-mighty steelworkers, mine workers and auto workers.
But on this day that once celebrated a flourishing labor movement in the United States, sports unions have also encountered an unparalleled degree of unrest as their members' employers try to regain control of an escalating salary structure. 
 Baseball players are in the 25th day of a strike, hockey players are headed for a possible lockout at the start of their season Oct. 1 if they don't have a new collective bargaining agreement, basketball players face a tortured negotiation in their effort to shed sports' first ceiling on salaries and football players began a season yesterday significantly affected by such a cap.
If hockey owners lock out the players, and the baseball players are still on strike, it would be the first time two sports have been shut down at the same time.
Through July of this year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, the country had only 19 work stoppages, down from 28 for the first seven months of 1993. There were 35 stoppages each in 1993 and 1992, a blip on the labor scene of 1952, when 470 shutdowns idled 2.75 million workers.
Work stoppages, bureau records show, began declining in 1980, coinciding with the beginning of the Reagan years, the worst years in the labor movement's history. Just under 16 percent of the work force belongs to unions today compared with 35.5 percent right after World War II.
While New York unions can't even muster enough support for a Labor Day parade today, sports strife has catapulted players averaging more than $1 million a year to the front lines of the ongoing labor-management battles that have been more traditionally fought by workers seeking an extra seven cents an hour and better conditions in their factories.
Sports unions clearly command a disproportionate influence given their relatively tiny membership. Of the 16.6 million members of all unions in this country, only about 3,500 are professional athletes.
"It's like you had a time warp and told someone that Ted Williams was wielding more power than John L. Lewis," said Dan Yager, general counsel of the Labor Policy Association of Washington. "You'd probably have said Williams was using a corked bat."
Richard Moss, who came out of the steelworkers' union to serve as general counsel of the baseball union in its first 10 years, said, "Sports unions are the unions that have made progress in the last 10 years."
But because athletes earn such lofty wages -- National Basketball Association players average $1.6 million a year, major league baseball players $1.2 million -- they prompt the question: Are sports unions a legitimate part of the union movement, or are they clubs for the wealthy?
Union leaders readily reply that they are legitimate unions; management representatives decline to grant them that status.
 
Thousands of Classifications
 "When people hear the word union, they think of somebody working in a mine or a blue-collar job," said Gerald McEntee, president of the 1.3 million-member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "That's altogether different now. We have nuclear engineers, architects, jockeys, parimutuel operators. In the public service, we cover thousands upon thousands of classifications."
Before baseball players had a union, Mr. McEntee added, "They were like chattel. They couldn't move from team to team. You had .330 hitters making $20,000 a year. The owners were putting away all this money. It was the same in the other sports."
Morton Bahr, president of the 625,000-member Communications Workers of America, said salaries are relative and have nothing to do with determining a union's legitimacy.
"As long as they're getting a fair share of what their employer earns, that's the key," Mr. Bahr said. "We don't focus on what the individual ballplayer gets."
David Lipsky, dean of the school of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University, noted that members of other unions are high earners, too, citing the Screen Actors Guild and other entertainment unions.
 
An Atypical Situation
 Rex Hardesty, public affairs director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said players "deserve every penny they make."
Yet Mr. Yager of the Labor Policy Association said sports bargaining "is about as typical of labor relations in this country as the Bud Bowl is to real football."
"It's a little bit of a sideshow," said Mr. Yager, whose group represents Fortune 500 companies. "You have two millionaires on both sides of the table. It's like two mega-corporations talking to each other about mergers or splits or sales. It's closer to that realm of activities than it is to real labor relations."
Mr. Yager added: "It's a relatively closed labor market. There's no international competition so none of the same elements are there as there are for steel or auto or retailing. It's a whole different dynamic."
James Waters of Towers Perrin, a management consultant firm in Saddle Brook, N.J., agreed with Yager, but acknowledged that he is puzzled by the players' view toward their unions.
 
An Amazing Altruism
 "I'm amazed at the solidarity of the players," he said. "I'm amazed at the motives that keep them seemingly as unified as they are." Speaking specifically of baseball, Waters added, "Guys in the big leagues are motivated in preserving the game for players in the minor leagues. That amazes me. That is a kind of altruism I don't think you see in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- unions looking out for the next generation."
The understanding and outlook that have motivated baseball unionists through 8 work stoppages in the past 23 seasons were instilled in players by Marvin Miller and Mr. Moss when they left the United Steelworkers Union in 1966 and led the neophyte baseball union. Their efforts have been passed on through their successors and succeeding generations of players.
Yet Mr. Miller, who is generally acknowledged as the No. 1 leader in the sports labor movement, believes sports unions don't fit in the labor movement generally.
"To give the labor movement its due," he said, "the sports unions were a kind of delayed reaction to conditions. That is, to look at baseball when I came into it in 1966 was to look at the rest of industry in 1896. What happened could be more related to what happened in the labor movement in the '30's. But I don't see any relationship anymore. I think sports unions operate independently of the rest of the labor movement."
The National Football League Players Association, however, operates within the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and its leader, Gene Upshaw, sits on the umbrella group's executive council. Upshaw's union and the N.F.L. are at peace after years of labor battles, but Upshaw has come under fire from union members who have lost jobs or suffered severe salary slashes because of the new salary cap.
The salary cap -- which places a ceiling on team payrolls -- is the common denominator in the labor unrest in the four sports, but it merely is the owners' delayed reaction to a salary level that was unheard of in the days of Joe DiMaggio, Otto Graham, George Mikan and Maurice Richard.
The National Basketball Association instituted a cap 10 years ago after convincing the players that the league was in dire economic straits. Owners in the other sports were slow to follow, but they eventually caught on to what seemed like a good management thing.
"Basketball has thrived since, and owners in other sports say it must have something to do with the cap," Mr. Moss said. "In fact, it doesn't."
The N.B.A., Mr. Miller said, experienced a tremendous increase in revenue, and that made the salary cap tenable. "The salary cap," he added, "does not add one penny of revenue. To say the salary cap was responsible is ludicrous."
 
Disaster for Players
 The basketball union, whose labor contract has expired, now wants to dump the cap. Those players join their baseball and hockey friends in arguing that caps artificially lower salaries. Moss said they can also destroy team unity, pointing to the N.F.L., where some players have been asked to take pay cuts so other players can be signed.
"This has turned out to be a disaster to the players," he said. "You manufacture divisions among players. It wouldn't surprise me if the players revolt sometime soon."
Meanwhile, Mr. Lipsky of Cornell offered a conflict among owners as a reason for labor unrest.
"There has been a turnover in ownership in many of the leagues," he said. "New owners in baseball, for example, have paid extraordinary sums for their teams, while old owners paid what now looks like bargain-basement prices. This difference results in different attitudes and the clash is fueling the dispute. There's an old saw in labor relations that when you have instability and change, you're going to have trouble in labor relations."
In baseball, low-revenue clubs, primarily those in smaller markets, want the wealthier clubs to share more of their local revenue with them. The richer clubs have agreed to do that, but only if the players accept a cap on their salaries. Rejecting their part of the formula, the players walked out Aug. 12.
Sports strikes, or threatened strikes, are different from strikes staged by other unions for a range of reasons.
"In the 50's," said Jeffrey McGinnis, president of the Labor Policy Association, "auto workers looked at what steelworkers got, who looked at rubber workers. You'd see those patterns add on top of each other, and they resulted in a wage spiral in the 60's and early 70's. That's gone because none of those companies work in sheltered markets. Players' unions, on the other hand, work in sheltered markets."
That is, the sports leagues don't have competition either in this country or in foreign countries.
Further, except for three games during the 1987 football strike, club owners have not used replacement players. The N.F.L. probably was able to get away with the substitutes because except for stars at the skill positions, football players are more anonymous than their peers.
Baseball fans would not pay major league prices to see a minor leaguer play in place of Ken Griffey Jr. Replacement workers, though, have become the bane of union workers. "After Reagan replaced 11,000 air-traffic controllers, it was like poison ivy; it spread all over," said William Bywater, president of the International Union of Electronics Workers. "If the government could do it, companies felt it was okay to do it. But in baseball, who are they going to replace the players with?"

Vatican vs. V.P.: Papal Population Politics

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If there has been one unequivocal campaign promise the Clinton-Gore Administration has kept from the start, it is on a woman's right to choose abortion. That applies abroad, too: Clintonites have reversed 12 years of Reagan-Bush policies denying aid dollars to countries where abortion is included in birth control.
They promised and delivered; that's democracy. But then, in the run-up to the U.N. population conference in Cairo, advocates of abortion rights went a bridge too far.
Trickily avoiding the A-word, U.S. sherpas espoused a U.N. statement calling for governments to provide "reproductive rights" including 'fertility regulation" and "pregnancy termination" throughout the world -- as if new verbal compounds could conceal the abortion deed.
The Vatican wasn't fooled by these euphemisms, and cunningly enlisted Muslim fundamentalists to reject imposing "a current life style of certain opulent societies" (that's satanic Uncle Sam) on third-world nations.
Fine; brings the battle out in the open. But then the Vatican went too far: not only did the Pope's spokesman condescendingly refer to the U.S. Government as "this Administration," but he publicly attacked Vice President Al Gore by name.
The Pope's representative impugned the sincerity of Gore's conciliatory assertion that the U.S. did not seek an international right to abortion. In delivering that shot, the papal spokesman seemed to suggest that the second-highest official elected by Americans was a hypocrite.
That was a personal insult issued in the Pope's name. Unless corrected, it will stand as unprecedented papal meddling in U.S. politics.
It's overreaching enough for a U.S. bishop to predict the political behavior of co-religionists, as Bishop James McHugh did yesterday with his warning of a "powerful incentive to American Catholics to walk away from the Democratic Party." For the Pope himself to permit his official spokesman to rail against any specific American political figure demeans the Vatican -- or "this papacy," as spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls might put it.
Reached by phone in Cairo yesterday, Gore played it cool: "In dealing with those who are actually negotiating at this conference," he soothed, "I've found people to be constructive and conciliatory on both sides."
He found Bishop McHugh "statesmanlike in saying, even though they will not accept the view that contraception is all right, nevertheless signaling they fully understand that if other organizations wish to make condoms available, they won't strenuously object."
Understandably, after feminists, greens and redistributionists got carried away, Gore has been shifting the focus away from abortion to contraception, and then to a wider area of agreement: education and equality for women. Let's hope he can; Perdita Huston's seminal 1979 book, "Third World Women Speak Out," showed that to be a key to family stability.
My objection to the new Malthusians is their insistence that crowding is the obstacle to economic growth and individual advancement. Hong Kong and Taiwan show that to be as untrue as Thomas Malthus's predictions of world starvation two centuries ago. As nations get richer and people get educated, families get smaller.
"Yeah, I've heard that 'Development is the best contraceptive' for 20 years," counters Gore. "We're adopting a more holistic approach here in Cairo. Availability of contraception; increase of child survival to encourage smaller families; education and empowerment of women; and the economic development to make it easier to establish the others."
Conservatives who put individual freedom first can embrace that quartet. The danger comes from the gender-agenda coercionaries overpopulating global conferences who would make governments the levelers of nations and bureaucrats the makers of family decisions. A "right to develop" is not an entitlement to a handout.
The Vatican did well to blow the whistle on the power grab of the new Malthusians; the result is the creative tension of open debate. And moral instruction by preachers has a traditional place in politics. But the Pope should tell his arrogant spokesman that he harmed the anti-abortion cause by getting politically mean.

HEADLINE: In Ex-Workers' Paradise, It's a Bleak Labor Day

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Having just returned from a two-month stay in Russia, during which I spent much of my time with ordinary Russian working people and their families, I am dismayed by reports that the situation has stabilized. 
 President Boris N. Yeltsin's claim that Russia's economic slide has stopped is wishful thinking. Industrial production in Russian has fallen 26 percent since the beginning of 1994. Most of the "new business" that supposedly makes up for lack of domestic industry comes from importing retail goods. The bulk of the profits made this way leaves the country.
Most workers have not been paid in months, and the majority of people cannot afford the new privatized services that are emerging. Meanwhile, the health care system, the pension system, day-care facilities and the public transportation system continue to deteriorate -- ask any Muscovite about the Metro.
While the "New Russians," the nouveau riche, build dachas, put up satellite dishes and watch etiquette programs on television, most Russians struggle just to keep their children fed and elderly parents healthy. They live in cramped apartments in buildings where the elevators routinely break down, smashed windows and unlighted stairwells are the norm, and uncollected garbage provides the scenery.
The breakdown of Russia's economic, social and political infrastructure is not over, despite the new official line.

HEADLINE: In Ex-Workers' Paradise, It's a Bleak Labor Day;
Safety Net Mess

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Russian workers face two key problems: unpaid wages and erosion of the factory-based social safety net. Indeed, this is true not only of Russian workers, but of workers in most of the former Soviet Union. 
 The Russian Government's withholding of wages sometimes goes back 18 months. Workers may go without pay for many months at a stretch. When they protest to factory managers and government officials that they are not being paid, they are usually told, "There is no money." This assertion is sometimes true, but often is not.
Workers, seeing newly rich officials and corrupt factory bosses, are unlikely to be fooled by this claim. Nonpayment of wages is a serious source of potential political and social instability throughout the former Soviet Union -- and it is mainly fledgling independent trade unions (not the fat-cat former official trade unions) that raise this issue.
It was the controlled trade unions that doled out payments ranging from disability to maternity benefits; they decided which workers were to go to summer resorts; they "co-owned" worker clinics, hotels and resorts -- along with the factories. And they impeded genuine trade unionism in the former Soviet Union. Only in the last few years have real trade unions begun to develop -- despite the continuing wealth and political power of the successors to the Government-run trade unions.
Russia is poised to enter a long-delayed period of bankruptcies and closures of unproductive mines and factories, and mass unemployment is likely. Since workers depend on their jobs for vital social services, the impact of unemployment and closures will be even more devastating.
The entire Russian social security nexus, built on many decades of hidden taxation, is compounded by muddled or nonexistent property records, rampant corruption, nomenklatura privatization and an irrational tax system. Sorting out this mess -- and creating a new, fair distribution system -- will take the best efforts of Russian and Western economists, accountants, tax experts and independent trade unionists. A lot may depend on timely efforts to rationalize the social security legacy of the Soviet system.

HEADLINE: U.S. Rejects Proposal by Havana to Admit 100,000 Cubans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The Cuban Government proposed yesterday that the United States grant entry to at least 100,000 Cubans if Washington wanted Havana to clamp down on the flow of boat people, Administration officials said.
The United States delegation quickly rejected that demand, made at bilateral talks in New York, and began cautioning that an agreement on how to stop the exodus might be impossible. 
 After the third day of talks, David T. Johnson, the spokesman for the United States delegation, said substantial gaps remained.
 
'Differences Are Significant'
 Sounding considerably more downbeat than after the first two days, Administration officials said the Cubans presented a written counterproposal today to an Administration offer to expand the number of Cubans admitted each year to at least 20,000.
Mr. Johnson declined to give details about the Cuban proposal but commented, "I'd just say the differences are significant."
In an interview on Saturday, Ricardo Alarcon, the head of the Cuban delegation, said that if Washington would accept 100,000 Cubans, this would drain the pent-up pressure for people to take to rafts and small boats to emigrate.
Channeling the flow into large-scale legal immigration, he said, would help both the United States and Cuba, which has a population of almost 11 million people.
 
Both Sides Are Far Apart
 But Michael M. Skol, the Deputy Secretary of State who heads the United States delegation, said in an interview last night, "Their proposal was a long way from covering our mutual needs."
Administration officials declined to say exactly how many Cubans Mr. Alarcon said should be admitted, but one official said it was "a six-figure number." Nor did the Cubans say over what period of time that number of Cubans should be admitted.
Late yesterday, there was a sharp change of tone from that after the talks on Thursday and Friday, when several Administration officials voiced optimism that an agreement would be reached soon.
Last night Mr. Johnson said, "I would caution against any premature speculation that an agreement is going to be reached."
 
Lengthy Talks Feared
 Administration officials have said over the past week that they feared that the Cubans might seek to drag out the talks in the belief that pressure would build on Washington to make concessions as the flow of refugees continued.
The two sides met in the United States Mission to the United Nations at 2:15 P.M., but Mr. Johnson said the delegations spent much of the three hours before they emerged caucusing without the other side. The two sides agreed to reconvene this afternoon at the Cuban Mission.
 
Embargo Stressed
 Administration officials also said the Cuban counterproposal called on the United States to ease its 30-year trade embargo against Cuba, but Washington has said repeatedly its delegates to the talks would not even discuss the embargo. "There were lots and lots of things in their proposal that we couldn't accept," one United States official said.
Cuban diplomats declined to discuss yesterday's talks. But in the interview on Saturday, Mr. Alarcon, a former Foreign Minister, said: "I cannot be optimistic. To find a real solution you have to deal with the causes of the emigration, and that remains the economic embargo."
Cuba has repeatedly argued that the embargo is linked to the exodus because it makes Cubans poorer, thus encouraging them to emigrate.
Mr. Alarcon, whose is currently president of the National Assembly, said 134,000 Cubans had applied for visas to the United States last year.
One Administration official said last night that the the 134,000 figure "was not far off" what the Cuban delegation had proposed.
Over the past few weeks, many Florida officials have urged President Clinton not to allow a replay of the 1980 Mariel boatlift, when 125,000 Cubans came to the United States. The Coast Guard has picked up more than 20,000 Cubans in the Florida Straits since the latest surge of refugees began in early August.
Under the Administration's proposal, Washington would increase to 20,000 the number of Cubans admitted yearly by broadening the definition of "refugee," by immediately accepting 19,700 Cubans on a waiting list for visas and by using the Attorney General's broad power to grant emergency visas. Immigration laws state that only immediate family members of Americans can qualify for visas, but the definition of "family" could be expanded, for example, to include cousins, aunts and uncles.
Under current law, the United States can admit 27,845 Cubans a year, but in the past year, only about 2,700 have won residents' visas.

HEADLINE: Battle for Mitchell's Maine Seat Reveals Democrats' Senate Woes

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 3

 BODY:
Maine was supposed to be a pushover for the Democrats in a year full of electoral travail.
Though several of his colleagues around the country were clearly vulnerable, Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, looked like a stainless-steel sure thing for re-election, having won with 81 percent of the vote in 1988. 
 Then he decided to retire, and everything fell apart. He endorsed Representative Thomas H. Andrews as his successor, only to see Mr. Andrews fall well behind Representative Olympia J. Snowe, the Republican nominee, in the opinion polls and the money-raising derby. He turned down a Supreme Court nomination so he could concentrate on shepherding health care legislation through Congress, but that effort stalled, further weakening his party's position.
Now Mr. Mitchell, who assured the White House weeks ago that Mr. Andrews could hold the seat, is desperately scurrying about, seeking cash to help get Mr. Andrews's commercials on television.
On Monday, President Clinton will briefly interrupt his vacation to fly to Maine for a Labor Day speech at the Bath Iron Works, which makes Aegis destroyers for the Navy. Ostensibly, the speech will celebrate improved labor relations at the hard-pressed yard. In Washington, it is described as a bid to help Mr. Andrews, too.
But that is Washington, and this is Maine.
Here, people seem surprised, if not miffed, that the President is coming. Craig Brown, the Andrews campaign manager, said on Friday: "We weren't consulted on this. The White House didn't call at all until 20 minutes ago. They cooked it up on their own. Tom is scheduled to be elsewhere, and, frankly, we prefer to campaign on our own, but I'm sure we can change things around if it's really necessary."
Christian Potholm, a pollster at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, said that his polls showed Ms. Snowe about 15 percentage points ahead. He, too, expressed mystification at the Clinton visit.
"In 20 years I have never seen a politician in this state who could transfer popularity," Mr. Potholm said. "No President, no governor, no senator. Our tradition is just the opposite: stubborn independence. Now, with all the holes in their dike, why choose this one to try to plug in such a public way? I can't believe he'll change votes."
But at least Mr. Andrews is not running away from Mr. Clinton, as some other candidates are. In one widely quoted comment, Kathy Karpan, the Democratic candidate for governor in Wyoming, told the Casper Star-Tribune: "Why be cute about it? Of course he's a liability."
Candidates everywhere this year, Republican and Democratic alike, are doing everything they can to disassociate themselves from Washington and their parties. Politics as usual has no friends in 1994.
Two typical themes in television advertisements are these: "He votes for what he believes in, and not just the party" (Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, a close Clinton ally who is given only a slightly better than even chance of surviving) and, "He hasn't let Washington change him" (Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, a Democrat seeking a second term and considered a better bet for re-election).
As the fall campaign begins, with 35 Senate seats on the line, the Democrats face the real possibility of losing a net total of seven seats and thereby relinquishing their majority. And even if they do not do that badly in the balloting on Nov. 8, they seem likely to suffer enough losses to complicate the President's job substantially.
A lot can change in the next nine weeks, but at the moment chances look slim for Mr. Clinton's achieving in the next two years what eluded him in the last two years, including the passage of comprehensive health care legislation and a revamping of the welfare system.
Haley Barbour, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been rousing the faithful with the comment, "We can cut Clinton's term in half."
 
Two Points of Attack
 The bleak outlook for the Democrats results partly from Mr. Clinton's lack of popularity -- his approval rating in the polls is down to 40 percent, the lowest for any President at this stage of his term in more than four decades -- and partly from the widespread disdain for Congress, which the Democrats have dominated since World War II. But as always, luck and timing play a part, as they have in Maine.
Mr. Andrews, a brilliant organizer who has often beaten the odds before, is under attack for two things he has done in Washington. In May he voted for a ban on assault weapons, while Ms. Snowe voted against it -- though she supported the crime bill that included the provision on a crucial vote two weeks ago. In 1989, Mr. Andrews concluded that it was futile to try to block the closing of Loring Air Force Base, in poverty-stricken northern Maine, and said so, when others, including Representative Snowe and Senator Mitchell, fought on.
In this year of disenchantment with politicians, Mr. Andrews has fought back via a nine-day, 72-stop motorcade through the state by describing those actions as signs of courage and willingness to defy the establishment.
"Tom may be able to turn it around once his television gets going," said Harold C. Pachios, a Portland lawyer who is one of Mr. Mitchell's closest associates, "but right now you'd have to say Olympia is pretty dominant."
Loring, which was built to give bombers headed for the Soviet Union a head start on the polar route, was just about all that inland northern Maine had in the way of an economic resource, other than timber and potatoes. Its loss, said Prof. Anthony J. Corrado of Bates College in Waterville, "has persuaded even the believers that government, especially Andrews, has turned its backs on them."
 
Trouble Away From Home
 Abby Holman, Ms. Snowe's press secretary, said: "Maine is a defense-dependent state. Not only did he cut off his nose to spite his face, now he considers his bitten nose a badge of honor."
And in a state where the National Rifle Association commands a huge following, the vote on assault weapons clearly hurt Mr. Andrews. Among other things, a top Democratic lawyer here said, it has given Mr. Andrews a liberal aura that may sell in his district, which covers the southern third of the state, but is anathema to voters in the north.
 
The Lure of the Negative
 Mr. Potholm's polls, as well as surveys taken for the candidates, show that Mr. Andrews is much less popular in Ms. Snowe's district than she is in his, though she won re-election by narrow margins in 1990 and 1992 and he won handily.
That may result in part from Ms. Snowe's strong appeal to independents, a larger block in Maine than either Republicans or Democrats, and from her marriage to Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. She has spent some time at the Statehouse in Augusta, which gives her a base in Mr. Andrews's district.
But Mr. McKernan's unpopularity, the result of a state financial crisis, could also be a liability.
Severin Beliveau, a former state Democratic chairman, said that Mr. Andrews's only option was to mount a negative campaign.
"It may not be fair," Mr. Beliveau said, "but from a political point of view I would point out that her campaign manager is Jock McKernan's former chief of staff, and I'd lay all the problems of her district at her feet -- you know, 'She's been representing northern Maine for 16 years, and are you any better off? No, you're poorer than ever, so why would you send Olympia Snowe to the United States Senate?' "
So far, Mr. Andrews has taken the high road, emphasizing his support for health care and arguing that Maine, as a state with a strong two-party tradition, needs a Democratic senator to balance Senator William S. Cohen, a Republican.

HEADLINE: FLIGHT FROM CUBA: IN CUBA;
Though Desperate, Most Cubans Are Not Ready to Take to Rafts

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LA FE, Cuba, Sept. 3

 BODY:
There are no rafts in the quiet gulf that presses up to this small town on Cuba's western end, only children splashing around under the hot late-summer sun and fishing boats tethered to the shore.
Though some hungry townspeople have taken to stealing food from their neighbors' homes, no one has yet tried to steal any of the boats. In a town whose name translates as Faith, no one seems to have turned decisively against the Revolution. 
 But stories of the thousands of desperate people fleeing the island have dominated conversation for weeks. The people of La Fe are asking the same questions asked by those who take to the rafts, and getting many of the same answers.
"What can you hope for?" demanded Lazaro Rodriguez, a young laborer who is the father of three small children. "There is no future here."
Among the great majority of Cubans, the ones who have stayed, there are some who cling to the Revolution's promise of a more developed society and others who, on its worst days, remember things as having been worse before.
There are people, especially in the provinces, who could not imagine abandoning the homeland. And there are those who would leave in a flash but will not risk their lives to be confined indefinitely at the United States naval base on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Yet even for some of the diehard revolutionaries in Havana who look on the continuing spectacle of the rafts with disgust or disbelief, the exodus seems to have heightened a sense of urgency about Cuba's steep economic decline.
"At the beginning, we thought all of this could come apart," a 19-year-old woman studying to be an army counterintelligence officer said, referring to the hijackings of state-owned boats and a riot against the security forces in Havana that prompted the Government to start letting people leave the island freely last month.
"Maybe it will help that they leave," said the woman, whose olive uniform was set off by bright pink plastic earrings. "In the provinces people are more tranquil. But they have to struggle to eat, and they get crazy."
As in the past, the bitterness of Cubans' private complaints may be a poor measure of their patience with the Communist Government that Fidel Castro brought to power 35 years ago.
 
Focus of Attention
 A month after the most serious disturbances of Mr. Castro's presidency -- the incident on Aug. 5 that saw hundreds of people loot stores and attack the police and thousands more pour into the streets to watch -- what impresses many foreign diplomats here is how quickly the Government managed to turn people's attention to the flight on the rafts and Cuban talks on immigration issues with the United States in New York.
"The country is not dominated by the rafters," insisted the spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, Miguel Alfonso. "That is pathology. Life goes on normally in Cuba."
Particularly around the provinces of Havana and Matanzas, the area from which most of the raft people have come and have gone, the Government has been quick to stop the daily power blackouts and to put scarce cooking oil back in the stores.
Some rationed foods that for months existed only on the thriving black market have become available again. The resumption of classes for schoolchildren last week lifted from their parents the daily summer pressure of finding them lunch.
But what the Government has not provided is any clear sign that it will take the sort of radical measures that foreign economic advisers and analysts say are needed if Cuba is to salvage its crumbling industrial plant, revive food production in the countryside and attract new investment from abroad.
 
'What Is Going to Happen?'
 "The question I ask myself is the same one that I think everyone else asks: What is going to happen here?" a 48-year-old architect said in his home in a working-class Havana neighborhood. "And I cannot see a way out of this, not in the direction we are heading now."
As a stream of his friends have traveled abroad on professional delegations and defected, the man said, he has only struggled harder to survive in Cuba. Though he does not hesitate to criticize the Government elite, he appreciates the Revolution's social achievements.
But even with a good job, he earns only 340 pesos a month, about $4 at the black-market exchange rate. Were it not for the occasional $100 check from an uncle in Miami, he says, he would be reduced to the illicit scavenging and bartering to which some of his other friends have turned as the only way to put enough food on their families' tables.
"I am doing the unspeakable to remain in my country," he said. "But I don't know how long I can keep going."
In insisting that his name not be used, the man showed a caution about speaking his mind that has eroded among many Cubans as the country's troubles have grown steadily more dramatic. "The system of control is still there," one Latin American diplomat said, "but some of the fear has been lost."
On the beaches around Havana and along the city's Malecon, the promenade that runs along the sea, the crowds that gather to watch each new contraption set out often listen first as those about to leave pour out tales of their desperation to reporters, television camera crews or anyone else within earshot.
In street-corner debates over whether to leave or stay, the comments are almost as intense. With so many people risking so much for a promise as meager as that drawing the raft people -- three meals a day behind razor wire and the vaguest promise that they might not have to return home -- it is as though the complaints of those who stay can only be lesser criticism.
Government loyalists are hardly explaining the dissatisfaction to themselves for the first time. It has been five years since the collapse of the Soviet bloc began cutting the subsidized trade on which Cubans lived for three decades. It has been more than two years since the United States economic embargo against Cuba was tightened, adding sizable premiums to the essential imports of an economy suddenly open to the laws of the capitalist world.
"These kids are not all against the system," said Clara Mendez, 47, a school principal in the town of Guanabo, just east of Havana. "Maybe they want better clothes, better food. It is all scarce here."
Young Cubans, Mrs. Mendez said, were lured away from their country by the bright images of the consumer paradise that they, unlike Eastern Europeans, have always been able to see on television. She should know, she said: her two sons, ages 27 and 29, arrived in Miami by raft shortly before the refugees started being diverted to Guantanamo.
"They are well," she said. "They don't want for anything. Only for spiritual things."
 
Warnings on Official Radio
 On Government radio stations, stories about those who survived the voyage are much darker.
"For those who risk everything," Radio Reloj intoned on Friday night, "Guantanamo is denial, desperation, the evil little place where everything is anguish, unhappiness and complaint."
Away from the capital, the temptation to leave seems more distant.
From La Fe, Havana is little more than three hours by car, but with only one prized 1954 Buick in the town and gasoline scarce throughout the country, the trip can take two days of hitchhiking. Buses from the provincial capital of Pinar del Rio are so crowded and infrequent as to be almost out of the question.
"How could I go all the way there?" Elaine Soto asked about New Jersey, where one of her aunts has lived for years. Pointing to the small concrete-block structure where she was born, she said: "My home is here. My family is here."
With more than two dozen fishermen, the town is more prosperous than many. Fish can be swapped with farmers for meat and vegetables and with people who come from the cities for clothes and other goods. But in conversations with dozens of townspeople, there seemed to be little question that the cohesion of the town had suffered along with the economy.
 
Thefts of Food
 Tania Rodriguez, 24, Lazaro's sister, told of a neighbor stealing one of the tiny rations of meat she received for her chronically ill 1-year-old daughter. On Saturday afternoon, young men told of townspeople having descended like vultures that morning on the abandoned remains of an ox stolen from a local farmer and killed for meat. Hours later, a police car pulled up to investigate, but people said it would be the exception if the rustler was found.
In La Fe, at least, it seems to be family that has taken up slack from the socialist state, providing for those who have lost jobs or who simply do not earn enough. Under such circumstances, townspeople said, even those who might want to leave by raft have found reasons to reconsider.
Yet in the confidences they whispered to a visiting reporter, two men said that when they could be sure not to end up in Guantanamo, they would surely leave, too, not in spite of their children, but to be able to provide for them.
Diuva Camaliche, 15, a bright girl who said she had been unable to find a job since quitting school two years ago, said her father, who lived and worked in Pinar del Rio, had already gone, leaving from Havana on a raft. That was enough, she and others said, to convince them that things could not go on as they were.
"Something has to happen here," Diuva said. "Either things have to get better or they are going to get worse."

HEADLINE: To Economists, Managed Care Is No Cure-All

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Advocates of managed health care say the way to slow the growth in the nation's medical spending is to move most Americans into health maintenance organizations and similar groups. But many economists say that any savings would largely disappear if everybody had managed-care coverage.
In large part, these economists say, the savings of managed care -- which come from steering patients to doctors and hospitals that accept lower fees and cost-saving rules -- are illusory for the country as a whole. That is because when a managed-care group negotiates a lower group rate with a hospital, say, the hospital does not simply absorb the loss of revenue. Instead, it makes up the difference from patients with traditional fee-for-service coverage, a tactic called cost-shifting. 
 "One group is paying the full freight and another group is paying a discount," said Peter Konigsberg, national medical director of Coopers & Lybrand, an accounting and employee benefits consulting company.
At the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, for example, managed-care groups have been paying below-cost rates while patients with traditional insurance keep the hospital afloat.
"Essentially all of the operating margin we had on the hospital side was due to 12 percent of our insurance business, who were paying their fair share of the bills," said William N. Kelley, chief executive of the medical center.
"When that 12 percent goes away," he added, "it's hard to imagine how we are going to break even in the long run."
To take another example, Georgetown University Hospital in Washington said it got $28,113 for a triple coronary bypass from traditional insurance plans. But for the same procedure, Kaiser Permanente, an H.M.O., pays $10,987, and Mid Atlantic Medical Services, a managed-care network, pays $12,000, the hospital said.
The cost-shifting problem is compounded, hospitals say, by the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which do not pay the full cost of their patients' care.
Doctors and hospitals have been willing to accept managed-care deals, if reluctantly, because of the volume of business such networks can provide and because they can recover the discounts through cost-shifting. But if most people were in managed care, critics say, there would be few people left to absorb these costs.
Controlling national health expenditures, now $1 trillion a year and rising, is a major sticking point in the Congressional impasse on health care. But whatever happens in Washington, the effectiveness of the rapidly growing managed-care networks organized by insurance companies and large employers will be crucial for payers and policy makers. Already, at least 50 million Americans are in health maintenance organizations, and tens of millions more are in other managed-care networks.
 
Disagreement on Details
 Most economists agree that managed care can reduce costs. But other things are less clear: By how much can costs be cut? For how long? Where would the reductions come?
In the darker forecasts, economists say managed care would slow the growth of the national health care bill only as long as some people were picking up the slack in traditional plans; once those people converted to managed care, costs would rise as fast as ever. More optimistic experts say that getting everyone on managed care would yield lasting savings, through techniques like emphasizing preventive care, shrinking the number of hospital beds, reducing unnecessary medical testing and using fewer specialists.
The biggest savings in managed care come from half-empty hospitals across the country. They are often willing to fill unused beds at below-cost rates, said William L. Roper, a senior health care official in the Reagan and Bush Administrations who is now president of the Prudential Life Insurance Company's health care research center in Atlanta.
"Managed-care companies are able to reap the benefit of that," said Dr. Roper, a believer in managed care. "But those savings would not be possible if many or all people were in managed-care plans."
The managed-care organizations typically limit a patient's choice of doctors, hospitals and therapies. Patients are offered financial incentives to consult network physicians, who follow strict rules for approving or withholding care and are rewarded for meeting budget goals.
 
Does Quality of Care Suffer?
 Health maintenance organizations can also save money by refusing to pay for medical tests and procedures that are deemed unnecessary. But people with serious health problems often reach into their own pockets to pay doctors outside the network -- another example of cost-shifting.
Critics say low-cost H.M.O.'s may sacrifice quality of care. "Physicians see this on a daily basis," said John C. Goodman, an economist who is president of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group based in Dallas.
"When they are practicing for an H.M.O.," Dr. Goodman contended, "their incentive is to under-provide to patients, because that means more money in their pocket."
Daniel N. Mendelson, an economist at Lewin-VHI, a health research company based in Fairfax, Va., said: "We are already in that world where everybody isn't getting everything. Rationing is happening. Some managed-care organizations are going to realize savings because they are not providing state-of-the-art medicine."
To be sure, many health maintenance organizations have elaborate programs to improve the quality of care and report the results to employers, and many H.M.O.'s are rated highly by their patients in surveys.
Experts who are more sanguine about the savings from managed care argue that only 30 percent to 40 percent of such costs are now shifted to other payers. A group of big insurance companies and commercial H.M.O.'s commissioned a study recently by Lewin-VHI researchers, which said that although nearly 80 percent of the savings in network-style H.M.O.'s came from discounts, there could still be savings of $37 billion in 1998 from more efficient and reduced use of health services.
"Under managed care, the entire system would become more efficient," said Karen Ignagni, president of the Group Health Association of America, a trade group of H.M.O.'s. She said there would be savings from programs like disease prevention.
But William B. Schwartz, a health economist and professor of medicine at the University of Southern California, predicted that although a $37 billion saving, if it materialized, would reduce the amount spent that one year, the reductions would soon be wiped out by continuing increased costs of at least $60 billion a year.
Dr. Schwartz contended that national health spending would rise 6 percent each year no matter what system is in place. Half of the increase would result from expensive new technology, one-third from modest, 2 percent pay raises for nurses and other health workers and the rest from the needs of a growing and aging population.
Some economists say it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of managed care because H.M.O.'s attract younger, healthier people, while people with medical problems typically prefer fee-for-service insurance.
Noting that new technology has added enormously to the quality and cost of medical care, Dr. Schwartz listed procedures now taken for granted that did not exist 20 years ago, including hip replacement, lens implants, balloon angioplasty and magnetic resonance imaging.
"As long as you have expensive technology coming on stream, and as long as managed care provides that technology, they are not in a position to effectively contain costs," Dr. Schwartz said.
Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, added, "The legal system will make sure that new inventions that have any hope at all will get rammed down the throats of the H.M.O.'s."
Dr. Reinhardt cited a California jury award last December of $89 million to the family of a woman who died of cancer after an H.M.O. ruled that she could not have a bone marrow transplant.
 
Budget Office Doubts
 By 2000, some industry experts say, nearly all Americans will be in some type of managed-care plan, although some networks will probably be less tightly controlled than others.
The Congressional Budget Office said in March that if all insured people were in tightly organized H.M.O.'s, national health expenditures could be reduced by 5.5 percent, which would be $55 billion this year.
But the budget office noted that this would require a fivefold expansion of H.M.O. capacity and significant changes in the way many managed-care groups function. It added that at least 30 percent of the United States' population lives in small towns and rural areas unsuited to H.M.O.'s.
Jack Zwanziger, a public policy analyst at the University of Rochester, said that in Southern California, where managed-care plans dominate, hospital costs were rising more slowly than in other states. "Every year the rates are lower," he said.
But several economists said that California still had higher health costs per capita than most other states. The Congressional Budget Office said surveys of employers showed that many health maintenance organizations had cut back on covered services.
It added that reports of managed-care premiums rising at a slower rate than traditional insurance were a "weak" argument for comparing costs. The budget office said "a valid comparison" would have to examine total costs, including out-of-pocket costs of individuals.
"Although H.M.O.'s appear to reduce the level of health care costs, there is no credible evidence that they reduce the rate at which costs subsequently increase," the budget office concluded.

HEADLINE: GROWING ECONOMY PRODUCES SURPLUS IN STATE BUDGETS

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

 BODY:
In a fiscal turnaround that would have been all but unthinkable in the nation's statehouses just a few years ago, state budgets are swelling with revenue and nearly half the states have enacted election-year tax cuts in recent months.
In state capitals from Boston to Phoenix, lawmakers who fought in 1991 and 1992 over how to fill huge, painful budget gaps instead battled this year over how to divide unexpected wealth. A growing national economy has largely been responsible, and not only for the surge in revenue: it has also helped to ease recession-era strains on the budgets, like welfare spending and Medicaid. 
 To be sure, the tax cuts so far are generally dwarfed by the tax increases enacted a few years ago to deal with the budget gaps, and in some cases they are small enough so as to be little more than symbolic.
Many states, including New York, are expected to consider much larger tax cuts next year. And with revenue now outrunning projections in all but a handful of states, many lawmakers are also talking about using surpluses next year to raise state workers' salaries or to restore spending on programs they cut a few years ago.
But amid the rush to divide up spoils that in some states are measured in the billions of dollars, many fiscal experts are warning that the brighter fiscal picture is temporary and, in some ways, even illusory. Nor is it uniform: California's fiscal picture, for example, could be charitably described as having improved in two years to severe from disastrous.
Still, the current revenue boom is undeniable, and state tax coffers are growing far beyond the rate of inflation. Eighteen states had double-digit increases in revenue from sales taxes in the past year and 23 saw such increases in business taxes, according to a report released last week by the Center for the Study of the States at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany.
In at least 22 states, the response this spring or summer was to cut taxes. At $649 million, New Jersey's cut was the largest of any state, said Steven D. Gold, the director of the center. Other large cuts per resident were in New York ($470 million), Arizona ($115 million), Georgia ($100 million) and New Mexico ($50 million). Seventeen other states, including Texas, cut taxes by lesser amounts this year.
For nearly all the states, however, even larger amounts of money will almost surely be the subject of discussion next year. This has prompted caution from fiscal experts who warn that widespread tax cuts or spending increases could wind up proving catastrophic if the nation's economy begins another downturn.
Another ominous factor on the fiscal horizon, they say, is the states' growing prison populations and the potentially huge cost of tough crime measures like the three-strikes-you're-out provisions adopted by 11 states in recent years and pending in a dozen others.
 
Mixed Blessing for Governors
 For the nation's governors, the surge almost seems a mixed blessing. "The budgets are in better shape, there is no question," said Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who is chairman of the National Governors' Association. "And because there were huge tax increases to plug these big holes a few years ago, the public has a deep concern about tax cuts now."
But even as he promised to work for a tax cut if he was re-elected this fall, Mr. Dean was clearly concerned about going too far.
"The proper thing to do is to put aside a contingency fund" for a future downturn, the Governor said. "But our Legislature in Vermont has not shown the discipline to indicate to me that they wouldn't just spend it. So the second-best choice is a tax cut."
A similar thought was expressed by the chief fiscal official in Texas, John Sharp, the State Comptroller. Last Wednesday, Texas ended the first year of its two-year, $70.1 billion budget cycle. Asked in an interview for an accounting, Mr. Sharp said the state wound up the year with $2.1 billion more in its treasury than had been anticipated.
 
Don't Tell the Legislators
 "The economy is roaring," the Comptroller said. "I want to say the state economy is doing well because I want people to read it, and it certainly is the truth. But I don't want legislators to read it because I want legislators to continue what they have been doing for the last three years, which is finding better ways to operate."
In a year when 22 governors are up for re-election, including those in the nation's four most populous states, the political implications of the states' improving fiscal pictures could be enormous and, for them, positive.
Then again, voters may prove oblivious to or skeptical of the positive news. After all, many may simply be hardened by images of the tax increases and budget slashing that incumbent governors oversaw earlier in their terms.
A good example is New York, where Gov. Mario M. Cuomo presided over a $470 million tax cut last spring, mostly in business taxes. As he campaigns for a fourth term, he is plausibly able to talk about enacting future tax cuts ranging from $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year.
But Mr. Cuomo also remains the man who has presided over a series of unpopular fee and tax increases, the deferral of scheduled tax cuts, a doubling of state university tuition costs, cuts in popular state programs and a freeze in the salaries of state workers. And some of their unions, which have been instrumental in his rise to power, now refuse to endorse his re-election.
 
Good News for Incumbents
 Still, tax increases tend to be the thing that enrages voters the most, and in virtually every state they are not an issue this fall. Simply put, that is good news for incumbents.
In Texas, for example, Mr. Sharp, a Democrat who is up for re-election, cheerfully asserts: "There will not be a tax increase next session. Slam dunk, period."
The more apropos question, in state capitals around the country, is how much of a tax cut to give the voters. To be sure, there are plenty of governors and legislators who insist that deep tax cuts represent a golden opportunity, a way to force state governments, even in flush times, to pare back to the essentials.
The most far-reaching experiment with such a concept is in New Jersey, where Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, was elected last year on a pledge to cut state taxes by 10 percent a year over three years.
But Mr. Gold, the director of the Center for the Study of the States, said that many states had done little to address long-term structural problems in their budgets and warned that this guaranteed painful deficits in the future, when the economy slowed.
Equally important, "states have been passing the buck to local governments," Mr. Gold said, adding, "To some extent, this appearance of health at the state level is partly due to shifting fiscal stress to cities and counties and schools."
Another advocate of caution is Hal Hovey, the editor and publisher of State Budget & Tax News, a bimonthly report. The upturn in state revenue is striking, he conceded. Indeed, having published the 1992 issue entirely in red ink to dramatize the fiscal straits of the states, he put out an all-green-ink issue this summer.
But Mr. Hovey warned: "This big boom in revenues probably won't be sustainable. And for the states in general, it is my opinion that significant tax cuts are more dangerous than they have been in years."
In a few cases, most notably in Mississippi, where revenue from sales taxes rose 15.4 percent this year, some of the gains cans be attributed to casino gambling. But that is an unreliable source of steady cash because an increasing number of states, including some close to Mississippi, are on the verge of legalizing casino gambling.
In general, though, the surge in revenue is a direct result of the economic recovery. The budget picture looks strongest in the Rocky Mountain and Southeastern states, many of which weathered less turbulent fiscal times in the early 1990's.
In California, progress is measured best only by how the size of the state's problems has shrunk. Three years ago lawmakers were confronted with a potential budget gap of $14.3 billion, which was filled by a combination of spending cuts, borrowing, tax increases and shifting costs to local governments.
Since then that gap has decreased by almost $3 billion a year; this year, in a $55 billion budget, lawmakers fought over filling a relatively manageable $5 billion hole, said Mac Taylor, deputy legislative analyst for the California Legislature.
But Mr. Taylor noted that one risky assumption built into the current budget and the next one was that California would regain $3.6 billion in its lawsuit against the Federal Government over the cost of providing services to illegal aliens.
California also offers a striking example of how spending on prisons puts pressure on the budget. In the last several years, the state has cut 5,000 employees in higher education, part of an overall plan for deep budget cuts. But those savings were more than wiped out by the addition of 8,000 workers to the budget for corrections officials.
 
History Lesson in New York
 In other states, the overall economic recovery has been less than dramatic, but the states' fiscal condition has been aided by tough measures like those in New York, where the state work force was reduced by 10 percent during the recession.
"The cost containment that the state did in those difficult years helped us to get to the point where now we can look at tax cuts, with the recovery of the economy, as a reasonable option," said Rudy F. Runko, the New York State budget director.
But history offers an obvious caution. In the mid-1980's, during another economic boom, Governor Cuomo and legislative leaders in Albany agreed to nearly $5 billion in tax cuts. Before long, Mr. Cuomo was saying the cuts were too generous and was asking for tax increases; by 1991, he and the Legislature were staring at budget gaps of $4 billion or more.
This time around, Mr. Runko said, another tax cut is feasible. But he urged that state officials move with prudence. "The Governor is saying these cuts must be affordable, without doing damage to essential state services," he said. "And they must not impact the local governments."

HEADLINE: Parade Shows Off West Indian Political Clout

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
The West Indian American Day Parade, the largest annual street celebration in New York City, was an explosion of colorful costumes, a haze of spiced food and a thunder of steel-band music yesterday, flowing down Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn. But first came the politicians, strutting for support from one of the city's burgeoning immigrant groups.
The Caribbean festival drew state and local politicians by the dozens, demonstrating the infusion of new and potential voters represented by immigrants, including those from the Caribbean islands. 
 The political overlay on the parade, which a half-dozen years ago was just a large but local ethnic festival, was particularly significant given the cancellation of this year's Labor Day Parade because of weakening support for the event among unions. When organized labor was in its glory, that parade represented an opportunity for a command performance for any savvy politician.
So it was yesterday at the West Indian American Carnival Day. Officials from Governor Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and political hopefuls ranging from Al Sharpton to Bernadette Castro, both candidates for the United States Senate, crowded a pre-parade breakfast yesterday in the Crown Heights neighborhood and then led the parade, which in recent years has grown to attract as many as 2 million people.
"There's a growing recognition that the West Indian community has become one of the most important political forces in the city," said Marty Markowitz, a state senator representing Crown Heights, which has a large Caribbean population.
Politicians also made their presence known in other raucous parades upstate, on blustery boardwalks in the Rockaways and in 30-second attack ads broadcast from Long Island to Buffalo, as the summer campaign for governor shifted into high gear for the Sept. 13 primary and the November election beyond. [Page B2.]
Estimates of the Caribbean population in New York City run as high as 500,000, and the Department of Planning reported that from 1982 to 1989 153,000 people from 23 Caribbean countries moved to the city. In the 1980's, the department said, more immigrants came to New York from Jamaica than from any other country except the Dominican Republic.
The culture of the Caribbean was on full display yesterday. Eastern Parkway was lined with stands offering an array of foods for sale, including curried goat, pigs' feet and fried plantains.
As flatbed trucks rolled down Eastern Parkway, the infectious pounding of the drum and brass music had the crowd dancing, leaving out almost no one. A man caught in the spirit grabbed the hand of a police officer and had her boogeying, though reluctantly, and the driver of a bus crossing Eastern Parkway on Nostrand Avenue was bouncing up and down in his seat to the music.
 
Chance With the Crowd
 But everywhere the culture of politics was evident. Political signs were plastered on almost every available street light and utility pole. Before the parade began in earnest, the politicians had their chance with the crowd, walking, waving and shaking hands.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said the Caribbean parade has "gotten the attention of the political community in greater degrees in the last five or six years."
She said that for Labor Day in the last couple of years, some politicians had attended both the unions' parade in Manhattan and then the Caribbean parade.
The Labor Day Parade, which became an annual event beginning in 1981, was held off and on for nearly 40 years and always drew a hefty share of politicians. Labor leaders decided to cancel this year's parade and hold the event every other year because the decline in union membership made the event a financial strain on locals, said Ted H. Jacobsen, the secretary of the New York City Central Labor Council.
Although Mr. Jacobsen was not ready to declare labor politically impotent because its parade was canceled, other labor leaders said the loss of verve for the event seemed to be part of a trend following recent losses in Congress -- including the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the failure of legislation that would have banned the use of permanent replacements for strikers.
 
'The Cheapest Poll'
 "I wish our members were as enthusiastic about their unions as Caribbeans are about their roots and ethnicity," said Jan D. Pierce, the vice president of the Communications Workers of America for the Northeast region.
Norman M. Adler, a political consultant advising Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell among other candidates, called attendance at parades "the cheapest poll" for determining whether a community's potential political power was growing or shrinking. He said the burgeoning Caribbean and Puerto Rican parades were evidence of the rising power of immigrant groups.
By 1 A.M., the police had not yet released an estimate of the size of the crowd. They said one participant, Marc Rock, 29, of Queens, was killed when he fell from a float and was crushed under its wheels. Sixty-nine other people suffered various injuries, mostly minor, and 39 were taken to hospitals, the Emergency Medical Service said.
With the Labor Day Parade canceled, Mr. Adler predicted last week, the Caribbean parade "is going to be the politicians' substitute photo-op."
The pre-parade breakfast, held at a social club at Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway, brought together the politicians and more than a hundred leaders of the Caribbean community. And the efforts by the politicians to woo the community leaders were plain to see.
"It's true we have to get to know each other better," Mr. Giuliani said. "My success as Mayor has a lot to do with your success as a community."
And Mr. Cuomo, rolling out his joke du jour, said he was asked yesterday if he was planning to attend the parade, and "I said, 'Of course: I'm from Jamaica'." That's Jamaica, Queens.
The Governor's joke drove home a point -- that politicians now think it is smart to identify with the Caribbean community. "There was a time when there was Italy, Ireland and Israel for New York City," said Senator Markowitz, the Brooklyn state senate Democrat. "Now you have to add on the Caribbean as a major power center."
 
A Balancing Act
 In turn, the Caribbean community is organizing politically. Una Clarke, a Caribbean-American Councilwoman from Brooklyn, said that a goal had been established for each of the 60 musical and dance groups participating in the parade to register 25 people to vote and that a more comprehensive effort to get Caribbeans to become citizens and register to vote is underway in churches in Brooklyn.
The increasing size of the parade crowds has a political overtone, Ms. Clarke said. "When you look at the numbers of people, you can see a potential to become a serious economic and political force to be reckoned with," she said.
But the rise of ethnic groups also represents a balancing act for politicians. And yesterday's march down Eastern Parkway demonstrated that, too. The parade went past 770 Eastern Parkway, the headquarters of the Lubavitcher Hasidic movement, which was the nerve center of that community as it prepared for the observance of Rosh ha-Shanah.
City officials negotiated with both Caribbean and Hasidic leaders for months in an attempt to avoid tensions between the two groups. The 1991 disturbances in Crown Heights were started after a Guyanese boy was killed when struck by a car driven by a Hasidic Jew. A Jewish student was fatally stabbed later that night.
There was also concern that the choice of the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. as one of the parade's marshals would increase friction between the groups. Mr. Chavis, recently ousted as head of the N.A.A.C.P., embraced black leaders, particularly Louis Farrakhan, minister of the Nation of Islam, whom many Jews view as anti-Semitic.
But the police reported no problems of that nature. And the only jostling appeared to take place among politicians.
Mark Green, the City Comptroller, said yesterday that he had told Mrs. Castro, a newcomer to the campaign business, that "the only thing worse than fund raising is the elbowing at the front of the parade lines."

HEADLINE: Politicians Still Courting Perot's Leaderless Army

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CUSHING, Me., Sept. 1

 BODY:
At the height of the bitter battle over ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Ross Perot held a Washington news conference to denounce the pact. Representative Olympia J. Snowe was right there beside him.
And when Mr. Perot's organization, United We Stand, holds a candidate forum this fall, Ms. Snowe, a nine-term Republican from northern Maine now running for the Senate, will be there as well. 
 It is not the power of Mr. Perot himself that draws politicians like Ms. Snowe to his side. His popularity ratings have been sinking for months. It is not the strength of United We Stand. While its officials say they have millions of members, they have stopped releasing the hard numbers, and many doubt their figures.
What does matter, in the gubernatorial, Congressional and legislative elections across the country this fall, is the potentially pivotal position of the mass of voters who supported Mr. Perot for President two years ago -- almost 20 million of them, 19 percent of the national total.
Once an army, they are now a rabble, without leaders and without marching orders, but still armed with their ballots.
In many states, including this one, where Ms. Snowe's Democratic opponent is Representative Thomas H. Andrews, they may well decide the outcome of important races. Maine was Ross Perot's best state in the 1992 Presidential election; he finished second, pushing George Bush into third, even though Mr. Bush has spent almost every summer of his life in the state.
Indeed, Mr. Perot carried three of the state's counties -- Waldo, Somerset and Piscataquis -- all in Ms. Snowe's Second Congressional District.
Senator William S. Cohen, a moderate Republican from Bangor, said he was persuaded that former Perot voters "will probably tilt the Senate race for or against Olympia." The desperate poverty of much of northern Maine, he said, "make Perot's ideas appealing to a lot of very angry people."
"They don't demonstrate or anything, because Maine is not that kind of place," Mr. Cohen said, "but they seethe with anger."
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who worked for Mr. Perot, said: "United We Stand is basically ineffectual in most places. Maine, Florida, parts of Texas, parts of Michigan, it might count for something. But what you have here is like an iceberg; what's interesting is the 85-90 percent below the surface, the people no longer personally loyal to Ross Perot, no longer active, if they ever were, in the organization, but still profoundly committed to his issues."
National surveys show that the former Perot voters are angry, frustrated, disillusioned with both major parties, still yearning for basic political change and still convinced that neither major party is likely to supply it.
Steve Bost, a former Democratic legislator who is now the full-time executive director of United We Stand in Maine, says Perot supporters "think that Clinton has fought for change all right, but in the wrong direction, and they think the Republicans have completely failed to offer any realistic alternatives to Clinton programs like Nafta and health care reform and the assault-weapons ban."
"They're watching and waiting," Mr. Bost said.
Although others disagree, Mr. Luntz is convinced that they will vote this fall. If he is right, and if they vote preponderantly for one party or the other, then Mr. Perot's boast a year and a half ago that the Perotistas would make or break many Congressional candidates may prove true, even though he will have very little to do with it.
Mr. Perot squandered much of his popularity in a television debate on Nafta with Vice President Al Gore. He was widely thought, even among his backers, to have looked ill-prepared and superficial.
A more recent gambit intended to keep him in the limelight also failed. Mr. Perot offered $1 million to the Republican Party, which it agreed to accept, for a television program attacking President Clinton's health care proposals. Anne Gavin, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said the networks refused to sell the large blocks of time that would have been required.
United We Stand is precluded, because of its status as a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, from formally endorsing candidates or contributing to their campaigns. Instead, it holds forums at which candidates make their pitches and it sends out questionnaires intended to win commitments from candidates on issues like deficit reduction, Congressional pay cuts and changes in campaign spending laws.
 
'Haven't Heard a Peep'
 Politicians in Maine report little organized activity by the Perot forces. For example, Peter Hastings, a former legislator who lives in Fryeburg, a small town in the southwestern corner of the state, said: "I haven't heard a peep from them anywhere in rural Maine, which is where they should be strongest. That's where economic discontent is greatest."
Mr. Bost concedes it is not easy to measure the group's effect, but it informally backed candidates in special Congressional elections in Kentucky and Oklahoma this year, and both of them won.
In Texas, both Senate candidates are hotly pursuing the Perot vote. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, was strongly supported by the Perot forces in winning her seat in a special election last year, and her Democratic opponent, Richard Fisher, was active in the Perot campaign in 1992.
In Virginia, Oliver L. North, the Republican nominee, has been bidding for support from Perot voters in his "outsider" campaign for the Senate. In other states, including Connecticut, former Perot campaign officials have mounted campaigns of their own this year.
But Ben Coes, the executive director of the Maine Republican Party, who is himself a member of United We Stand, says the organization's best days are behind it.
"As an entity, it's really a paper tiger," Mr. Coes said. "But the voters are still out there, milling around, looking for candidates. They are going to vote for the candidates who can define themselves as anti-politics-as-usual, anti-Washington. They are going to vote this fall, of that I'm absolutely sure, but for whom?"
Among those in this state who hope to benefit are candidates who identify themselves with Maine's history of backing independents. One is Angus King, a former talk-show host on public television, who is running a serious campaign for governor, and James Longley, the Democratic nominee in the First Congressional District. His father, a former governor, was elected as an independent.
Douglas Hodgkins, a professor at Bates College who has studied the Perot phenomenon, sees Perot supporters as swelling the ranks of a whole new class of Maine voters prepared to vote for independents. That group, Mr. Hodgkins said, "is built into our political culture here, and with the powerful antipartisan mood in the nation, I think it will soon be duplicated nationwide -- we're just a little bit ahead."

HEADLINE: President Begins a Campaign to Avoid Losses for the Democratic Party in November

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BATH, Me., Sept. 5

 BODY:
President Clinton opened a campaign today to fend off heavy losses in the November elections with a Labor Day address that called attention to what the White House hopes will save Democrats: the creation of jobs.
At the huge shipyard here that is Maine's largest employer, Mr. Clinton pointed to the 4.1 million jobs by which the nation's economy has grown since he became President and called that a measure of a vitality that his critics have overlooked. 
 Speaking to hundreds of workers and their families, who huddled under umbrellas in a cold, driving rain, Mr. Clinton jabbed his finger repeatedly for emphasis as he declared that his Administration was "not promising you miracles, but promising you progress."
In traveling here from his vacation on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., Mr. Clinton was in part conducting a rescue mission for the Senate seat being relinquished by George J. Mitchell, the Democratic leader. Representative Thomas H. Andrews, the Democrat who hopes to succeed Mr. Mitchell, is trailing Representative Olympia J. Snowe in the polls, and on a podium heavy with Democratic candidates and labor leaders, Mr. Clinton sought to give Mr. Andrews's campaign a much-needed boost.
 
Seeking a Second Look
 But the thrust of the President's remarks looked ahead to what promises to be an autumn-long bid to shore up other foundering allies. Mr. Clinton hopes to persuade dissatisfied voters to take a second look at just how much he and his fellow Democrats have achieved.
In remarks drafted by the White House, Senator Mitchell began today's rally with a reminder that Mr. Clinton had confounded the Republican critics who warned last summer that his package of tax increases and spending cuts could cripple the economy. In fact, Mr. Mitchell declared, the budget deficit has declined, economic growth has soared and more jobs have been generated than under "the two previous Republican Presidents put together."
And Mr. Clinton himself called that steady job creation the signal product of what he portrayed as his battle "against some very, very powerful enemies of change."
"For the first time," he shouted, wearing a baseball cap and a machinists' union windbreaker in the downpour, "manufacturing jobs in America have increased now for eight month in a row." He said he would look beyond Labor Day by renewing his dedication "to keep this economic recovery going."
 
Visiting 6 States
 Mr. Clinton, of course, will not face a re-election fight for two more years. But the White House is already bracing for Republicans to score major midterm gains in the House and the Senate, and Mr. Clinton's visit here was the first stop on a heavy autumn schedule as he tries, despite his own dwindling popularity, to use whatever influence he can muster to prevent Democratic losses from becoming disastrous.
With some Democrats trying to distance themselves from Mr. Clinton, it is an open question whether he can make much difference. But after returning to Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton is scheduled to travel to Louisiana, California, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and New York in the coming three weeks to raise money for his allies and campaign on their behalf. Before Mr. Clinton's speech today, some advisers of Mr. Andrews had expressed some anger about the President's visit and a possible scheuduling conflict, but Mr. Andrews was here with Mr. Clinton.
The shipyard he chose as his setting today, Bath Iron Works, has built vessels for the United States Navy for 110 years. Cutbacks in defense spending have reduced employment there to 9,000 from a peak of 12,500, but the yard has been kept alive by contracts to build Aegis guided-missile destroyers, a project that Mr. Clinton championed.
At the same time, the workers, who are members of the International Machinists' Union, and management have now settled on a contract intended to give the shipyard new flexibility as it begins to seek the nonmilitary business on which it will soon be forced to rely. Calling that step a model for the ones many other American enterprises must now take, Mr. Clinton suggested that the shipyard's efforts to complete its post-cold-war conversion should be seen as evidence that "we can build the economy on the strength of your example."
 
Finishing His Vacation
 Before delivering his speech this morning, Mr. Clinton toured the Aegis destroyer Laboon, which was named for a Vietnam War-era chaplain with the Marines and is still under construction. He then stood by as showers worsened while the shipyard's owners, labor leaders and Senator Mitchell took turns extolling him and his Administration.
By the time the President reached the microphone, the wind and rain kicked up by a northeaster that blew into the region overnight had turned so heavy that he was shouting to be heard. He spoke for only 10 minutes before telling the crowd that it was time to leave "or we're going to raise health care costs by staying in the rain too long."
By midafternoon, Mr. Clinton was back on Martha's Vineyard, hoping to take advantage of the last few days of a vacation that was busy through the weekend with golf, book shopping and a dinner Sunday night with Maurice Tempelsman, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' longtime companion. Mrs. Onassis' children, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, joined the President for dinner at the house they inherited from their mother.
This afternoon, Mr. Clinton bade farewell to his 14-year-old daughter, Chelsea, who was returning to Washington to prepare for the first day of school, and he then celebrated that new independence by inviting his wife, Hillary, to join him on the golf course -- gusty wind, driving rain and all.
"This is good weather compared to what we play in at home," Mr. Clinton insisted as he teed off in a blue jogging suit to begin his sixth round in the last 10 days.

HEADLINE: Steel Mill Is Shadow Of What It Once Was

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FONTANA, Calif., Sept. 1

 BODY:
It was a symbol of America's industrial might, one of the world's biggest, most sophisticated, most expensive steel mills, employing thousands of workers and producing 2.3 million tons of high-grade carbon steel a year when it went on line in 1979.
But almost immediately, the 23-story-high Kaiser Steel Corporation plant, built at a cost of $287 million, became a symbol of wrenching changes in the economy, its roaring furnaces burdened by international competition, environmental regulations, labor disputes and the encroachments of corporate raiders. 
 Within three years it was closed. This desert town 45 miles east of Los Angeles, once home to citrus groves, then part of Southern California's industrial engine, slipped into the shuttered slowdown that has gripped the region.
Now, since early last year, the mill has been the scene of one last burst of activity: 300 Chinese workers from the Shaogang Steel Corporation in Beijing have been cutting, unbolting, dismantling, marking and crating the 55,000-ton mill and shipping the pieces to southern China for reassembly.
Amid sprays of sparks from cutting torches and the roar of giant cranes, each piece -- some nearly 200 tons -- was photographed and chalk-marked in Chinese characters to be matched with blueprints and painstakingly fitted back together.
 
$400 Million Moving Job
 Shaogang Steel, otherwise known as the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, estimates the operation will cost $400 million. California Steel Industries Inc., which bought the plant, along with related steel-finishing operations, from Kaiser Steel in 1983 for $120 million, will be paid just $15 million for it. The main plant never resumed operation in part because of competition from low-cost Japanese and Korean steelmakers, who were accused of dumping steel at prices below cost in the Western United States.
"That was the only offer there was with people that had the money to pay for it," said Don Duffy, vice president for operations for California Steel. "The price they are paying us is a pittance by comparison with the total costs for them."
Nevertheless, the deal makes good sense for the Chinese, who do not have experience in building sophisticated steel mills, said Matt MacFadden, California Steel's vice president for human resources.
"Ten years ago this was the very best in the world," he said. "There haven't been that many dramatic improvements. Looking at this facility, knowing that it ran, knowing that the configuration worked together, knowing its heat, its tonnage per hour -- why try and reinvent the wheel?"
It has been a long ordeal for the Chinese workers, who have lived virtually sequestered in a motel in nearby San Bernardino with little contact with American society other than occasional visits to places like Disneyland and Chinatown. Their own cooks have trucked lunches to the work site.
As they began to arrive, the Chinese were the subject of protests by labor unions here, angry that the dismantling jobs did not go to American workers in the struggling economy of Southern California.
"These jobs don't belong to those Chinese guys," Joe Perez, executive secretary of the Building and Construction Trades Council in Riverside, said at the time. "They belong to us. We put this thing up, and we should be able to take it down. We want those 300 jobs."
But the protests soon died; the sale of the plant was contingent on employing Shaogang workers, so they could become intimately familiar with the structure they would rebuild.
 
Land to Be Swept Clean
 The deal with Shaogang includes a promise that the 76 acres on which the massive plant stood will be thoroughly cleared and leveled. The last components are being loaded onto railroad flatcars and onto 175-foot-long trucks so big they can only travel the highways after 10 P.M., headed for the Port of Los Angeles.
Two sea shipments have already arrived in China. The last will leave soon.
At the dismantled plant, the last members of the Chinese work crew, with their yellow plastic hard hats, are breaking its concrete foundations into chunks of no bigger than 10 square inches that will be used as fill.
Other members of the crew are already in China working on the early stages of the reassembly of the plant, which is known as the No. 2 Basic Oxygen Process and Caster Operation, or "BOP 2."
"It was like peeling a banana," Mr. MacFadden said. "First the outer structure came off. Then the equipment itself. The casters. The last thing left was the furnaces, huge ladles."
He looked around at the dusty site, where one crew, using a crane, was loading a section of steel frame onto a flatcar, another was knocking down the concrete base of the last of six 12-story elevator shafts and a third was pulling iron reinforcing bars from piles of broken concrete.
"This is what's left: massive rubble," Mr. MacFadden said. "They've gotten the ladles out of here, the bag house, the water-treatment facility. It's wild. I couldn't believe it would come down so quickly. We're to the point where everything's come down and nothing is up in its place yet."
Now that the plant is gone, he said, it is still not certain how the land will be used. There is talk of building a mini-mill to process scrap steel, or the area might be used as a transport and loading yard for the smaller steel-processing mills that surround it.
 
Big Appetite for Steel
 In China, where the economy grew by as much as 13 percent last year, the plant will add to a burgeoning industrial base and feed a voracious appetite for steel.
Richard S. Masco, project engineer for the Diversified Packaging Development Corporation, an American subcontractor for Shaogang Steel, said the Chinese could have the plant up and running in as little as two years.
"These are some of the finest engineering people I have ever run across," said Mr. Masco, who coordinated the work of crews of American subcontractors including heavy equipment operators, technical advisers and truck drivers. "They are fantastic, organized, everything in its place, everything in its order. The heavy lifts were all engineered to the point of exactly what angle the booms on the cranes were to be."
There was a note of poignancy in his words. It is the Chinese workers who now embody the energy, know-how and optimism that have been a part of this region's lore.
While California Steel thinks about what to do with the vacant land, Kaiser, which is now out of the steel business, has plans to build an auto raceway on an adjacent tract.
A decade and a half ago that outcome would have seemed impossible. The mill, built with more steel per square foot than any other building in the country, was meant to withstand the harshest onslaughts, including an earthquake up to 8.6 on the Richter scale of magnitude.
"This was meant to be here in perpetuity," Mr. MacFadden said. "When the earth ended, this thing was going to be here."

HEADLINE: Gay Presence Leads Revival Of Declining Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
As cities around the country continue to shrink, urban planners say the neighborhoods molded by homosexuals in recent decades are taking on a new importance as bastions against further decay.
Although there are no authoritative statistics to track the migration of homosexuals to various urban neighborhoods, their presence -- and with it their economic power -- has become increasingly visible. 
 In addition to well-known areas like Greenwich Village in New York and the Castro district of San Francisco, predominantly gay neighborhoods have arisen in a dozen major cities over the last two decades, at once bolstering those cities' sagging tax bases, pumping thousands of dollars into the economy and sometimes making tired neighborhoods safer and more attractive to heterosexuals.
 
Rehabilitation and Stability
 "They've stabilized a lot of neighborhoods where they've stayed," said Dianne Welchko, a real estate agent in Chicago for 25 years.
Seattle's Capitol Hill section, for instance, has in the last 15 years seen an influx of gay men and women who have rehabilitated houses in the working-class area. The Montrose neighborhood in Houston, once a declining working-class section, is now the geographic center of a lively gay community. In Miami, there is South Beach, in Denver the Cheesman area, in Cincinnati Liberty Hill and Northside, and in St. Louis the South Grand Street area. There are also concentrations in smaller cities throughout the heartland.
"We surprise a lot of people," said Howard Harris, a technician who works with the Federal Aviation Administration in Oklahoma City. "And we're the buckle in the Bible Belt."
George Chauncey, a social historian at the University of Chicago, said data on gay neighborhoods had been elusive, largely because the Census Bureau did not identify them as such. But he said anecdotal indicators pointed to their growth. "The evidence comes from gay and lesbian voter drives, the proliferation of gay-oriented businesses and the addresses of people on gay mailing lists or political action committees," said Mr. Chauncey, the author of "Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940" (Basic Books, 1994).
William Frey, a demographer who studies minorities at the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan, said, "These neighborhoods are like earlier ethnic enclaves."
Perhaps nowhere is the phenomenon of gay neighborhood as urban pillar truer than in the Dupont Circle section of Washington, a half-mile north of the White House. In the past 20 years it has been transformed from a rundown area of stores and apartments badly in need of renovation to one of the most vibrant and desirable places to live in the District.
 
'We Need a Realtor'
 Today, a lively mix of restaurants, nightclubs and businesses keeps the area awake long past the time the rest of the city has closed its eyes and rolled up the sidewalks.
Robert Bray, who travels around the country for "Fight the Right," a grass-roots project of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, summed it up with a twist on a recent war cry of advocates for gay rights: "We're here. We need a realtor."
In 1970, commercial space in the area cost about $15 a square foot, according to figures from Washington Realty Group Inc., a large real estate agency. During the mid-1980's, at the height of the real estate boom, commercial space went for $25 a square foot. During the same period, a $350,000 town house in Dupont Circle would have increased in value to $750,000. And monthly rents for a one-bedroom apartment there rose to $750 from $400 during the period, the last for which figures are available.
"The gays get a lot of the credit for turning this area around," said City Councilman Jack Evans, whose district includes Dupont Circle. "You see the same thing happening in the 14th and U Street corridors, which are just now recovering from the urban disturbance of the 1960's."
 
Born of Crisis
 Sociologists and demographers alike say the concentration of homosexuals in core neighborhoods has grown in the last two decades out of gay political advocacy and the AIDS crisis, as well as from generally more tolerant attitudes toward homosexuals.
That visibility has translated into demarcated gay neighborhoods whose residents demand recognition. Today, dozens of large and midsize cities have gay pride events each year, and proposals to ban discrimination against homosexuals appear regularly as local ballot questions. New York City and Cincinnati, for example, have passed such legislation in the last five years and other cities have such legislation pending, like Oklahoma City, where the International Gay Bowling League and the International Gay Rodeo Association stage annual events.
Steve Collier, the executive director of the Oklahoma City Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the two events accounted for hotel bookings of several thousand rooms. Mark S. Schwartz, a member of the Oklahoma City Council whose ward has the most visible gay population in the city, said: "They bring in a lot of people, and that helps the local economy. Their deposits look the same, their taxes look the same."
The Rev. Kit Cherry, public relations associate of the Metropolitan Community Church in Los Angeles, said the influx had benefited urban areas as much as homosexuals. The church, whose members are mostly homosexual, has 270 congregations in the United States.
 
Political Involvement
 "We've offered cities faith in themselves," Ms. Cherry said. "We went into cities at a time when many people were abandoning them for the suburbs. We fixed up buildings that were falling down and got involved in local and regional politics to insure the well-being of cities."
The concentration and visibility of gay men and women in urban neighborhoods have not come without cost. Such distinct neighborhoods also attract hostile outsiders.
Stuart Michaels, a research sociologist at the University of Chicago, lives in Lakeview, an area that has been steadily gentrified into a gay enclave. "People looking for gay people to bash know where to come," he said. "If you're walking down the street, it's not unusual for some young kids in a car to yell, 'faggot' at a man or 'dyke' at a woman with short hair."
In addition, as buildings and housing in these areas are revived and property taxes increase, some lower-income residents are being driven out. And not everyone is enthusiastic about living in a neighborhood with a large homosexual population.
 
Some Feel Discomfort
 "There have been times when I've felt uncomfortable in my own neighborhood," said Pam Taylor, who works for the Voice of America and lives in Dupont Circle. Ms. Taylor said she was happy to hear from gay friends that the area was no longer the city's only gay neighborhood.
"There are places, particularly on 17th Street and P Street, where heterosexuals avoid walking down those streets because of what they feel is an in-your-face attitude by gays that they don't belong there," she said.
Because homosexuals in neighborhoods like these are so visible, experts say they give rise to inaccurate images of gay men and women. The wealth on display in upscale neighborhoods like Lakeview and Dupont Circle, where houses typically sell for $500,000 and up, promote the notion that all homosexuals are rich.
Two recent studies have challenged that stereotype. In June, Yankelovich Partners Inc. released a study showing that homosexual couples have about the same household incomes as heterosexual couples of similar educational levels. And a study by Lee Badgett, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, that was released last month showed that homosexuals generally earned less than their heterosexual counterparts, because of discrimination.
The assumption that they earned more, Ms. Badgett said, was based on market research that had focused on white, high-income homosexuals who lived in neighborhoods like Dupont Circle. Ms. Badgett found that gay men nationwide earned 11 percent to 27 percent less than heterosexual men in comparable jobs. Lesbians earned 5 percent to 14 percent less than heterosexual women.
Other distinctions have emerged in studies of homosexual communities done by Bob Bailey, a professor at Rutgers University, for Strubco Inc., a marketing research firm in New York that compiles, categorizes and sells lists of people, and Voter News Service, which conducts exit polling for the television networks and The Associated Press. The study showed that gay men were likely to concentrate in densely populated, gentrified inner-city areas near bars, restaurants and social-service institutions, while lesbians were more likely to be dispersed and live in working-class neighborhoods.
In addition, homosexuals who are members of ethnic or racial minorities often settle in neighborhoods where their ethnic and racial groups are concentrated.
There is also a shift away from traditional gay and lesbian neighborhoods in New York City. For example, people who track homosexual-population trends say that many homosexuals are eschewing identifiable gay neighborhoods for more diverse areas, like Park Slope in Brooklyn and Jackson Heights in Queens.
"There is a portion of our community that wants to be separatist, to have a queer culture, but most of us want to be treated like everyone else," said Dick Dadey, executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda, an organization that lobbies for homosexual rights. "We want to be the neighbors next door, not the lesbian or gay couple next door."
That increasingly means that homosexuals are choosing to stay in the suburbs or in the small towns and midsized cities they come from, Mr. Dadey said. "As people exhibit individual acts of courage by coming out," he said, "we're finding out how diverse we are."

HEADLINE: Postal Service Says Troubles In Chicago Are Being Resolved

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 5

 BODY:
In May, firefighters responding to a blaze in a suburban condominium found more than a ton of mail inside dating back nearly seven years.
The letter carrier who lived there, Robert K. Beverly, has since pleaded guilty to stealing and delaying mail and was recently sentenced to 21 months in prison. It was one in a string of cases since February that led to Chicago's postal service being rated the worst in the country, but officials there now say the things are getting better. 
 "You don't hear those egregious kinds of reports much anymore," said the postmaster, Rufus Jones, 46, who assumed leadership of the Chicago district in May. "We've made a conscious effort to identify and ostracize those kinds of individuals, ending their employment or disciplining them."
Mr. Jones said that 60 postal employees had been suspended or discharged since February, and that "52 percent of the top staff had been replaced."
The United States Attorney's office said six letter carriers had been successfully prosecuted on criminal charges since February, including Mr. Beverly.
Mr. Beverly, who asserted that his workload was overwhelming, was charged with delaying and stealing 3,396 pieces of first-class mail, 1,138 pieces of second-class mail and 22,439 pieces of bulk mail, as well as 4,364 compact discs from two music clubs, valued at $65,460, according to court records. It has cost the United States Postal Service $69,380 to reimburse advertisers and deliver the first- and second-class pieces that accumulated in his apartment.
Starting in February, Chicago residents heard one story after another about their post office, including ones of mail accumulating in delivery trucks of letter carriers who did not deliver and of mail being thrown in a viaduct and set afire.
The Chicago postal district, which handles nearly 10 million pieces of mail each business day, has 4,250 mail carriers. The local chapter of their union, the the National Association of Letter Carriers, refused to comment on the suggestion that their workload had been overwhelming. But a spokesman said that they were working with postal authorities to upgrade service.
 
Workers Are Retrained
 Mr. Jones said more than 2,000 postal employees of all ranks had been retrained since May, attending classes on the theoretical concepts of mail delivery as well as practical how-to classes on casing and delivering mail.
"In terms of worker productivity and service, there has clearly been an improvement recently," said Sam Peltzman, an economics professor at University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business who has studied the postal service.
Yet, Mr. Peltzman added that the post office needed to address larger questions of coping with emerging technologies as well as its future role. "It will be obsolete if present cost trends continue," he said. "Their rates have gone up over time in a business where their competitors' rates, particularly in the electronic media, have gone down."
But that is a far-off concern for Mr. Jones, who says, "We're not where we want to be by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm cautiously optimistic."

HEADLINE: Asian and European Markets Off in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Asian and European stock markets were mostly lower yesterday in trading thinned by closed exchanges in the United States. All financial markets in the United States and Canada were closed yesterday for the Labor Day holiday.
Stocks in Japan followed the dollar lower yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 244.65 points, or 1.18 percent, at 20,409.18. But traders in Tokyo said the drop was exaggerated by thin trading volume. In trading early today, the Nikkei had gained 28.41 points. The dollar fell to 99.05 yen in Tokyo, from 99.20 in New York on Friday, but it later rose back to 99.20 yen in trading in London. 
 Hong Kong stocks closed firmer but below the psychologically important 10,000 level after a sharp rally that drove the Hang Seng index of 33 stocks up to a peak of 10,064.86 ran out of steam. The Hang Seng closed up 60.48 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent, at 9,962.04. In trading early today, the Hang Seng had fallen 63.80 points.
In London trading, the dollar slumped against the German mark, falling to 1.5545 marks, down from 1.5537 marks in New York trading on Friday.
In Frankfurt, German stocks ended sharply lower. The DAX index of 30 issues closed at the lowest level of the day, falling 30.19 points, to 2,174.52.
French stocks ended a choppy day as traders sought a new resistance level after the CAC index of 40 issues broke the psychologically important level of 2,000. Buying was depressed by a lower dollar and a sharp fall in bond futures. Interest rate cuts in Europe are now seen as less likely because of a strong growth outlook. The CAC index closed down 22.17, or 1.1 percent, at 1,998.20.
Swiss shares were flat, with the Swiss Market Index up 2.50 points, at 2,674.50. Dutch stocks closed lower. The Amsterdam EOE index of 25 leading issues closed down 1.17 points, at 417.17.
But the London Stock Exchange, Europe's largest, surged yesterday, brushing aside the gloom in other European markets. A late rally helped the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading issues close up 18.8 points at 3,241.5, after having been down more than 16 points earlier.
Oil prices, meanwhile, fell sharply in London yesterday as a strike by oil workers in Nigeria ended.
North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery fell 32 cents, to $16 a barrel, having dipped as low as $15.85 earlier in the session. Oil prices were last below $15.90 in May.
Prices fell on the news that thousands of Nigerian oil workers returned to work yesterday. Union officials said a two-month-old strike to protest the arrest of an opposition leader had ended.

HEADLINE: The Case for a Sale of Kidder

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
If General Electric is trying to sell NBC, can Kidder, Peabody, the company's troubled investment bank, be far behind?
Like the television network, Kidder is a G.E. acquisition that never really worked. And even as reports of G.E.'s efforts to shed NBC trickled out last week, the conventional wisdom on Wall Street was that G.E. would not or could not keep Kidder. There are at least four reasons: 
 *Kidder is not No. 1 or No. 2 in its industry, the cardinal criterion for any business in the G.E. pantheon in the era of John F. Welch Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive.
*As an investment, Kidder has been a dud.
*G.E. has proved beyond reasonable doubt that it cannot manage a Wall Street firm.
*Mr. Welch has a record of admitting defeat and cutting his losses.
 
 
Managers Forced Out
 Mr. Welch has spent a good deal of time trying to fix Kidder already. And his job has been tougher since April, when the firm said $350 million of the profits it thought it had earned were fictitious creations of Joseph Jett, Kidder's chief trader in government bonds. Mr. Welch promptly forced out Kidder's top management and sent two of his top lieutenants, Dennis Dammerman, G.E.'s chief financial officer, and Denis Nayden, G.E.'s top financial trouble-shooter, to steady the firm while taking a hard-nosed look at each of Kidder's businesses.
Kidder and G.E. would not comment on Kidder's track record or plans for the future, but a Kidder spokesman said Mr. Dammerman and Mr. Nayden expect to share the results of their examination -- and the broad outlines of an action plan -- with Kidder employees later this month.
Mr. Welch has also started to look for a new Kidder president with a track record in the securities business, something neither Kidder's former chief executive nor the new G.E. team had.
 
 
Preventing the Worst
 The intervention by G.E. -- with its triple-A credit rating, sterling reputation and skillful damage control -- has prevented the worst from happening. Kidder has not been spurned, as were Drexel Burnham Lambert and E. F. Hutton after their scandals, by the lenders who finance Kidder's huge inventory of securities.
Nor have large institutional investors suspended business with Kidder, as the California Public Employees Retirement System, the World Bank and others did with Salomon Brothers after its bond trading scandal in 1991.
But all of this activity may be only a prelude to casting Kidder adrift, either by shutting it down, selling it or spinning it off to G.E. shareholders, many analysts and Wall Street competitors say. It is not as if G.E., which bought Kidder in 1986 to gain a foothold in booming financial markets, was happy with the firm before the scandal. And now Mr. Welch, who does not brook failure, is clearly feeling even worse.
Kidder would not be an easy sell, what with the Jett scandal, the end of the bull market in bonds and a dearth of buyers with both the cash and the compelling need to own an investment bank. "This fiasco with Jett doesn't make it a very salable property right now," said Kent A. Newcomb, a securities analyst at A. G. Edwards.
The investment bank would be a big bite to swallow for even the biggest American commercial banks. And the European banks that want to deepen their involvement in United States capital markets have had some discouraging experiences with previous acquisitions.
So it appears that for the time being, G.E. has little choice but to hold onto Kidder while it tries to fix it up -- to revive confidence in management and to show that Kidder can make money. G.E. faces a situation similar to that of American Express a few years ago, when that company decided to part with Shearson Lehman Hutton after a long but lackluster association. It took several years and hundreds of millions of dollars in cash infusions before American Express was able to get rid of the brokerage firm.
"None of the options seem particularly attractive," said Guy Moszkowski, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
For all the attention G.E. is lavishing on Kidder, however, it is still likely the unit will go.
 
 
The Business
Not Big Enough, And Slipping
 Kidder, with its $60 billion in assets, $5 billion in revenues and about 5,000 employees, is the nation's 12th-biggest securities firm, based on assets. But its main claim to fame is its astonishing dominance of the market for mortgage-backed securities. That business has accounted for more than two-thirds of Kidder's profits in recent years, people at the firm say. But it has shrunk quickly this year as rising interest rates choked off new issues, which were down nearly 30 percent through August, compared with the first eight months of 1993.
And, more recently, Kidder seems to be having trouble getting the business. According to the Securities Data Company, Kidder was the lead manager on just seven new mortgage bond deals in August, helping to raise $1.25 billion, compared with nine deals worth $6.3 billion a year earlier.
While the flow of talent from Kidder has been a trickle rather than a waterfall, there are signs of edginess. Some of Kidder's most productive brokers -- those who cater to clients with deep pockets -- have left.
And traders in Kidder's huge fixed-income operation are said to be spending a lot of time on the phone with friends at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, First Boston, Union Bank of Switzerland and other concerns that have hired Kidder people in the past.
The most valuable players are not likely to make their exits yet, because that might cost them big year-end bonuses. "By the end of this year, if people are not treated as they think they should be, that would be a good time for the trickle to become a waterfall," said a recruiter who spoke on condition of anonymity. And much will depend on G.E.'s ability to hire executives who inspire confidence, including the new president Mr. Welch is looking for.
 
Lackluster Profits
A Weak Return On G.E.'s Money
 Absent the Jett dealings, which Kidder said had caused it to report $350 million in phantom pretax profits over 28 months, the company has returned only $270 million on G.E.'s total investment of $1.3 billion since 1986. (The investment includes the $600 million purchase price plus capital infusions of $500 million or so in the late 1980's and early 1990's plus a $200 million infusion in April.)
Kidder's average profit margin in the last eight years, in the low single digits, has not only paled beside that expected from other G.E. businesses -- GE Capital's profit margin has been in the double digits for years -- but has also looked sickly beside those of other Wall Street firms. And in 1993, a blockbuster year in which profits of the top 11 firms spurted 20 percent, Kidder's earnings fell 6 percent.
If the investment bank could not soar in the biggest bull market of the decade, prospects look distinctly unappetizing during bleaker times on Wall Street. Kidder has been losing money this year as interest rates have climbed and the bond market has soured. Not counting Mr. Jett, Kidder lost $40 million in the first six months of 1994, G.E. said, making it all the less likely that Kidder would achieve the break-even performance that G.E. predicted in June for the final two quarters of 1994.
 
 
The Management
The Perils Of a Rich Parent
 G.E. proved it was not adept at managing a Wall Street firm in several ways. For starters, there was Mr. Welch's choice of Michael A. Carpenter, a management consultant from headquarters with no experience on Wall Street, who ran Kidder for five years until he was dismissed in June after the Jett scandal.
Mr. Carpenter was able to stanch the defections from Kidder, control costs and oversee the firm's leap into a mortgage powerhouse. But he was not able to transform Kidder the way new management transformed other second-tier firms like Smith Barney and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
And Mr. Carpenter headed a management team that was sharply criticized for failing to supervise Mr. Jett.
Just steadying the organization is proving to be difficult, even with G.E.'s enormous resources. Kidder's interim leaders, Mr. Dammerman and Mr. Nayden, have spent most of their time either with the regulators and the United States Attorney who are investigating the Jett scandal, or with key Kidder clients and creditors.
"They aren't close to stabilizing the situation," said one executive close to Kidder. "They may have stabilized it in terms of controls and investigation, but I'm sure they are not even close to having a lock on key people."
The thought has occurred to many analysts that G.E. may have inadvertently contributed to Kidder's management problems. "Maybe it's the business of people having a big parent with lots of money," said Perrin H. Long, a securities analyst at First of Michigan. "Maybe that breeds a feeling of, 'I don't worry too much; I'll let G.E. worry about it.' "
 
The Chairman
Not Sentimental About Laggards
 Mr. Welch, the G.E. chairman, has no tolerance for businesses that do not perform up to his expectations. In the last decade, he has shed nearly two dozen major G.E. businesses that were worth $11 billion and that employed tens of thousands of workers.
The businesses that he shut or sold included some that he was, for a time, enamored of, including a large factory-automation business. And now he is apparently thinking of getting rid of NBC, another business he was enthusiastic about when he bought it in 1986.
Of course, Mr. Welch says that G.E. thinks Kidder still has a great franchise and that G.E. has no intention of abandoning the firm.
But as a potential seller who has no interest in driving down the value of his property, Mr. Welch's assurances have all the persuasiveness of a finance minister's promise, on the eve of a devaluation, that he will never, ever debase the currency.

HEADLINE: Boeing Expects 737 Orders

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: FARNBOROUGH, England, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The Boeing Company announced plans today for a longer version of its 737 jets and said it had obtained commitments from four customers who wanted 40 of the jets at a total price of nearly $2 billion.
Boeing also announced today -- the opening day of the 1994 international air show here -- that it had four firm orders for its 767-300ER jetliners. Those planes, valued at $384 million each, will be leased to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines by the International Lease Finance Corporation. 
 The new version of the 737, called the Boeing 737-800, will be 9 feet, 2 inches longer than the 737-400 and able to carry 164 to 189 passengers. The first deliveries are expected in 1998, the company said.
Boeing, based in Seattle, declined to disclose the names of the expected customers for the 737's, saying it had yet to enter into contracts.
One customer, it said, also plans to buy eight 737-700's, which would bring the total package to about $2 billion. Those jets can be configured for as many as 144 seats.
Last year Boeing announced that Southwest Airlines would take delivery of the first 737-700 in 1997.
At the air show, Ron Woodard, president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said, "We expect to see airplane orders and deliveries recover during the second half of the 1990's."

HEADLINE: Labor Day: When Summer Wanes and the Race for Governor Begins to Heat Up

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
In raucous parades in Rochester and Crown Heights, on blustery boardwalks in the Rockaways, and in 30-second attack ads aired from Long Island to Buffalo, New York's gubernatorial candidates yesterday kicked off the traditional start to the fall campaign that this year will determine whether Mario M. Cuomo is written into the state's political lore for winning a fourth term.
Within nine weeks, as New York voters resolve whether to keep or dump Mr. Cuomo, a one-time Democratic Presidential aspirant, they could also set the state on the path toward radical changes in its policies on taxation, welfare and the death penalty. In the process, they may send a message, along with voters in California, Texas, Florida and other large states, about the health of President Clinton's coalition and his own prospects for re-election in 1996. 
 But as Labor Day marked the fading of the summer campaign, New York's gubernatorial contest remained a race that has yet to take full form.
First of all, both parties and their leading candidates -- Mr. Cuomo for the Democrats, State Senator George E. Pataki for the Republicans -- face primaries on Sept. 13. But more importantly, perhaps, is the view held by leaders of both parties that Mr. Pataki has not used the last two months to establish his political persona.
Despite Mr. Cuomo's vulnerabilities, Democratic and Republican strategists agree that the Republicans cannot simply run against him without offering a credible alternative, both in a candidate and a platform. And some Republicans are concerned, and Democrats are cautiously optimistic, that nine weeks may not be long enough for the Republicans to do that.
 
A Landmark Date
 "I think he is up to the task of running the state," Assemblyman John J. Faso, a Kinderhook Republican, said of Mr. Pataki, his legislative colleague. "But I don't think he has yet made a convincing case of that."
In reality, the campaign has been chugging along for nearly a year. But political strategists use Labor Day as a landmark date when voters return from vacations and begin to concentrate on the choices that loom two months down the road. In addition to the gubernatorial race, New Yorkers face decisions about other statewide offices, the Legislature, the House of Representatives and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
The acceleration of political energy was palpable yesterday, at least partly because candidates knew that the primaries are only a week away and that campaigning will be compressed by the Rosh ha-Shanah holiday.
While the candidates walked beaches and streets, the real work of their campaigns was being waged on the airwaves, where Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Pataki and Richard M. Rosenbaum, another Republican candidate, all have placed aggressive new television commercials that take on at least one opponent. In some television markets, the ads appeared back-to-back during evening newscasts, potentially leaving viewers confused about who was assailing whom.
Although they have not yet won their primaries, both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki are neck-and-neck in some polls and are focusing on each other in their advertising. Mr. Cuomo's new commercial, his first to mention Mr. Pataki by name, accuses Mr. Pataki of saying he supports a ban on assault weapons while voting against it in the Senate. In his ad, Mr. Pataki blames Mr. Cuomo for raising taxes and vetoing the death penalty.
 
Out Among the Voters
 Mr. Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman who is considered a long-shot to defeat Mr. Pataki in next week's primary, was preparing to begin a $400,000 statewide advertising campaign today that will depict both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki as Albany dealmakers.
At a Labor Day parade in Mr. Rosenbaum's hometown of Rochester yesterday, and in Brooklyn, where he campaigned on Saturday, there was evidence that previous ads had helped New Yorkers recognize the candidate, whose gravelly bulldog voice is as distinctive as his hairless head.
"Hey, the party's over," Tioga Cherry, a Rochester bus driver, yelled at Mr. Rosenbaum, echoing the slogan of a Rosenbaum ad about forcing delinquent fathers to pay child support.
Mr. Pataki's campaign has largely ignored Mr. Rosenbaum, and his aides have publicly predicted an overwhelming victory in next Tuesday's primary. Indeed, Mr. Pataki originally planned to take the Labor Day weekend off, feeling it would be his last chance to rest and spend time with his wife, Elizabeth, and their four children.
He changed plans after deciding he did not want to convey any signs of complacency, and attended a volunteer fire department parade in Broad Channel, Queens, before searching for votes at a cabana club in the Rockaways.
 
The Coats Are Coming Off
 Mr. Pataki spent most of the summer raising money for the fall, quite successfully. But rather than using his time and resources to detail his views, he has made vague promises about cutting taxes and spending and imposing welfare restrictions in the mold of his gubernatorial role models, William Weld of Massachusetts and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. He also says he will sign legislation approving the death penalty.
"We don't want to lay out a plan that sounds good politically but that you can't realistically adopt next year," Mr. Pataki said yesterday, discussing tax cuts. "What we are going to tell the people this fall is exactly what we are going to do next January, very much like Governor Whitman, who told the people what she was going to do and is doing it."
Perhaps the most enthusiasm of the day was shown by the 62-year-old Mr. Cuomo, a 12-year incumbent who would break Nelson A. Rockefeller's modern record for longevity by completing a fourth term. (Only George Clinton, New York's first Governor, served longer.)
Marching in the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn, Mr. Cuomo suddenly picked up the pace and shed his blue coat, walking at a speed that left other politicians behind. As Mr. Cuomo raced ahead, Reginald H. Bowman, a candidate for Assembly in Brooklyn, shouted into a portable microphone: "That's right, Mario is running for his life."
Mr. Cuomo's aides say he has been energized by his acceptance of the Republican threat, both to his personal legacy and, in his mind, to the state. He was quoted recently as saying in an editorial board meeting that New York could lose its "humanism" and "civility" if he is not re-elected.
 
Increasing Criticism
 In an interview after leaving the parade, Mr. Cuomo stepped up his criticism of the Pataki campaign's characterization of his record.
"I'm not going to allow them to do what they have done for six months, which is talk about Cuomo, lie about Cuomo and not tell the truth about the state," he said.
Mr. Cuomo said his campaign would begin to expose Mr. Pataki's record, beginning with the assault weapons ad. "The test is not so much, Is it negative?" he said of his advertisements. "Is it honest? Is it useful? Is it relevant? Most of all, is it honest? Are you telling the truth? These people say we're No. 1 in job losses. It's not true." (In fact, Federal statistics show that New York ranks second in job losses since July 1990, when the national recession began).
Mr. Cuomo continued: "They tell you they are going to give you a huge new tax cut. I'm the only person in the race that said we'd give you a tax cut and did it. Nobody else ever did it. I did it. When my opponent was mayor, his taxes went up 20 percent. So we'll simply tell the truth."
But in fact, Mr. Pataki was responsible for tax increases of only 8.4 percent during the three years he served as Mayor of Peekskill in northern Westchester County, according to Peekskill officials. In the past, the Cuomo campaign has tried to saddle him with responsibility for a 21 percent increase that took effect in his first year but had been enacted the previous year.
Asked about Mr. Cuomo's use of the higher figure yesterday, Mr. Cuomo's spokesman, Joel R. Beneson, said, "The Governor was mistaken. And unlike them, when we're mistaken we clarify it immediately."

HEADLINE: Washington Public Schools Set to Open One Week Late

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The District of Columbia decided today to delay the start of school by five days, until Sept. 12, after a judge turned down a stopgap plan to put fire patrols in the hallways at dozens of schools that do not meet fire codes.
Most of the District's schools are in compliance with the codes, but education officials have said it would be too confusing to keep some schools closed while opening others as scheduled on Wednesday. The school board ordered the officials to draw up plans to accommodate the students whose schools will remain closed next Monday. 
 For a few weeks, the school system has been struggling to complete work ordered in June by Judge Kaye K. Christian of District of Columbia Superior Court. She told officials they had until Aug. 30 to correct thousands of fire code violations in the city's 166 school buildings, where more than 80,000 students attend classes. The city had been sued by a group of parents over the violations.
Although the delay in opening the schools is, on its face, a matter of safety, education officials including Superintendent Franklin L. Smith said the real problem was the chronic underfinancing of the school system in the nation's capital, which is beset with budget problems.
With a backlog of $500 million in needed repairs and an annual capital budget of less than $15 million, the schools continue to deteriorate and their perennial safety problems are swept under an ever-more-ragged carpet.
 
Time of Political Upheaval
 In this sense, the travails of the schools here resemble those in New York City, where schools opened 11 days late last year because of concerns over exposing students to asbestos.
The problems of the local schools also come at a time of political upheaval in the city, with a Democratic mayoral primary race considered too close to call. The incumbent Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, has fallen well back in the polls behind her two opponents, John Ray, a City Councilman who is critical of her management of the city, and former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who left office after being convicted on drug charges.
Amid confusion over when particular schools would open, fire officials and repair crews worked through the holiday weekend to bring as many schools as possible into compliance, but about 50 schools have still not be cleared for opening by the judge.
And officials acknowledged that some schools would not be ready for weeks. Some schools lack working fire alarms or fire doors, or have other serious violations that are costly and time consuming to correct.
Judge Christian continued to receive reports from fire officials who were inspecting the schools, and in the next few days, she will grant or deny their requests for individual schools to open.
To avoid a citywide delay in opening school, lawyers for the city had proposed a plan endorsed by the city's fire marshal in which schools with violations of the fire code could open, as long as an adult trained to watch for and report fires was on duty at all times.
But Judge Christian rejected that proposal, calling it mealy-mouthed. To approve the plan, she said, would be "to ignore everything the court heard throughout six days of trial."
 
Plan Accepted by Parents
 The lawyers for parents who won the court case calling for the city to bring all the schools into compliance said they would reluctantly accept such a plan, viewing it as a temporary expedient that would balance the needs for safety against those for education.
But Judge Christian, in a hearing this morning, disagreed. She said the law made no such provision for what she considered a waiver of the fire codes, and she insisted that each school pass inspection before opening.
The plaintiffs, in effect, got more than they bargained for today from the judge, who over the course of the legal proceedings has been sternly laying down the law like a tough principal dealing with unruly adolescents.
"The judge has said that 100 schools could open, and as far as we are concerned, that's fine with us," said Alfred M. Mamlet, a lawyer for the parents' group. He said the group would not support any effort to teach classes in alternative locations, like churches, because they also might not meet fire safety standards.
One parent at the hearing this morning, J. E. McNeil, a self-employed single mother who was not a party to the lawsuit, said that the plaintiffs had run amok and that she was distressed to find that her son's school would not open even though it had been found in compliance with fire rules.
She said school board members who urged parents to share child-care duties for a few days did not understand the economic pressures on parents, or the risks to students of staying home from school in a city that is plagued with violent crime.
"Some parent, somewhere, is going to have to stay home and take care of my child -- probably me," she said. "I am concerned for all the children who see school as a safe zone."

HEADLINE: Entrepreneurial Company Defies Singapore Model

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
Sim Wong Hoo, white-shirted, bespectacled and voluble, is something of a rare species in this corporate city-state -- he is a high-tech entrepreneur.
"I guess I stick out like a sore thumb," laughed Mr. Sim, who at the age of 39 pilots a billion-dollar company, Creative Technology Ltd. His company has brought music to the personal computers of America and the world in the form of the Sound Blaster, a stereo soundboard that is inserted in the computers. 
 Visitors to Singapore, and many American multinational companies who base their regional headquarters here, speak of its immaculate streets, manicured lawns and very modest crime problem, thanks to a culture of hard work and obedience and the liberal use of the cane for petty offenders.
Singapore, though, has been inhospitable to individualism -- that indispensable ingredient of entrepreneurial culture. The intrusive hand of government -- almost all major companies are run by, or have major shares owned by, the state -- has made Singapore a particular economic success story, yet has all but squashed innovative, start-up companies.
"Singapore can be a tough environment for entrepreneurship," Mr. Sim said, "but if you can get by the tough part, you become very tough."
The climate is so tough, in fact, that when he decided to take his explosively growing company public two years ago, he had to turn to the Nasdaq market in New York, because the stock exchange in Singapore seemed unprepared to cope with what he was trying to do. Not until two months ago, when Creative Technology had achieved a market capitalization of more than $1.6 billion, did he finally list the company in Singapore.
"It's like a son coming home," Ngo Get Ping, a senior vice president at Nomura Securities, said of the company's listing here.
Mr. Sim is struggling to use his success to confront other challenges like increased competition, falling profit margins and swiftly advancing technology. His products still sell well, but he acknowledges it is still uncertain where the next frontier and the next big profits lie.
Some analysts also wonder.
"They took a Singapore company and made it a billion-dollar company," said Kevin Scully, the research director at Schroder Securities here. "But the question is: How do you find another Sound Blaster? It is very hard to make the next quantum leap."
The story of Creative Technology, founded in 1981, shows that while missteps and setbacks have been frequent, Mr. Sim's unwillingness to concede defeat and a knack for nimble shifts in strategy and product development have propelled him and his company forward.
"We knew from the beginning that we wanted to have our own technology," explained Mr. Sim, who earned an associate degree in engineering from a local college. "We wanted to have our own products. But it is very hard in Singapore because the Singapore market just doesn't support it."
His first product was a computer. "I looked at the PC and said it was dumb," he recalled. "I said computers should talk. Computers should play music.
He continued: "I believe in sound. I believe in music. But in the early days, the technology was not there."
 
Cheap and Plentiful Competition
 That first personal computer, called the Cubic CT, was aimed solidly at the Singapore market, and it almost sank him. Swarming around were cheaper PC clones being manufactured in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
"All this originality, and people just did not appreciate it," Mr. Sim said. "This was just not the business to be in despite all the effort we put into it." He was left with a handful of engineers and a few technicians, and in 1986, the future looked bleak.
Mr. Sim and his engineers looked at the Cubic CT and began playing around with the machine's sound board. "I took the thing out and made it into a very simple, low-cost music board, which we heavily protected," he said. "And it turned out to be good business because nobody had it."
He took the board to a computer exhibit in the United States that year, and the rest was history. "The money we made on a few hundred boards," he said, "was the equivalent to the money we made on the PC."
The next year, Mr. Sim moved to the United States and badgered manufacturers of games to incorporate his music standard into their games. Within a few years, his sound card, the Sound Blaster, emerged as the industry standard for sound in personal computer software around the world. A company was born.
"Today, we just totally dominate the market," he said. An American competitor, Media Vision Technology, has filed for bankruptcy protection, and Creative Technology is involved in litigation against another Singapore company, Aztech Systems Ltd., contending patent infringements.
On the fourth and seventh floor of a plain, concrete building in a Government-sponsored manufacturing zone, Mr. Sim's company churns out about 600,000 sound cards a month. The most basic card sells for less than $50 in the United States.
About 65 percent of the market in sound boards is in the United States, with the rest evenly split between Europe and Asia.
"Margins on the Sound Blaster are coming down," he said. "It's becoming a commodity, but we are over 60 percent of the market."
 
Strong Results Taper Off
 The company's annual results, released last month, for the fiscal year that ended in June, showed a surge in profit to $97.9 million from $44.8 million on sales of $657.9 million. But fourth-quarter results reflected the decline in margins, with profit down nearly 12 percent over the fourth quarter of the preceding year.
Mr. Scully of Schroder said he was impressed by the earnings report, but he added: "The strong earnings growth will be difficult to sustain. They are in a mature product cycle. The product they are making is a mass commodity and there is price erosion, about 5 percent per quarter."
Now, as Mr. Sim confronts the question of where to go next, he says, "The next frontier is to merge the telephone function together with the sound function."
He offered an example in which someone stuck in a traffic jam could call the computer at home, ask it to read any electronic mail and have it record and dispatch the reply.
Mr. Sim said the technology to do so was available and coming down in cost. "We're less than a year away," he said. "The pieces are all over the place. You just have to glue them together."
Creative Technology already offers a system for conferences between personal computers. Using a small video camera mounted atop a monitor, two users can see one another, talk and work on a single, shared spreadsheet together, all over a single telephone line.
But another product used to edit full-motion video, called Video Blaster, has failed to generate much excitement in the marketplace. Of Creative Technology's 3,000 employees, 400 are engaged in research and development.
"We're very good at putting a lot of things together, integrating a lot of technology," Mr. Sim said. "We have built the research and development to do this. That's how we succeed."

HEADLINE: Developers Seek Profits in Polluted Land

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J.

 BODY:
If the 166-acre tract of scraggly, garbage-strewn undergrowth here seems an unlikely place for a new shopping mall, consider what lies beneath its scarred topsoil. For decades, almost all of this city's trash was buried here.
In the parlance of environmentalists, the site is a brown field -- something less polluted than a toxic waste dump, but still needing more extensive cleanup than the undeveloped greenery of the nation's suburbs and rural areas. 
 That is just what Peter Aagaard, a Danish builder who specializes in the reuse of polluted land, was looking for when he paid $10 million for the property in 1992. Now, as he prepares to clean it up and build a factory outlet mall with 200 stores and 7,300 parking spaces, he has joined a broad effort by planners and government officials to steer development to abandoned, polluted urban land and to loosen government regulations that are defended fervently by environmentalists.
 
Like a Walk in the Park
 "This site really isn't that complicated," said Mr. Aagaard (pronounced AAY-gard), who has built large projects on polluted industrial sites in Denmark and Spain but never before in this country. In Europe, where undeveloped land is scarce, builders must remove centuries of garbage and industrial residue. Cleaning up a landfill like this one would be a walk in the park, he said.
For developers like Mr. Aagaard -- and the Ikea company, which four years ago built a store here atop a landfill -- the attraction is simple. Because American banks are often unwilling to lend money to develop such land, the prices are relatively cheap.
Mr. Aagaard, 37, says his total costs of acquisition and cleanup will be just under $200,000 an acre, which he said was about half what developers would expect to pay for a large plot of unpolluted, ready-to-use land next to a busy highway. And in his case, the highway happens to be the New Jersey Turnpike, one of the busiest in the nation.
"There are lots of good New Jersey locations that could be redeveloped," said Mr. Aagaard, who is now looking for another polluted site in the state. "Unfortunately, most people won't take the risk."
His project has attracted unusual interest across the region, where developers, fearing the high cost of environmental cleanup, have bypassed places like Elizabeth, and where a long history of industrial expansion and decline has created the nation's largest concentration of abandoned brown-field sites.
But the interest is not confined to partly polluted areas like the Elizabeth landfill. New Jersey and several other states have already scaled back some of their regulations for environmental cleanup, and Congress is considering broad changes in the Federal Superfund regulations for the cleanup of the nation's most severely polluted sites, changes that might make even them more attractive for reuse.
 
Changes in Store for Superfund
 When it was enacted in 1980, the Superfund law required that severely polluted land covered by the legislation be cleaned up to a standard suitable for housing, playgrounds and other uses that would bring people in close contact with the soil. Some officials in Congress and large urban areas have complained that those standards sacrificed potential redevelopment of troubled industrial areas.
The Superfund rules will expire this year, and, judging from the bills before Congress, the new version of the law is likely to bring big changes. One provision being considered would create different cleanup standards for sites that are not to be used for housing, but rather for commercial developments like warehouses, factories or shopping malls.
Another provision would reduce the potential liability of banks that agree to finance the development of less polluted sites like the landfill here. Under current law, banks that are forced to foreclose on a developer of a polluted site could end up being held liable for the cleanup.
"The pendulum has swung too far in the direction of protection from theoretically harmful environmental affects," said H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, which studies land-use issues in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. "We have created enormous barriers to redevelopment that need to be lowered."
The association has spent three years putting together an inventory of brown sites in Union County, which includes Elizabeth, and is helping Mr. Aagaard with the environmental review for his project. The group has found 185 sites, totaling 2,500 acres, that it says could be reclaimed.
 
'Polluters off the Hook'
 But some environmentalists say that reducing the level of environmental regulation, either through the Superfund law or state rules, would be a mistake.
"The argument that you can apply laxer cleanup standards for industrial users is simply a way to let polluters off the hook," said Steven A. Romalewsky, toxic prevention coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a private monitor of government.
"If the polluters don't pay, taxpayers will," he added.
Others maintain that it is precisely because brown sites tend to be concentrated in poor areas, like Union County, that tough environmental safeguards are necessary.
 
In Wake of Love Canal
 "These sites are often next to residential areas that are occupied by people of color, and it is not going to be the government or industry that lives there in the future," said Vernice D. Miller, an environmentalist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
No one denies that Federal and state regulations on environmental cleanup, most imposed over the last 15 years in the wake of the Love Canal contamination near Buffalo, have discouraged redevelopment of partly polluted brown-field land, especially in and around New York City.
"Banks take the position that they don't want to get involved," said Hugh O'Neill, a New York City environmental consultant who, in a study of industrial land in South Brooklyn earlier this year, found 20 abandoned brown-field sites along the Gowanus Canal, in Red Hook and in Sunset Park, most of which he said could be redeveloped.
Except in Union County, there is no complete list of the region's brown-field sites. But the Superfund program, which deals with the nation's worst hazardous waste sites, offers one measure of the region's legacy of industrial pollution.
 
New Jersey Has the Most
 Of the 1,232 sites on the National Priority List to be cleaned up under the Superfund program, New Jersey has the most -- 108 or nearly 9 percent of the total. New York, with 85 sites, ranks fourth, behind Pennsylvania and California. Connecticut, with 16 sites on the list, is among the 10 states with the fewest priority sites.
The Superfund list does not include the brown fields, but urban planners say areas with the highest concentration of toxic waste sites also tend to have many abandoned brown fields.
Several measures have been taken over the last year by cities and states in the region to identify and reclaim the brown-field sites. In late August, the city of Bridgeport was given a $200,000 grant from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to identity sites, determine how much pollution they contain and promote them to private developers.
The Federal grant came a year after Connecticut's Department of Environment Protection was authorized to raise $25 million through the sale of bonds to clean up polluted sites across the state. Unlike previous state cleanup programs, the new "Urban Site Remediation Program" is intended to speed the cleanup of urban property needed for economic development, not necessarily the most polluted.
 
Bergen County Has Most
 In New York State, private companies have announced plans this year to clean up an abandoned incinerator site in New Rochelle, a site polluted by oil in Syracuse and the sites of 33 idle coal-gas plants across the state.
And in New Jersey, the state's Department of Environmental Protection on Wednesday released a detailed list of 6,000 contaminated sites across the state. Although it said the list did not include every suspected area of pollution, it said the highest number of sites were in Bergen County, with 591 sites, and Middlesex County, with 541 sites.
A 1993 New Jersey law, the Industrial Sites Recovery Act, has provided state grants and loans for cleanup, changed state rules to allow different cleanup standards for housing, commercial and industrial uses and provided other incentives for brown-field development.
More than anywhere else in the region, Elizabeth has emerged as a laboratory for brown-field projects.
The first began in 1980, when officials here decided there was no hope of attracting private developers to a polluted 18-acre stretch of waterfront on the Arthur Kill, overlooking Staten Island.
So, with environmental grants from the state, the city began a 10-year effort to remove oil, metal and other pollutants from under the ground and and transform the site into a park, now called Veterans Memorial Waterfront Park, with manicured lawns, walkways and a marina.
"This site did not have a market," said J. Christian Bollwage, Elizabeth's Mayor, who said $6 million had been spent on the project. "The only thing that made sense was reclaiming it as open space."
The next project came in 1988, when, after years of effort, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey found a private company to develop an an abandoned landfill site the Port Authority owned here next to the New Jersey Turnpike.
 
Ikea Steps Into Breach
 The company, Ikea USA Inc., the Swedish chain of furniture and household goods stores, opened a new store on the site in 1990. Although the Port Authority had already paid for an extensive cleanup of the site before it tried to sell it, officials said no American company could obtain bank financing to buy it.
"Invariably, when we would find prospective buyers, they would go to their banks and tell us thanks, but no thanks," said Myron Ronis, a Port Authority manager who negotiated the sale to Ikea (pronounced eye-KEY-ah).
Then, in 1992, came Mr. Aagaard, who purchased his Elizabeth tract from a British company. Like Ikea, he said, he plans to develop it without American bank financing, and will spend $300 million, including $33 million to buy and clean up the site.
Linda P. Morgan, director of the Regional Plan Association's New Jersey Office, who was in charge of its Union County study, said some of the county's other brown sites pose problems for developers, including difficult highway access, but she said the sites could be cleaned up for less than builders assumed.
 
Surprise at U.S. Red Tape
 Mr. Aagaard said Regional Plan's help did much to speed the approvals necessary for cleaning up his site and building his mall, which he said he expects to open in early 1997. Nonetheless, he said, he was surprised by the amount of American red tape.
"When I met with agencies, there might be 25 people at the table, including me and two or three others I brought along," he said. "Isn't that a waste of taxpayers' money?"
Still, Mr. Aagaard, who moved with his wife and three children to Princeton, said he planned to spend at least two more years in New Jersey and would seek another large project on one of the state's polluted sites.
"I see all this land as an opportunity," he said.

HEADLINE: New Limits Are Seen to Freer Trade

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 31

 BODY:
In El Paso and across the Mexican border in Juarez, they call it the milk war. As soon as the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect on Jan. 1, American milk, freed from Mexican licensing requirements, flooded across the Rio Grande. It was competitive in price, and unlike most Mexican milk, it was date-stamped for freshness.
Angry dairymen in the Mexican state of Chihuahua won a 9 percent tax on milk imports in the border region. But 9 percent proved too small to deter local consumers. Now the Mexican milk producers, complaining that health rules in the United States block them from sending their milk across the border, are pushing to require stores selling American milk to sell theirs, too.
 
Dispute Becomes Nastier
 In recent weeks, the struggle has intensified. Trucks delivering milk from El Paso to Juarez have been trashed and torched, their drivers beaten. 
 A recent report to the Federal Reserve confirms what the El Paso milk producers have learned: new trade barriers -- sometimes disguised, sometimes blatant -- are eroding the benefits of the new trade agreement's lower tariffs.
Because of new paperwork and inspections, new health and safety requirements, new environmental and labor standards, new anti-dumping suits and new rules of national origin and labeling requirements, some businesses are little better off than they were without the trade agreement, the report's authors say.
 
Boon to Protectionism Seen
 While they note that the pact has promoted the overall flow of goods and services, they argue that in the long term, many of its provisions will serve protectionist ends.
Mexican and United States trade officials agree that as tariffs have come down, many other obstructions to trade, including new duties in all but name, have arisen in their place.
Even as Mexico has pulled nearly even with Japan as the United States' second-largest export market -- behind Canada -- industry groups in both countries have successfully put pressure on their governments to impose new protection for the steel, meat, dairy, cement and lumber industries, among others. Government help for producers of oilfield pipe, paper and wheat are pending.
The report avoids blaming either Mexico or the United States. But its authors, William C. Gruben, a research officer for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and John H. Welch, a former Fed economist and now a market analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, point out that Washington has led the way in creative protectionism.
"I hate to point a finger at the Mexicans, when the past masters of countervailing duties and anti-dumping charges have been agencies of the United States Government," Mr. Gruben said in an interview.
The report appears in the most recent issue of the Dallas Fed's quarterly Economic Review. Although the magazine's routine disclaimer says that articles do not necessarily represent the Fed's point of view, Mr. Gruben and Mr. Welch's manuscript was reviewed by top officials in Dallas and Washington.
The pact's sheer complexity, with hundreds of pages of cross-referencing clauses and formulas, has befuddled even many customs agents. But these difficulties are diminishing.
Over the long run, Mr. Gruben and Mr. Welch say, what seemed like muscular free-trade measures will accumulate flab, as industries learn how to defend themselves. "Any agreement can get middle-aged spread, just like the rest of us," Mr. Gruben said.
With elections completed in Mexico and coming up in the United States, and a new world trade treaty before the United States Congress, neither American nor Mexican politicians have wanted to confront each other publicly.
But the obstacles hardly come as a surprise. Canada signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, too, but the impact has been greatest on commerce between Mexico and the United States. Washington and Ottawa reached a trade accord in 1988, which brought down tariffs but was followed by a host of new trade barriers.
 
View Toward the Millennium
 "The history is that as tariffs are reduced, nontariff barriers are raised to substitute," said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, in a recent interview on trade with Mexico. "Then nontariff barriers are reduced. But it takes a long time."
Winning a global agreement on reducing barriers to agricultural trade took 20 years, Mr. Garten said. But, he quickly added, "In the year 2000, the economic historians will be able to write that the integration of the North American market proceeded faster than anywhere else."
This, however, is 1994, and eight months into the new era, Mexican officials concede that they have introduced a swarm of new inspections, regulations and anti-dumping cases -- in no case tougher than the Americans impose, they add. "When you compare nontariff barriers coming into Mexico with nontariff barriers coming into the United States, you will always find ours are not as restrictive," Jaime Serra Puche, the Mexican Secretary of Commerce, said in a recent interview.
More of the latest trade barriers appear to have been erected on the Mexican side, but in many cases the Mexicans are just catching up with the lobbyists and lawyers north of the border. The United States steel industry has filed carloads of anti-dumping complaints, contending that Mexican and other foreign producers were selling their goods for less than at home or below American costs of production.
When the Mexicans imposed anti-dumping duties as high as 79 percent on American steel a few weeks ago, American producers were left in the awkward position of quarreling with Mexico's dumping calculations but supporting its right to protect its steelmakers. In the United States as in Mexico, said Curtis H. Barnette, the chairman of Bethlehem Steel, "We have the continued right to use our trade laws if we feel there has been injurious trade."
And meat? The Mexicans have imposed new inspections and labeling requirements, often creating more border delays than before the trade agreement took effect. United States packers contend that the new procedures are redundant for meat that has already met Ariculture Department standards. The Mexicans respond that they require nothing more than the United States has long demanded for meat and other food that they ship north.
Lumber? Mexico now demands proof that it is not infested, even when it has been dried in kilns at temperatures up to 280 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to kill almost any bug. The United States charges $30 a truckload for the sanitary certificates, and the Mexicans charge $32 more to validate them.
 
Pact Didn't Solve Everything
 "These are the problems that people had hoped Nafta would eliminate, but it hasn't," said Sam Vale, a rancher who owns a border toll bridge in Rio Grande City, Tex. "It hasn't been a panacea by any stretch of the imagination. The paperwork is a nightmare."
The United States has begun a dumping inquiry on Mexican pipe used in oil production. And in May, Washington raised its anti-dumping tariffs on Mexican cement to 60 percent from 43 percent.
The authors of the Dallas Fed report say that while environmental, labor and health rules can serve their stated ends, they often disguise protectionism. Using a regionalism, Mr. Gruben refers to the unlikely link between labor leaders and environmentalists as the "Baptists and bootleggers phenomenon."
Anti-import furor in Mexico appears to have the support of the Government and industry groups. Public service television commercials show an imported car breaking down or a stuck zipper on an imported dress turning romance into comedy.
Even youngsters are conscripted into the battle. At a grade school in Patzcuaro, in central Mexico, a Children's Day party this spring offered dancing, singing and feasting in a courtyard festooned with banners warning the children and their parents against foreign toys.
In Juarez, the largest city in a dairy and meat region, the fight against imports has turned ugly. In recent weeks, a Farmers Dairy truck delivering El Paso milk to a Juarez supermarket had all its tires slashed, its refrigeration lines severed. Another driver was pulled from his cab and beaten, while his truck was driven away, wrecked and abandoned.
Three other trucks, parked at a Juarez warehouse and filled with Price's Creameries milk from El Paso, were doused with gasoline and consumed by fire. Borden trucks have also been hit.
"It's not in the spirit of free trade," said Gene Carrejo, Price's vice president for sales. So far, he added, Mexican authorities have found none of those responsible.

HEADLINE: An Immigration Puzzle;
Crises in Cuba and Haiti Resurrect Debate About Newcomers and Employment in U.S.

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
With Cubans piling up at Guantanamo and an invasion of Haiti seeming inevitable, the United States is once again facing the prospect of a tide of huddled masses -- only this time many Americans seem decidedly uneasy.
And while their feelings are a product of everything from racism to fears of cultural change to the end of the cold war, economics surely plays a big part. 
 "Americans think immigrants are stealing their jobs and lowering their standard of living," said William Alpert, an economist at the University of Connecticut -- thoughts that have a special resonance in an era of widening gaps in income between the skilled and unskilled.
Are the politicians and policy makers who see economic peril in continuing immigration correct? Research in the area has been less than conclusive, a fact that Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at Princeton University, says is feeding passions on both sides. "Some try to exaggerate" findings of job and wage losses, he says, while "some try the opposite."
The perceived economic threat of immigration, notes Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard University, is no different today than it was in the 1890's, when Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor was calling on Congress to "shut the doors." Unskilled immigrants compete with unskilled American-born, either reducing the wages of natives or putting them out of work.
 
Raising the Returns
 By the same token, if unskilled native-born citizens are made worse off by competition from immigrants, Americans with money are made better off. This is most evident in the availability of low-wage workers to wash dishes, mow lawns and tend babies.
Cheap, plentiful unskilled labor probably did (and still does) directly raise the returns to capital, both physical and "human." Machines and white-collar workers are presumably more valuable if it costs less to hire labor for the repetitive tasks of the assembly line. But does the scale of immigration currently being experienced in America portend such economic class conflict?
Ms. Goldin points out that the percentage of population growth attributable to immigration in the last decade is close to the spectacularly high peaks during the decades of the Great Immigration before World War I -- 33 percent in the 1980's, compared with 28 percent in the 1890's and 54 percent in the first decade of this century.
But David Card of Princeton surprised many fellow economists with his benign analysis of the most notable influx of immigrants in modern times, the 1980 Mariel boatlift, in which 125,000 largely unskilled Cubans flooded southern Florida in a matter of weeks.
Using other Sun Belt cities as a benchmark, he found that the Marielitos had no discernible impact on wages or unemployment. The local economy, he concluded, expanded rapidly enough to absorb the new immigrants without driving the largely black and Hispanic competition onto the unemployment rolls.
But the study hardly settled the question of whether immigrants make life tougher for American-born workers. Lawrence Katz of Harvard, who was formerly the Labor Department's chief economist, speculates that the American labor force is so mobile that the impact of excess labor supplies on localities quickly dissipates. Or to put it another way, more nonimmigrant workers would have come to Miami if the Mariel boatlift had never happened.
 
Not Off the Hook
 "There is now evidence," Mr. Katz said, "that where immigrants are going, natives are leaving" -- evidence that Mariel-style immigration is not necessarily traumatic for regional economies, especially rapidly growing ones like Miami's.
But this interpretation does not get immigrants off the hook in the national economic context. Indeed, it implies that in one place or another, more unskilled immigrants mean lower wages and fewer low-end jobs for those already here.
Mr. Katz, along with his Harvard colleague Richard Freeman and George Borjas of the University of California at San Diego, say the impact of unskilled immigrants has been substantial. They estimate that roughly one-fifth of the growth in the wage gap between the skilled and unskilled since the mid 1970's is linked to the growing supply of unskilled immigrant labor.
The United States is, of course, a nation of the descendants of immigrants who are reluctant to deny opportunities to a new generation of immigrants. Thus to many, the more important question is whether continuing immigration is adversely affecting the American economy's long-term prospects. But here, too, the evidence is ambiguous.
 
Cause for Celebration
 Mr. Borjas notes that the skills and cultural backgrounds that immigrants are bringing is "hollowing out" in the middle, with higher percentages of highly skilled college graduates and higher percentages of people with just the rudiments of education. Americans do not worry about the top end -- in fact, many celebrate the arrival of all those Indian computer whizes, Russian physicists and Filipino nurses as a revitalizing influence.
But over all, Mr. Borjas said, immigrants are far more likely to receive welfare than people born in America. In 1990, he calculates, the 8.4 percent of households with foreign-born heads received 13.1 percent of the total cash assistance. And he questions the capacities of low-income immigrants to assimilate into America's largely middle-class culture as rapidly as preceding generations did.
Before the 1970's, immigrants entered the country with smaller earning gaps, compared with their native counterparts, and made far more progress in closing the gap. Mr. Borjas projects that the wages of immigrants who arrived from 1970 to 1990 will never catch up, remaining 15 to 20 percent behind those of American-born workers. These (and less responsible) calculations are figuring prominently in the California gubernatorial election, where Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, has made an issue of the taxpayers' cost in supporting immigrants.
 
A Social Tragedy
 Other economists share Mr. Borjas' concerns, but put a different spin on their significance. Ms. Goldin notes that a disproportionate number of the economically distressed immigrants are political refugees from the wars in Indochina. Their problems constitute a social tragedy, but do not say much about the consequences of immigration driven primarily by economic incentives.
Barry Chiswick, chairman of the economics department at the University of Illinois at Chicago, points out that job opportunities for unskilled workers, native and immigrant, have collapsed since the 1970's. Hence, it is hardly surprising that immigrants facing language, cultural and racial barriers have had more trouble moving up in a society in which native-born are also having more trouble moving up.
Moreover, he emphasizes that only unskilled immigrants qualify as competition for Americans near the bottom of the economic pecking order. Thus, changes in immigration policy that discriminated in favor of the affluent and educated would defuse the problem.
American immigration laws were in fact revised in 1990, raising the number of visas for individuals in skills deemed in short supply and lowering the priority of reuniting families. The latter policy of giving preferences to the relatives of American residents, adopted in the mid-1960's, has been widely blamed for the decline in average skill and earnings levels of immigrants.
 
Economic Waste
 But Mr. Chiswick notes that Washington exercises enormous discretion in deciding which skills are needed, a process open to both bureaucratic inefficiency and political influence. He would much prefer a Canadian-style system, in which immigrant preferences were largely determined by a formula based on education and assets.
To some economists, the saddest aspect of limits on immigration (current and prospective) is the sheer economic waste of preventing labor from moving to where it is most productive. For in theory, part of the increase in productivity of, say, a Haitian who goes from making 20 cents an hour in Port-au-Prince to $8 an hour in New York, could be used to compensate the native-born who are made a bit worse off by competition from immigrants.
Immigrants might, for example, be made ineligible for beefed-up anti-poverty programs like earned income tax credits and food stamps. But that may not be constitutional; and it certainly does not mesh with notions of equality under the law. Even more to the point, Mr. Chiswick argues, it would add to the sorts of social problems that worry Americans most about low-end immigration.
What seems almost indisputable in the immigration debate, though, is the unfortunate coincidence of widening income inequality in America and the pressure on the United States to admit unskilled immigrants, legal and illegal. "It would be tough enough to make sensible immigration policy in the best of times," Mr. Ashenfelter concluded. "Today it's almost impossible."

HEADLINE: Film Ratings Under Attack From More Than One Angle

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Movie ratings seem like taxes: necessary but a source of irritation and anger. Within the last few days, debate over the 26-year-old film rating system has taken a particularly nasty turn.
"I've had a Maalox moment on this latest go-round," said Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie industry's lobbying arm, which controls the ratings classification board and is now locked in an angry dispute with the creators of a new film, "Jason's Lyric," about black teen-agers in Houston. 
 Mr. Valenti's Maalox moment includes accusations of racism against the ratings board, which Mr. Valenti furiously denies. The board insisted on the deletion of some sexual scenes and a change in the movie's promotion poster before it would rate the film R instead of NC-17.
Beyond this there are persistent charges that the ratings board is far more critical of films with sexual content than of those with gory violence; that the board allows itself to be bullied by big studios but deals aggressively with less powerful independent companies, and that it seems far more horrified about foul language in films than about foul and murderous behavior.
The Classifications and Ratings Board of the Motion Picture Association of America was founded in 1968 to replace the archaic and prudish Hays Production Code, which controlled the sexual content of movies for decades. The board's classifications were created, with the endorsement of theater owners, as guidelines for parents.
 
The 5 Categories
 Over the years, those ratings evolved into five categories: G, for general audiences, usually cartoons and children's films; PG, meaning parental guidance is suggested and some material may be unsuitable for younger children; PG-13, meaning parents are strongly cautioned and some material may be inappropriate for children under 13; R, restricted, people under 17 must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian, and NC-17, a relatively new rating, meaning no one under 17 is admitted. Independent film companies also have the option of releasing unrated films, but studios who are part of the association are obliged to adhere to its rulings.
The 13-member ratings board is headed by Richard M. Mosk, a Los Angeles lawyer. The names of the other members, all in the Los Angeles area, are secret. Barbara Dixon, a spokeswoman for the association, said they are all parents and represent a diverse mixture of ethnic and economic groups.
Perhaps the criticism most often heard about the ratings board is that studio-made action films, which are often loaded with violence, rarely encounter problems. Even "Basic Instinct," one of the most aggressively violent and sexual studio-made films in years, was given an R rating. But film makers depicting sexual situations that seem believable (unlike "Basic Instinct") are often told to delete certain scenes.
"Double standards apply," said Doug McHenry, the director of "Jason's Lyric." "The ratings system has a proclivity for violence over sex." Other critics add that double standards exist even in terms of sex: the ratings board strongly objected to male frontal nudity in Bruce Willis's recent film called "Color of Night" and deletions were made in the film. But female nudity, as in "Basic Instinct" and "Short Cuts," is not so objectionable to the board.
 
Contrasting Cases
 The latest case in the violence versus sex issue involves Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers," which was given an R rating. The rating, which delighted Warner Brothers, which produced the film and is a supporter of the association, came only after Mr. Stone made many cuts. One of them was a scene in which prison inmates decapitate a warden, played by Tommy Lee Jones, and carry his head on a stick. Even without that particular bit of gore, however, "Natural Born Killers" is one of the bloodiest commercial films in decades.
On the other hand, the ratings board unexpectedly gave an NC-17 to "Clerks," a comedy that was a prize winner this year at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals. Because some video companies like Blockbuster refuse to buy NC-17 movies and some theatrical chains decline to show them, the rating is considered an economic death sentence.
The reason for the rating? The film focuses on two teen-age boys working at a convenience store in New Jersey, and their dialogue is often crude. Miramax, the producer, is appealing the decision on the film, which is set to open on Oct. 21.
Mr. Valenti, speaking by telephone the other day from Venice, where he is attending the city's film festival, defended the potentially damaging rating, saying that moviegoers in Iowa or Kansas probably have different standards from those in New York or Los Angeles.
"There are millions of Americans who become hysterical about the kind of bad language that may be de rigueur around dinner tables in the East Side of Manhattan," Mr. Valenti said, his voice rising. "But in the cities and villages and towns across this free and loving land it's not that way at all."
 
The Present Case
 What has led to the latest controversy, however, is "Jason's Lyric," a Romeo-and-Juliet romance against a backdrop of the urban ghetto. The film, scheduled to open on Sept. 30, has a cast that includes Allen Payne, Bokeem Woodbine and Forest Whitaker. The director, Mr. McHenry, who produced "New Jack City," a 1991 action drama set in New York, said in an interview that he agreed to make some deletions in the sexual content to gain an R rating for "Jason's Lyric."
"None of the things that I did were so heinous that it lost the integrity of the film," he said. But Mr. McHenry said that officials of the Motion Picture Association then strongly objected to a marketing poster for the movie, which showed the two leads embracing erotically.
Mr. McHenry said he was so angry at the board's objection to the poster that with the cooperation of Gramercy Pictures, the film's distributor, he made a 60-second radio spot that was broadcast in 25 urban markets in mid-August. "In this country you can kill 50,000 people in a film, but you can't have a tasteful, romantic love scene," the director said in the ad. "If you have two black people making love, somehow, that's steamier than other people." He also said that a double-standard had been applied to films with black actors.
"I'm not calling any one individual a racist," Mr. McHenry, who is black, said in an interview. "What I'm saying is the process leaves a pattern of discriminatory results."
"Clearly, African-American films have had a tougher time," said Mr. McHenry, 42, who graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Business School and Law School before becoming an assistant to Peter Guber, now chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, in the 1980's. He added that provocative movie ads with Sharon Stone in "Basic Instinct" and Madonna in "Truth or Dare" produced no difficulties for the Motion Picture Association.
Although Mr. McHenry altered the ad, which has now been accepted by the Motion Picture Association's advertising administration board, his allegations stung Mr. Valenti.
In a column in Daily Variety on Aug. 23, he wrote of Mr. McHenry: "A young African-American director cries 'racism' about the rating for his film, 'Jason's Lyric.' The film features full views of nude copulation; naked actors sprawl across its advertising posters.
"What I most admire about the young director is his chutzpah. When he was in diapers I was working every hour of every day in the White House by the side of Lyndon Johnson as he led the greatest revolution in our nation's history on behalf of civil rights and human justice for every citizen."
He called Mr. McHenry's comments "fraudulent blathering" designed to gain free advertising for his movie. (Mr. McHenry said he did not want to engage in a shouting match with Mr. Valenti.)
In the interview Mr. Valenti said one company, Miramax, now owned by Disney, has perennially tangled with the ratings board for the publicity. "Miramax has raised it to a level of artistry," he said. "They get millions of dollars in free publicity by accusing the rating system of everything but child molestation. It's a marketing gambit."
Harvey Weinstein, a co-chairman of Miramax, denied the assertion. "The question to ask is how does a picture like 'True Lies,' where maybe 75 people are killed, have no problem with the ratings board. But 'Clerks,' a comedy which is really harmless, where two guys use bad language, gets an NC-17. It's unjust. Let's face it, it's an inanity."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGNS;
Cuomo: The First Nod Towards Pataki

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:

CANDIDATE: Gov. Mario M. Cuomo
 
PRODUCER: The Garth Group, New York 

VISUAL: The ad opens with a still frame of Mr. Cuomo on the upper-left side of the screen, followed by a similar frame of Mr. Pataki on the right. The ad then alternates between snippets of video interviews with Mr. Pataki, a state Senator from Putnam County, on his vote on an assault weapons ban this year and yellow lettering commenting on the interview. The ad is 30 seconds long.
 
THE SCRIPT: Announcer: "Governor Mario Cuomo wants to ban assault weapons. His opponent George Pataki claims he agrees, but he voted against it. First, when asked in a TV interview if he had voted against a ban on assault weapons, he denied it."
Mr. Pataki: "No we have not had a vote."
Announcer: "Then he said it was just procedural."
Mr. Pataki: "There was a procedural amendment."
Announcer: "Finally they admitted it. It was a ban on assault weapons. Maybe that's why Newsday wondered what George Pataki really stands for. George Pataki. Politics as usual."
 
ANALYSIS: This is the first time Mr. Cuomo's campaign has mentioned Mr. Pataki by name, and the ad economically allows an attack on two fronts. The first front is thematic: Mr. Pataki is not trustworthy, a message the Cuomo camp has pursued for several weeks. The second is on a specific issue: Mr. Pataki voted against an assault weapons ban in a year in which fear of crime runs high among voters.
The ad also allows Mr. Cuomo to portray himself as being tough on crime, even as Mr. Pataki hammers home in his own speeches and commercials that he, unlike Mr. Cuomo, is with the voters in his support of the death penalty.
There are few facts to dispute in this commercial, though the Pataki campaign might argue that it is incomplete and misleading. On April 25, Mr. Pataki did vote against a gun licensing bill, which a Democratic Senator had amended to include sharp restrictions on a number of assault weapons. Since then, Mr. Pataki has given various explanations of his vote, which are reflected accurately in the ad.
Mr. Pataki has argued that the amendment, offered by a Democrat, was of the kind that the Republicans who control the chamber routinely oppose. Moreover, he has said he favors a more sweeping ban than the one included in the amended bill, which would have allowed licensing for some collectors and competitive shooters. -- IAN FISHER

Rosenbaum: Fighting as an Outsider

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:

CANDIDATE: Richard M. Rosenbaum
 
PRODUCER: Sandler-Innocenzi, Alexandria, Va. 

VISUAL: The 30-second ad begins with a poker game involving cigar-chomping card sharks in a smoke-filled room. As one player tosses down his cards, his face changes into that of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. A dealer gives him three deuces with these words super-imposed over them: "Taxes," "Welfare" and "Lost Jobs." Then the dealer gives another three deuces to a second player and these words appear over his cards: "Voted with Cuomo 90%," "Raised Taxes," and "Paid No Taxes on $400,000." That player's face then changes into Senator George E. Pataki, Mr. Rosenbaum's rival in the Republican primary. Suddenly there is a bolt of lightning, and Mr. Rosenbaum appears, gesticulating and talking directly at the camera about how he will cut taxes, sign the death penalty and reform welfare.
 
THE SCRIPT: Announcer: "The politicians are always dealing in Albany. Cuomo's deal? Taxes, welfare, lost jobs. Pataki's deal? Vote with Cuomo 9 out of 10 times, raise taxes then make more than $400,000 himself and pay no taxes at all. Pataki? New name, same game. But Dick Rosenbaum breaks up the insider game." Mr. Rosenbaum: "I'm Dick Rosenbaum. I'll slash taxes, pass the death penalty and make welfare fathers pay up." Announcer: "Dick Rosenbaum. Republican for Governor."
 
ANALYSIS: The spot is designed to underscore the central theme of the Rosenbaum campaign: that he is an outsider runnining against an entrenched and corrupt political culture where Republicans and Democrats are the same. But Mr. Rosenbaum is himself vulnerable to that charge because he was once a state Republican chairman and has worked as a lobbyist in Albany and Washington, D.C.
Mr. Rosenbaum's criticisms of the two leading candidates are also misleading on several points. Under Mr. Cuomo, the state has raised some taxes, such as on petroleum, cigarettes and businesses, but has reduced others, including the personal income tax. Welfare spending is up, but the lion's share of that has gone to cover the rising cost of Medicaid, which Mr. Cuomo has only limited control over. And while the state lost about half a million jobs during the last recession, it has had a net gain of 422,000 jobs during Mr. Cuomo's 12-year tenure.
Though the ad says Mr. Pataki voted with Mr. Cuomo "9 out of 10 times," the figure actually refers to the number of times he voted with Democrats in the Senate, where many votes are unanimous. Though Mr. Pataki has voted for Cuomo initiatives, he has also voted against Mr. Cuomo on more occasions than most Senators. Mr. Pataki is directly responsible for raising taxes by 8.4 percent as mayor of Peekskill in the early 1980s. But he has also voted against several state budgets that included tax increases. And though it is true that Mr. Pataki did not pay capital gains taxes on a $401,666 profit he made from a 1986 real estate transaction, he did so legally under a provision of the Federal tax code that has allowed him to defer that tax liability.-- JAMES DAO

Pataki: Honing a Mantra Against Cuomo

BYLINE: By Kevin Sack 

 BODY:

CANDIDATE George E. Pataki
 
PRODUCER Russo, Marsh & Associates, Sacramento, Calif., and Alexandria, Va. 

VISUAL Alternating photographs of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki on half of the screen, as the text spoken by a narrator rolls on the other half. When the narrator announces, "It's time for a change," Mr. Cuomo's picture tumbles off the screen.
 
 THE SCRIPT "Mario Cuomo has consistently raised your taxes time and time again. As a State Senator, George Pataki voted against Mario Cuomo's tax-and-spend record every time. Mario Cuomo vetoed the death penalty 12 years in a row. Senator George Pataki fought for the death penalty, and as a Governor will sign it into law. Mario Cuomo has been in office 12 long years. It's time for a change. George Pataki, the new Governor New York needs."
 
 ANALYSIS This ad chants Mr. Pataki's campaign mantra: Mr. Cuomo has raised taxes and vetoed the death penalty; Mr. Pataki has fought against both in the Legislature; after three Cuomo terms it's time for a change. The Pataki campaign thus far has been premised on the notion that victory can be shaped on that anti-Cuomo message. This commercial does little to further define Mr. Pataki, a Republican legislator from Putnam County, or to detail his positions, particularly on how he would cut taxes.
Unlike some previous Pataki ads, which have relied on erroneous economic statistics, this commercial carefully avoids such blunders. But it commits a far more common sin of political advertising, that of omission.
It is true that Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature have raised certain taxes time and time again, particularly those on businesses, petroleum and cigarettes. But the Governor has studiously avoided raising broad-based taxes, and in 1987 he signed the largest cut in personal income taxes in state history. The last phase of that reduction has been cancelled because of the state's economic problems, but the top rate on earned income dropped from 9.5 percent to 7.875 percent.
With the election nearing, Mr. Cuomo pushed through a modest $475 million tax cut this year, reducing taxes on businesses and hotel rooms, among others. He has pledged to cut taxes further next year, but has not said how.
The most recent studies by the U.S. Census Bureau show that the state's tax burden, measured as a percentage of personal income, is about the same as when Mr. Cuomo took office. That is true even when state taxes are combined with local taxes.
It is also true that Mr. Pataki, who was elected to the Senate in 1992 after eight years in the Assembly, voted against the budget each year he was in the Senate. But he voted twice for the budget while in the Assembly, in 1985 and 1986, according to his aides, before adopting the practice of routinely voting no.
The claims about the death penalty are true. -- KEVIN SACK

HEADLINE: Health Care Debate to Shift To Federal Employees' Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Almost every health care proposal still pending in Congress complies with the politically potent demand -- expressed over and over in last month's Senate debate -- that all Americans should be able to get insurance as good as what Congress has.
In fact, there is no special health plan for members of Congress. They participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, along with nine million other Government workers, retirees and dependents. 
 The Federal program is not one insurance plan, but a supermarket offering 300 private health plans to Federal employees around the country. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative research center, calls it "a showcase of consumer choice and free market competition" that offers a much wider choice of health plans and has controlled health costs better than private employers.
The entire program, with premiums of more than $15 billion a year, is run by 164 people. Administrative expenses total $22 million a year.
The program's low cost, large size and sterling reputation make its expansion an attractive option in what has become a political minefield.
As a result, virtually all the major health care proposals that Congress will take up when it returns next Monday would open the Federal employees' program to millions of people who are uninsured, self-employed or work for small businesses. The bills differ in significant ways, but would vastly expand the program, adding 25 million to 50 million people or more.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the purpose was simple: to "give the American people exactly what we have."
But how to achieve that goal, like so much else in the health care debate, is a devilishly complex question. And the idea has many critics, starting with Federal employees who worry that the program's expansion will come at their expense.
James B. King, who supervises the insurance program as director of the Federal Office of Personnel Management, said, "This is a wonderful working model, but it cannot be instantly duplicated."
Bills offered by the Senate and House majority leaders, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, would give the public an opportunity to buy the same health benefits that members of Congress and other Federal employees have.
At first, ordinary consumers would pay premiums based on local market conditions, and these premiums would differ from those paid by Federal employees. But eventually, Federal workers and other consumers would pay the same rates, all based on local market conditions.
Federal employee unions say they fear that their members' premiums would rise as a result. Diane S. Witiak, a spokeswoman for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 700,000 Federal workers, said, "Congress shouldn't ask Federal workers to pay more for fewer benefits."
A more modest proposal devised by a bipartisan group of 20 senators known as the "mainstream coalition" would permit uninsured people and businesses with fewer than 100 employees to enroll in many of the health plans offered to Federal workers. But under this proposal, premiums of Federal workers would be computed separately from those of other subscribers.
A bill offered by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, would open the Federal program to self-employed people and to private businesses with 50 or fewer employees.
 
14 National Plans Offered
 The Federal employees' health program, created in 1959, is now open to members of Congress and their aides, the President, Cabinet officers, Civil Service employees, Postal Service workers, Federal judges and Federal court employees.
Fourteen plans are offered nationally. Federal employees and retirees pay the same premiums for a given plan, regardless of where they live or how old they are. The biggest nationwide plan, offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, covers more than 3.5 million Federal employees, retirees and dependents. A retired 61-year-old Congressional aide in Washington and a 20-year-old employee of the Department of Agriculture working in Texas pay the same premium for this policy, $101 a month for family coverage, and the Government contributes $304.
In private industry, employees often do not have the slightest idea how much they and their employers pay for health insurance. But in the Federal program, employees are told precisely how much the Government contributes and how much they must pay for each plan. Armed with this information, Federal employees become sophisticated consumers, more conscious of health costs than most workers in private industry.
"Federal employees shop like crazy" to minimize their premium costs, said Alan P. Spielman, a vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
Employee groups like the American Postal Workers Union sponsor health plans open to all Federal employees across the country. These plans allow Government workers to go to virtually any doctor or hospital. The unions have been phenomenally successful in marketing their health plans; some plans, like that of the mail handlers, dwarf the unions that sponsor them.
In addition, scores of prepaid health plans, including health maintenance organizations, are available to Federal employees in specific areas of the country. The H.M.O.'s generally require patients to use a select list of doctors and hospitals in a designated market.
The Federal Government pays, on the average, 72 percent of the premiums for its employees' health plans. Federal workers can reassess their needs and choose different plans in a five-week period each fall.
The Government negotiates with insurers on behalf of Federal employees, stipulating certain categories of benefits that must be provided, like hospital care, doctors' services and prescription drugs. Federal officials say they do not coerce insurers or write detailed regulations, but coach insurers to improve their plans by adding certain features.
The precise benefits, as well as the deductibles and other employee costs, vary by plan. The Government publishes a brochure giving details of each plan, and Federal agencies sponsor "health fairs" at which insurers market their plans.
"There's no fine print," said Mr. King, the director of the Office of Personnel Management. "It's all up front. Insurers are not permitted to do anything sleazy."
 
Nunn Urges More Audits
 But his agency and the plans themselves are clearly not prepared for a huge influx of subscribers. Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who recently investigated the program, said the Office of Personnel Management did not do nearly enough audits to detect fraud and overpayments. Some of the biggest plans are audited only once every seven years, he said.
The Mitchell, Gephardt and mainstream coalition bills all call for the Government to define a standard package of health benefits. Daniel C. Adcock, a lobbyist for the National Association of Retired Federal Employees, which has 500,000 members, said he worried that the standard package would be inferior to what Federal employees now had.
"We support the goal of universal coverage," Mr. Adcock said. "We understand why President Clinton and Congress want to give all Americans the same type of health insurance they have. But there should be safeguards to make sure the Federal employees' program is not degraded. We want to be sure that Federal employees and retirees don't lose anything."
Many Federal workers and retirees have insurance that pays 100 percent of their hospital costs, but under most proposals pending in Congress, patients would have to pay 20 percent, Mr. Adcock said.
 
Increased Costs Predicted
 Under Senator Mitchell's bill, workers in companies with fewer than 500 employees, welfare recipients and people who were self-employed or unemployed would have access to all the insurance plans available to Federal employees, including the ones offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, said this proposal would "wreak havoc with the premiums of Federal employees" and would increase costs for taxpayers, who pay most of the premiums. He predicted that many insurers would drop out of the Federal employees' program rather than accept tens of millions of new high-cost customers.
The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association also opposes the Mitchell and Gephardt bills.
Alixe R. Glen, a spokeswoman for the association, said: "Senator Mitchell's proposal would have the same practical effect as abolishing the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. There would be no nationally available plans with uniform premium rates throughout the United States."
Such national plans, which now cover 70 percent of the people in the Federal employees' program, would be carved up and offered through local health insurance purchasing cooperatives. Premiums would be set locally. The Office of Personnel Management would eventually blend the premiums for Government workers with those for other customers.

WHAT -- The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program offers 300 private health insurance plans to nine million Federal employees, retirees and dependents, including members of Congress, White House officials and judges.
 
BENEFITS -- All plans pay for hospital care, doctors' services, mental health care and prescription drugs. Details vary. Most plans offer additional benefits.
 
PREMIUMS -- Federal employees and retirees who choose conventional health insurance pay the same premiums, regardless of their age or where they live. For family coverage under the standard Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan, subscribers pay $101 a month and the Government pays $304. About 30 percent of subscribers are in health maintenance organizations like Kaiser Permanente and the Harvard Community Health Plan. (pg. B8)

HEADLINE: Vatican Rejects Compromise On Abortion at U.N. Meeting

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 6

 BODY:
After a day of tortuous closed-door talks that pitted Vatican diplomats against many other delegates, the United Nations population conference failed tonight to reach a compromise on the contentious issue of abortion.
Standing alone, Vatican diplomats blocked a consensus on a formula sponsored by Pakistan, saying they found it unacceptable. The proposed formula itself took five hours of haggling among 15 countries. 
 The Vatican's decision drew a chorus of boos, according to delegates at the closed session. At the time, conference participants said, the Vatican delegation was represented -- unusually -- by a woman, an American whose name was not released.
The move by the Vatican reflected Pope John Paul II's ardent crusade against abortion. But many delegates have noted that abortion is only one element of the far broader issue facing the meeting -- averting a disaster in global population growth.
"The Holy See cannot give explicit or implicit support in those parts of the document regarding abortion, the weakening of several family-related terminologies, the effective encouragement among adolescents of a liberal sexual life style free of parental rights," a Vatican statement said, referring to the conference's draft document.
The decision came despite efforts by Vice President Al Gore, head of the United States delegation, to assuage the Vatican's fears that the conference would legitimize abortion as a right and promote adolescent promiscuity.
The conference's report will not be binding on any nation, but delegates say that the broader the consensus, the better the chances that population growth can be limited.
Mr. Gore, who came under personal attack by the Vatican last week for purportedly misrepresenting the conference's intentions, met at his own request today with Archbishop Renato R. Martino, the head of the Vatican delegation. Later Mr. Gore said: "The misunderstandings they've had before have been significantly dispelled."
However, he said, the United States and the Vatican would inevitably remain divided on abortion, which the Clinton Administration says should be safe, legal and rare.
The encounter did not bring the Vatican any closer to what Administration officials depicted as a gathering consensus that abortion should be left to legislation in each country.
"This is absolutely unacceptable," said the chief Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls. "We are dealing with an international document preparing policies for governments that deal with human beings."
Among other things, the compromise rejected by the Vatican said abortion should "in no case" be used as a method of family planning -- a distinction the Vatican has long wanted to the enshrined by the conference.
But the wording also said that "in circumstances in which abortion is legal, such abortion should be safe." Delegates said the Vatican could not agree to this because Roman Catholic doctrine forbids abortion as a violation of the sanctity of life from the moment of conception.
 
Longer-Range Goals
 The wording of the compromise was based on an earlier proposal by the European Union and maintained three essential principles: that abortion should not be part of family-planning policies, that it should be left to national governments to legislate and that all efforts should be made to reduce abortion.
The draft conference document is to form the basis of a 20-year plan as part of an ambitious attempt to foster economic development by promoting women's rights. By United Nations, World Bank and other estimates, the world's population will soar from 5.7 billion now, to 7.27 billion by 2015, which many regard as unsustainable.
"A billion people already struggle to survive on a dollar a day," the World Bank's president, Lewis T. Preston, told delegates today. "Two billion people are without clean water. The problem is that we are not doing enough quickly enough to implement the basic action that experience has shown to be effective."
Despite such worries, the gathering of more than 150 delegations here has diverted most of its energies since it opened on Monday to abortion, which has elicited opposition from Islamic delegates, too.
One Islamic newspaper, Al Shaab, said today, "On this pure land, delegates poured from different states hailing promiscuity, calling for abortion and extramarital sex, and pointing to an era with no morals, where all values are trampled underfoot."
When Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan spoke at the conference on Monday, she also called abortion unacceptable. Her comments helped define the division between religious conservatives and secular liberals like Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, who said on Monday that decriminalizing abortion should be a "minimal response" to the deaths of women from unsafe, illegal abortions.
 
'Reproductive Health'
 But according to delegates, today's negotiations shifted the lines of this division when Pakistan and Benin, a Vatican ally, supported the compromise language. Countries as diverse in their approaches to abortion as Iran and Sweden also approved.
When the conference resumes on Wednesday, delegates said, the Vatican could win some support from Latin American countries that were not able to speak tonight because of time pressures. Such support could force further talks on a compromise.
Only when that is complete will delegates move to other contentious issues, notably a definition of "reproductive health," which the Vatican see as a cover for abortion on demand.
The only area in which the Vatican has come close to agreement is the question of adolescent sexuality. There, at the Vatican's insistence, proposals for confidential sex counseling for teen-agers have been balanced by the proviso that parents should exercise their "rights, duties and responsibilities" to provide "appropriate direction and guidance in sexual and reproductive matters."
The Vatican's stand on abortion suggested that when the conference ends on Sept. 13, the guidelines will not win a full consensus. "No one should have the illusion that there is going to be some kind of resolve that causes the Vatican to sign this document," Mr. Gore said today.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Governor Cruises Election Road

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Mark Roosevelt, the front-runner in the Democratic primary for governor, was introducing himself to the men at the Eire Pub in Dorchester, a staunchly Democratic neighborhood in Boston.
Dennis Farrell, a lifelong Democrat, hardly took his eyes off the television. He seemed surprised that Mr. Roosevelt, a 38-year-old state representative, was campaigning. "Seems like a shoo-in for Weld," Mr. Farrell, who manages a post office, told a reporter. 
 Mr. Weld is, of course, Gov. William F. Weld, a patrician Republican. He barely got elected four years ago but is now heavily favored to beat whoever wins the Democratic nomination in the Sept. 20 primary, be it Mr. Roosevelt or two even lesser-known candidates: Michael Barrett, a state senator, and George Bachrach, a lawyer and former State Senator.
But if Governor Weld seems like a shoo-in for re-election, Democratic political analysts say, it is not because his performance has been so strong, but because the Democrats seeking to challenge him are so weak. Against a strong opponent, these analysts say, the Governor would not have it so easy -- not with his record, which they see as vulnerable to attack, and not in a state like Massachusetts, long a Democratic stronghold (if now a slightly more conservative one), where Republicans remain vastly outnumbered.
"This guy's performance isn't so wonderful that he can't be taken out," said Michael Goldman, a Democratic consultant who is not aligned with any of his party's candidates for governor. "Luckily for him, instead of running against a Joe Kennedy or any other serious Democrat, he ended up with the B-team. They've got no dough and no name recognition. And the reality is that you can't beat somebody with nobody."
Mr. Weld has a $2.2 million campaign chest, plus the $450,000 he has already spent on television commercials -- more than three times what any Democrat has raised. While the Democrats will take to the television airwaves this week, Mr. Weld has been running three television commercials for the past two weeks.
 
2-to-1 Favorite in Poll
 A recent poll shows him beating any of his Democratic challengers by a margin of 2 to 1. The prominent Democrats who might have given him a race, including Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, have decided not to take him on. In 1990, Mr. Weld won by only a four-point margin over John N. Silber, the president of Boston University and an unpredictable Democrat whom a lot of voters could not support.
"Weld's popularity is less a function of what he's done than what the Democrats have failed to do over the past three years," said James Braude, a Weld critic who is the head of the Tax Equity Alliance of Massachusetts, a citizens' group.
John Stenson, who owns the Eire Pub, agreed. "Whose fault is it but the Democrats' for putting up three guys nobody knows anything about?" he said.
Mr. Braude recalled a state Democratic fund-raising dinner last spring at which the speakers included President Clinton and Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The three candidates for the party's nomination for governor were introduced.
"It was clearly partisan," Mr. Braude said. "Clinton was there to attack Dole. Kennedy was there to attack the Republicans. But in four hours, Weld's name wasn't mentioned once. It was almost as if the party was conceding the gubernatorial race."
Mr. Roosevelt was the chief architect of a major education reform bill signed into law last year. But what recognition he has comes mostly from his name: he is a great-grandson of Theodore Roosevelt and a second cousin of Mr. Weld's wife, Susan Roosevelt Weld.
Like the Governor, Mr. Roosevelt graduated from Harvard and Harvard Law School. But Mr. Roosevelt, who earns $37,000 a year and owns a small town house on Beacon Hill in Boston, is from the poorer side of the family. His father, Kermit Roosevelt, was a longtime official of the Central Intelligence Agency who arranged the 1953 coup that brought the Shah of Iran to power.
Mr. Weld and his Democratic challenger also share political views. Both support the death penalty and an overhaul of the welfare system. But where the Governor is relaxed -- he takes pride in his thrice-weekly squash games and his regular vacations at the family camp in the Adirondacks -- Mr. Roosevelt is, in his own words, driven.
He rarely misses an opportunity to criticize the Governor. "He's indifferent, apathetic, feckless, aloof, passive and lazy," Mr. Roosevelt said in a recent interview. "Did I say uncaring? He's uncaring."
Mr. Weld promised not to raise taxes, and he has not. He is credited with bringing calm to a chaotic State Legislature, and trimming the state work force by 12 percent.
While he takes credit for balancing the budget, his job was eased considerably by two big tax increases won by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis near the end of his last term. In addition, voters rejected a 1990 tax rollback -- endorsed by Mr. Weld as a candidate -- that would have reduced state revenue by nearly $2 billion a year.
At a picnic in Fall River where Mr. Weld was campaigning a few weeks ago, Mike and Kimberly Brett, who described themselves as former Democrats now registered as independents, praised the Governor. "He's turned the state around," said Mrs. Brett, a state welfare worker. "He balanced the budget."
 
Weld Called 'Pro-Upper Class'
 Fewer voters seem to share the feelings of John Richards, who was at a recent Democratic fund-raising event in Dorchester where Mr. Roosevelt was campaigning. "Weld has brought a lot of things around on the backs of people in need," said Mr. Richards, a construction superintendent. "He's never had a tough time in his life. He's always been pro-upper class. He doesn't have to work."
Mr. Weld, a self-styled libertarian, describes himself as fiscally conservative and liberal on gay rights and abortion. But he has changed his position on several key issues. For example, he repeatedly declared himself against gun control -- and even sent The Boston Globe a snapshot of a boar he had shot and killed -- until last year, when he proposed tough gun control legislation that included a ban on assault weapons.
The Governor, a 49-year-old former prosecutor, portrays himself as "to the right of Attila the Hun" on crime. But his administration was embarrassed last year when a man who had been convicted of second-degree murder killed a police officer after walking away from a work release program. Mr. Weld said he had not been aware that second-degree murderers were eligible for release, and halted their participation in that program.
As the United States Attorney here, Mr. Weld opposed casino gambling. But he recently negotiated an agreement with the Wampanoag Indians of Gay Head to open a casino in New Bedford. Casino gambling, he said, will spur economic recovery.
In a front-page series of articles last year, The Globe explored the easy access the Governor gives to business and special interest groups that have helped his campaigns.
"Weld is intoxicated with big money," Mr. Roosevelt said.
Mr. Weld's chief fund-raiser, Peter Berlandi, is the consultant for the Bechtel Corporation, which is managing the Central Artery, a joint state and Federal highway project that is now the nation's largest public works effort. Mr. Roosevelt has demanded that Mr. Berlandi resign his job with Bechtel, saying it represents a conflict of interest.
 
'Forced Into Throwing Mud'
 The Governor's campaign manager, Ray Howell, says the Democratic accusations are acts of desperation. "The Democrats cannot argue with Weld's record or positions on issues that matter to people -- like jobs, taxes, crime and welfare," Mr. Howell said. "So they're forced into throwing mud."
Costs for the Central Artery project have risen to $7.7 billion from $5.7 billion in the last four years. In addition, the project has fallen six years behind schedule. Mr. Roosevelt blames the Governor. "I predict the Central Artery will be Weld's undoing," Mr. Roosevelt said.
Mr. Howell responded: "It's another lie. The biggest percentage of the cost increase occurred under Dukakis."
Despite the attacks, Mr. Weld's popularity continues to grow, according to the polls.
"Bill Weld is in his long Teflon phase," said Mr. Goldman, the Democratic consultant. "Nothing sticks. But it's all blue smoke."
The Governor has dismissed his Democratic challengers as "the three amigos," referring to the movie by that name about a trio of hapless cowboys.
 
Geographical Connections
 Oddly enough, each of them has some sort of connection -- familial, geographic or financial -- to Mr. Weld. Besides Mr. Roosevelt's being related to Mrs. Weld, Mr. Barrett and the Governor live on the same street -- Fayerweather -- in Cambridge, although at opposite ends.
Mr. Bachrach calls himself an unrepentant liberal, but in 1991 he raised money for Mr. Weld and gave a $300 campaign contribution to Lieut. Gov. A. Paul Cellucci and $100 to the state Treasurer, Joseph Malone, both Republicans.
"That's the only excitement in the race so far -- Bachrach's giving money to Weld and Cellucci," said Peter Lucas, a former political reporter and lifelong Democrat who is now a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
Politics in Massachusetts is like bullfighting in Seville or soccer in Rio. It's what people talk about. Mr. Barrett says it's not the candidates' fault if the race has not caught fire.
 
A Quotable Interview
 "Each of the three of us manages to be pretty quotable," he said. "I made a couple of convention speeches which were well received. They were tough and quotable, and even witty in spots."
Certainly, people are still quoting Mr. Roosevelt's interview with The Globe last March, when he declared that in seven years in the Legislature he had "a record of accomplishment probably unsurpassed by any legislator in the 20th century in Massachusetts."
Mr. Roosevelt now says he regrets the comment. "I can be sanctimonious," he conceded.
Whether voters see the re-election of Mr. Weld as a sure thing or not, Mr. Howell, the Governor's campaign manager, says his man is running hard.
"This is Massachusetts, where Republicans are 15 percent of the electorate," he said. "We absolutely do not see this as a shoo-in. This thing could turn around very quickly."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Its Decline Against Both Mark and Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened further against other leading currencies yesterday, extending its decline from late last week, on rising demand for German marks and pessimism about American-Japanese trade talks.
Trading volume was light, which exaggerated the extent of the dollar's moves. But American foreign exchange traders returning from the Labor Day holiday said the underlying selling pressure on the dollar was strong. They saw little reason to buy the dollar now or in the days ahead. 
 "The dollar picked up where it left off on Friday -- in a downward spiral against both the mark and the yen," said Tom O'Malley, foreign exchange analyst for Technical Data, a Boston-based financial research concern.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5425 marks, down from 1.5561 marks on Friday, after trading as low as 1.5395 marks.
The dollar also weakened to 98.66 Japanese yen, from 99.20 yen in New York on Friday.
And the British pound strengthened to $1.5531, from $1.5475 on Friday.
The dollar began falling in Tokyo, where traders said large banks were sellers because of fears that the dollar would drop sharply if American-Japanese talks on reducing Japan's trade surplus faltered before a Sept. 30 deadline set by the United States.
Those fears appeared to be reaffirmed later yesterday by the United States Ambassador to Japan, Walter F. Mondale, who said in Washington that crucial issues in those talks remained unresolved.
"He said there was more work to be done," said Hubert Pedroli, manager of foreign exchange trading at the New York office of Credit Suisse, the Swiss investment banking firm. "He was less than enthusiastic about the prospects."
The Japanese-American trade imbalance is the most contentious issue confronting the two countries and the main reason for the dollar's protracted slide against the yen.
Sales of dollars accelerated in European dealings as traders shifted more holdings to German marks. Traders said there was growing sentiment in Europe that Germany was emerging from an economic slump. That suggests Germany's interest rates are likely to rise, which would make mark-denominated holdings worth more.
Traders were also reacting to a proposal from Germany's governing Christian Democratic coalition calling for the strongest nations in the European Union to integrate their economies at a quicker pace than the rest of the economic bloc.
"That made people buy marks and sell its weaker sister currencies," said David Wilson, a vice president at the New York office of Credit Lyonnais, the large French bank.

HEADLINE: Airbus Gets Large Order at Plane Show

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: FARNBOROUGH, England, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The European consortium Airbus announced today that it had received a big new order, but the overall outlook for civilian aircraft manufacturers remained cloudy despite glimmers of hope at the industry's showcase air show.
The four-nation Airbus group, archrival to the market leader, the Boeing Company, announced an $850 million order from the International Lease Finance Corporation for five extended-range A340-300 aircraft and nine new A320 passenger jets on the second day of the Farnborough air show. 
 It was the biggest single order so far at the fair, which is held every two years and in the past has seen many announcements of large orders.
 
 
Big Deal for Boeing
 The only other big announcement so far this year involved Boeing, which said on Monday that it had an order worth more than $380 million for four 767-ER jets to be used by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
 Boeing also said it had commitments for 40 of its new-generation 737-800 jets, which would allow the plane to go into production.
 With the focus these days on the civilian airline industry, the fight over an important British contract for 60 military transport aircraft, said to be worth 5 billion ($7.5 billion) rumbles on here.
 British Aerospace, one of the four members of the Airbus consortium, along with Aerospatiale S.A. of France, the Deutsche Aerospace unit of Daimler-Benz A.G. and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain, began a full-scale campaign this week for its European Future Large Aircraft consortium.
The consortium built a full-scale mock-up in the aircraft park here and trumpeted the plane's larger range and greater lifting capacity. The transport, which would haul troops, tanks, helicopters and other big loads, would move Airbus into the military, as well as the civilian, market. Deliveries are to begin in 2002.
 In response, the American competitor, the Lockheed Corporation, fresh from announcing its $10 billion merger with the Martin Marietta Corporation, accused its rival of promoting a "paper airplane" that has not yet been designed, while an updated model of its own C-130J Hercules, a troop and cargo transport plane, was already in production.
 France's military industry joined the battle today, with a call for European military ministries to "buy European."
 "Europe must buy European," said Serge Dassault, president of Gifas, a trade group for the French military industry. "It's an absolute principle we have to fight for."
 The industry has been hurt by reduced military spending after the cold war and by the recession, which curbed air travel. In 1990, just before the Persian Gulf war, 130 orders for civilian planes, worth $14 billion in total, were announced at the Farnborough show. Orders plunged two years ago, to $1.86 billion, and this year looks hard pressed to reach even that.
 Despite the sparse orders, there were some signs of hope for manufacturers, with the air travel industry starting to emerge from the recession, after losing more than $16 billion in the last four years.
 On Monday, Airbus challenged Boeing for a bigger share of the lucrative Chinese market.
 Airbus's president, Jean Pierson, told reporters at the air show that the aircraft group wanted a 50 percent share of the fast-growing Chinese market, in line with its worldwide target for jet sales.
 Boeing, based in Seattle, has 50 to 60 percent of world passenger jet sales with Airbus holding around 30 percent and McDonnell Douglas getting the rest.

HEADLINE: Japan Raids Companies, Suspecting Bid Rigging

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The Japanese Fair Trade Commission raided the offices of more than 20 prominent trading companies today on suspicion that they colluded on bids to supply material and equipment for the country's foreign aid program, news reports and officials here said.
The suspicions about bid-rigging come at a time when the United States Government has announced its intention to help American companies secure more contracts stemming from Japan's foreign aid expenditures, which total more than $10 billion a year. 
 There have long been assertions that the money Japan gives to less- developed countries as aid is used to buy Japanese equipment and services, to the exclusion of products and services from other nations. Tokyo has denied this, saying companies from all nations can bid for such contracts.
If the trading companies are charged with bid-rigging, it would raise new doubts about the awarding of contracts under Japan's official development assistance program.
In the last few years, the Japanese have seen many cases of bid-rigging on public works projects. The cases have led to arrests and resignations of politicians and construction-industry officials and have helped the United States in its push to open Japan's construction market.
The companies visited by Japan's antitrust enforcement agency today included the Itochu Corporation, the Marubeni Corporation, the Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Company.
 
Targeted Inspections
 Spokesmen for Mitsubishi and Itochu confirmed that their companies had been visited by officials from the Fair Trade Commission, the antitrust agency. At Mitsubishi, the agents went to the machinery division, which coordinates foreign-aid project bidding and some other offices. At Itochu, the agents visited the textile division and other offices.
But the spokesmen said they would have no further comment because they did not know exactly what the agency was seeking. A Fair Trade Commission official said the agency did not comment on investigations.
Robert M. Orr Jr., chairman of a committee dealing with Japan's foreign aid at the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, said Tokyo's practice used to be to parcel out foreign aid grants to Japanese companies. But he said that had changed.

HEADLINE: Shawinigan Journal;
Quebec Libre? His Hometown Won't Think of It

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SHAWINIGAN, Quebec, Aug. 31

 BODY:
They have known him here for years, people like Marcel Brousseau, who as a boy played baseball with him, or the brothers Guy and Gilles Sauvageau, who run a coffee, magazine and tobacco shop where he still occasionally drops in to pass the time of day.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, the son of a machinist at a local paper mill, comes home every few weeks, the way Harry Truman used to return to Independence, Mo. Mr. Chretien still owns a house in Shawinigan, has family here and knows many townspeople by their first names. 
 With his entourage of aides, bodyguards and reporters, he makes the rounds to try to show that despite years in Government and some off-years as a Bay Street lawyer, he is still, as he likes to call himself, "the little guy from Shawinigan."
On one recent visit, he ordered the daily special for lunch at the Bravo Pizzeria and then walked into the Moderne tavern next door. But he stayed only long enough to win a bet for Leo Sanscartier, another old friend who had wagered with the Moderne's owner Alain Lord he could get the Prime Minister inside the bar.
"He stayed several minutes," said Mr. Lord, "just long enough to shake hands and win Leo $10."
Mr. Chretien, who became Canada's leader last October, remains popular in Shawinigan, a river town at the southeastern edge of deep pine forests halfway between Montreal and Quebec.
It is a clean, tidy town. The Sauvageau shop is a few blocks from a riverside park where children are playing baseball. At one of the downtown squares, Place Mauricienne, their grandparents are playing the ancient French game of boules, a type of lawn bowling. Chez Sauvageau attracts just about everyone in town at one time or another, and Guy Sauvageau says 80 percent of his customers are "pretty happy with Jean Chretien."
But separatist feeling is strong, and a year ago, just before the general elections, polls indicated Mr. Chretien might lose his Shawinigan seat in the House of Commons to the Bloc Quebecois, a national party that wants Quebec to split from Canada.
But then people like Mayor Roland Desaulniers started asking whether the town, which has been severely depressed economically, could afford to pass up the chance to elect the next Prime Minister.
Prime Ministers' hometowns are usually able to dip deeply into the proverbial pork barrel.
The voters listened to their mayor. Mr. Chretien won 53 percent, making Shawinigan one of 19 Quebec seats that went Liberal, against 54 for the separatists. And Mr. Chretien did not let them down.
Smiling broadly, the mayor, a former local businessman, said Shawinigan was doing "a lot better today," acknowledging both a general improvement in economic conditions and a batch of new public projects, from waterworks, roads and sewers, to a new industrial theme park.
Mr. Chretien denies buying votes with federal largesse, but almost with a wink and a nod. He says no one knows how Ottawa works better than he and that therefore he "can make sure" his hometown gets "all the programs available.
Although activity is picking up, Shawinigan still has a long way to go to approach its former prosperity.
Early this century, electric power from the nearby Shawinigan Falls on the St. Maurice River had stimulated rapid economic growth, based on paper, aluminum and chemicals. But old industries have reduced or ceased activity, and few new ones have taken their place.
Many families have had to search elsewhere for work, slashing the population by one-third, to 21,000.
One of the more visible new projects is the $15 million theme park, the Center for the Interpretation of Industry, to highlight Shawinigan's industrial history, stimulate tourism and create local jobs.
The main exhibits are an old aluminum smelter, paper mill and hydroelectric plant, preserved to show what the industrial world looked like in the town's heyday. Plans are to charge tourists up to $10 each to visit the old buildings.
But a study commissioned by the Federal Bureau of Regional Development in Trois Rivieres, 15 miles to the south, concluded that the project was badly organized, would lose money and would close within a year unless bailed out with further grants.
Critics have already mockingly dubbed it "patronage park" and "Jean's World." Yvon Legault, the author of the critical federal study, compared the center to Montreal's ill-fated Museum of Humour, which closed last fall after less than a year.
But locally, the idea of the project is still very popular. It is scheduled to open by June 1996.
The project is also helping the campaign of Mr. Chretien's old friend, Yvon Lemire, a Liberal running for a third term in the Quebec Assembly. On Sept. 12, voters will decide whether incumbent Liberals or the separatist Parti Quebecois will run the province. Mr. Chretien, an ardent federalist, is hoping to see the separatists fail.
In canvassing, Mr. Lemire is using Mr. Chretien's generosity to promote himself as the candidate of jobs and prosperity. "There's been a 60 percent increase in the construction business," he says at the doorstep of Martin Pelletier, a railway brakeman. "This town is really catching up."
Mr. Pelletier gave a noncommital smile.

HEADLINE: Candidate Ties Gubernatorial Bid to Property Taxes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 6

 BODY:
In a governor's race in which all the candidates talk tough on crime and promise to purge the government of waste, William E. Curry Jr. has seized onto the state's high property taxes as an issue that highlights his independence from the pack.
While several of his opponents have focused on cutting or eliminating an unpopular income tax introduced in 1991, Mr. Curry has pledged to return about $1 billion from state coffers to cities and towns for property tax relief. The details of the program have met widespread criticism, but Mr. Curry insists that his approach is the only one that challenges the status quo. 
 "If you put all the other candidates on sodium pentothal and asked them which tax hurts working people the most, it would be a no-brainer -- the property tax," he said at a news conference last week. He criticized the others for what he called sloganeering against a well-worn target, the income tax, and added, "I'm trying to move the debate in this election in the direction I think it belongs, in the direction of fundamental change."
 
Considers Himself an Outsider
 The attack was one of the latest in a campaign in which Mr. Curry, a 42-year-old Democrat and the State Comptroller, has cast himself as an irreverent and cerebral political outsider who claims to have enough experience in the trenches of government to succeed in bringing sweeping change.
Mr. Curry has defied the leadership of the state party organization and is running as an insurgent in a tough primary election against John B. Larson, the leader of the State Senate, who won the party's official endorsement in July. With assistance from Stanley Greenberg, the pollster who also counsels President Clinton, Mr. Curry has sought to portray himself in much the same way as the President did two years ago, as an "inside outsider."
In his campaign, Mr. Curry has displayed his governmental savvy with detailed policy proposals, such as the reduction of property taxes and a 32-point plan to fight crime, and stressed his administrative and management skills in running the Comptroller's office.
At the same time, he has positioned himself as an outsider, regularly describing his bid for governor as "the greatest challenge to politics as usual in this state in either party in a generation," and illustrating his campaign literature with a picture of a lightning bolt hitting the State Capitol.
Critics say that Mr. Curry, a former State Senator and the son of a prominent party leader in Hartford, has overstated both his outsider status and the contrasts between him and Mr. Larson.
Indeed, in a recent debate, Mr. Larson remarked: "We agree on an awful lot of things. I'm not sure what our differences are, but I know what makes me different." And then Mr. Larson discussed his personal background.
 
A Three-Way Race
 The winner of the primary next Tuesday will join a three-way race. One opponent will be the victor in the Republican primary between former United States Representative John G. Rowland and Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer; the other will be Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, the nominee of the A Connecticut Party, the party line on which Lowell P. Weicker Jr. was elected governor in 1990.
Mr. Curry has been something of an independent voice in Connecticut politics since he was first elected to the State Senate in the late 1970's and frequently earned the ire of his colleagues and Gov. Ella T. Grasso with his support for liberal causes. After losing an election for Congress in 1982, he became national director of the political action committee of the Nuclear Weapons Freeze movement, and also was an outspoken critic of United States support for the contra fighters in Nicaragua.
Today, Mr. Curry's base of support includes the state employees' unions as well as local citizens and environmental groups. In contrast to Mr. Larson, he supported pay raises for the state unions that were recommended last year by a labor arbitrator and rejected by the Legislature on the ground that money was lacking.
 
Campaign-Finance Laws
 Mr. Curry has called for the state to establish insurance-purchasing pools to help small businesses and self-employed workers reduce the cost of their coverage. He supports a tougher death penalty and stronger discipline in prisons, including requiring inmates to pursue an education.
He also advocates change in campaign finance laws, complaining that lobbyists have exerted undue influence on elections with their contributions.
And most notably, Mr. Curry has pushed his plan to reduce property taxes, showing a zeal for cuts often associated with conservative Republicans, while maintaining that his plan would be more progressive than competing proposals to cut the income tax.
In debating Mr. Larson, who supports a 25 percent income-tax reduction for families earning less than $100,000, Mr. Curry has argued that the property tax is a more serious burden for the middle class.
According to the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, the state had the third-highest local property tax per capita in the nation in the fiscal year 1992. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities reported that the state's property tax revenue almost equaled the combined revenue of the sales tax and income tax.
 
Property Tax Relief
 Mr. Curry has said that by the end of his first term in office, he would send $1 billion back to the towns and cities as property tax relief. The money would come from a variety of sources, including about $160 million in payments from two casinos operated by Indian tribes; more than $350 million in revenue that will be available when the state finishes payment on its economic recovery bonds; $200 million by eliminating unfinanced state mandates for municipalities, and a 5 percent across-the-board spending cut for state government.
Critics have pointed out that about $85 million in casino money is already being used as relief for towns and cities, and they note that the Legislature has already committed the money from the bond payments to other types of tax relief. Mr. Curry has also refused to specify what mandates he would cut to save $200 million and has not provided the formula he would use to distribute the money to the state's 169 towns and cities.
While Mr. Larson has called Mr. Curry's property tax proposal laudable, he said that it was not achievable and that he preferred to wait for a legislative commission to issue its recommendations on the matter in January. In the meantime, he said, a smaller income-tax cut would be easier to implement and would provide immediate relief.
But Mr. Curry said that cutting the income tax would preclude cutting the property tax, and he brushed aside the flaws as problems to be overcome once he takes office.
"I'm just trying to put this question at the center of the debate, where it belongs," he said in an interview. "Evening the playing field -- that's the goal here."
"And even if I can't come up with the $200 million in savings from the mandates, this would still be the largest and most important change in the state's tax structure in memory," he said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Industrial Robots Make the Grade

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
In the early 1980's, when Roger B. Smith, then chairman of the General Motors Corporation, described his vision for the auto industry's future, he imagined factory floors where, one by one, workers would be replaced by robots.
"Every time the cost of labor goes up a dollar an hour," Mr. Smith said, "a thousand more robots become economical." 
 But while hundreds of thousands of jobs were subsequently lost in the American auto industry and other manufacturing businesses, robots had little to do with it. Indeed, the early industrial robots were often expensive, more temperamental than the most recalcitrant worker and in many cases ill suited to the tasks assigned them. By the late 1980's, a steep decline in orders for robotic equipment had driven most American companies -- including G.M. -- out of the business of making industrial robots.
 
Sales Are Booming
 Fortunately for United States manufacturing industries, some small American robot makers stayed the course, as did the big Japanese robotics makers. Today, sales are booming for robots, which are cheaper, stronger, faster and smarter than their predecessors.
Industrial robots are hard at work in the industrial heartland, spot-welding car bodies on auto assembly lines, placing tiny parts on circuit boards in electronics factories and packing frozen hamburger patties into boxes at food-processing plants. And rather than replacing workers in droves, robots are reserved for tasks that either are ill suited to human hand and eye or are so onerous or strenuous that people don't want to do them.
"In the early 1980's robots were a fad and expectations were overly high," said Takeo Kanade, director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. "Now I think views are a little more practical and realistic."
In the first half of this year, 4,355 robots with a total value of $383.5 million -- a record both in terms of units and dollars -- were sold in the United States, according to the Robotic Industries Association in Ann Arbor, Mich., the industry's principal trade group. That represented a 25 percent increase in value over the first half of 1993, the previous record.
And the industry's backlog of unfilled orders stands at $350 million, the highest in nine years, the association reported. The increase in demand is largely fueled by orders from the automobile companies, although other industries are showing renewed interest, officials of the trade group said.
Lower cost and greater reliability are the keys, said Steven W. Holland, a robotics specialist at General Motors. Prices today are about half what they were 10 years ago for comparable machines and reliability is four times better, he said.
Among other jobs, G.M. uses robots to lay a bead of urethane sealant around the windshield frames of its vehicles before installing the glass. Labor costs are not even an issue, Mr. Holland said. More importantly, it is a task whose uniformity and repetition would make it difficult for human hands to do.
"We use robots to put a urethane seal around windshields very precisely, because we don't want any leaks," Mr. Holland said. "We would install them even where the labor rate is like Mexico's."
And unlike simpler "fixed automation" machinery, designed and built to perform one task and one task only, like a conveyor line, today's robots can be reprogrammed for a new task, while a conventional automated machine would have to be replaced. "We can replace fixed automation with robots with a similar or lower investment," Mr. Holland said.
 
American Giants Pulled Out
 If today's robots are different, so is the lineup of companies making them. No longer in the business are American giants like G.M., Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the General Electric Company, the International Business Machines Corporation and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, all of which chose to bail out.
As a result, the robots that American auto makers and other domestic manufacturers are buying to help fend off the likes of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company and the Honda Motor Company are largely machines that themselves are made in Japan. The Fanuc Robotics Corporation, a unit of Fanuc Ltd. of Japan, is the leader in the United States, with robotic sales expected to reach about $260 million this year.
A unit of the Swedish industrial conglomerate Asea Brown Boveri A.B. is second in the United States robotics market, with sales estimated at $120 million. But after that, the big makers of industrial robots are Japanese: Motoman , the Panasonic Factory Automation Company, Kawasaki Robotics, Sony Component Products and Nachi Robotic Systems, all of which do their manufacturing in Japan.
The only major American producer to have survived is Adept Technology Inc. of San Jose, Calif., which makes robots for light assembly work on circuit boards and electronic devices and was not tied to the boom and bust cycles of the auto business. Still, it has annual sales of only about $50 million in a $700-million-a-year market.
 
Japan's Heavy Use
 One reason that Japanese companies are so powerful in robotics is that they build a lot of the machines for use in their home market. According to the Robot Industries Association, there are about 300,000 industrial robots in use in Japan, compared with 52,000 in the United States.
"The Japanese build more robots each year than we have installed in the United States in total," said Joseph Engelberger, an American who developed the first commercial robot in the mid-1960's. Although Mr. Engelberger received a great deal of attention from Japan at the time, he eventually sold his company, Unimation, to Westinghouse.
He said that American industry's focus on short-run profit was what drove robotics offshore. "I have been to Japan 28 times, and I have never heard a discussion about return on investment" related to robotics, Mr. Engelberger said. "Their attitude is that if a robot can do a job better, then use a robot."
Mr. Engelberger is now developing mobile robots through his own company, the Transitions Research Company in Danbury, Conn. Like some other small companies, Transitions Research is working to improve "service" robots that might serve meals in hospitals or act as watchmen in warehouses. Such applications require finer sensing capabilities and vision systems than most industrial robots now have, which is why the field has yet to take off.
As for the industrial robots used in manufacturing and assembly work, the current leader, Fanuc Robotics of Japan, was not even in the American robotics market until G.M. brought the company into a joint venture in 1981. The initial plans called for joint development of new models of robots, which would be made in the United States. But G.M. ended up serving largely as a marketing conduit for Japanese-made robots, before selling its interest in the venture in 1992 at the depth of General Motors' financial troubles.
Dogged determination to grab market share, regardless of immediate profits, is the reason Japanese rather than American companies dominate the robot business in this country, said Vernon L. Mangold Jr., president of Kohol Systems Inc. in Dayton, Ohio. Kohol has survived as a small producer of robots for special applications, like hot, dirty jobs in the steel industry.
Mr. Mangold said his company had managed to stay alive by seeking out niche markets unattractive to larger producers, which prefer to make standardized machines that can be adapted to work in all sorts of factories. "We work in nasty environments like foundries that the other guys avoid," Mr. Mangold said.
For Adept Technology, the largest American company still in the field, success has come through adapting their robots to the needs of factory managers. Adept aims to make its robots flexible, able easily to learn new jobs, said Charlie Duncheon, vice president for sales and marketing at Adept. "There are products in consumer electronics and personal computers that have a life cycle of six to nine months," he said. "Those people need flexible automation that can be changed rapidly for a new product."
To make the change-overs as quick and painless as possible, robot makers have applied the lessons of personal computers to the "user interface." Instead of having to write new software code to adapt a robot to a new task, for example, users can use a computer mouse, point-and-click commands and successive pull-down menus to make the necessary changes.
"You no longer need a Ph.D. in computer science to program a robot," Mr. Duncheon said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Auto Sales Rose In August

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Calming fears on Wall Street that weak July results signaled an end to the economic recovery, sales of cars and light trucks in the United States resumed their vigorous pace in August, rising 10.3 percent over the comparable month a year ago.
The results released today suggested that the auto makers were correct in attributing the July slowdown to production shortfalls, rather than to a drop in demand. As investors hurriedly bid up auto stocks late in the day, auto executives clearly felt vindicated. 
 "I guess the Street didn't believe it, but this proves that last month's analysis was valid," said William E. Hoglund, the General Motors executive vice president in charge of sales, service, and marketing. "Our story last month was availability."
There is no shortage of buyers, Mr. Hoglund added. "We see a confident consumer," he said. "At the gut level, on the showroom floor the dealers report that the customers are in a buying mood."
Placing a heavy bet that the recovery will continue, the auto makers are planning to raise their fourth-quarter North American output to 3.9 million units, 8.3 percent higher than last year's level, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade weekly.
 
Stocks Rise
 That increase is consistent with solid economic growth, said David L. Littmann, chief economist for the Comerica Bank. "It's a continuing healthy economy," he said. "Not sluggish, not robust in the boom sense."
He predicted that increased exports of cars and trucks would offset any softening in the domestic market and help hold growth higher than 3 percent through 1995.
As the sales reports trickled in late this afternoon, shares of G.M. rose $2.125 to close at $52.25 in heavy trading. Chrysler rose $1, to $48.50, and Ford gained 37.5 cents, to $30.
"The momentum, at least in this segment of the economy, is pretty much intact," said Joseph S. Phillippi, auto industry analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York. The strong sales performance, he said, was "across the board."
Rising interest rates and a drop in mortgage refinancing have taken the edge off the recovery without stopping it, according to many auto analysts.
But interest rates have not risen enough to frighten away consumers who simply need to trade in their aging cars, said Gurudutte Baliga, assistant portfolio manager for IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. Mr. Baliga said 25 percent of the vehicles on the road, or more than 40 million cars and light trucks, were more than 10 years old.
Production constraints continue to hold back sales. G.M., for example, was able to increase supplies of its popular Blazer sport utility vehicle and Lumina midsized car from July to August. But, because of plant shutdowns to prepare for new models, it still has no Chevrolet Cavaliers or Pontiac Sunfires, two small cars that are expected to sell in large numbers.
Similarly, Ford's car sales slipped 9.4 percent for the month, to 145,131, in large part because it had halted production of two small cars, the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz. Ford has not yet replaced them with two new, larger cars, the Contour and Mystique, which are to go on sale on Sept. 29.
Dealers reported that inventory shortages could prevent them from taking advantage of strong demand in coming months. Normally, dealers increase their sales in September and October as they clear out the previous year's models to make space for the new versions.
"Our tremendous sales in August almost wiped out our entire inventory," said John Kaestner, general sales manager at Evanston Toyota in Evanston, Ill. "There isn't anything left for cleanup. I'm begging for inventory."
During August, sales of all cars, whether built in North America or imported, rose 8.1 percent, to 782,583. Sales of light trucks -- a category that includes pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- rose 13.8 percent, to 518,242.
 
Saturn Sales Up
 Within the generally strong market there were some notably impressive performers. At G.M., sales of Saturn small cars almost doubled, to 31,814.
While the Honda Motor Company posted a mild gain of 5.2 percent in car sales, total sales of its Accord surged ahead of Ford's Taurus for the first time this year. But a spokesman for Honda, Art Garner, said that because Ford could easily increase its fleet sales, the Taurus would probably edge the Accord for the sales crown again in 1994.
Toyota posted a gain of 23.4 percent in total vehicle sales for the month, to 127,129. Because of the high resale value of its cars, Toyota has offered generous lease deals, since people who lease pay only for the value of the car that they use during their contract, typically two or three years. Leasing has helped Toyota dull the price increases forced on it by the strength of the Japanese yen.
In addition, Mr. Phillippi the analyst said, buyers appear willing to pay premiums of more than $3,000 because of the perception of Japanese quality. "There's no question that there's still a fairly high owner loyalty out there among import buyers," he said.

American Express Offers New Card

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The American Express Company, making a long-awaited drive for a market far larger than globe-trotters and executives on the town, introduced a new credit card yesterday, its first with no annual fee.
The new mass-market challenge to banks that issue Visa and Mastercard reflects a change of strategy at American Express. Under Harvey Golub, its chairman for the last year and a half, the company has chosen to play down the trademark green and gold charge cards, which require payment in full and carry a high annual fee. 
 Mr. Golub has concluded that there is more money to be made in the highly competitive card market by charging interest on unpaid card balances. The company plans to introduce 10 to 15 cards with various features in an effort to quadruple its credit-card balances to about $30 billion, which would earn $450 million to $600 million in interest and fees a year.
 
Grace Period Offered
 The first card in the line, called the Optima True Grace card, is intended to appeal to people who typically run high balances on their cards. Its most unusual feature is that interest will not be charged on any purchases until 25 days after the date the card holder's bill is printed. Most other card companies offer a grace period only if the account is paid in full; otherwise, interest is charged from the date of purchase.
After the grace period, American Express will charge the prime rate (now 7.75 percent) plus 8.75 percent. That rate is slightly less than that charged by large mass-market card issuers. Citibank, for example, the leading credit-card provider, charges the prime rate plus 9.9 percent on its most popular cards. For the first six months, American Express will offer the Optima True Grace card with a "teaser" rate of 7.9 percent.
Credit-card consultants said that the grace-period feature appeared to be designed to encourage consumers to use the card for both borrowing and spending. Many credit-card holders use one card for their revolving balances and another -- with a grace period -- for spending that they intend to pay off every month.
"The biggest problem banks have is that people transfer funds onto their cards and let them sit," said Stephen M. Szekely, a credit-card consultant with Payment Systems Inc. of Tampa, Fla. "American Express has come up with a nice innovation to maintain usage levels."
 
A Costly Feature
 It is a costly feature, however. Most banks earn interest on 90 percent of their credit-card balances, because 80 percent of the balances are rolled over from previous months and roughly half of new purchases are subject to finance charges, Mr. Szekely said.
Because American Express will not charge interest on any new balances, its earnings from the card will be cut by one to two percentage points, Mr. Szekely said.
The company will partly compensate for the lost interest, however, because it charges merchants a higher fee than banks that issue Mastercard and Visa cards.
Consumers will probably pay about 1 percent less a year using the Optima True Grace card than a typical card with the same nominal interest rate, experts said, although that could vary depending on how the cards are used.
The stock of American Express rose $1.375 yesterday, to $30.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
This is not the first venture by American Express into revolving-credit cards. In 1987, it introduced the original Optima card, which was successful in the marketplace, but the company ultimately lost more than $1 billion on unpaid Optima balances. That card was offered only to people who also had American Express charge cards, and as a result it attracted a disproportionate amount of customers who were in debt over their heads.
 
Learning From Mistakes
 American Express said it had learned its lesson and had invested in new loan approval systems.
"Good judgment comes from bad experience," said Phillip J. Reise, president of the company's credit-card group. "Let's say we now have excellent judgment."
The original Optima card is still being offered and has rates as low as the prime rate plus 6 points.

HEADLINE: Dow Posts a 13.12 Rise In Light, Aimless Day

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market edged higher yesterday, with trading thin as Rosh ha-Shanah began and the long Labor Day weekend ended.
General Motors' announcement in the late afternoon of strong August auto sales lifted the Dow Jones industrial average slightly, but there was little indication of the general direction of stocks. The dollar fell and so did bonds, eroding the limited gain in equity prices. 
 The Dow industrials rose 13.12 points, to 3,898.70, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.87 point, to 471.86. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite was up 0.25 point, to 759.48.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 199.9 million shares, about 30 percent below this year's average of 286 million shares a day and 25 percent below the even more subdued summer volume of 266 million.
James B. Stack, president of Investech Research, predicted that the Dow would establish a trading range between 3,750 and 3,950 over the next three weeks or so. Between April and late August, the Dow generally traded between 3,600 and 3,800.
 
Qualified Gloom
 But Mr. Stack said that market prospects would darken in the fourth quarter as traders began to realize that contrary to current assessments, the economy was not slowing. The Federal Reserve, he said, would again have to raise interest rates.
He advises taking profits on technology stocks like Compaq, which gained 3/8 yesterday to close at 35 3/8, and Microsoft, which was unchanged at 56, as well as on military-related issues like McDonnell Douglas and Raytheon. And he urged cutting losses on stocks like Wall Street brokerage houses and electric utilities because of their vulnerability to rising interest rates. Investech, based in Whitefish, Mont., provides technical market research to institutional and individual investors.
Louis G. Navellier, a big portfolio manager and newsletter writer in Incline Village, Nev., said he was bullish, but not by much. "We're meandering higher," he said. "I'll make maybe 3 percent this month, and the market will make 2 percent."
The reason? "September is usually a horrible month because of profit taking and window-dressing," Mr. Navellier said, alluding to the kind of trading that takes place as the third quarter closes. "But it won't be as bad as usual because there aren't any profits to take, and there are too many dogs to throw out the window."
Three stocks -- General Motors, American Express and Eastman Kodak -- accounted for nearly all the rise in the Dow yesterday.
 
Statistics From Detroit
 G.M. was up 2 1/8, to 52 1/4, with almost all of the rise coming after the auto maker's announcement at 2:50 P.M. that August vehicle sales had been better than expected; domestic cars were up 17 percent and domestic trucks were up 15 percent, over the period a year earlier. Chrysler also reported strong growth, but Ford reported weaker than expected sales.
American Express, the most active stock, with 3.9 million shares changing hands, rose 1 3/8, to 30 3/8, after the company introduced a new version of its Optima credit card. The Optima True Grace card will have a 25-day grace period before interest is charged on outstanding balances.
Eastman Kodak rose 1 1/8, to 51 1/4, after announcing the $1 billion sale of its clinical-diagnostics business, which makes cancer-screening machines and other equipment, to Johnson & Johnson, which slipped 1/8, to 50.
Sears, Roebuck, which fell Friday despite reporting August sales growth of 5.2 percent, rose 3/4, to 47 1/2.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.18 point, with 956 advancing stocks lagging behind 1,142 declining issues. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.46 point, to 456.00.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 15 rose. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S. &P. 500, 228 rose.

HEADLINE: MUSIC NOTES;
Orchestras Merge Business Resources

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
In an innovative managerial arrangement, the American Symphony Orchestra has taken the chamber orchestra Concordia under its wing. Concordia, founded 10 years ago by Marin Alsop to explore American music, particularly concert music with jazz influences, will retain its own board of trustees, keep its own books and pursue its own artistic goals. But the American Symphony Orchestra will oversee the presentation of its concerts, as well as its marketing and fund raising.
"What we're trying to do," explained Eugene Carr, the executive director of the American Symphony, "is to create a new way to manage the arts by combining resources. It seem ridiculous that if you have a dozen organizations, each producing a small number of events every year, you also have a dozen executive directors, a dozen office leases, a dozen marketing departments. None of the organizations can really afford to engage as much staff as it needs." 
 Concordia presents only four concerts a year. The American Symphony Orchestra presents six programs but is also in residence at the Bard Music Festival, has a chamber series and tours. Combining the two organizations allows for what Mr. Carr called "an economy of scale." Concordia will pay the American Symphony a fee for its management services for the next three years, but the arrangement should represent a saving of 40 percent in administrative costs for the orchestra.
What the American Symphony gets out of the relationship, in addition to the management fee, is a slightly expanded staff, which will work for both orchestras. Collaborative projects are also under discussion.
"Everybody is looking for ways to cut overhead these days," Mr. Carr said. "We think the way to do that is to work more efficiently. The American Symphony and Concordia are two different kinds of ensembles. But producing concerts, marketing, dealing with boards and raising money are similar from one organization to the next. By streamlining all these support functions, we are able to show foundations that more of the grant money they give us actually goes toward artistic programs, not toward light bulbs and rent."
 
Americans in Bucharest
 Contemporary American music has not had much of a presence in Romanian concert halls, but the composer Tobias Picker and the conductors Sergiu Comissiona and Cristian Mandeal, with sponsorship from the United States Embassy and Delta Airlines, plan to remedy that with a weeklong festival starting on Sunday at the Atheneum in Bucharest.
Music by few dozen American composers, representing virtually every contemporary style, will be performed in the festival, which will include three concerts by Mr. Mandeal's orchestra, the George Enescu Philharmonic, and two concerts of chamber and vocal works. Among the composers whose works are scheduled are John Adams, Leonard Bernstein, Samuel Barber, Elliott Carter, David Diamond, Conlon Nancarrow, Aaron Copland, Michael Daugherty, Ned Rorem, Jacob Druckman, George Gershwin, Joan Tower, William Schuman, Paul Schoenfield and Mr. Picker. Works by Warren Davidson and Regina Keane will have their world premieres.
"Romania has a great musical tradition," Mr. Picker said, "but they've hardly heard any American music, and with the exception of Copland and Bernstein, they don't even know the names of American composers." Mr. Picker, who is leaving for Bucharest on Sept. 4 to oversee the final preparations, is taking the pianist Ursula Oppens and the violinist Robert McDuffie, both well-known interpreters of American works.
Mr. Picker began thinking about presenting American music in Bucharest two years ago. He had been the composer in residence at the Houston Symphony, where Mr. Comissiona was the director. He proposed the idea of a festival to Mr. Comissiona, who is Romanian. Mr. Comissiona made the connection with Mr. Mandeal and his ensemble.
"When I was composer in residence in Houston," Mr. Picker said, "I spent my time bringing American music to Americans. And even then, I thought that the next logical step would be to export our music, to bring it to countries that have a Western musical tradition, but for whom our music would be completely new."
The concerts are to be recorded by the Romanian Composers Union, and there is talk of a highlights CD, although Mr. Picker was not sure whether it would be released in the United States.
 
Opera Guide
 For the itinerant opera fan who needs a way to know what's playing where, Opera America publishes an annual guide that lists schedules and production information (but not casts) for most American and a handful of foreign companies.
This year's edition, snappily titled "Season Schedule of Performances 1994-95," runs 128 pages (up from 104 last year) and lists the offerings of more than 100 companies affiliated with Opera America, a 24-year-old organization that provides information, advice and administrative services for professional opera companies.
The listings, arranged by company, include mailing addresses, administrative and box office phone numbers, and seating capacities. There is also a listing of world premieres and a works index that allows readers to track their favorite operas, or to see at a glance that Puccini's "Boheme," with 28 productions scheduled from Hawaii to Finland, is getting the best coverage.
The pocket-size book is available for $12 (plus a $3 handling fee per order) from Opera America, 777 14th Street NW, Suite 520, Washington D.C., 20005, or by fax, (202) 393-0735.
 
New Met Butterfly
 When the Metropolitan Opera announced its schedule for the coming season, Carol Vaness was listed in the title role of a new production of "Madama Butterfly," to be staged by Giancarlo del Monaco. But by the time the season brochure was ready to go to press, Miss Vaness withdrew, saying she had decided not to add the role to her repertory at this time. (She will still sing Elettra in "Idomeneo" and the title role in "Tosca" at the Met this season.) Last week the Met found a replacement: Catherine Malfitano, an American soprano who has lately been spending most of her time in Europe and has sung the role to some acclaim at La Scala, Covent Garden and the Vienna State Opera.
 
Hemidemisemiquavers
 *Patricia Racette, a soprano from New Hampshire who is to make her Metropolitan Opera debut this season (as Musetta in "La Boheme"), is the recipient of the 1994 Marian Anderson Award, a $25,000 stipend given annually to a young singer who has shown professional promise. The singers are nominated by critics, artistic directors and managers of opera companies and orchestras, and they do not know they are being considered for the prize. Miss Racette, the fifth winner of the award, has been singing at the San Francisco Opera since 1989 and has also performed since then with the New York City Opera, the Vienna State Opera and the Welsh National Opera.
*The finalists for the 1994 Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards for the best new American works are Leon Kirchner, for his Music for Cello and Orchestra; John Anthony Lennon, for "Zingari," a guitar concerto; Tison Street for "Bright Sambas," and Jay Alan Yim for "Rain Palace." They were selected from 125 entries. The final ranking (first prize is $5,000, fourth prize $500) is to be announced on Oct. 1, after the works are performed by the National Symphony Orchestra in a free concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington.
*James Ehnes, a Canadian violinist, was awarded the first Ivan Galamian Memorial Prize, a $25,000 career grant. The prize was established by the board of the Meadowmount School of Music, the retreat for string players that Galamian founded in 1944 in Westport, N.Y. Galamian, who also taught at the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute, died in 1981.
*Mark Anderson, a pianist from California, won the $20,000 first prize in the 22d University of Maryland William Kappell Piano Competition. The prize includes a recital at Alice Tully Hall on Nov. 12. Stanislav Judenich of Uzbekistan won the second prize ($10,000), and Armen Babakhanian of Armenia won the third prize ($5,000).

HEADLINE: GREAT COOKS: Linda McCartney;
Lots of Smidgens, But Hold the Meat

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER 

 BODY:
"ARE you a veggie?" is the usual salutation of Linda McCartney, cookbook author, photographer, musician and wife of Paul McCartney, the songwriter and performer.
Mrs. McCartney recently went to the East Hampton, L.I., home of the chef Pierre Franey to discuss her passion for vegetarian cooking and to prepare a meal from her cookbook, "Linda McCartney's Home Cooking" (Arcade Publishing, 1989). Traipsing behind her was her vegetable-loving husband, wearing baggy plaid shorts, sandals and a blue sweatshirt and carrying a guitar. 
 "I grew up in a family that loved good food, but I was the one who really liked to cook," she said while quickly getting down to business by chopping onions, carrots and leeks for a vegetable soup. "When I was growing up in Scarsdale, we had a cook. Maybe because of my insecurity or whatever I used to hang around the kitchen and watch her."
Mrs. McCartney, 52, disarmingly earthy and outgoing, has been married to the ex-Beatle for 25 years and has four children: Heather, 31 (from a previous marriage); Mary, 25; Stella, 23, and James, 17.
She was wearing blue jeans and a colorful peasant blouse -- "I'm a peasant cook," she said -- that set off her straw-colored hair and pellucid green eyes. Mr. McCartney, also 52, watched his wife buzz around the kitchen for an hour before quietly carrying his left-handed Martin acoustic guitar into the den for -- what else? -- a songwriting session.
"Don't mind me," he said. "I'll watch for a while, then go into another room to play a little." The McCartneys spend a few weeks each summer in East Hampton, near Mrs. McCartney's stepmother, Monique Eastman.
"Paul really is a great bread maker," Mrs. McCartney said while assembling her soup. "During the bread strike in England he made it every day at home."
Mr. McCartney said: "My best dish is mashed potatoes. A little milk, some chopped onions -- that's the Liverpool version."
Mrs. McCartney's devotion to meatless cooking goes beyond her household south of London. Three years ago she introduced in England a line of frozen vegetarian entrees: lasagna, pasta, burgers, pot pies, goulash and more. Today the line, which bears her name, carries 18 items and has more than $40 million in sales annually. Once the initial investment is recouped, she said, she plans to give the profits to charity.
In this country, Linda McCartney's Homestyle Cooking entrees, produced by Fairmont Foods outside Minneapolis, were test-marketed in the Midwest this year and are to be introduced on the West Coast next month and on the East Coast by year-end. Single-portion entrees will cost about $3 each.
For the meal at Mr. Franey's home, Mrs. McCartney prepared vegetable soup, an eggplant casserole laced with fresh herbs, coleslaw and applesauce cake.
"Most people don't know how good vegetarian food can be," she said. "Look at this vegetable soup. You know where the flavor comes from? Sauteing the vegetables in a little oil first."
The McCartneys, who raise sheep for wool and have an organic farm two hours south of London, in Berkshire, have been vegetarians for more than 20 years. An abhorrence of animal slaughter is at the root of the couple's aversion to meat.
"It really all started with the animals," Mr. McCartney said. "We were sitting home having dinner one day, and there were some lambs running around outside on our farm. They were so cute, and we were sitting there eating meat. Before that it never occurred to us that maybe we should look into another way."
He added that for the first year of their meatless lives, "there was this big hole in the middle of the plate, you know, because we were so used to meals built around meat."
"Then gradually," he continued, "Linda started filling that hole by cooking vegetables in interesting ways."
At the drop of a scallion Mrs. McCartney cites statistics on animal carnage and on the global economic efficiency of vegetarianism. And she never misses an opportunity to underscore her beliefs. When she spotted some ceramic figurines of pigs and cows on Mr. Franey's windowsill, she remarked, "Oh, those are cute, but they sure look different when they're murdered."
Mrs. McCartney refers to meat as "flesh" or when giving extra emphasis to a point, "a slab of fear." The McCartney children, all raised without meat, poultry or fish, have remained vegetarians.
"When the kids were growing up I said: 'Hey, we're going veggie. I don't want to cook meat anymore,' " she recalled. "If they wanted to eat differently out of the house, fine. But as it turned out, they were all sympathetic."
Even though all the children except James are now on their own, the McCartneys describe themselves as homebodies. "We don't get out that much, unless we're on tour or something," Mr. McCartney said.
"Yes, but the house is always full," Mrs. McCartney said. "The kids come by; we have friends over." At their East Hampton rental house the week before, they had entertained guests -- including Paul Simon, Lorne Michaels and his wife, Alice -- with a vegetarian dinner.
Mrs. McCartney noted that she was working on an updated vegetarian cookbook. Her current book has sold more than 250,000 copies worldwide, she said.
As she spoke, she sliced fat late-summer eggplant for the casserole, which was liberally seasoned with fresh basil and oregano and onion. She is hardly Julia Child-like when it comes to precision with ingredients. Everything is added in handfuls, pinches, smidgens. Her favorite measurement is "lots of."
"Linda, should I add half a tablespoon of oregano or a whole tablespoon?" Mr. Franey said.
"Go ahead, throw it all in, Pierre," she replied with a wave of her hand. Mr. Franey chuckled and followed orders.
Mrs. McCartney clearly enjoys serving flavorful food. She undertook a daunting challenge two years ago while on a world tour with her husband's band (she played keyboards and sang) and road crew, a total of 140 people.
"Before the tour the promoter told us that we had to pay for our food on the road," Mr. McCartney said. "We thought, wow, we have to think about how to do this." Mrs. McCartney decided that it would be a good idea for both health and economic reasons to do a vegetarian tour.
Working with a caterer, Mrs. McCartney devised menus for every day, with several choices for each course listed on a blackboard.
"The food was so good that most people didn't miss meat at all," Mr. McCartney said. "We even got a few converts by the time it was over."
Mr. McCartney then indulged in some Beatles culinary nostalgia. "When the Beatles were starting and playing in clubs around Liverpool," he said, "my father, on his days off, would make a batch of mashed potatoes and stuff and bring it down so we would have something to eat."
Mrs. McCartney placed her eggplant casserole in the oven, then started on the applesauce cake. "Lots of lemon zest gives it flavor," she said while running a lemon over a grater. The simple, semisweet and moist cake was redolent of cinnamon and nutmeg and studded with Mr. McCartney's favorite nuts, pecans.
"Pierre, do you have any organic eggs?" Mrs. McCartney asked Mr. Franey, prompting a surprised look, as if he had been asked to sing a few bars of "Penny Lane."
While the nonorganic cake was being assembled, Mr. McCartney ducked into the den with his guitar to work on a song. Reading lyrics scribbled on a sheet of paper, he ran through two verses of a sweet-sounding ballad having to do with a poor boy in love.
"I do it very simply at first, just to get the feeling," he said. "It's just like cooking, you know -- a simple expression can be the best."
Back in the kitchen, Mr. Franey turned to Mrs. McCartney and said, "Mademoiselle, did you put the timer on before you put the cake in the oven?"
"No," she replied, unconcerned."We'll know when it's ready."
Aside from her culinary pursuits, Mrs. McCartney is a well-known photographer of rock stars and other subjects. In the mid-1960's, when she was known as Linda Eastman (no connection with the Eastman-Kodak Company), the daughter of a prominent New York entertainment lawyer, Lee Eastman, she worked as a receptionist at Town & Country magazine.
"One day, an invitation came in to the editors for an event called Meet the Rolling Stones," she recalled. "I snagged the invitation and put it in my drawer. I got caught, but they didn't want to go anyway, so they said I could go."
Carrying her Pentax camera and trying to look like a professional, she went to a pier on Manhattan's West Side, where the party was being held on a boat.
"When I got there they told me that there was not enough room on the boat for all the journalists and all the photographers, so they turned to me and said, 'O.K., you will be the only photographer on the boat.' "
The photographs she sold to magazines around the country instantly established her reputation. Mrs. McCartney used her newfound stature to photograph dozens of leading rock musicians in the 1960's and 70's -- including Paul McCartney, whom she met while photographing the Beatles in 1967. They were married two years later. In 1992 she published a coffee table book of her musician portraits and had a traveling exhibition of her work in the United States.
Back at Mr. Franey's, the finished meal was arranged on a table outside. Mr. McCartney eagerly strode out, sat down and tucked a napkin into the neck of his sweatshirt.
"You don't mind having photos taken?" his wife asked.
"Not if I get some soup," he replied.
Later, as the last of the apple cake was consumed, Mr. Franey declared the meal a great success: the soup was full flavored and perfumed with summery herbs, the eggplant well textured and tasty, the coleslaw bright and fresh and the applecake homey and moist. Mr. Franey had to concede that he initially had harbored doubts about Mrs. McCartney's free-form style of cooking.
"Next time, I want to invite you here and I will cook my own version of a vegetarian dinner," he said to Mrs. McCartney.
"Wonderful!" she replied.
"We're going home on Tuesday," her sated husband said. "Maybe we could do it before then?"

HEADLINE: Clinton Has Opportunity to Act Wisely on Cuba

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Clinton Administration officials insist that Fidel Castro is directing the flow of refugees fleeing Cuba. They, and much of the United States media, portray President Castro as the dictator in control of the floodgates, which he cynically opens and closes at will, forcing out thousands of unhappy Cubans. Such a distorted picture has plunged President Clinton into a policy quagmire. Mr. Castro cannot now stop the exodus; only a change in United States policy will stem the human tide. 
 In the last few years increasing numbers of Cuban refugees hijacked boats and planes to reach Florida. The hijackers were always given a hero's welcome in Miami, and their feats were broadcast to Cuba over the United States-financed Radio Marti. Whenever the Cuban Government successfully interdicted such illegal emigration, the United States accused it of committing human rights violations and classified those arrested as political prisoners.
Some Cubans trying to flee became emboldened by this express approval of their efforts in the United States. They increasingly used violence to overcome the Cuban police and those loyal to the Government who attempted to stop them.
Last year two Cuban police officers were bound and shot in cold blood by a group trying to steal a boat to set out on the Florida Straits. In two incidents in July, hijackers forced those not wishing to leave to jump overboard or take a dangerous journey against their will.
On July 13, an attempt to steal a tugboat ended in tragedy. Thirty people drowned when a botched effort to thwart the flight resulted in the sinking of the 19th-century vessel. The Clinton Administration branded the tragedy an example of Cuban brutality. Many Cubans, even high-level party members, felt the Government should not try to stop those fleeing.
Although increased military and police force might prevent some from leaving, it also increases the likelihood of violence and loss of life. Mr. Castro cannot risk the domestic consequences of attempting to solve unilaterally a problem the United States helped create. Administration inflexibility is counterproductive, and the insistence that Cuba's leadership commit political suicide is not viable.
The hand of Jorge Mas Canosa, the ultra-right-wing Miami expatriate, seems to dictate United States policy and can only strengthen the resolve of the Cubans in Cuba to tough it out. It is unrealistic to expect two generations of Cubans who have sacrificed for the revolution to surrender voluntarily to a man loathed by Cubans at home and by those who have suffered from his vengeance in Miami.
President Clinton, however, could chart a new course that would curtail the flight and avoid a crisis of still greater proportions. A modest shift in United States policy -- engaging in direct talks on a broad range of issues while lifting the embargo on food and medicine -- would provide the Cuban people some hope that things will improve. By easing the economic suffering even minimally, President Clinton would demonstrate that he, not Mr. Mas Canosa, is in charge and that the long-term interests of the United States and the Cuban people come before the ambitions of a narrow segment of expatriates.
Cubans would have reason to stay and work out the inevitable transition. Such reasonable measures would help open a broader debate in Cuba, leading to peaceful, democratic change.

HEADLINE: Don't Call Unemployment a Jobs Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich's boastful summary of the Clinton Administration's "work-force agenda" in "The Fracturing of the Middle Class" (Op-Ed, Aug. 31) is political disingenuousness. 
 It is not just "Wall Street" that "frets" that "unemployment is too low to contain inflation." Mr. Reich knows that the Administration, Congress and the Federal Reserve are determined to keep people out of work to depress wages and salaries.
The creation of 2.5 million jobs in the last year is not "progress," and Mr. Reich knows it. He has repeatedly acknowledged that most of the new jobs are part time, low paid or both.
The accepted policy to maintain at least 6 percent unemployment while labeling it "full employment" insures that the number of people out of work increases as the work force grows. Mr. Reich knows this, and knows that it is a formula for social disaster. When will he propose a real jobs policy?

HEADLINE: Don't Call Unemployment a Jobs Plan;
Meanwhile at the Fed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Jobs Versus Inflation at the Fed" (editorial, Aug. 30) states that I "called last week for the Fed to use monetary policy to bring down unemployment from temporary high levels." Not so. I even voted to raise the discount rate on Aug. 16. 
 You also suggest that my "declaration may have been designed to enhance the likelihood that the White House would elevate him to the Fed chairmanship when Mr. Greenspan's term expires." That is untrue; your very next sentence notes that I "preached the same doctrine as an academic and before Congress." Not all statements by high government officials are Machiavellian. Some are simply honest and lack an ulterior motive.

HEADLINE: Missing Boat: Perils in a Life at Sea, and on Land

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GLOUCESTER, Mass., Sept. 6

 BODY:
The women of this fishing community have a covenant with their men. They don't tell their husbands how much they worry when the men are at sea, for days and sometimes weeks on end.
And the men don't tell their wives about the waves crashing over the deck in 50-mile-per-hour gales, or the ice on the masts in winter, or the freighters they can't see in the fog. And they never, never admit that sometimes they are afraid. 
 "I'll overhear my husband telling someone else about the boat hanging up, or a guy almost getting thrown overboard," said Jane Russo, 31, who met her husband, Vincenzo, when she was 15 and a waitress at Dulie's Coffee Shop, down by the docks. "But he never tells me."
 
Searching for Survivors
 This is how things are here even now, even as the men and women of this economically battered, close-knit town of Italian and Portuguese immigrant heritage grieves for the four fishermen whose boat went down in a storm 100 miles east of Cape Cod early on Monday. The missing men are not just names here; they are people most everyone knows.
The Coast Guard is still searching for the crewmen, all experienced hands who had weathered far worse storms than Monday's, but the people of Gloucester are beginning to lose hope. Only an automatic distress signal was received from the 78-foot trawler, the Italian Gold. A Canadian helicopter followed it to the overturned vessel, which sank 15 minutes later, but saw no sign of survivors.
"It doesn't look good," said Mrs. Russo, who has three small children and a husband on another boat.
Mrs. Russo and some of the other fishermen's wives were talking over coffee this evening in the basement of St. Ann's Church after a Mass for the the Italian Gold's crew. The missing men's wives, Donna Curcuru, Alise Carrapichosa, Joanne Govinco and Vera Curcuru (no relation to Donna Curcuru), were in seclusion, at home with their children.
Sinkings are rare, but the risk is constant, and it was only by God's grace, the women said, that they weren't the ones waiting by the telephone. "Who's to say your number's not going to be up?" Mrs. Russo said.
 
'Daddy's Gone Fishing'
 At 4 this morning, she said, her husband, the son and grandson of Sicilian fishermen, had left aboard the Miss Trish to cast nets for cod, haddock and flounder, just like the Italian Gold. "I tell my children, 'Daddy's gone fishing,' " she said. "When he leaves, you say something like, 'Make sure you call.' You don't tell him your fears, and he doesn't tell you his. You try to spare each other."
Grace Favazza, 66, lost her oldest brother, Vito, when another Gloucester boat, the Captain Cosmo, went down 16 years ago today with seven men aboard. "Sept. 6, 1978, the sea took him," said Mrs. Favazza, whose husband, Peter, 74, retired from fishing with a bad leg. "The whole boat and the crew -- no trace. Every day for a month my mother waited: 'Maybe today there'll be word, maybe tomorrow.' "
To be a fisherman's wife is to spend your life waiting, in a way -- waiting for your husband to come home, waiting for him to leave again.
Peter Favazza was at sea for the birth of his four children. It couldn't be helped, Mrs. Favazza said. Her husband had to earn a living the only way he knew how. "I called my sister each time," she said. "I said, 'I'm ready to have my baby. I'm packed.' "
Angela Sanfilippo, the head of the Gloucester Fishermen's Wives Association, was serving cookies at the church this evening. With the men gone, she said, the women have to manage life on land by themselves.
"Your kids get sick, you take care of them," said Mrs. Sanfilippo, who has raised three children, including a 23-year-old son who is a fisherman, like his father, grandfather and great-grandfather. "You buy a house, you plan a vacation."
Gerri Lovasco's husband, Peter, retired from fishing after 53 years of going to sea. She said the prolonged separations meant that the wives "had to make a lot of the decisions -- about school, confirmation, who the godfather was going to be." Their husbands, she said, "missed birthdays, anniversaries."
And weddings. "We," Mrs. Favazza said, indicating the women around her, "go to weddings with each other."
Still, Mrs. Lovasco said, it has been a good life. "We had beautiful houses, education for our children," she said. But Mrs. Russo, whose children are ages 4, 3 and 1, interjected with some bitterness, "Not anymore."
Mrs. Favazza's husband would be gone for 22 days at a time, fishing off Nova Scotia, then home for 3. Mr. Favazza, who now has trouble walking, rested at home while his wife was at the church today.
Later he said: "We went through a lot of storms, hurricanes. When the wind kicks up, you've got waves 20 and 30 feet; they splatter all over the boat. We had windows broken in the pilot house, the doors smashed in, the lifeboats washed away.
"Then in the wintertime, when the spray hits the mast, or any other part of the boat, it turns to ice. We stop the boat, we have to use wooden mallets to chop the ice off. Otherwise, it would tip over."
Once, about 15 years ago, Mr. Favazza said, his boat caught fire off Maine. "We got onto another boat, and watched her go down," he said. "Was I scared? Frightened to death."
 
Keeping Fear Private
 But no, he added, he never told his wife he was scared. Not then, not ever. "She had enough to worry about with the kids," he said. "She was working day and night, same as me."
Nowadays, the women may worry as much when the men are home.
After 375 years, fishing is disappearing as a way of life here. The oldest American fishing area, Georges Bank, is largely barren of the haddock, cod and flounder that sustained more than 10 generations of New Englanders.
With Government regulations intended to preserve what is left, fishermen can't work nearly as often as they want. For every two days they are out, they must stay home one. A 10-day trip means 5 days at home -- 5 days of not bringing in money.
Still, Mrs. Russo said, nothing will stop her husband from fishing, not this week's accident, not regulations, not the depleted fishing stock.
"You come to this country when you're 14," she said, speaking for her husband, and for many others. "You don't go to high school; you get on a boat. Now, you're 35 and you've got two mortgages, a house and a boat, and three children. It's not a good time for a career change."
Mrs. Russo squared her shoulders. "I'm damn proud of him," she said. "I have a brother-in-law who went to college. My husband says, 'He knows books, I know life.' "
The discussion quieted when Gay Viola, the sister of the missing skipper, Nicholas Curcuru, 48, entered, bringing only news of Mr. Curcuru's wife. "It's a way of life," Mrs. Viola said, whose father was a fisherman. "Even now, Donna's waiting for him to call and say he's coming home."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Cuban Talks Suspended As Envoy Returns to Havana

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Talks between the United States and Cuba on halting the exodus of Cuban boat people toward Florida were suspended today when the chief Cuban negotiator, Ricardo Alarcon, abruptly broke off discussions and flew back to Havana to consult his Government.
But the rest of the Cuban delegation remained in New York and the spokesman for the American delegation, David T. Johnson, said the negotiations could resume as early as Friday. 
 In Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher described the talks as "productive, useful, businesslike." And he emphasized that Mr. Alarcon's decision to return to Havana "is not by any means a breakdown in the talks but it's part of the useful talks that are taking place."
In Madrid, Cuba's Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, also expressed cautious optimism that an agreement might be possible, telling journalists, "I think we have not yet exhausted all the talks' possibilities."
"Such a dispute cannot be solved in a few days and I think we will arrive at a reconciliation," he added.
 
Position Called Moderate
 Members of a group of Latin American representatives to the United Nations who met privately with Mr. Alarcon here last night described his position as moderate and said he told them not to be surprised if, despite all the difficulties, there was an agreement within a few days.
However, American officials conceded that "substantial differences" remained between the two sides, suggesting that after six days of talks here Mr. Alarcon, a former Cuban Foreign Minister and United Nations representative, felt the need to consult with President Fidel Castro directly.
As usual neither side provided any information about the substance of the discussions, which today took place in the United States Mission to the United Nations after two days of meetings in the Cuban mission and lasted barely 45 minutes.
But while the United States has offered to expand legal immigration from Cuba in return for Havana's halting the deluge of boat people sailing for Florida, the Cuban Government wants any refugee accord linked to an easing of the 32-year American trade embargo against the island, arguing that the poverty this causes forces people to flee.
So far, the Clinton Administration has insisted that the negotiators confine themselves to immigration issues, although this leaves the United States team with relatively little bargaining leverage.
 
An Offer by the U.S.
 Initially, the Administration, which under a 1984 agreement can admit up to 27,000 Cuban immigrants annually but has been accepting only 2,000 or 3,000 in recent years, offered to raise this number to 20,000 if Havana clamped down on the boat people.
Cuba replied that since the United States ought by now to have issued over 100,000 more refugee visas than it has it should first agree to catch up with the target set in 1984.
The United States then said its earlier offer of 20,000 visas was "flexible" and could be raised to around 27,000 a year.
Cuba also suggested that the United States set a date for discussing the economic embargo and consider reversing the new restrictions President Clinton imposed this summer when he made it harder for American Cubans to send money to relatives on the island or to make visits there.

HEADLINE: On a Harlem Block, Hope Is Swallowed by Decay

SERIES: Another America: Life on 129th Street -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
There are days that Robert LeShawn Garland, a lanky 18-year-old with a yen to fly airplanes, can look out his window and spy his father waiting in a snaking line to buy crack. Once their eyes met, and his father hung his head.
On the floor below, Donna Williams often starts her day with a beer, trying to beat the blues. She has five children, she just turned 40, and she has been on welfare for more than a decade. From her living room, she can see an empty lot and rows of boarded windows. 
 Two stoops away sit Mel and Dennis. Once they owned the block, these two brothers with high cheekbones and laughing eyes, counting their cash from drug dealing. Now 19-year-old Mel is in a wheelchair, paralyzed after taking seven bullets from a 9-millimeter pistol.
This is 129th Street between Malcolm X Boulevard and Fifth Avenue in Harlem. It is a block in the other America, the America of the black underclass. It is a place -- and it could be in Chicago, Miami or Los Angeles -- with its own values, rules and economy. While the experts debate welfare reform, education and job training, generations live and die on this block, a world apart.
The world of 129th Street is increasingly violent and dispirited. The scrappers on this block -- the ones who call the police on drug dealers and who badger landlords for repairs -- say the old civil-rights remedies like affirmative action do little to improve lives hobbled by a multitude of ills. While the black middle class has expanded greatly in the last 30 years, a growing number of black people have also been trapped in seemingly intractable poverty.
It is a measure of the block's isolation that when a girl from 129th Street dressed for an interview for an office job recently, she chose a black evening sheath and wobbly high heels. Few on this block have steady jobs, creating a feeling of perpetual waiting. The hours are whiled away on stoops, basketball courts or in front of the TV.
Strivers like Robert Garland, who traveled four hours each day to attend a good city high school and is now in college, are seen by many as outsiders and face ridicule. His half-sister Nadine Allen, who became an unmarried mother at 19 and is unemployed, is the one who saunters down the street greeting friends. Ms. Allen, a former drug merchant, has her pick of suitors, but Mr. Garland was dateless on prom night. Even the sweetness of romance is brief on 129th Street, and marriages are rare. Up and down the block are women who say they have been "dogged" by men, a term for being treated badly. They talk about being raped, beaten and abandoned. Mothers complain of men who walk by their own children as if they were invisible. The men claim the women want them only for the material possessions they can provide.
Many people talk of getting high school equivalency diplomas and jobs and moving away, but the reality is that almost no one ever does. Some, like Mel and Dennis, have tasted financial success from drug dealing. These are usually short-lived episodes of lavish spending on clothes and recreation that end in violence or an arrest.
One constant is death, taking the young and old alike. Almost everyone on this block is related to someone who has been shot, is addicted to drugs or dying of AIDS. In the last five months, four young men from the block were shot; three of them died. Here, children talk about the kind of funerals they want in the way that young people in other neighborhoods plan proms.
Few on the block believe that the American dream exists for them. The lives that flicker across their television screens remind them of what they lack and what they desire.
In quiet moments, anger and disappointment can be heard.
"They say that 129th Street is a black hole," said Vikki, who is 26 and lives here with her younger cousins. Like many others interviewed she insisted on not using her last name. "If you are born here, you die here."
 
The Mother
A Fruitless Wait
For Skills or a Job
 On a recent day, Donna Williams sat with a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor that made her hands look especially small. She came to 129th Street four years ago, but she knows only two of her neighbors. The others scare her. She stays home, knitting and watching bootleg horror films as family members stop by.
At 40, Ms. Williams is tiny enough to wear her clothes from junior high school, but her eyes are ancient.
Ms. Williams's problems are multilayered. She never attended high school and has no marketable skills. She drinks every day but denies she is an alcoholic. Welfare caseworkers tell her otherwise. She has medication for depression, but tried to kill herself last year. She sees no connection between the children she started having at 15 and the life she has.
She believes life on 129th Street is every bit as horrifying as the movies she watches day after day about murderous ghosts and homicidal teen-agers.
"You see those kids on TV from Bosnia," Ms. Williams said, beginning to slur her words. "That's stupid. They eat better than our kids." Indeed, the block looks like a city after a war, with its vacant lots, abandoned buildings and four-to-seven-story dowager buildings of ornate ironwork, tiled hallways and marble stairways, long in decline.
 
A Job Goal Stymied
 Ms. Williams said she wants to get her high school equivalency diploma, get off welfare, and leave the city. But she said her goal of becoming a home-care attendant was derailed recently when her 17-year-old daughter had a baby after becoming pregnant on a camping trip for inner-city children.
Instead of increasing her welfare check -- because both her daughter and grandchild are her dependents -- she said the city mistakenly cut her payments and dropped her from a home-care training program. Her caseworker told her that a woman with a small child could not participate.
"They don't want me off assistance," Ms. Williams said, sounding bitter. "They want to keep you in a rut, keep you depressed."
Of her five children, ranging in age from 16 to 24, the three youngest live with her in the tidy apartment. The other day, her daughter Decima, 17, was back home with her 10-month-old son, Brennan.
They watched a film about giant man-eating ticks. Decima undid her long braids and argued with her mother about giving the baby medication for his teething. The temperature was in the 90's, but his grandmother warned Brennan away from the window.
"You know about these windows," she said, meaning the threat of stray bullets. Some children on the block have been wounded that way.
Born in Reading, Pa., to a mother who was a homemaker and a father who eventually left them, Ms. Williams left eighth grade to marry after she became pregnant. She eventually divorced her husband, a heroin addict who beat her. She found solace through liquor and making babies with other men.
"I look at my children and I know I gave something to the world," she said.
 
Talisman Against Despair
 Ms. Williams came to New York to live with her boyfriend, Bobby, and his mother. Bobby beat her, too, she said. When she obtained an order of protection against him, his mother evicted Ms. Williams and her children. When the city gave her the option of going to the projects or moving to a city-subsidized apartment on 129th Street, she ended up here.
Like talismans to ward off despair, almost every inch of her living room wall is covered with certificates and awards received by her or her children: perfect attendance by a sixth grader; the G.E.D. certificates of her son and daughter.
When Ms. Williams ran out of awards, she began plastering the walls with anything colorful, from a Met Life advertisement featuring Snoopy to one for Crayola washable crayons.
"I'm motivated," Ms. Williams insisted, as she watched a video whose opening scene was of a young black man killing two Korean store merchants. "But lately, motivated for what? I look out that window, and motivated for what? What went wrong?"
 
The Dealer
Teen-Ager Bears An Adult's Burden
 He sold drugs near Majester's Fish and Chips on the southeast corner of 129th Street. It is near a smoke shop where the old-timers congregate on folding steel chairs. Across the street are the beams of a church abandoned before completion and a boarded-up building where West Indian and African-American drug dealers worked different sides by mutual agreement.
At 13, this representative of the new generation of dealers has a face too immature to shave. He chews bubble gum and shows off his new roller skates.
"If you not white and your mom's got no money, what you going to do?" he said. "We got to eat now. Who would hire me? I was in the slow class at school, anyway."
His mother is a former crack addict who now drinks heavily. One day, she wandered by her son's corner. He cringed in embarrassment because she was wearing house slippers and a diaphanous dress that hung off her shoulders.
The young dealer cares for three younger brothers and sisters, getting them off to school in the morning, buying groceries and preparing meals. One morning, they shared a bag of Ruffles potato chips, washed down with Pepsi. He said he had never known anyone with a real job or anyone who went to college. When asked whether he might be able to go to college and better himself, he shook his head vigorously.
 
'You Have to Sell Your Soul'
 "I think everything is against the black man," he said, sounding like an imitation of the older men on the block. "You have to sell your soul to live with white people."
One day, as the dealer and some friends leaned against a car and puffed on a marijuana cigarette, someone shouted "Five-O," the code for the police. It comes from the television show "Hawaii Five-O." Someone flung the cigarette into a lot.
Three white officers jumped out of the car and patted down the group. They made them open the car trunk. They searched the ground and found a spent shell casing. It was a silent, hurried affair, ending with the officers speeding off.
"If you hadn't been here they would have beat us, called us niggers," one boy said to a visitor from outside the neighborhood.
The young dealer leaned against the car, shaking.
Sometime in the summer, he disappeared from the corner. There were rumors that he and his crew had lost their jobs after a shooting near their spot.
 
The Girlfriend
A Troubled Quest For Intimacy
 Sherri, 19, was pouting, and Mel-Mel, her 3-year-old son, was sobbing as they made their way across 129th Street. A woman Sherri knew had snubbed them, even though Mel-Mel kept waving and saying, "Hi." Sherri smacked him and jerked his arm.
"Have some pride," she said. "Don't be talking to nobody who don't talk to you."
Sherri is the former girlfriend of Mel, now in a wheelchair but once a successful drug dealer, and she is the mother of one of his two children. He treats her shabbily sometimes, she said, even though she has been supportive during his ordeals.
Children are valued here for the usual reasons, but also because they create an instant life for many women. With babies come a welfare check, a subsidized apartment, something to do with your time or a way to keep a man. Increasingly, though, the girls say their babies are accidental footnotes in a quest for intimacy.
Many men see their offspring as emblems of masculinity. Beyond the baby-making, things fall apart.
For a time, Sherri and Mel lived together as family. Sherri's mother was ill with complications from diabetes and 15-year-old Sherri was pregnant. After her mother died, Mel, on the run from the police, went back to selling drugs to pay for the burial.
Mel promised Sherri's mother before she died that he would take care of Sherri and their son. His own father was often in jail and used the family's food stamps for drugs. Sherri's father was absent. By all accounts, Mel has done better than either father, spending time and money to care for Mel-Mel.
But things quickly deteriorated for Sherri and Mel, too. The two 16-year-olds were overwhelmed by the responsibilities of adulthood. He chased girls. They came to blows and she called the police.
 
The Absence of Fathers
 The block is haunted by the ghosts of many a relationship. Men and women often seem to be at war. Many people grew up without fathers, most lack the money to support a family, and there is no pressure to marry.
Vikki, the legal guardian of her troubled younger cousins, had a boyfriend, George, who kept his address a secret. Vikki became pregnant by him but had an abortion. On one bad Monday in July, she was close to tears after learning that George had two other pregnant girlfriends.
Ms. Allen, one of Vikki's friends, said the father of her baby passes them on the street without speaking. Her goal is to marry a man "with a legal job."
Frances Weldon, the mother of Ms. Allen and Mr. Garland, said she was not surprised that many young people on the block believed in neither romance nor tenderness.
"If you grow up without it, how can you believe in it?" she said.
 
Brother and Sister
Siblings Share Dream of Escape
 Nadine Allen sat in her mother's bedroom and slowly dragged on a cigarette. The TV droned on, her son Dayvon lay kicking on the unmade bed, and ketchup spotted the linoleum floor. Ms. Allen was depressed and gaining weight. A high school dropout who had spent time in the drug trade, she was unemployed again and had no financial support from the father of her 1-year-old.
Ms. Allen, 20, is watching her friends die or sink into the muck of welfare and baby-making. Several weeks ago, she went to the wake for Liviro Bunch, a 22-year-old neighbor shot in a dispute that the police are still investigating. Memorial flowers decorated the block, looking incongruous among the garbage.
Mr. Bunch's murder increased Ms. Allen's desperation to escape 129th Street, but she has no clear idea of what to do.
The other day, Ms. Allen stood outside another funeral home and tears slid down her face. The service was for a 21-year-old childhood friend, Donald Bonaparte, shot in the head. As a tribute, some friends had written and planned to perform a rap called "Kill or Be Killed" but were talked out of it by one of the mothers.
"Things haven't really changed," Ms. Allen said of her prospects as a black woman. "If there was no racism there would be no 129th Street."
 
Planning to Be a Pilot
 Her brother, however, is on the cusp of escape. Robert Garland graduated from high school in June and went off to Alabama Aviation and Technical College on Labor Day. He plans to be an airline pilot, a dream he has clutched for years.
Mr. Garland traveled to August Martin High School in Queens each day for a special aviation program. When he was a sixth grader, his class was "adopted" by Marble Collegiate Church as part of the I Have A Dream Foundation program. The program, with its guidance and financial support, guaranteed a college education to any sixth grader who made it through high school.
By Mr. Garland's accounting, about 35 of the 84 "dreamers" made it. He knows that two died.
Mr. Garland has written off most of his peers on 129th Street. They say things to him like, "You read so much you got words coming out of your ears," he said.
"I'm different because I act different," Mr. Garland said. "Most of them, they want things now. They see the drug dealers with fancy clothes and cars."
Mr. Garland's mother left his father years ago because of his crack addiction. She never married Ms. Allen's father, her high-school sweetheart.
"What happened to my father taught me that you have to have a goal," Mr. Garland said. "You have to be determined, you have to want something different, something better."
In June, as Mr. Garland prepared for graduation, his sister quit her job at McDonald's. "It was too stressful," Ms. Allen said. "At the end of the week my paycheck was only $60. It wasn't worth it."
 
Easy Status Symbols
 Ms. Allen says she spent time in the drug trade to be "down," meaning to fit in. Like many children of 129th Street, she believed that her life would be transformed by things like sneakers, stereo equipment and gold jewelry. They are easy status symbols for those who know no other way to gain status.
"I needed money then," she said. "All the guys I associate with, what I see from them, if I stand on this corner I can make more money in a week than other people make in a month.
"I didn't have options like Shawn," Ms. Allen said. "It seemed the best opportunity for me."
She said many girls she knew got out of the house by having a baby and getting welfare and public housing.
"Everybody's having kids," she said. "They think that's the in thing to do. It's really to keep their boyfriends but it really pushes them farther away.
"The girls aren't looking for anything better," she continued. "They see themselves on 129th Street for the rest of their lives. A lot of these guys feel they're not going to live too long, so they want to leave something behind."
In some ways, Ms. Allen's is a soul corroded by what she sees. Mr. Garland stands apart and looks away. The mother urges on her son, but her voice is strained and wistful when calculating her daughter's chances.
Lately, Ms. Allen has considered going to Georgia to live with her maternal grandparents, reversing the trip her mother's family made decades ago when New York beckoned with promise.
"I have to leave," Ms. Allen said. "I have to leave or I'll die. There's nothing for me here."

HEADLINE: Treasury Had Doubts About Health Plan, Papers Show

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
From the first weeks of the Clinton Administration, Treasury officials expressed profound doubts about major parts of the President's plan to overhaul the nation's health care system, White House records made public today show.
Today, the Administration released 234 boxes of working papers of Hillary Rodham Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, after fighting for 18 months to keep the boxes, each containing about 2,500 pages, secret. 
 In the documents, economists warn that the President's plan had "fatal flaws" that could cause "real-world havoc" and "potential disasters" for the nation's health care system.
The papers were made public at a time of soul searching within the Administration about what went wrong with the President's campaign for universal health insurance. After rejecting several plans with that goal, Congress returns next week to take up more modest proposals.
The records of the task force show that Treasury officials anticipated almost all the criticism later aimed at Mr. Clinton's health plan, but that the White House brushed aside the concerns as relatively insignificant.
 
Concerns About Cost
 Harold M. Ickes, deputy chief of staff at the White House, said today that the records showed that Mr. Clinton's policy-making process was open to many points of view.
In the first half of 1993, Treasury officials often contended that Ira C. Magaziner, the coordinator of the task force, was making decisions without consulting Cabinet officers like Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. The officials expressed concern that Mr. Magaziner had neglected the explosive question of how to pay for universal health insurance.
On Feb. 17, 1993, James R. Ukockis, a senior economist at the Treasury Department, wrote that the work of the task force "has gone from frenetic to frantic" as the White House devised schemes to control health costs and health insurance premiums. On Feb. 23, Mr. Ukockis wrote that Mr. Magaziner "was not interested in a balanced evaluation" of price controls, but wanted "someone to make the best possible case for a specific price control program."
Then on March 23, Mr. Ukockis wrote, "Every option has fatal flaws, which, although passed off as problems 'still under examination,' are actually major roadblocks to successful implementation." He expressed concern that Secretary Bentsen would be "confronted by a fait accompli when he is finally brought into the health policy process" by Mr. Magaziner.
President Clinton did propose Federal regulation of health insurance premiums as a way to slow the growth of health spending. The proposal was denounced by doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and members of Congress from both parties, just as the Treasury had predicted.
 
Ridicule and 'Guesstimates'
 Another official, David M. Cutler from the staff of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, upset White House officials when he challenged major premises of the Clinton plan. He argued in August 1993 that the growth of health spending had not done significant damage to the growth of the nation's total economic output. Moreover, he wrote, "Total compensation as a share of gross domestic product has remained remarkably constant since 1947, even as health care spending has increased as a share of G.D.P."
President Clinton eventually proposed that employers pay most of the cost of health insurance for their employees. Mr. Cutler said in August 1993 that this proposal "will mandate an increase in employer spending much greater than ever previously legislated," and he declared that this "mandate is essentially a tax," contrary to the official position taken by the White House.
Paul Starr, a Princeton professor who was in charge of a panel drafting proposals for short-term cost controls, complained a few days later that Mr. Cutler's analysis seemed to "downplay the importance of the problems we are trying to address."
In April 1993, Treasury officials ridiculed the reliability of estimates of savings to be achieved from the Clinton plan.
In response to a request from the Council of Economic Advisers, Administration officials "sat around the table making guesstimates of the savings to be realized" from various cost-control proposals, according to one Treasury memorandum. It concluded, "It was an appropriate exercise for April Fool's Day."
 
A Strategy Backfires
 Experts from the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis protested Mr. Magaziner's decision to bring in experts from private industry to audit their revenue estimates.
"This outside review process is without precedent," wrote Janet Holtzblatt of the Treasury. "The audit group does not contain individuals with the experience to evaluate the work of the Office of Tax Analysis. It consists of eight members, seven actuaries and one health economist. All eight are employed by private industries with an interest in health reform and tax policy."
Just two weeks after Mr. Clinton took office, Professor Starr suggested that the President ask Congress for "standby authority to control health care prices." But in a memorandum to Mr. Magaziner, Mr. Starr wrote, "It is better for the exact method and span of controls to be left ambiguous, as this allows interest groups to imagine the worst."
This strategy backfired, White House House officials say. Drug companies, insurers and others in the health care industry were so alarmed at the talk of price controls that they organized a campaign to attack the Clinton plan before its details were set.
Mr. Ukockis wrote that Mr. Magaziner's insistence on price controls "may be a brilliant strategy, but it may also be reckless." He told the White House that "Treasury personnel are not to take part in formulating or advocating a price control proposal until Secretary Bentsen specifically approves of such activity."

HEADLINE: U.S., Despite Critics, Is to Expand Taiwan Ties

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Completing a policy review of how to treat one of Asia's emerging economic powers, the Clinton Administration announced today that it would expand official ties with Taiwan, while continuing not to recognize it as a country separate from China.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers quickly attacked this split-the-difference policy adjustment as not treating Taiwan with due respect, and the Government of this island of 20 million said the new policy fell short of what was needed. 
 The new policy is intended to accord more respect to Taiwan, in light of its important economic ties with the United States -- all without offending China, which insists that the United States not treat Taiwan as a full-fledged nation.
"Our fundamental one-China policy will be continued," said a State Department official who chose not to be identified. "The United States is committed to maintaining unofficial commercial, cultural and other contacts with the people of Taiwan."
Taiwan welcomed the revised policy today, but said it had not "sufficiently addressed the needs arising from the close relationship" of the United States and Taiwan.
Under the results of the policy review, the United States will not support Taiwan's entry into the United Nations or any other institution in which membership is open only to independent countries.
But the United States will support Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world trade organization.
According to the new policy, American officials, including some senior officials, will be able to have contacts with Taiwanese officials and visit Taiwan -- something that Administrations have shied away from.
The senior official who outlined the new policy said the top leadership of the United States would not visit Taiwan, and Washington would not permit visits by Taiwan's top leaders.
Last May, President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan was not permitted to leave his airplane during a refueling stop in Hawaii on his way to Central America. That move angered many members of Congress, who later invited Mr. Lee to visit their districts. The official said President Lee would now be able to leave his airplane.
President Lee was also barred from attending alumni reunions at Cornell University. A senior official said that under the revised policy, it would still be inappropriate for Mr. Lee to attend such reunions.
Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, belittled the policy adjustments as "small steps."
"We continue to give Taiwan the cold shoulder," he said. "Taiwan has a multiparty system, free elections and a free press -- the things we profess to champion -- while we continue to cuddle up to the mainland government, whose dictatorship permits none of these."
Under the revised policy, Washington will continue to provide military material and training to help Taiwan defend itself.
Under the new policy the name of Taiwan's official office in the United States will be changed to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States. At present, the office's name -- the Coordination Council for North American Affairs -- does not even identify it as an organ of Taiwan.

In Harlem, 129th Street between Malcolm X Boulevard and Fifth Avenue is a block in the America of the black underclass -- a block that could be in Chicago, Miami or Los Angeles. It has its own values, rules and economy. Even as the nation engages in a spirited dialogue on issues like welfare reform, education and job training, places like 129th Street exist as a world apart. The scrappers on the block -- the ones who call the police on drug dealers and badger landlords for repairs -- say the old civil-rights remedies like affirmative action do little to improve lives hobbled by a multitude of ills.

HEADLINE: Peace in a Northern Ireland Factory

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Patrick R. Dougan's office at the Mackie International factory sits astride the peace line, the wall -- imaginary in some spots, quite real in others -- that divides the Protestant and Roman Catholic neighborhoods of West Belfast.
"If you look over there to the left, you can see houses flying tricolors," Mr. Dougan said as he pointed out the window, referring to the Irish flag, a symbol of the Catholic minority's demands for a British withdrawal from the province. "Over there to the right, you can see Union Jacks." 
 At Mackie, no flags fly at all. They would not, said Mr. Dougan, the company's chairman and owner, be a good idea at the plant, once a bastion of Protestant employment and now the site of one of the more ambitious efforts to desegregate Northern Ireland's economy.
Of the 400 workers at the plant, which makes machinery for the textile industry, 29 percent are Catholic, up from 11 percent in 1991, when Mr. Dougan took over. Catholics make up about 42 percent of Northern Ireland's population of 1.6 million.
For Mr. Dougan, a wealthy Catholic entrepreneur, who was viewed with deep suspicion by Mackie's work force when he was recruited by the Government three years ago to revive the ailing company after the previous American owners filed for bankruptcy, the opportunity to hire more Catholics has been a byproduct of his success in stabilizing and then expanding Mackie International.
Relations on the shop floor have generally been harmonious, workers said, and Mackie is profitable again.
But even now, as the peace process in Northern Ireland gains momentum, Protestants arrive to work each morning through a gate adjacent to their neighborhood and the Catholics at a separate gate near their homes.
"I frankly don't see that wall coming down anytime soon," Mr. Dougan said. "But we have a gospel to preach, that it is possible to be successful right here on the battlefield, the erstwhile battlefield I hope, when people want to work together and get on with their lives."
Workplace integration in Northern Ireland is a huge task, given the province's deep-rooted patterns of segregation and employment discrimination, primarily against Catholics, and the enduring enmity between the two communities. Even putting history aside, male unemployment in the neighborhoods visible from Mr. Dougan's window runs as high as 60 percent, spawning levels of poverty, disillusionment and resentment that have made the area the primary recruiting ground for the terrorist forces on both sides.
Such integration is also a subject watched with great interest among American supporters of Northern Ireland's Catholics. New York City's municipal pension fund and other public pension funds are among the investors that subscribe to guidelines known as the MacBride Principles. The principles, which were named after an Irish politician, Sean MacBride, include a call for selling the stock of American companies operating in Northern Ireland that are shown to discriminate against Catholics. American companies account for about 10,000 jobs in Northern Ireland, or less than 2 percent of the total.
With Northern Ireland enjoying its best chance for peace in 25 years, Government officials and business leaders said they saw great opportunities to breathe new life into the economy, create jobs and redress the imbalances of the past while providing hope to both sides.
By some indicators, Northern Ireland has a long way to go. Catholic males, with a jobless rate estimated at 28 percent, are more than twice as likely to be jobless as Protestant males, who have an unemployment rate around 13 percent. With the economy still feeling the effects of recession, few industries are hiring new workers, making it hard to provide opportunities to Catholics.
At many of the biggest industrial employers, a combination of prejudice, fear and economic difficulty has left Catholics badly underrepresented. Of the 2,000 employees at Harland & Wolff, the shipyard that is Belfast's largest employer, only 5 percent last year were Catholic. With the company struggling to avoid further job cuts, the prospects for hiring more Catholics there are dim.
By the same token, there are employers with predominantly Catholic work forces who are having as much trouble hiring Protestants. Despite efforts to step up recruitment, the Sean Quinn Group, a cement manufacturer near Fermanagh, had only six Protestants among its 280 employees last year.
Although there is a growing Catholic middle class, in inner-city ghettos many Catholic families are enduring their second or even third generation of male unemployment. Skill and educational levels are low among those Catholics. Even when jobs in Protestant companies are available to Catholics, they are often passed up out of fear of violence. Catholic workers are a primary target of Protestant paramilitary forces.
Still, there has been measurable progress over the last few years in reversing discrimination. Catholics held 36.6 percent of all jobs last year, up from 34.9 percent in 1990, according to the Fair Employment Commission, the British agency that enforces a tough antidiscrimination law enacted in 1989.
"We're heading in the right direction, and the pace of change could accelerate very substantially if we were to have peace," said Robert G. Cooper, the panel's chairman. "You'd hope to see an expansion of the economy. And you would not have the enormous chill factor, the reluctance and fear on the part of many workers to go to jobs in particular areas."
The textile industry has a long history in Northern Ireland, and Mackie, which was founded in the mid-19th century and makes machines that prepare and spin fibers for textile companies, has suffered badly along with the rest of the industry over the last several decades. Employment at the company dwindled from the thousands down to 270 in 1991.
Mackie had been acquired in the mid-1980's by an American company, Lummus Industries of Georgia, but after Lummus went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1992, threatening Mackie's already precarious chances of survival, Mr. Dougan agreed to buy the company, with the price being the assumption of its $21 million in debt.
Mr. Dougan, who has turned around other companies, expanded Mackie's sales force, pushing into Asian markets, for example. He diversified into environmental services. And with some help from the gradual world economic recovery, Mackie's sales this year will be about $30 million, up from $9 million in 1991. The company should record a $3 million profit this year after a long period of losses, Mr. Dougan said.
Later this month, Mr. Dougan will take Mackie public through a $16.5 million share offering on the London Stock Exchange. The proceeds will go to debt repayment and modernizing machinery.
As he has added more than 100 new jobs over the last few years, Mr. Dougan said, he has recruited actively among Catholics, but never hired workers just because they were Catholic. He praised his Protestant work force for what he called its strong work ethic and reliability.
The biggest problem, he said, is finding skilled Catholic workers, who are in short supply. Many of the Catholics he has hired have been recently trained in jobs like welding, rather than in more highly skilled fields like machine-tool operations.
Catholics from nearby neighborhoods used to throw rocks at Protestant workers as they went in and out of the plant. But now, as the Catholic proportion in Mackie's work force grows, workers on both sides said they get along well, and that at least within the walls of the factory no one focuses on religion.
"You can't change the balance overnight, because you've got to hire the people who can do the kind of work we do," said Paddy Auld, a plant supervisor, who is Catholic. "If we don't get the proper people in, then the company can't survive, and one thing that people in all sections of the community are finding out is that if you lose your job, it doesn't matter what religion you are."

HEADLINE: VATICAN HOLDS UP ABORTION DEBATE AT TALKS IN CAIRO

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 7

 BODY:
In an unexpected maneuver today that angered many participants in the United Nations population conference, the Vatican was able to to put off for two more days any debate over how to deal with abortion in a plan to stabilize world population in the coming decades.
The Vatican move, apparently supported by several small countries that did not enter the debate until today, in effect reopened a discussion on the language of one paragraph of a 113-page document and sent it back to a committee until Friday. The action brought sharp condemnation from Egypt, the conference host, and sent delegates from a number of nations into private meetings to try to find a way to force the issue back onto the conference floor over the Vatican's objections. 
 At issue is paragraph 8.25 -- a number that is taking on symbolic importance here -- an already much-diluted section that deals with abortion. The Vatican insists that all references to abortion and other language that might imply that it is acceptable as a method of family planning be removed from the plan of action. Because the United Nations conference operates by consensus, a minority objection to the disputed passage was enough of an obstacle to send the issue back to a committee.
Most delegations, including the one representing the United States, expect the Vatican will refuse to sign the agreement, the same position it took at the population conferences in 1974 and 1984. Many delegates here believe that in the end the Vatican's team will have to step back and allow a consensus to carry the document, with reservations appended by the Holy See.
"Does the Vatican rule the world?" asked Egypt's Population Minister, Maher Mahran, speaking at a news conference shortly after this morning's discussion was derailed by new objections from a group of small nations, most of them Latin American. "We respect the Vatican. We respect the Pope. But if they are not going to negotiate, why did they come?"
Several reasons have been suggested for the Vatican's action: Some believe it is still possible to force some changes in the language, while others say the Vatican merely wants to prolong the debate to draw attention to its objections and possibly generate more support. But this did not seem to be happening today.
The Vatican's willingness to delay an international forum in order to make a point on abortion has isolated it from several large Islamic nations where it might have expected to find some support, including Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan as well as Egypt. That left only a few independent conservative voices, including Afghanistan, in opposition on the margins of the Conference on Population and Development, which is scheduled to end on Tuesday.
 
Anti-Abortion Groups Active
 At the same time, anti-abortion groups and Islamic militants have stepped up psychological pressure on those attending the conference by displaying graphic illustrations of fetuses or monopolizing microphones at news conferences and seminars, participants reported.
On its side, the Vatican today reiterated its concerns about the direction the conference was taking in an address by Archbishop Renato R. Martino, the delegate of the Holy See to the United Nations. Archbishop Martino not only condemned abortion and contraception but also sought to ally the Vatican with third world demands for more equitable sharing of global wealth and technology.
He drew a connection between "permissiveness" and the abuse of women, and suggested that many family planning programs were coercive and harmful.
After the abortion paragraph was sent back to a committee, the conference went on today to approve other chapters of the action plan, including two on internal and international migrations and their relation to the population question.
The Vatican's actions provoked questions that extended beyond the current conference to forthcoming United Nations meetings on social and economic topics, including a gathering on the role of women, which is scheduled for next September in Beijing. The questions came from a range of nongovernmental groups who say they are closer to the populations of Roman Catholic countries than the Vatican is.
 
Dissenting Catholic View
 "How come this is the only religion with a permanent observer seat at the U.N.?" Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, asked today at a news conference. "How come we don't finally stand up and say we're not talking about abortion? We're not talking about family planning. We're talking about the role of women in church and state."
Timothy E. Wirth, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs and leader of the United States Delegation, told reporters tonight that this was "a time of respectful disagreement."
He acknowledged that the Americans believed on Tuesday night that the conference was close to an accord on a paragraph that dealt with the dangers of unsafe abortions as a public health matter. Agreement on that paragraph is holding up consideration of other sections of the Conference on Population and Development's action plan still in dispute.
 
A Dozen Nations Object
 Rachel Kyte, political analyst for the International Women's Health Coalition, a New York-based organization that assists women's health groups and clinics worldwide, said that when the conference resumed its meeting on the text this morning, expecting to cement the consensus achieved last night, more than a dozen countries that had not spoken on Tuesday raised objections. Among them were Argentina, Ecuador, Honduras, Guatemala and Malta, as well as Guam, a United States territory, according to people close to official delegations. Reporters are barred from the debates.
The issue had to be referred to a special committee charged with reporting back by Friday morning.
"These Latin American nations are trying to make the Vatican happy," said Miguel Trias, head of Colombia's largest, government-backed family planning organization, Profamilia. "But in 2,000 years the Vatican has never been happy."
Alexander C. Sanger, president of Planned Parenthood of New York City, said in an interview that the divergent views of the Vatican and nongovernmental groups from Catholic nations, some of which have seats on official delegations, demonstrated a split between the Vatican hierarchy and millions of lay Catholics.
"There are two churches," he said, "one where the hierarchy talks to the presidents of countries, and then there's the church of the people. The people are picking and choosing what parts of Catholicism they want to carry over to their personal lives."
Britain's Minister for Overseas Development, Lady Chalker, told reporters today that if the Vatican negotiators did not want to wreck the conference, "they should enter their reservations now." For Norway, Sweden and Germany, delegates said, the conference had already gone too far in diluting language in order to lure the Vatican into a consensus.

Chart: "THE POPULATION CONFERENCE: Obstacle to the Accord"
 The controversial paragraph 8.25 as it went back to a special committee at the United Nations Population Conference in Cairo yesterday.
 In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning. All governmental and nongovernmental organizations are urged to strengthen their commitment to women's health, unsafe abortion as a major public health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved family planning services. Women who have unwanted pregnancies should have ready access to reliable information and compassionate couseling.
 Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority, and all attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion. In circumstances in which abortion is legal, such abortion should be safe. Any measures or changes related to abortion within ght health system can only be determined at the national or local level according to the national legislative process. In all cases, women should have access to quality services for the management of complications arising from abortion. Post-abortion family planning services should be offered promptly, which will also help to avoid repeat abortions.

HEADLINE: Affluent Europe's Plight: Graying

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 7

 BODY:
For most of those attending the population conference here, the question is simple to put, if baffling to answer: What do you do when your land has too many people, especially young people?
But what do you if your land has too few young people, a riddle that confronts the low-birth-rate countries of Western Europe, Italy in particular, where the population has actually begun to shrink and where ever-smaller family sizes and the aging of society mean that, in a few years' time, there will only be one person of working age for every two retirees demanding a pension. 
 The question might seem idiosyncratic in light of the cataclysmic issues of overpopulation and underdevelopment that have torn the social and economic fabrics of many third world countries and that provide the most obvious challenge at the United Nations Conference on Population and Development here.
But, in parts of the rich, developed world, the decline in birth rates also ties in with other, potentially explosive issues, notably migration from the poor south, that is coming increasingly to preoccupy Western Europe -- and even the United States as it faces waves of Cuban and Haitian fugitives in addition to the flow of job seekers from Mexico and elsewhere.
 
More Old Than Young
 "Migration is a global phenomenon that can no longer be left to the spontaneity of market demands or to the convenience of individual nations," Family Minister Antonio Guidi of Italy told the conference, at which his country occupies a peculiar position.
"In 1994," Mr. Guidi said in his address today, "Italy became the first country in the world with more people over the age of 65 than young people under the age of 15."
Not only that, according to statistics released earlier this year by the authoritative Istat research organization, the number of Italians -- currently 57 million -- actually shrank by 5,265 in 1993.
With the average Italian birth rate a statistical 1.21 -- the lowest figure of its kind in the world -- the nation's fertility is "much less than what is required for replacement" of the dead, said Joseph Grindlat, of the United Nations Population Division here.
 
The Perils of Affluence
 The story of how that happened and what it will mean is one that ties the fortunes of wealthy Italy to its poorer neighbors across the Mediterranean to the south -- a tale of the perils of affluence.
After the World War II, as elsewhere in Europe and America, a baby boom swelled populations, but, in Italy in particular, postwar industrialization and rapid economic growth brought other worries. People moved to the cities and housing became more scarce and more expensive. More and more women took jobs to meet the mounting costs, and wealth nurtured a consumer society.
"What attracts a couple less is to give life," said Msgr. Ersilio Tonini, a priest in the Italian city of Ravenna. An economist, Alessandra Nannei, said: "Over the past 15 years, maternity and homemaking have been stripped of value. Bringing up children is a tough job, but it no longer has society's full recognition."
 
Couples Live With Parents
 The creation of a wealthy, urbanized society, moreover, brought its own problems. Housing is so expensive and scarce that many young Italian couples do not have the money to rent a family-sized apartment and live with their parents for years until they can afford a place of their own.
Recent statistics have shown that a baby in Italy adds at least $200 to monthly family expenditures in clothes and food between the ages of 1 and 6; keeping teen-agers home works out at $600 a month.
Such considerations have evidently persuaded many Italians against having large families. The country's abortion laws are the most liberal in western Europe, permitting abortion on demand in the first three months of pregnancy. According to official statistics, the number of legal abortions per year in Italy fell from 234,800 to 155,200 between 1982 and 1992.
 
'Have to Have Immigrants'
 But the demographic changes have produced other strains. As people live longer, they need to draw on Italy's generous pension and social benefits, even as the number of people paying the taxes to finance such programs diminishes.
And as young people receive more widespread education, they start work later in life and choose the jobs they want to do more carefully.
"These days you have Egyptian cooks and Filipino maids," said a Government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "There are certain jobs Italians won't do anymore. That means that, as Italians get fewer, we have to have immigrants."
The problem is common to many Western European countries. Germany, its Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said at the conference the other day, is home to 7 million foreigners among its 81 million people -- a population that, United Nations and other demographers say, will begin to shrink after the year 2000.
At the same time, population growth rates in North Africa and elsewhere in the third world, coupled with faltering economic growth, mean that developing countries will produce an ever larger number of people who cannot find jobs in their own countries and who look to migration to Western Europe to save them.
In Italy, home to over one million foreigners, the pressure for migration plays into a tense political landscape. Neo-Fascists in the coalition Government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi argue for tighter immigration controls, ostensibly to avert a wave of racism among Italians fearing that jobs could be taken away by foreigners. In France, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has made political capital out of harsher immigration controls. Germany has been increasingly troubled by a wave of neo-Nazi xenophobia preying on Turkish migrants and other foreigners.
All that combines as a hazardous mix, as the United Nations conference here has acknowledged.
"International migration entails the loss of human resources for many countries of origin," says the conference's draft program of action, "and may give rise to political, economic or social tensions in countries of destination."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Official Says Germany Could Cut Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against other leading currencies yesterday after a Bundesbank official said the central bank had room to cut interest rates.
Many traders bought dollars for marks after a Bundesbank council member, Hans-Jurgen Krupp, said he could "see room for rate reductions despite good economic progress." His comments appeared in an interview with The European newspaper, which was released to news services before its publication tomorrow. Lower German rates could help the dollar gain against the mark by making deposits in Germany less attractive. 
 "Krupp's comments gave the dollar a pop," said Matt Porio, a trader at Chase Manhattan Bank. "He caught the market off guard because many people think European rates are bottoming."
The dollar rose as high as 1.5543 marks yesterday after Mr. Krupp's comments were reported. It settled at 1.5507 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.5425 marks on Tuesday.
 
Rise Was Expected
 After Sweden and Italy raised interest rates in August, many traders and analysts concluded that European rates were poised to rise, ending a two-year decline. That view became more widespread after France's biggest commercial banks raised lending rates later in the month.
The Bundesbank left its own rates unchanged at a meeting on monetary policy last Thursday. The German discount rate on loans to banks is 4.5 percent, compared with 4 percent in the United States.
The dollar rose against the yen as traders waited to see if negotiators would make progress this week in talks aimed at shrinking Japan's trade surplus. The dollar rose to 99.45 yen yesterday from 98.66 yen on Tuesday.
The dollar held onto most of the day's gains after the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said he expected no breakthrough in this week's talks. Mr. Kantor also said a Sept. 30 deadline for making progress was a "long way away as we sit here on the seventh."
"I thought Kantor's comments showed cautious optimism about the negotiations," said Bob Lynch, currency analyst at MMS International, a market-analysis firm. Mr. Lynch and other analysts expect the dollar to trade in a narrow range against the yen until the Sept. 30 deadline, rising and falling with prospects for progress in the talks.
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 5.3120 French francs, up from 5.2922 francs on Tuesday; at 1.2963 Swiss francs, up from 1.2940 Swiss francs, and at 1,577 Italian lire, up from 1,573.50 lire. The British pound fell to $1.5448 from $1.5524.

HEADLINE: Rowland Pledges an End To the State's Income Tax

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Sept. 7

 BODY:
The leading Republican candidate for governor, John G. Rowland, pledged today that he would eliminate Connecticut's personal income tax over the next five years and reduce the state's business and inheritance taxes without raising other taxes to take their place.
"We're not going to be increasing any of the other taxes," Mr. Rowland said during a television debate here with his opponent in next Tuesday's Republican primary, Secretary of the State Pauline R. Kezer. "We can cut enough spending." 
 But the key to his plan, he said, is his expectation that the state's economy will improve, generating more revenue from the remaining taxes, once state spending is slashed to make Connecticut more attractive to businesses.
"Is it credible to say that the income tax can disappear?" Mrs. Kezer said. She challenged Mr. Rowland to say how he would cut the state's $9.45 billion budget to make up for $2.8 billion in income-tax revenue. "I know a lot of people like to hear that, John, but I don't think it's believable to say that you can do that.
"To say that you can cut almost $3 billion out of this budget without showing us where those cuts are is just incredible."
 
Emulating Others
 Both candidates, however, agree that cutting taxes is essential, and both say they are emulating tax-cutting Republican governors in other states, especially Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey.
The income tax, state spending and their effect on Connecticut's struggling economy took up much of the hourlong debate, which will be broadcast by WVIT-TV, Channel 30, on Sunday at 11 A.M. Later today, a crusader against the income tax, former State Senator Tom Scott, announced that he would be an independent candidate in the general election and pledged to eliminate the tax.
In 1990, Mr. Rowland, a Congressman from Waterbury, pledged not to raise taxes during a race he narrowly lost to Lowell P. Weicker Jr. Mr. Weicker pushed an income tax through the General Assembly to close a billion-dollar budget gap.
Mr. Rowland now says he has a five-year plan to eliminate the tax, but has not released details. Today, he said only that he would rely on attrition in the state work force, the consolidation of agencies, changes to welfare programs and cost-saving measures he has proposed for prisons, including the transfer of inmates to prisons out of state.
 
Of Pain and Suffering
 "There'll be pain, there's no question," Mr. Rowland said of budget cuts. "It will probably be across the board. But speaking of pain, it's been the people of the state who have suffered over the last three to four years. People who have lost jobs, people who lost income, people who have left the state."
"It's a question of how much they want from state government," he said. "That's the key philosophical debate in this campaign. Many of the Democrats have said we need more programs, we need more spending, we need to do more things for more people. I think we need to do just the opposite. We need to take care of basic necessities."
Mrs. Kezer has proposed cutting the state budget by 10 percent, or more than $900 million, in her first two years, and using the savings to cut the income tax.
Asked where she would find $900 million in budget cuts, Mrs. Kezer said it would "come out of government excess." As much as $100 million a year, she said, would result from not filling the 2,000 state jobs that become vacant each year. State offices have too many managers and too many job classifications, she said, and she would work with employee unions to reorganize departments.
 
Support for a Casino
 The state's bonded debt can also be reduced, she said, and she, too, would change welfare programs, limiting recipients to two years of benefits.
Both Mrs. Kezer and Mr. Rowland said they would favor another gambling casino in Connecticut, which already has one casino operated by the Mashantucket Pequots and a second to be operated by the Mohegan Indians, if it was approved in a referendum of residents where the casino would be situated.
Mrs. Kezer said any new casino would also have to make up for revenue the state would lose from existing compacts with the Mashantucket Pequots and Mohegans. Under those compacts, the tribes will pay the state $160 million a year only if there are no non-Indian casinos approved.
She said she opposes using Bridgeport's harbor, the site of competing proposals from several casino operators, because it would serve the state better to develop the port and increase exports.
Mr. Rowland said he would insist that a Bridgeport casino provide jobs to Bridgeport residents. And for the first time, he said that he does not favor Donald Trump's proposal for an amusement park on the harbor.

Prices of Treasuries Fall On New Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities closed above their lows of the session yesterday but still fell modestly as traders reacted to higher commodity prices and a Government report that labor costs rose in the second quarter.
Both reports fanned investors' fears about inflation, but the concern was partly offset by a steady dollar in the currency markets. 
 The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity futures, considered a leading indicator of inflation, climbed more than a point to 234.23, propelled by rises in energy and precious metals.
The 30-year bond fell 11/32 , to a price of 999/32 for a yield of 7.56 percent, up from 7.54 percent on Tuesday.
 
Dollar Is Steady
 The steady dollar offered bonds some fragile support, keeping prices from sinking deeper as investors and dealers awaited news of trade negotiations with Japan. Traders noted that the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor cautioned not to expect any breakthrough at the meeting in Los Angeles this weekend.
Wholesale inventories rose a stronger-than-expected eight-tenths of a percent in July. Sales unexpectedly fell four-tenths of a percent, but traders said that report was less important than the Labor Department's report that labor costs rose a revised 3.4 percent in the second quarter, and that productivity fell by the largest amount in five years, 2.5 percent. Lower productivity makes goods more expensive to produce, and is thus a harbinger of inflation.
Yesterday a monthly tally of layoff annnouncements compiled by Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed a total of 46,000 in August, up from 19,000 in July, and the highest since 49,000 in March. The monthly average through the first eight months of 1994 stood at 46,000, little different from the 50,000 monthly average during the similar period a year ago.
The layoffs showed a continuing pattern of company cutbacks, despite the pickup in new hiring this year. Through August, the communications sector, notably the Baby Bells, and the aerospace industry have announced the most layoffs, the report noted.
 
Rate Cut Not Seen
 Michael R. Englund, chief economist for MMS International, a market and research analysis firm, said the market was not expecting any change in Federal Reserve Board policy at this month's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Sept. 27. In fact, he sees little likelihood of any change before the November meeting.
"I think the market's main themes here are that the P.P.I. and C.P.I. numbers may be worse than anticipated, with energy expected to boost both to four-tenths of a percent over all and three-tenths of a percent at the core," Mr. Englund said, referring to the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index. Still, he predicted that Treasuries would stay in line for the rest of the month because the market did not expect the central bank to move on short-term interest rates this month.
Analysts noted that the strong auto sales reported on Tuesday could add a little punch to approaching inflation reports, suggesting that the perception of a slowing economy might be overdone. "One theme we're seeing is that the inventory data for July have been quite strong, and August should be another big number because of vehicle assemblies being strong," Mr. Englund said. "This is also a positive for the econony, suggesting that second-quarter inventory buildup can be sustained."
Among government agency issues priced yesterday was a $700 million offering by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae.
The 10-year debentures, being sold through various securities dealers, have a 7.85 percent coupon and are priced at 99.859 to yield 7.87 percent. According to Fannie Mae, the debentures are callable on or after Sept. 10, 1999, and are priced to yield about 59.6 basis points over Treasury securities with a comparable maturity.
In the municipal bond market, in the week's largest scheduled deal, the Industrial Development Authority of Lehigh County, Pa., sold $115.5 million of revenue bonds due 2029 for the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company through CS First Boston.
Rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's because of insurance coverage, the issue was priced to yield 6.4 percent.

A study says global warming may help U.S. agriculture.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
REMEMBER global warming? For the policy wonks, that was yesterday's worry; they have moved on to nuclear proliferation, ethnic slaughter and the reliability of DNA tests in identifying O. J. Simpson's blood.
But the near-consensus that civilization is playing high-stakes games with Mother Nature has not changed since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Nor has Washington's belated commitment to reduce the emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, to 1990 levels by the year 2000. 
 Yet the results of the newest and, probably, the most careful analysis of the effects of climatic warming suggest that the fear of greenhouse gases decimating American agriculture may no longer be well founded. The study concludes that on balance, global warming will likely benefit American agriculture. And, if that is the case, finding the political support for paying to combat global warming may not be easy.
Greenhouse gases -- gases that trap solar heat -- lead to higher average temperatures and, on average, more rain because of increased evaporation from the oceans. And while the infant science of climate change will no doubt come up with some surprises, it does look as if the planet is heading for hotter times with radically altered patterns of rainfall.
Some places, including good chunks of Canada and Russia where growing seasons are perilously short, would undoubtedly find the change refreshing. But the handful of detailed economic studies done in the last several years suggested that American farmers would come out as big losers.
Some studies suggested that a doubling of atmospheric carbon would generate enough temperature change and rain at the wrong time to cause American crop losses on the order of $20 billion annually. "The specter of global warming calls up the vistas of corn blistering on the stalk," write the authors of the new contrarian analysis -- Robert Mendelsohn and William Nordhaus of Yale University and Daigee Shaw of the Institute of Economics in Taipei, Taiwan.
The trio's new assessment, to be published this month in The American Economic Review, is based on heavy-duty number-crunching of climate and soil data from 3,000 counties across the United States. But the underlying economics that drives their revisionist analysis is straightforward.
Earlier studies, they note, were all based on "dumb farmer" assumptions, in which the hewers and tillers, despite climate changes, kept doing whatever they had been doing. But that is not how farmers with access to technology and capital behave when production costs change. They adjust by changing seeds, fertilizers, growing techniques and even crops.
It may not be possible to simulate these adjustments directly, but the three economists offer a clever alternative. They have used their data on rain, temperature, soils and the crops that grow best under differing conditions to isolate the statistical impact of weather on agricultural productivity. This has enabled them to determine not only the impact of temperature and rainfall on crop yields but also the impact of changing from one crop to another under pressure from climatic change.
A uniform increase of 5 degrees Fahrenheit and a rise of 8 percent in precipitation -- the ballpark impact from a doubling of atmospheric carbon -- generate surprisingly modest changes in agricultural productivity, they found. Indeed, if the county data are weighted by the value of crops rather than just total acreage, global warming produces more winners in the United States than losers.
The key to understanding what is going on here, the three economists suggest, is the fact that climate-sensitive corn and wheat crops from the Plains states rarely account for more than a fifth of the value of America's farm output. And, more importantly, global warming appears to be good for fruits, vegetables, cotton and rice, which generally do better in warmer weather and are grown so densely that irrigation can economically offset variations in rainfall.
"These results do not amount to a declaration of war against tree huggers," noted Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. Uncontrolled climate change, he said, could still make a mess of lots of places and people. It might also increase the risk of catastrophe to levels that wake everybody up: Imagine a world with once-a-century floods or hurricanes happening once or twice a year. And even where it does not reduce economic output, global warming could radically change the pace and direction of plant and wildlife evolution.
But the study should serve as a warning not to assume popular support for this cause. For unlike dirty water and air that cause disease, or unrestricted hunting that decimates species that are good to eat or nice to cuddle, global warming will not automatically cause problems that unite people to fight it.
"It may take some fancy political footwork," Mr. Hahn predicted, "to sustain a consensus once the costs really begin to bite."

HEADLINE: ADVANCE IN TRADE MADE WITH JAPAN

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
American and Japanese trade officials said today that they were making progress toward agreements to open Japan's controlled markets in insurance and government purchasing.
But they said that talks on getting Japan to buy more American cars and auto parts were still deadlocked and that no accord was likely anytime soon. 
 Both American and Japanese officials emphasize that they still have much work to do to close the deals on insurance and Japanese Government procurement -- particularly procurement of telecommunications equipment by Japan's state-owned phone monopoly.
But if Washington and Tokyo are able to close those deals in the next few weeks, it appears increasingly likely that they will declare victory in those two areas and break them off from the auto negotiations, which would continue on a separate track for as long as it might take to reach an accord, if ever.
While any market-opening agreements with Japan would be good news for the Clinton Administration, the fact is that two-thirds of Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States comes from its vastly superior sales of autos and auto parts in this country, as compared with American sales in Japan.
If no agreements can be struck on insurance and procurements, or if only partial agreements are struck, then President Clinton could find himself faced with an unpleasant choice between his political credibility and the dollar's credibility.
The reason is that the Administration has set Sept. 30 as the deadline for Japan to make satisfactory progress in these trade negotiations; otherwise, Washington would initiate trade sanctions.
If President Clinton does not move to impose at least some sanctions on Sept. 30, he will appear to be backing down on his Administration's oft-repeated trade threat. With midterm elections looming in November, that could be politically damaging -- particularly since the Administration's private polls show its get-tough approach with Japan to be among its most popular foreign policy initiatives.
If the President does move to impose sanctions, it could set off another plunge of the dollar, as traders once again assume that the Administration's only tool for dealing with the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States is devaluing the American currency against the Japanese yen.
A weaker dollar might cut the trade deficit by making Japanese imports more expensive in the United States and American exports cheaper in Japan.
The Clinton Administration has already drawn up a list of imports from Japan on which it would impose punitive tariffs, under both the Super 301 and Title VII trade laws, should no deals emerge by the end of this month.
Japanese officials have told American reporters in recent days that they would either break off all negotiations with the United States if it imposes sanctions or take the United States before a tribunal of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
At the same time, the Japanese officials warned that other Asian countries with trade surpluses with the United States would not look kindly on Washington's resorting to sanctions, especially before the Jakarta meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which President Clinton will be attending in mid-November.
It is precisely to avoid these stark choices -- after 15 months of fruitless negotiations between the Clinton Administration and four different Japanese governments -- that the American and Japanese sides have begun what are likely to be a marathon set of talks to try to reach an accord before Sept. 30.
 
No Details Disclosed
 The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown met this afternoon with the Japanese Trade Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto. After his negotiations with Secretary Brown, Mr. Hashimoto quipped that "there was no fatal attack" on him from the American side, but he refused to disclose any details of how the discussions went.
Mr. Kantor and his top negotiator, Charlene Barshefsky, are scheduled to hold talks on Thursday and Friday in Los Angeles with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Yohei Kono, who will be in town for a four-way meeting of Japanese, American, Canadian and European Union trade ministers. Then all sides are expected to return to Washington for still more negotiating sessions.
In a briefing with reporters today, Mr. Kantor played down hopes for an immediate breakthrough, but he also played down the threatened trade sanctions as well.
"That appears to be a long, long way away as we sit here today," said Mr. Kantor, who clearly was trying to avoid saying anything that could set off another fall in the dollar.
"This is a time for listening, exchanging ideas, trying to determine whether on the framework, these sectors will be satisfied, and I think it would be unfortunate if I began to address the issue of Sept. 30," Mr. Kantor said. "How much progress and where we are successful are another question, and we will just wait and see over the next three weeks."
Progress on opening Japan's markets in insurance and government procurement has been more forthcoming because neither area involves large layoffs of Japanese workers or goes to the core of the Japanese economy.
But the automobile issue does. The car is the symbol of the Japanese export economy. The Japanese auto makers and affiliates carry enormous political weight in Japan. And, most important, because of all the past arguments and negotiations on auto issues between the two countries, there is great mistrust between them.
Therefore, the American side is demanding measurable criteria, some sort of fixed yardsticks, to determine whether Japan is really opening its automobile markets.
The Big Three auto makers say that as they try to import cars and light trucks to the Japanese market, they still face numerous nontariff barriers. For example, they particularly object to a process called "type notification," whereby a salesman must, as he completes a sale, take an imported vehicle to a Government office to have it certified. The vehicle must be certified for everything from emissions to quality standards, a process that can take up to six hours -- by which time, the Big Three argue, any self-respecting consumer would have given up.

HEADLINE: An Innkeeper's Life, Leaky Roof and All

BYLINE: By HELEN PIKE 

 BODY:
ON a day last spring that was bright with sunshine, Luba and Bill Robinson finally realized that running a bed and breakfast was going to require more than just sipping port and trading witticisms with guests.
It was the afternoon they discovered water slowly sheeting down the parlor wall at the Whistling Swan Inn, a Queen Anne mansion in Stanhope, N.J., that had been lovingly restored. The owners were on vacation, and the Robinsons were inn-sitting, so to speak. So far that week, melting snow had already seeped into the basement, winding a course toward the washers and dryers. On another day, one of the housekeepers hadn't shown up, leaving Mrs. Robinson to wash the linen for the 10-bedroom inn by herself while her husband juggled reservations and dining-room duty. 
 On this warm afternoon, ice on the porch roof had started to melt, seeping behind the roof flashing that had separated from the house. "So there we were," Mrs. Robinson recalled. "Bill was on the porch roof and I was handing him an ice chipper when guests drove by looking for the driveway."
She improvised her inn etiquette. "I simply shouted out the directions," she said. "I mean, at that point, what else could I do?"
What the Robinsons, who work full-time for the AT&T Corporation, and other couples are doing is pulling aside the lace curtains on the romance of bed and breakfast inns. Many of them are assessing the merits of running their own establishments before taking the plunge.
This is a new approach taken by "refugees from Corporate America," as Pat Hardy calls them. Ms. Hardy is a founder and co-executive director of the 1,800-member Professional Association of Innkeepers International, which has trained about 1,500 wannabe innkeepers since 1980.
"They come with buyout money in hand and are looking for a major life-style change," she said. After taking the association's course, 90 percent change their minds.
These aspiring hosts are signing up for workshops or apprenticing as innkeepers. They are also attending seminars that cover everything from advertising to creative menu planning using grocery store coupons.
All of this knowledge may help set the sun on what Ms. Hardy calls "the green velvet skirt syndrome."
"That's what guests think it's all about: donning a smoking jacket or velvet finery, sipping sherry and talking about foreign affairs," said Ms. Hardy, who ran a bed and breakfast in Santa Barbara, Calif., for nine years and also helped write "So You Want to Be an Innkeeper" (Chronicle Books, 1990).
After a seminar and a weekend trial run, she recalled, "one couple, husband and wife dentists from the Midwest, decided their own lives didn't look so bad."
Others quickly learn they don't have the capital required to own an inn -- "a minimum of $200,000 and a lot of credit cards," Ms. Hardy said.
Some people, influenced no doubt by the sitcom adventures of Bob Newhart playing a befuddled Vermont innkeeper, decide to buy an existing inn where costly renovations have already been done and there is an established clientele. Others choose to manage an inn but not own one.
"You really learn the meaning of cash flow," said Paula Williams, who left AT&T and, with help from her husband, Joe Mulay, renovated the Whistling Swan Inn nine years ago from a multiple dwelling.
The couple were so besieged by questions from guests that they began conducting weekend workshops at the inn, which is 25 miles east of the Delaware Water Gap. (The $300 fee is refunded if a participating couple volunteers to fill in at the Whistling Swan for a week.) Eventually, Mr. Mulay followed his wife's footsteps with a buyout from AT&T and went to work with her full time.
Their workshops begin and end at the oak dining-room table that used to grace the Oklahoma farmhouse of Ms. Williams's grandmother.
A seminar last March drew seven participants, including one of the inn's three housekeepers, Barbara Depew. The couples were Margaret and Ronald Lunzman of Stockholm, N.J., who are looking for a bed and breakfast in the Poconos; Robert and Amy Geller of Monsey, N.Y., who spent their honeymoon at the Whistling Swan and hope to buy an inn in the future, and Ron and Jeanne Aquino Salvo of Mountainside, N.J., who want to go into the innkeeping business despite a few reservations.
"I'm the doubting Thomas," admitted Mr. Salvo, who works as a software consultant for Dun & Bradstreet. "This weekend is a big feasibility study."
About 3 percent of all inns fail each year, Ms. Hardy said. Some innkeepers choose a location too far off the beaten path, while others move to areas they are not familiar with. Still others decide to cut down on the number of rooms, making it difficult to pay for their investment. A few return the property to residential use after suffering from financial or emotional burnout or, as Ms. Hardy put it, "the disillusionment factor."
She estimates that the number of bed and breakfasts and country inns -- where dinner is served in addition to breakfast -- has stabilized between 12,000 and 15,000. In 1980, the number was a mere 1,000.
Ms. Hardy says she has seen the bed-and-breakfast industry crest in regional waves. From 1980 to 1985, there was growth on the East and West coasts, while in 1985, the Midwest and South surged ahead. Since 1990, there has been a swell of new inns in Montana, Wyoming and Colorado.
According to research compiled by the innkeepers' association, operating expenses can run between $8,000 and $15,000 a room. Ms. Hardy said a one- to four-bedroom inn would probably not break even; a five to eight-bedroom inn running at full occupancy year-round may earn $34,628 -- not including mortgage payments (and in 1992 the average occupancy rate was only 50 percent). A nine to twelve-room inn may earn only $79,000, again, minus mortgage payments.
Additional research shows that it takes about three years before innkeepers "start to see a light," Ms. Hardy continued. "In four years, they can put some money in their pocket, and in five years, they can buy a new car and go on a vacation."
Most entry-level innkeepers divide the responsibility of running an inn; one partner does most of the daily work, from making breakfasts to fixing toilets, while the other continues with his or her day job. "That way there's a second income to supplement operating expenses," Ms. Hardy explained.
Wendy Denn and her husband, Jon, publish the "Professional Inn Guide," a compilation of 395 members, whose inns meet certain standards set by organizations like the American Automobile Association and the American Bed and Breakfast Association. She, too, says prospective innkeepers should watch their expenses.
A simple bedroom makeover can cost $10,000 but can climb to $40,000 for a period room, said Ms. Denn, who also manages the Trinity Inn and Conference Center in West Cornwall, Conn.
After eight years of conducting workshops, Mr. Mulay and Ms. Williams have distilled their knowledge into a few key points.
"Figure out who you are so you can run an inn that works for you," Ms. Williams said. "Are you bidets and heated towel racks? Candles and Jacuzzis? Feather beds and remotes for the gas fireplace? Do you like to serve buffet style?"
Both suggest putting money back into the bathroom, the most frequently used room in an inn. "More businessmen are asking for tubs to soak in after a long day," Mr. Mulay added.
Have a private apartment, Ms. Williams advised, and take time out for a nap each day.
"Never buy a house without a clause that says the sale is contingent on receiving zoning approval," said Mr. Mulay, referring to property that will be converted from private to public use.
"Be prepared for a wide variety of diets, from vegetarians to diabetics to those guests with food allergies," said Ms. Williams, who collects recipes for food that can be prepared in bulk in advance and frozen. She favors a breakfast buffet and a single dining-room table where guests can eat family style.
"For heaven's sake, if you have a Victorian, don't name it after Victoria or Anne or any British princes," she continued. "Don't name it after fruits, either. Apple is the most over-used name after a queen or a prince."
"Workshops are useful not for convincing individuals to go into the business, but for helping them to decide it's not for them," said Ms. Williams, who also started the state's bed-and-breakfast industry association.
Of the 150 people who have attended weekend seminars at the Whistling Swan, 12 have gone on to open their own inns. Only one has failed, said Ms. Williams, adding that the host may have been doomed from the start by opening an inn in the already crowded New England market at the beginning of the recession.
As for the Robinsons, who were back in their Belle Meade town house Sunday night and at their respective jobs for AT&T Monday morning, they said they would do it all again.
"We still sipped sherry with the guests," Mr. Robinson said. "That was the reward for all the hard labor."

HEADLINE: Three Congressional Endorsements

 BODY:
In three metropolitan area Congressional districts, victory in the Democratic primary on Sept. 13 will be tantamount to election because of the overwhelmingly Democratic registration. Here are our recommendations in these races.
Manhattan-Bronx, 15th District: Charles Rangel, the dean of New York's Congressional delegation, faces two challengers in only his second primary contest during 24 years in office. One of the challengers is Adam Clayton Powell 4th, son of the famous Harlem politician unseated by Mr. Rangel in 1970. 
 That infuses this race with history and a certain drama. When Mr. Rangel made his insurgent run for Congress, his opponent was clearly in the twilight of a once-powerful political career. Now Mr. Rangel is approaching the pinnacle of his own Congressional career. Mr. Powell 4th has depicted him as over the hill and out of touch.
Though too lax on Congressional reform, Mr. Rangel is a long way from being a spent volcano. He ranks fourth on the Ways and Means Committee, which is the source of all taxing power. Mr. Rangel's position is a clear benefit for his district and all of New York.
He has been active in trying to secure an empowerment zone for Harlem, which could be an important springboard for economic development. And he has been effective in forcing Washington to pay attention to urban concerns.
For his part, Mr. Powell has not been a particularly productive legislator, though he has developed a reputation for independence on the City Council. The brutal truth is that he is running more on his name than his record. Al Davis, an engineer, offers little of the background needed for effective service. So we firmly recommend Mr. Rangel.
Manhattan-Brooklyn, Eighth District: Jerrold Nadler has made an impressive debut in his first term in Congress. He has used his knowledge of transportation to address some of the city's infrastructure problems, from rebuilding the West Side Highway to proposing rail freight facilities to spur development.
Mr. Nadler faces two opponents in this race -- Deborah Green, a soft-spoken professional lobbyist on human rights issues, and Thomas Duane, a City Council member for nearly three years. By his own admission, Mr. Duane agrees with Mr. Nadler on most issues. A key distinction is that Mr. Duane is openly gay and promises to be especially sensitive to all forms of bigotry.
But Mr. Nadler already has a good record on civil rights issues, and his generally progressive stands on other issues ranging from health care to legislative reform merit our support.
Bronx-Westchester, 17th District: Voters in this scattered district -- covering parts of the Bronx, Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Pelham and New Rochelle -- confront an unusual if ultimately uninspiring choice.
Eliot Engel, seeking his fourth term, has not emerged as a forceful leader in New York's not particularly dazzling Congressional delegation. Many residents question his commitment to the district, and although he works hard, Mr. Engel has not left big footprints.
His challenger, the well-known salsa musician Willie Colon, has been involved in various social causes over the years, and we could not argue with voters who decide that a newcomer with strong ties to the large black and Latino population is more exciting than the incumbent. But, disappointingly, Mr. Colon has not mastered the issues that need to be addressed in Congress, and it is unclear where he differs on substance with Mr. Engel. Without great enthusiasm, we narrowly endorse Mr. Engel on the basis of his firmer grasp of the issues.

HEADLINE: The Trashing of CUNY

BYLINE: By Blanche Wiesen Cook and Sandi E. Cooper; Blanche Wiesen Cook, professor of history at John Jay College, is author of "Eleanor Roosevelt." Sandi E. Cooper is professor of history at the College of Staten Island and head of CUNY's Faculty Senate.

 BODY:
The decline or demise of the City University of New York has been forecast at least as far back as 1969, when enrollment was opened to anyone with a high school diploma. But this summer, the critics have been especially busy, and mean-spirited, too.
First, a long, contemptuous article by Heather Mac Donald appeared in the summer issue of City Journal, the quarterly of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative group that aspires to serve as the Giuliani administration's think tank. That attack found a much wider audience when John Leo cited it approvingly in U.S. News & World Report; Mr. Leo's column was then reprinted in newspapers around the country, and readers as far away as Seattle learned that "CUNY is at the cutting edge of a nationwide movement to do away with the very distinction between academic proficiency and deficiency and replace it with the concept of competence in one's own culture." 
These latest attacks reflect the national hand-wringing about the collapse of educational standards and local hostility to spending money for public education. They also reflect a social vision, disguised in the language of fiscal accountability, that follows these lines:
Not all students are educable; governments and universities are not equipped to repair the legacy of familial and societal decay; well-intended public efforts to eliminate inequality and abolish racism are expensive failures. Competition is the only way that the fittest and finest emerge as leaders. Higher education can benefit only a talented minority; it cannot address racial injustice or repair past discrimination; and, finally, what's good for the goose is good for the gander (that disposes of feminist or multicultural arguments). In short, social Darwinism is the anthem for the late 20th century.
To us, both graduates of city colleges in an era when tuition was free, these attacks are disgraceful. At a time when complex skills are needed for entry-level jobs, we see no wisdom in calls to curtail opportunity.
Those who lament the loss of 1950's standards, 1950's students and 1950's culture, the loss of some imagined Harvard on the Hudson, ignore the failures of the past, the achievements of the present and the realities of New York City.
There are in fact many similarities between the graduates of the old days and the graduates of today. CUNY's critics, however, tend to compare the top of the old with the bottom of the new. They ignore that the university has grown from 4 colleges to 20, including 10 senior colleges, 7 community colleges, a graduate center, a law school and an affiliated medical school. It serves more than 210,000 students, representing every segment of New York City.
These students include people from every ethnic group, from homeless families and families on welfare, and the newly arrived from every continent. At a time when less than 4 percent of students from the bottom quarter of the economic ladder now finish college, according to a recent report in Business Week, CUNY remains an exceptional avenue of opportunity. The first Rhodes Scholar from Brooklyn College is a Puerto Rican woman. CUNY graduates more African-American and Latino engineers, science majors and master's candidates than any other university in the United States.
But CUNY's critics invoke only those statistics designed to demonstrate that students burn money, fail excessively and earn worthless degrees. Ms. Mac Donald cites a 1989 survey finding that only 22 percent of the 1980 freshmen had graduated within five years. But studies by CUNY statisticians suggest that 40 percent graduate within eight years, and there is a good reason it might take so long: a typical CUNY student is a working adult, often with family responsibilities and often attending part time.
Open enrollment, the favored target of conservative critics, does not really exist anymore at the four-year colleges -- City, Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, New York City Technical, York, Baruch, Lehman and Medgar Evers. It was basically undone as a result of New York City's fiscal crisis in 1974-75. That year, classes and graduations were suspended, faculty and staff members lost salary, tenure was broken and tuition was imposed. Eventually the four-year colleges reinstated admission requirements close to the national norms.
Meanwhile, the system has been starved of the resources it needs to do its job. The full-time faculty has been reduced by a third since 1975. Class size has doubled, and classes are increasingly taught by young adjuncts or graduate students. Last year there was a furor over Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds's reorganization plan, which appeared to restrict liberal-arts education and redirect resources to practical, career-oriented training. Though this plan has been formally abandoned, faculty members remain suspicious that its objectives may yet be achieved by the back door, through budget allocations.
These difficult circumstances don't upset CUNY's critics, including a few professors who continue to accept salaries for work they now seem to detest. They represent a tiny minority of the faculty who have declared war not on the shrinking of the public purse but on the students.
The critics are correct to this extent: the allocated budgets cannot support CUNY's needs. But the critics' prescriptions for triage of the weak -- curtailing admissions, remedial services, counseling support and the SEEK program for disadvantaged students -- are wrong.
We must relearn some lessons and treat this generation as generously as we did the veterans of World War II. The public funds that they got helped create the biggest boom in American history. Only a handful of far-right cranks, in those days, complained about the G.I. Bill, or housing loans or pensions for the disabled. Is that because the beneficiaries were largely white males? Amid the difficulties of the present, the past always has a rosy glow that wasn't there when we lived in it.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Imagine A G.O.P. Senate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"Seven More in '94" was the wild-and-woolly slogan perpetrated in this space almost a year ago, in a report of a long-shot Republican chance to capture the Senate.
Back then, the switch of seven seats to give the G.O.P. a 51-to-49 majority was seen as a partisan's pipe dream. Now, as the '94 campaign begins in earnest, you hear George Mitchell, the retiring Democratic leader, predicting a loss of three or four seats (not including his own) while Bob Dole (busily creating delegate i.o.u.'s in the Northwest this week) predicts Republican gains of six or seven. 
 Hyper-sophisticated political deconstructionists will interpret this to mean that the Democrats are winning the Expectation Game. By persuading the public that an upheaval is in the works, anything short of upheaval in November -- a five-vote loss in the Senate, say, along with a 20-vote loss in the House -- Democrats could characterize as a kind of midterm victory. The headline would begin: "Republicans Fail . . ."
Let me fall right into that expectation trap by posing the question too overconfident for prudent pols: What if the Republicans actually won control of the Senate -- or, in a dead heat of 50-50, were able to persuade Richard Shelby of Alabama to swing over? What then? With the lady in the old George Price cartoon, contemplating a zookeeper inside a monkey cage trying to get his hat back from the gleeful monkeys, we can ask: "Who's in charge here?"
Bob Dole would be majority leader, somewhat less beholden to the most conservative members than he is now. He would soon be forced to choose between leader and Presidential candidate; my guess is that he would take the bird in hand, though Alan Simpson, now the whip, would be pushing him hard for the Presidency.
The nonagenarian Strom Thurmond, the only American official able to call Deng Xiaoping "sonny," would be chairman of Armed Services, replacing Sam Nunn, who might then find being ranking minority member too much of a comedown and accept Defense or State in the lame-duck Cabinet. John Warner would be de facto Armed Services chairman until ol' Strom retires in 1997.
The Foreign Relations Committee (Quick: who's chairman now?) would go by seniority to Jesse Helms, unless he again affirmed his loyalty to his constituents' favorite, Agriculture; in that case, Richard Lugar would return to lead Foreign Relations, now in dire need of reinvigoration. (Quiz answer: Claiborne Pell.)
Banking would go to Alfonse D'Amato (and just watch those Whitewater subpoenas fly). Orrin Hatch would head Judiciary, Larry Pressler Commerce, Mark Hatfield Appropriations and Frank Murkowski Energy. Arlen Specter would become chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence.
The innermost members of the Inner Club in a Dole Republican Senate, barring a major war, would be Bob Packwood heading the Finance Committee and Pete Domenici as chairman of Budget. With Simpson, they would decide what legislation moves.
What sort of legislation would move? Provided there was a shift of 30 votes in the House, a full-fathom-five sea change would take place in the wake of a majority change.
A balanced budget amendment would pass. So would a line-item veto. And a term-limits amendment would pass, be vetoed by a gutsy President Clinton, and have a chance of passage over his veto. Free trade would get a boost.
Health reform? The pre-existing Dole-Packwood plan -- permanent, portable insurance, with subsidies to the poor, deductions to individuals and no hidden taxes -- would sail through. And welfare reform, sidetracked since "Nixon's Good Deed" was done in by Democrats in 1970, would have its day in the sun.
Clinton's forgotten promise of tax relief to the middle class would be remembered. Taxes would not only go down, but policy would be directed away from consumption and toward investment. With a lower cap on mortgage deductions, prospects would be bright for tax-free savings accounts and a reduction of double taxation of dividends. The economic emphasis would be on growth, not redistribution of wealth.
What would "seven more in '94" do to the Clinton Presidency? The more relevant question is: Would the agile Clinton listen to the voice of the people, or spend his final two years furiously trying to sweep back the wave of the future?

HEADLINE: Exxon Oil Spill Devastated a Way of Life

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Five years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, all is not well in Alaska's Prince William Sound. I live here and know firsthand the environmental degradation, economic devastation and social upheaval it caused. Exxon ruined far more than the sound's fishing. Exxon ruined a way of life. 
 The commercial harvest of pink salmon in Prince William Sound, unlike other areas, has been coming up short since the spill, because of low prices, low volumes or both. The harvest improved in 1994, but was still low in oiled areas. Herring fisheries crashed in 1993 and 1994.
Government scientists have verified in laboratory studies that genetic damage and reproductive impairment occurred in pink salmon and herring exposed to the 1989 spill. Long-term effects occur predominantly in these and other species, like
harlequin ducks, oyster catchers and juvenile sea otters, which feed or breed in the intertidal zone.
More than 50 intertidal mussel beds in the oiled sections of the sound remain heavily contaminated with Exxon Valdez oil and may be a continuing source of chronic oil damage. This summer, five years after the spill, government scientists initiated tests to determine if the oil could be removed from these mussel beds.
Exxon scientists have not found any chronic effects from oil because they did not want to. I compared 32 government and Exxon studies, and found that Exxon's studies demonstrated a bias intentionally directed at "proving" there was no effect from the spill.
For example, Exxon scientists averaged the oil concentrations in sea-water samples taken from different depths and areas, including areas not yet oiled at the time of initial sampling. This averaging effectively diluted any high oil levels, and the resulting low "average" oil levels were used to justify Exxon's claims for absence of biological effects.
Social scientists have documented what we found out the hard way. Cordova, Alaska, is particularly vulnerable to technological disasters. Injury to natural resources disrupts the pattern of sharing that forms a web of behaviors and social interactions, giving a sense of worth to individuals, strength to families and structure to society. In 1993, subsistence harvests in Prince William Sound still had not fully recovered.

HEADLINE: SERBIAN PRESIDENT IS SAID TO ACCEPT TRADE MONITORING

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Western diplomats said today that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia had accepted a compromise plan for monitoring the trade embargo he has imposed on the Bosnian Serbs. In return, they said, the Security Council will move to ease sanctions on Serbia as early as next week.
The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, members of the so-called contact group trying to make peace in Bosnia, announced in Berlin on Wednesday that if the Serbs agreed to allow observers along the border with Bosnia, the economic embargo against Serbia would be relaxed in stages. 
 Mr. Milosevic imposed the embargo on his former proteges last month, after the Bosnian Serbs rejected the contact group's peace plan. The five nations had made the Bosnian Serbs' acceptance a condition for lifting international trade sanctions on Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and Montenegro.
The Bosnian Serbs have relied on Serbia for much of their war materiel. Without such shipments, especially of fuel, the Bosnian Serbs' ability to fight will be severely impaired, tipping the balance of power toward the Muslim-dominated Government.
Under such circumstances, pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to seek peace would be vastly increased.
First official word of the agreement came when the French Foreign Ministry announced in Paris that Belgrade had agreed to accept "an international humanitarian mission" along its border with Bosnia to verify Mr. Milosevic's pledge to end military assistance to the Serbs.
The new plan, American and other diplomats here said, foresees stationing up to 200 civilian monitors along this frontier, which largely follows the Drina River. The monitors would have the double task of certifying that Yugoslavia is continuing to supply the Bosnian Serbs with food and other relief goods, while insuring that it does not send in fuel and weapons.
As a reward for accepting the monitors, the five nations will recommend that the Security Council temporarily reopen Yugoslav airports to international flights and end the ban on Yugoslav participation in international sporting and cultural events, allowing it take part in the coming European soccer championships.
The contract group's United Nations representatives held a first meeting here today to start work on a sanctions-loosening resolution, as well as on another resolution tightening restrictions on Bosnia's Serbs.
If Mr. Milosevic sticks to the plan, many diplomats here say, President Clinton will have little chance of persuading the Security Council to lift its arms embargo on the Bosnian Government, as he has said he would try to do if the Bosnian Serbs did not make peace by Oct. 15.
The arms embargo, imposed on all sides in the Balkan conflict, has effectively perpetuated the weapons advantage held by the Serbs at the beginning of the war in 1992.
While the United States and the Council's five nonaligned members -- Pakistan, Djibouti, Rwanda, Nigeria and Oman -- favor lifting the arms embargo, the other nine -- Russia, Britain, France, China, New Zealand, Spain, the Czech Republic, Brazil and Argentina -- are opposed. In any event Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs, has indicated that it would use its veto if needed to maintain the embargo.
 
Effect on Other Embargoes
 The United States cannot violate the arms embargo unilaterally without encouraging other countries to break embargoes that Washington favors, including those against Iraq, Libya and Haiti.
The new monitoring plan was worked out over several weeks between the official mediators in the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen of Britain and Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway, and Mr. Milosevic.
Brig. Gen. Bo Pellnas of Sweden, a former United Nations military observer in the Balkans who will become a civilian to lead the monitors, is to meet with representatives of the contact group in Geneva early next week to discuss the plan. The monitors are to be drawn from the mainly European members of the London Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, which has been trying for three years to end the fighting.
After Bosnia's Serbs rejected the peace plan drawn up by the contact group this summer, President Milosevic, who accepts the plan, closed Serbia's border with Bosnia, cutting off all supplies except food and medicine in an attempt to make the Bosnian Serbs change their minds.
The intermediary countries say Mr. Milosevic's embargo seems to be working, but they want to place monitors along the frontier to make sure.
But Mr. Milosevic refused to accept United Nations military monitors but finally agreed to civilians.
To avoid the appearance of infringing on Yugoslav sovereignty, the monitors will mainly observe the local border police as they check trucks crossing into Bosnia. The monitors will make recommendations to the border police and report back to the Security Council on whether Yugoslavia is cooperating.
 
Rebutting Domestic Critics
 To protect himself against domestic critics, diplomats say, Mr. Milosevic plans to present the operation as one intended to verify that he is keeping Serbia's Bosnian brothers and sisters fully supplied with food and medicine, and so refute rumors put out by his enemies that he is trying to starve them into surrender.
While the monitors will indeed perform this function, their prime role is to insure that Mr. Milosevic continues to deny the Bosnian Serbs military supplies.
If the monitoring plan works well, then the Security Council is expected to adopt two resolutions: One would end the ban on international air traffic and permit Yugoslavia to take part in international cultural and sporting events. But to keep up the pressure, this relaxation would lapse after a month or so unless the Council extended it. The other step would tighten sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs and make it harder for them to get money from abroad.

Serbs Attack Enclave
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sept. 8 (Reuters) -- Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia opened a major assault today against the Muslim enclave of Bihac, in northwestern Bosnia, officials said. More than 1,000 ethnic Serbian troops backed by tanks and artillery poured into Bihac from Croatia.
Serbs also fired a surface-to-air missile at two NATO combat aircraft, United Nations and NATO officials said. The planes, Harrier jump-jets of the British Navy, were not hit.
The United Nations peacekeeping force said the pincer offensive into Bihac was alarming because it involved Serbs from neighboring Croatia as well as Bosnian Serbs.
"We're talking of upward of 1,000 troops, tanks and artillery -- the works," said a United Nations spokesman, Maj. Dacre Holloway.
The NATO Southern Command in Naples said the two Harriers returned safely to the aircraft carrier Invincible in the Adriatic.

HEADLINE: Cuba, in Shift, Says Deal Can Be Reached With the U.S.

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Just days after the Government described its talks with the United States over immigration issues as being stalled, Cuban officials now say they believe a deal can be struck.
Returning home for consultations with President Fidel Castro and other officials, Cuba's chief negotiator, Ricardo Alarcon, said Wednesday night that despite major differences he was "confident that an acceptable agreement can be reached." 
 The change in tone came as the flood of refugees leaving the island on rafts and small boats appeared to be leveling off, easing pressure on the Clinton Administration to negotiate an accord under which the Cuban Government would renew efforts to stop the exodus.
It also coincided with meetings in Madrid between the Cuban Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, and three of the most prominent Cuban exiles ever to meet with members of the Castro Government.
 
Meetings Called Positive
 Though all three are considered moderates within the Cuban community in Miami, where they live, one of them, Ramon Cernuda, is a formal representative in the United States for one of the best-known dissident groups on the island. Another, Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, is a former leader of Mr. Castro's insurgency who turned against the revolution and spent years as a political prisoner.
Cuban officials provided no details on what was discussed in the meetings, which were arranged by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain. The dissidents said only that the meetings represented a positive and conciliatory first step by the Government.
Under the circumstances, however, the symbolism may have been far more important than the substance.
"This is the first time that the Cuban Government has recognized the existence of the opposition and has agreed to speak with it," Mr. Cernuda told reporters in Madrid. Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo added, "The Cuban Government has taken a step that it had not taken in 35 years."
Since Cuba began its negotiations with the United States in New York more than a week ago, the Government here has sought to emphasize its willingness to engage Washington in whatever dialogue it can.
 
Negotiator Sees Gains
 At the same time, it has taken advantage of attention drawn to the refugees, a total of about 30,000 in the past month, to repeat its argument that only by ending the long embargo against Cuba can the United States ease the deprivation that Havana says is the essential cause of the exodus.
In an interview with Cuban television on Wednesday night, Mr. Alarcon suggested that Cuba was making headway in the political battle.
Citing recent criticism of the embargo by some United States senators and newspaper editorialists, he said, "Every day the view becomes more widespread in the United States that the only way to resolve the problems between the two countries is by putting an end to the blockade and sitting down to talk about all the problems in a broad and respectful way."
Cuban officials offered no details of the proposals that Mr. Alarcon presented to officials here before flying back to New York this afternoon.
But two diplomats familiar with the Cuban position said that for the first time since the refugee crisis began little more than a month ago, Cuban officials had begun talking about the possibility of taking back some of the Cubans now interned at camps in Panama and the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. American officials said that the United States was asking Cuba to accept only the 225 or so Cubans who have asked to return.
 
'A Handful of Issues'
 Some American officials have said that the mere threat of a forced repatriation of Cubans who risked their lives to leave the island could lead to riots at the camps and angry protests from Cuban-Americans. At the same time, the Clinton Administration has shown no sign of having come up with any other solution.
Some Cuban officials have indicated that an increase in visas for Cubans wanting to join relatives in the United States -- even to annual levels of more than 20,000 migrants -- would not be a sufficient American concession in the talks. One diplomat said that, in part, the Cubans were seeking assurances that sooner or later the United States would agree to talks focused on the embargo.
The chief State Department spokesman, Mike McCurry, said today that the negotiations on migration were down to "a handful of issues," which he would not specify. But the Clinton Administration has insisted that it will lift economic sanctions against Cuba only when the Communist Government takes concrete steps to democratize its political system.
Although diplomats said today that Mr. Robaina's meetings with the Miami exiles were the sort of first steps that Cuba might take toward an eventual political opening, Cuban officials generally played down their importance.
"This is part of a process," the Foreign Ministry official in charge of the Government's contacts with Cuban exiles, Jose R. Cabanas, said in an interview this afternoon. "What this shows above all is our willingness to talk with all sorts of people who have a respectful position and are not hostile toward our country."
Despite founding the paramilitary group Alpha 66 and spending 22 years in Mr. Castro's jails after being captured in 1964, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo, 59, has supported discussions with the Government in order to bring about democracy. Mr. Cernuda, the director of a Cuban art museum in Miami, represents the Cuban Committee for Human Rights, a group led by one of the island's most prominent dissidents, Elizardo Sanchez. Like Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo and Alfredo Duran, a lawyer associated with Democratic Party politics in Florida who also met with Mr. Robaina, Mr. Cernuda has battled frequently with hard-line exile leaders in southern Florida.
 
'Gestures of Generosity'
 After meeting with Mr. Robaina himself today, the Spanish Prime Minister, who helped obtain Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo's freedom in 1986, said Cuba must "begin a process of rapid and profound transformations" that would include "gestures of generosity toward dissident groups."
Mr. Gonzalez's comments appeared to represent a ratcheting up of pressure on Mr. Castro by the Spanish Government, which has long sought to promote peaceful change in Cuba but has appeared increasingly frustrated with the results.
Meanwhile, the pressure of Cuban events on the Clinton Administration may be in remission. According to a spokesman for the United States Coast Guard district office in Miami, rescue vessels picked up 689 Cuban refugees on Tuesday and 1,029 on Wednesday, continuing a pattern in which the numbers had hovered around 1,000 a day since last Saturday.
By midnight , 610 more had been plucked from the sea.

HEADLINE: Quayle, Defending '92 Speech, Returns to Family Values Theme

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 8

 BODY:
With an eye on both his political past and future, former Vice President Dan Quayle returned today to the place where two years ago he made Murphy Brown's out-of-wedlock television baby a "family values" issue in the 1992 Presidential campaign.
Speaking again to members of the Commonwealth Club of California, he said the baby was still a values issue in American life, an unfortunate prime-time symbol of the country's "poverty of values." 
 "The ideal situation for our children is to be born and raised in an intact family, and I unapologetically assert that again," he said, asserting that liberals and news organizations had mocked and distorted his 1992 effort to focus attention on the dissolution of American families.
The critics and carpers were 180 degrees off, Mr. Quayle said, proffering a new analysis of his original speech.
"They turned it into an attack on single moms and working women," he said. "What I was talking about then, and what I am reiterating today, is the importance of fathers. Raising children is not just a mother's responsibility."
 
A Campaign in '96?
 What Mr. Quayle did not say today, and what he would not say even when pressed hard by his audience, was whether he had plans for making Baby Brown and the larger symbolism he sees an issue in the Presidential campaign of 1996.
Instead, he strung his audience along, throwing out phrases like "if I run," and here and there tweaking President Clinton, mainly for his handling of foreign affairs.
"This time around, if I choose to run, I will not run for the No. 2 spot," he said. "It will be my campaign, my ideas, and it will be done my way."
Could he persuade the electorate in 1996 to take him more seriously? Would the jokes and mockery stop?
"It's already much different," he insisted.
 
Testing the Waters
 This has been Mr. Quayle's stock approach to questions about 1996 for the past several months as he has toured the country, testing his standing within the Republican Party as measured against other possible contenders in 1996, among them Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and former Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp.
Once the 1994 elections for Congress and governors are over, he said, he will announce his decision.
Meanwhile, he is not only testing the waters but is also building up political good will by attending fund-raising events and rallies for 1994 Republican candidates from coast to coast. On Tuesday, for example, he was the featured guest at a fund-raising event in Pasadena for Gov. Pete Wilson, who faces a strong re-election challenge from State Treasurer Kathleen Brown.
And, like most national politicians with national ambition, Mr. Quayle has written the obligatory memoir, "Standing Firm," which is always on sale after each speech, with no extra charge for the autograph. Its recent publication, along with his increased presence on the hustings, has also resulted in an increasing number of invitations to appear on television news and interview shows. This morning, for example, he appeared on the NBC News program "Today."
In the speech here, Mr. Quayle was careful to press most of the hot buttons of Republican conservatism, everything from welfare reform to lower taxes. He drew frequent applause from his audience, seemingly made up mainly of Republican members of the Commonwealth Club, a public affairs forum that is a must stop on the political trail for serious national campaigners.
There was laughter when he charged that Mr. Clinton had no fixed foreign policy and sooner or later would discover that "there's more to it than the economy, stupid," a biting paraphrase of a Clinton campaign maxim. There were murmurs of approval when he proposed an oil embargo on Cuba to force President Fidel Castro's hand.
But for the most part, Mr. Quayle kept the focus on family values and his reprise of what he called "The Poverty of Values, Part 2."
He argued that although his first speech had drawn laughter and ridicule, the passage of time had proved him right. In fact, he noted, Mr. Clinton now speaks often about "community values."
 
Stirred National Debate
 In his 1992 speech, Mr. Quayle stirred a national debate about family values when he declared that "failing to support children one has fathered is wrong," then added: "It doesn't help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown -- a character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman -- mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice."
Mr. Quayle said today that he did not intend to dwell on the television show and, in fact, he mentioned it only in passing. But there was never any doubt about what he was talking about.
"Illegitimacy seems to be a pathology that feeds upon itself, entrenching and expanding with each generation," he said. "If children grow up never knowing their father, they assume that fathers are irrelevant and that males are not accountable.
"The implicit message to young girls is that it is acceptable to have children without marriage. The message to boys is that they need not be responsible in their behavior. This is tragic and wrong. Little wonder that so many young people live amid ethical chaos."

HEADLINE: Regulator Fears That Economics Could Lead A-Plants to Scrimp

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today that looming deregulation was creating unprecedented economic pressure for utilities and providing an "incentive to cut corners" at nuclear reactors.
The chairman, Ivan Selin, said the pressure would prompt his regulators to examine a new area when evaluating a plant that is operating badly: whether financial strain on the parent utility had left it starved for resources. 
 The pressure Mr. Selin was referring to results from a movement led by California regulators toward "retail wheeling." Under that system, electricity users can buy from the local utility, as they do now, or from distant generators, which can be either utilities or independent power producers. The local utility would be obliged to deliver the power. Such a system would end the monopoly power of utilities; anticipating that retail wheeling will be widely implemented, utilities around the country have moved to cut costs.
"Even financially sound utilities are under great pressure to reduce their rates, to be competitive," Mr. Selin said in an hourlong session with reporters on nuclear topics. "They may be tempted to put off capital investment that we consider necessary to maintain equipment in top shape. We have to be that much more alert about the safety implications."
 
Concerns About Indian Point
 Mr. Selin said his agency would pay close attention to spending by utilities at reactors but only where plants were in difficulty.
He cited only one example of a plant that bore watching, the New York Power Authority's Indian Point 3 plant, in Buchanan, about 35 miles up the Hudson River from Manhattan. A spokesman for the authority said that budget reductions were planned at Indian Point as part of an effort to cut the overall budget by 15 percent but that they were small and would have "absolutely no effect on safety" at the reactor.
Whether cost-cutting will lead the plants to jeopardize safety is a matter of debate among industry experts.
"What he says makes sense intuitively," Barry M. Abramson, a utility analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said of Mr. Selin's remarks. "Competitive pressures are going to force companies to cut costs."
Utilities have been cutting workers for a few years, Mr. Abramson said, and while they at first exempted their nuclear plants, they no longer do. And if corners were cut, it would be hard to discern, he said, adding, "No utility would tell you that they prefer to be the low-cost producer but unsafe."
Still, Mr. Abramson said, for most companies the nuclear plant is the biggest single asset, and they would not intentionally endanger it. He said, though, that competition might encourage some utilities to retire their high-cost reactors early.
Mark D. Luftig, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said most companies would find it cheaper to invest in maintenance and keep the plant running more, because the key to profitability was keeping the plant on line.
At the San Francisco office of the Environmental Defense Fund, David Roe, an expert on electricity production and use, said Mr. Selin's warning was "a classic case of regulators' tunnel vision."
"The same thing was said about the airline industry" when deregulation was initiated there, he said.
Mr. Selin singled out Indian Point 3, which has been shut for safety reasons since Feb. 27, 1993, and which the Power Authority now believes could be ready to re-open early next year. With a combination of a weak economy in the Northeast and high-efficiency lamps, motors and heating systems, New York has an electricity surplus, which has helped cut electricity prices.
"The objective situation seems to indicate that they have more incentive to cut corners," Mr. Selin said, but he added that in recent months, "the Power Authority has been pouring resources into Indian Point."

HEADLINE: Blacks Far More Likely Than Whites to Have AIDS, Agency Says

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Black women are nearly 15 times more likely than white women to have AIDS, while black men are five times more likely than white men to have the disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today.
AIDS is already the leading cause of death of black and Hispanic men age 25 to 44. Preliminary data indicate that AIDS has become the second-leading cause of death among black women age 25 to 44, the centers said. 
 In its weekly report on health issues, the agency said that of the 106,949 AIDS cases reported in the United States last year, 58,538, or 55 percent, occurred among racial and ethnic minorities. Of these, 38,544 involved blacks, 18,888 involved Hispanic Americans, 767 Asian-Americans and Pacific islanders, and 339 American Indians and Alaska natives.
There were 73 AIDS cases among every 100,000 black women, while the rate for white women was 5 per 100,000.
 
Many Cases of Drug Use
 Forty-seven percent of AIDS cases among minority women were caused by intravenous drug use, while 37 percent were due to the transmission of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through heterosexual intercourse.
"We're still not getting the message across to women that you can become infected with H.I.V. through sex with a man and that you cannot tell that the person is H.I.V.-infected by just looking at them," said Dr. Teresa Diaz, an epidemiologist in the the agency's surveillance branch.
Among Hispanic and black men, homosexual contact was cited as the mode of infection in 39 percent of cases, while intravenous drug use was the cause in 38 percent.
Dr. Diaz said intravenous drug use was a continuing problem. "It is still the primary mode of exposure for black women," she said.
Racial and ethnic minorities accounted for three-fourths of AIDS cases among adult and teen-age women, and 84 percent of the cases involving children aged 12 and under, the agency said.
The data showed that complex social, economic and cultural factors complicated efforts to prevent AIDS, Dr. Diaz said.
"If you're poor and live in a high-crime area, you have other priorities, like violence or crime and other diseases, and may not have such a high priority for H.I.V. and AIDS," she said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Treasury Bond Prices Barely Budge

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed yesterday as investors limited their trading, awaiting today's release of the Producer Price Index. Some analysts expect the report to show that inflation is accelerating and to speed up the timetable of another interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged at a price of 999/32 to yield 7.56 percent. The yields on some shorter maturities, like the three-year note, fell slightly. 
 It was the kind of session when even a stronger dollar in the currency markets, a smaller than expected decline in weekly jobless claims, or comments by the vice chairman of the Fed, could not turn the market's interest away from inflation.
Treasury prices rose in the morning and than slowly settled in the afternoon as market expectations grew that the Producer Price Index could be worse than expected. That notion may have been exacerbated by comments of Fed officials yesterday, said Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They indicated that the central bank is still biased toward tightening further, but not necessarily in the immediate future," she said.
 
Conditional Explanations
 Ms. Schaja forecasts that overall producer prices increased four-tenths of 1 percent in August while the so-called core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose two-tenths of 1 percent. "If the core number is stronger it may be because of the stronger auto sales," she said.
Even if today's producer price increase turns out to be lower than expected, investors and traders are likely to wait until they see the August Consumer Price Index before they relax. That report will be released Tuesday.
Yesterday's initial weekly unemployment report released by the Labor Department showed claims for the week ending Sept. 3 down 3,000, to 330,000, from a revised 333,000 the previous week.
Economists said that with the release of this week's statistic, August's average for initial unemployment claims shows an improvement in the labor market compared with July. The August payroll employment report, however, showed an increase of only 179,000 in nonfarm payroll, compared with a 251,000 increase for July.
Another indicator of economic growth came in the Commerce Department's survey of capital spending, which showed a rise despite the upward trend in interest rates.
According to the survey, American industry is increasing its spending this year on new factories and equipment at the fastest rate in five years. The projected increase is 8.8 percent over last year's total and the highest since an 11.4 percent increase in 1989. But analysts cautioned that this spending could be nearing its peak.
 
Fed Members' Remarks
 Some cause for bond selling in the afternoon came from remarks attributed to a Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who said that the economy was in a solid growth pattern, leaving some to infer that the Fed would continue raising rates this year to keep growth under control and inflation at bay.
Traders said those comments eclipsed those made earlier by the Fed's new vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, to a group of mortgage bankers in Washington. He said that long-term interest rates would fall if inflation was under control.
In a surprise development, the Treasury announced that it would auction $4 billion of cash management bills today in what a Government official described as a precaution against a faster pace of spending than expected.
Elsewhere, prices of corporate bonds were little changed. J. P. Morgan & Company sold $500 million of 7 5/8 percent noncallable notes due in 2004 at a price of 99.504, to yield 7.697 percent.
And the Tennessee Valley Authority sold $500 million of 40-year power bonds with an 8 1/4 percent coupon at a price of 95.746, to yield 8.63 percent. Callable in five years, the issue was priced through CS First Boston.

HEADLINE: Republican Candidates Run Hard and Cheaply

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Sept. 8

 BODY:
It seems like a throwback to old-fashioned politics, two candidates traveling across Connecticut, speaking at luncheons, shaking hands at fairs, marching in parades, telling people face to face why they want to be elected to the United States Senate.
But for Dr. Gerald Labriola, a retired pediatrician, and Dr. Joseph Bentivegna, a young ophthalmologist, their shoe-leather campaigns in a primary for the Republican Party's Senate nomination are all they can afford. While the Democratic incumbent, Joseph I. Lieberman, has raised more than $4 million and already is spending heavily on television ads, the two Republicans together have raised less than $120,000. Television is something they can only watch.
 
Incumbent's Advantage
 As a result, changing the campaign-finance laws to limit the advantages of incumbency is one of the few issues on which the two doctors agree. Dr. Labriola, a former state senator and candidate for governor and lieutenant governor, notes that Senator Lieberman established a re-election fund a month after taking office in 1989. 
 "It's fundamentally unfair to allow incumbents to raise money for six years," Dr. Labriola said. "Five years ago, he was raising money while I was examining babies."
Dr. Bentivegna, who has never run for office before, and who often seems to rely on conversations with his patients for his information on issues, said Mr. Lieberman's millions intimidated better qualified Republicans.
"Why is a guy like me on the verge of winning this primary?" he said "It's because the more established politicians looked at that war chest and said 'Forget it.' "
Dr. Labriola, who was recruited for the race by national party officials and who won the party's endorsement in July, is running mainly against Mr. Lieberman, mentioning Dr. Bentivegna only when asked about him.
"Joe Bentivegna is a nice fellow, an eye surgeon from Rocky Hill," Dr. Labriola said blandly, when the question came up at a Rotary Club lunch in Meriden.
 
'Clintonesque' Opponent
 He describes Senator Lieberman, on the other hand, as part of the "Clintonesque group" in Washington, a Beltway insider who raises much of his campaign money outside Connecticut and has voted against the state's interests.
While Mr. Lieberman has gained a reputation for standing apart from his party on important votes, Dr. Labriola said he "fakes right and votes left," in the end siding with President Clinton nearly every time, even on tax increases that hit Connecticut's high-income families especially hard.
The Senator said he is a moderate, Dr. Labriola told the Rotarians. "But is Clinton a moderate?" he asked. "He's a tax-and-spend liberal."
"What do I offer?" he says to audiences. "A belief that the role of government is helping people only when they can't help themselves. Being tough on crime and knowing who's the victim and who's the criminal. Empowering people, not governments. Traditional values for the family, church, patriotism."
 
Health-Care Proposal
 As a doctor, he has a health-care proposal whose starting point is, he said, "First, do no ill." The health-care system needs only repairs, he said. Costs can be cut by reducing paperwork, limiting malpractice awards and lawyers' fees, and encouraging hospitals to find economies and doctors to order fewer tests.
He would finance the cost of making health care more accessible by reducing farm subsidies and foreign aid and by eliminating unemployment benefits for illegal aliens.
Most of all, he said, Congress should move slowly. "Health care is the most important piece of legislation since Social Security or Medicare, and it should not be trivialized," he said.
In a primary in which neither Republican has money for advertising, Dr. Labriola has the advantage of being on the top line of the ballot. It might also seem to be an advantage that he can accuse his opponent, Dr. Bentivegna, of favoring the legalization of drugs, opposing the death penalty and supporting socialized medicine.
Dr. Bentivegna, however, has made a virtue of speaking his mind regardless of the risks, pausing in interviews only to ask every few minutes, "Am I making sense?" The sensation of a political candidate's taking chances was appealing anough to win the endorsement of the state's largest newspaper, The Hartford Courant.
Dr. Bentivegna said he opposes capital punishment not only because it is wrong to take human life -- he opposes abortion for the same reason -- but also because it doesn't work.
"If I were a smart politician," he said, "maybe I'd be saying the same things as my opponent and Senator Lieberman, we need to build more prisons, we need more police, we need more executions, the same things that haven't worked for the last 25 years."
 
The Problem: Illegal Drugs
 At the heart of the crime problem, he said, is illegal drug use. He proposes to wean criminals off their drug habits by giving them increasingly diluted doses.
He, too, has a health-care proposal, but his would require an increase in the Medicare payroll tax. Dr. Labriola, he said, "says he's going to do it without tax increases, and I say that's fiction."
Dr. Bentivegna's plan is relatively simple. The Government, through the Medicare tax, would provide catastrophic health-care coverage for everyone, paying a person's medical expenses once they exceeded $15,000. Everyone could then afford his own health insurance for the first $15,000.
Dr. Labriola describes the plan as socialized medicine. But Dr. Bentivegna said no one should have to lose his life savings to a health problem. "Those of us who are fortunate enough to have good health have to pay more into the system to protect those who have poor health," he said. "That has to be explained to the voters."
 
Fate of the Middle Class
 Dr. Bentivegna is most passionate over the fate of middle-income people in recent years. In a self-published book, "An Agenda for Connecticut," he rails against the nation's economic and political elite for making the middle class pay for the bank scandals, real-estate speculation and leveraged buyouts of the 1980's.
"The middle class is being massacred," he said. "It used to be possible for a man or a woman to get a job and support a family on one income. Now you can barely do it on two."
Woven from newspaper clippings and stories of economic distress told to him by his patients, "An Agenda for Connecticut" has the feverish logic of a dinner-party argument. But Dr. Bentivegna is a suburban eye surgeon, not a revolutionary. What becomes clear is that he himself is well off, and that what is wrong, in his view, is that more people can't afford to live as he does.
"Anyone who makes a living wage in Connecticut should be able to have what I have," he said, "to live in a good neighborhood, afford health care and send their children to good schools."

HEADLINE: Beijing, Despite Taiwan Issue, Looks to Better Ties With U.S.

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 8

 BODY:
China said today that the Clinton Administration's decision to expand its official ties with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province, will adversely affect United States-China relations. But at the same time, it took another step to signal that it wants to improve its relations with Washington and repeated an invitation to President Clinton to visit China.
The modest change in Taiwan policy was announced in Washington on Wednesday. It reaffirmed the longstanding American position that there is only "one China," but in a nod to Taiwan's growing economic power in Asia it loosened some of the strictures that have prevented American officials from carrying out direct talks with Taiwan officials on trade and economic issues. 
 For the first time since 1979, the most senior American official in Taiwan visited President Lee Teng-hui in his office to brief the island's President on the policy change.
Taiwan is the home of the Chinese Nationalist Government that fled the mainland in 1949 before Mao Zedong's victorious Communist army. Taiwan's Nationalists have given up their longstanding claim to represent all 1.2 billion Chinese on the mainland. President Lee has been seeking to accommodate the strong pro-independence movement on the island while remaining true to the goal the nationalists and Communists still share: eventual reunification under one government.
In a formal statement on Wednesday, Taiwan also reacted stiffly to the change in Washington, saying it did not go far enough. But today, its leaders seemed pleased with the policy adjustment.
The Chinese Government's reaction appeared similarly ambivalent. Speaking at a weekly Foreign Ministry briefing, Shen Guofang, a Government spokesman, said the series of measures announced in Washington on Wednesday "have seriously violated the three joint communiques signed between China and the United States."
"This act of the United States brazenly interferes with the internal affairs of China and is something we are firmly opposed to," Mr. Shen said. "This will seriously, adversely affect the further development of bilateral relations."
But Mr. Shen repeated that China would like President Clinton to come to Beijing for a summit meeting.
Such a meeting appears now out of the question because of China's deteroriating human rights conditions.
Mr. Clinton decided in May to break the linkage under which Washington demanded improvements in human rights in return for the annual renewal of China's low-tariff trade access to the American market. But Mr. Clinton had hoped his action would lead to reciprocal steps by Beijing to begin accounting for and releasing thousands of political prisoners. So far, it has not.
President Jiang Zemin, leaving for Moscow last week, made a point at his departure news conference of saying he had invited Mr. Clinton to come to Beijing.
Today, Mr. Shen added, "Meeting and exchanging views between leaders of China and the United States is of great significance for enhancing understanding and improving bilateral relations.
"We welcome President Clinton to visit China at his convenience," Mr. Shen continued. "President Clinton has already accepted the invitation and hopes to visit China at his convenience."
[In Washington, White House officials said Mr. Clinton had received no formal invitation and had no plans to visit China.]
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang met for the first time last November at the summit meeting of Asian Pacific leaders. They are expected to meet again this November at a similiar summit in Indonesia. Mr. Clinton has never visited China.
Western diplomats here say there would have to be significant progress in these disputes before a summit meeting could occur.

HEADLINE: A Democrat Who Thrives Opposing the President

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: OZARK, Ala., Sept. 7

 BODY:
From almost the day President Clinton entered the White House, Senator Richard C. Shelby has been at his heels, a nettlesome and outspoken critic. Never mind that Mr. Clinton is from Arkansas and Mr. Shelby is from Alabama, or that both are Democrats.
Although the positions that Mr. Shelby has taken reflect the native conservatism of Alabama, what has made him stand out from other conservative Southern Democrats is the flourish and relish with which the two-term junior Senator has consistently opposed the President. 
 Just weeks ago, for instance, Senator Shelby sided with Republicans in an 11th-hour bid to scuttle the crime bill, at a time when its passage was crucial for Mr. Clinton. And as the Administration was pressing its health care measure, Mr. Shelby was holding news conferences with Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who is a leading critic of the legislation. Mr. Shelby also co-sponsored an alternative health care plan backed by conservative Republicans.
Last year at this time, Mr. Shelby was trumpeting his being one of the first of six Democrats to oppose the President's budget as a tax-and-spend prescription, forcing Vice President Al Gore to cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
As the 60-year-old Democrat travels his state from Muscle Shoals to Mobile, there is some grumbling about his chumminess with the likes of Senator Gramm.
"Some of us are somewhat distressed, not so much because he exercised his independence, but because of the zeal with which he did it," said Greg Hawley, the Democratic chairman of Jefferson County, which includes Birmingham. "We don't expect him to be in lock step with the Democratic leadership, but we also don't expect him to be in lock step with the Republican leadership, as he has been lately."
 
Best of Both Worlds
 While some in the state that proudly calls itself the heart of Dixie speculate that Mr. Shelby may be ripe to switch parties, as Senator Gramm did 11 years ago, many political observers dismiss such speculation. They note that Mr. Shelby has the best of both worlds as a Democrat, and is shrewd enough to know it.
While Alabama is still largely Democratic, all the Republican Presidential candidates have carried it since Ronald Reagan first ran in 1980. But the Democratic Party label still means a great deal. By remaining a registered Democrat, while talking Republican, Mr. Shelby avoids being outflanked from either end of the ideological spectrum.
The Senator himself dismisses the speculation that he may change parties, even while aiming another barb at the President.
"I have no intention of switching parties," he said in an interview. "I can be more effective inside the Democratic Party by moving them to the right. President Clinton ran as a new Democrat, and we thought we were getting a centrist. But he has not been that. In order for the President to survive, he has to move back toward the center. He's a smart politician and very resilient, and I think he'll do that."
So far it appears that Mr. Shelby has not been hurt at home by his outspoken criticism of the President and his brazen flirtation with Republican positions.
 
Plenty of Applause
 Indeed, the luncheon audience on Tuesday at the noncommissioned officers club at Fort Rucker applauded enthusiastically as the Senator criticized the crime bill as "watered down" and described the Administration's health care proposal as "unwise, unwanted and unworkable."
Natalie Davis, a pollster and political science professor at Birmingham Southern College, said polls showed Mr. Shelby with a 67 percent approval rating, as against a 48 percent approval rating for the state's senior Senator, Howell Heflin, another Democrat.
Mr. Heflin probably votes as conservatively as Mr. Shelby, and against the President just as often, but with less fanfare.
"Bashing Clinton is becoming a political plus for Shelby," Ms. Davis said. "He's politically astute, and I suspect there is a good deal of calculation in what he does."
As Mr. Shelby threaded his way through the luncheon gathering here, Mayor Johnny Henderson of Enterprise said the Senator was "a patriot and a fine American" for eschewing partisan politics and the party line.
Mayor Henderson said it did not matter whether Mr. Shelby switched parties because "no matter what side of the aisle he is on, he is going to vote his convictions."
 
Criticism From Blacks
 But the Senator's anti-Administration posture has worn thin with some blacks, who represent nearly 30 percent of Alabama voters and more than 40 percent of the dependable Democratic primary vote in the state.
James Jarmon, a school principal and City Councilman in Ozark, said that lately he and many other black voters were disappointed with Mr. Shelby for his opposition to changes in the health care system that would put the cost of increased coverage on employers, and for the Senator's opposition to the crime bill.
Mr. Jarmon also said he was disappointed with Mr. Shelby's constant criticism of Mr. Clinton and with the Senator's attacks on the municipal government in the District of Columbia, which is predominantly black.
"I hear rumors that he might go to the Republican Party," Mr. Jarmon said, "and the fact is for me, it wouldn't matter that much if he did. Initially, he had strong black and white support, but lately he seems to want to pick a fight and be combative with the Administration."
But Jack Drake, a lawyer from Tuscaloosa and a member of the state Democratic Committee, said Mr. Shelby's opposition to the Administration had been exaggerated, perhaps for its effect back home on conservative voters.
Mr. Drake, who describes himself as a liberal and friend of Mr. Shelby, said Mr. Shelby had supported the Administration more often than not.
Mr. Shelby noted that he had for the most part been solidly behind the President on foreign policy. He also pointed out that he had deferred to the President on most Cabinet and sub-Cabinet appointments, although he thought many were "not the strongest."
But, still, when it comes to "core values," like taxes and "the economic well-being of America," Mr. Shelby said, he would not hesitate to criticize.
"I could look the other way on these issues," he said, "but it would be intellectually dishonest. I see myself as a Harry Truman Democrat, someone who is outspoken, who knows who he is and who knows where he comes from."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Agrees to Pact for Venture

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
A computer-chip company from California and I.B.M. announced yesterday that they had reached agreement on a joint manufacturing venture that could bring as many as 700 jobs over the next three years to the mid-Hudson Valley, where I.B.M. has laid off thousands of employees in the last two years.
Supported by $40 million in low-interest loans from New York State, the computer-chip company, the Cirrus Logic Corporation of Fremont, Calif., plans to invest $100 million in the new operation. Cirrus Logic and International Business Machines, based in Armonk, N.Y., have agreed to convert an existing I.B.M. plant in East Fishkill in Dutchess County to supply each company with semiconductors used in computers and other electronic equipment. 
 "Born and bred by I.B.M. over many years, the Hudson Valley talent pool is very attractive," said Tom Rigoli, a spokesman for Cirrus Logic. "We think it is without peer as a location for world-class chip-manufacturing talent."
 
Direct Involvement
 Until now, Cirrus Logic has relied on 14 independent computer-chip manufacturing plants around the world to produce its advanced integrated circuit designs. This is the first time that the company, which had revenues of about $350 million last year, has decided to become more directly involved in making its own semiconductors.
The joint venture, to be called MICRUS and run by Stanley J. Grubel, a former I.B.M. executive, will also provide I.B.M. with the microelectronic devices it now makes on its own.
The project, which was first disclosed in January, is expected to be operating by early next year, Mr. Rigoli said. Specific terms of the agreement were not revealed because some details remain to be worked out.

HEADLINE: Tenacious Lawyer Turns Exxon Spill Into Pollution Case for the Ages

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
In the annals of the environmental bar there has never been a trial like the one against the Exxon Corporation that began last May and is about to end in Federal District Court in Anchorage.
Like Alaska itself, everything about the Exxon Valdez disaster and its legal aftermath was oversized. The 1989 oil spill, 11 million gallons, was the largest ever by a tanker in North American waters. About 15,000 fishermen and other Alaskan plaintiffs sued Exxon, asserting that the spill had destroyed their livelihoods. 
 Exxon, the tanker's owner, is the world's richest energy company. Its senior executives, who by the time the trial began had already spent $3.4 billion restoring Prince William Sound and compensating victims, believed they had adequately proved their contrition. Vowing not to settle, they unleashed the company's vast coffers to hire a defense army that included scores of lawyers, scientists and economists.
 
Plaintiffs' Leader Emerges
 But what really transformed an already sensational pollution case into a transcendent political event was the emergence of Brian O'Neill, a rumpled, stubborn, mouthy 47-year-old Minneapolis lawyer, as the leader of the plaintiff's trial team.
Educated at West Point, Mr. O'Neill learned long ago how to define tactics and manage conflict. In court, he attacked relentlessly, repeatedly accusing Exxon's witnesses of lying. Outside court, he dominated the public debate, laying so many verbal mines in Exxon's path that the company's lawyers unsuccessfully sought in June to have him muzzled by the judge, H. Russel Holland.
Typical of his attacks was Mr. O'Neill's assertion in May that Exxon was "too big to give a damn about its people."
"And it's too big to give a damn about the public," he added.
The aim of such attacks, he said in a recent interview, was to transform the case against Exxon into a binding referendum in which 11 jurors were afforded a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to send a message to the big boys.
"Multinational corporations have a franchise that you don't have and that I don't have," Mr. O'Neill said, echoing the thrust of his closing arguments. "They get a franchise to take our oil out of the ground. They get a franchise to be rich and wealthy and respected beyond most people's dreams. And with that franchise comes responsibility to behave. This case will teach those people who have those franchises that they are responsible."
Maybe. So far, the first two of the trial's three stages have been a draw. In phase one, which ended on June 13, the jury decided in Mr. O'Neill's favor and determined that the disaster had been caused by reckless behavior by the tanker's captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood, and Exxon's senior executives.
In phase two, which ended in August, the jury seemed to side with Exxon when it awarded Mr. O'Neill's clients $286.8 million, only a third of the compensatory damages they had requested. The verdict forms that jurors sent to Judge Holland clearly indicated their rejection of large chunks of Mr. O'Neill's case.
Now both sides await a decision in phase three, in which the jury will decide whether Mr. O'Neill's clients deserve a punitive damage award and, if so, how much.
Mr. O'Neill's aggressive courtroom tactics and his public taunts made him the trial's dominating personality.
James Neal, the 65-year-old former Watergate prosecutor from Nashville who heads Exxon's trial team, regularly mocked his adversary in court, often beginning his cross-examinations by sarcastically quoting him. As the trial wore on, the personal animosity became palpable. One afternoon in late July, Mr. Neal and Mr. O'Neill left a hearing jaw to jaw, voices pitched, each accusing the other of low-ball tactics.
Exxon executives and lawyers repeatedly declined to discuss Mr. O'Neill's work. But in an interview in June, Patrick Lynch, an Exxon lawyer, said that the amount of money Mr. O'Neill and his team was seeking indicated they were driven by greed.
"This is a group of plaintiffs' lawyers whose basic interest is the profit motive," said Mr. Lynch, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles.
Mr. O'Neill has fomented almost as much antipathy on his own team. The job of organizing and disciplining a group that included some of the nation's most talented environmental lawyers meant months of shouting, arguing and often brutally trampling egos. During much of the trial, members of his team said, the plaintiff's legal office at the corner of Ninth and K Streets in Anchorage was a cauldron of backbiting and second-guessing.
"Before we started the trial, Brian was a 100-pound gorilla," Lynn Sarko, a member of the team from the Keller Rohrback firm in Seattle, said in July. "Now he's an 800-pound gorilla."
Mr. Sarko added, "Dealing with Brian in this trial you needed a really thick skin."
Brian Boru O'Neill was born on June 7, 1947, in Hancock, Mich., but spent no time there. His father, an Army engineer, kept the family on the move. Brian was the oldest of six children, and he excelled in school. As a senior at West Point, he was a leader of the class of 1969, being named one of the 76 cadet captains.
After two years in Europe with a gunnery division, Mr. O'Neill returned to the United States and took a three-year leave of absence from the Army to attend the University of Michigan Law School, graduating in the top five of his class in 1974. He rejoined the Army and after a short tour with the Army General Counsel's office in Washington, he resigned his commission in 1977 and joined Faegre & Benson, Minneapolis's second-oldest and second-largest corporate law firm.
He had already developed an interest in environmental law, but in the late 1970's the practice paid little. So by day Mr. O'Neill represented inventors in patent infringement lawsuits and took other business cases that eventually made him one of Faegre & Benson's top earners, said John French, the firm's managing partner. By night and on the weekends, he built a separate practice, suing the Government and others over environmental issues.
 
Environmental Successes
 In his 17 years at Faegre & Benson, Mr. O'Neill has won lawsuits that curtailed grizzly bear hunting in Montana, protected wolves in northern Minnesota and compelled the Federal Government to withdraw strychnine as a pesticide. He also won a $10 million judgment against Union Oil in an industrial pollution case in Minnesota.
By 1992, when he took a case involving the Endangered Species Act all the way to the Supreme Court, where he lost, Mr. O'Neill had established himself as one of the nation's leading environmental lawyer-advocates, an image he relished.
Until recently, he wore his hair to his shoulders and favored shorts, T-shirts and sandals at the office, even in winter. Some colleagues at Faegre & Benson grimaced at his name, hated his clients and loathed his style.
"It's fair to say that Brian is on the radical edge -- or considered that by the firm because of the magnitude of the cases and the notoriety," said Steve Shroer, a Faegre & Benson partner who has worked with Mr. O'Neill in Alaska and elsewhere for years. "And, frankly, Brian doesn't help himself much. He's a very vocal guy."
Mr. O'Neill was nearing his 42d birthday when he read the first accounts of the Exxon Valdez spill. The early facts impressed him: thousands of dead birds and otters; a $1 billion fishing industry threatened; a captain whose blood alcohol level violated Federal rules for commanding a supertanker.
But his path to the top of the plaintiff's legal team was far from direct. The first stop was Soldotna, a fishing village on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage, where two Alaska lawyers, Pete Earhardt and Chuck Robinson, were suing British Petroleum and the owners of the tanker Glacier Bay over an oil spill in July 1987 in the Upper Cook Inlet.
Estimates of that spill ranged from 40,000 to 150,000 gallons, and Alaska had closed the upper inlet to salmon fishing, temporarily stripping more than 800 fishermen of their livelihood.
Mr. O'Neill saw the case as his entree to the Exxon Valdez suit because the two lawsuits shared the same clients. He persuaded the Soldotna lawyers to let him try the Glacier Bay case, and by the middle of that summer, Mr. O'Neill and a young partner, Gerry Nolting, had assembled a team of Faegre & Benson lawyers.
 
$51 Million Dress Rehearsal
 The case turned into a dress rehearsal for the Exxon Valdez trial; in addition to clients, it shared similar economic theories as well as the judge, Mr. Holland, who had been appointed to the Federal bench by President Ronald Reagan.
On Sept. 5, 1991, the jury in the Glacier Bay case returned a decisive verdict, and British Petroleum, the tanker's owners and their insurers, eventually agreed to pay $51.3 million in damages, at the time the largest award ever in an oil spill.
Immediately after the Glacier Bay trial, Mr. O'Neill began attending the regular meetings in Seattle of plaintiffs' lawyers in the Exxon Valdez case. By that time, most of the work on the case was progressing well. The exception was the assessment of financial losses, the heart of the case, which was in disarray, said David Oesting, who coordinated the plaintiff's trial preparations.
Mr. O'Neill, having just proved he could build a successful case by accumulating the same sort of evidence, saw his opening, and in 1992 he took charge of assembling the damage assessment. By July 1993, he had completed a comprehensive study that solidified his standing as a manager and tactician.
When it came time to name the leader of the Federal trial, "he really had no competition," said Mr. Oesting, manager of the Anchorage office of Davis, Wright & Tremaine of Seattle.
"He had proven himself in the Glacier Bay case," Mr. Oesting said. "He had a good relationship with Judge Holland. His firm was obviously committed. And he had shown himself to be one smart, tough lawyer. And with this crew of lawyers on our side and the other crew opposing us, you had to be that."
The stakes are enormous for both sides. If Exxon loses, the cost could be billions of dollars and further damage to the company's image. If Mr. O'Neill loses, his clients will recover only a fraction of what they say they have lost, and the plaintiffs' law firms will recoup less than the $100 million they say the case has cost them -- $20 million in direct expenses and $80 million in lawyers' time.
But Mr. O'Neill argues that the highest cost could well be to the environment. If Exxon wins, he said, law firms will be discouraged for years from tackling such cases.
"If we fail, then this whole tactic that companies are using -- that we are big enough and wealthy enough to grind anybody into the ground in court -- will have been proven to work in the biggest environmental case yet."

HEADLINE: Fed Deputy Denies Rift With Chief

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Seeking to calm a controversy over whether he is soft on inflation, Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, took the unusual step today of defending remarks he made at a recent conference and saying he does not differ with his colleagues over monetary policy.
Mr. Blinder said that stories about an intellectual split at the top of the Fed were "alleged news." And he added that he and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had similar monetary policy beliefs but used different rhetoric to explain them. "There is no rift between the chairman of the Federal Reserve and myself," he said in a speech this morning to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. 
 Speaking broadly of his 18 colleagues on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy committee, Mr. Blinder said, "I don't believe there are any current operational differences of any significance."
Nevertheless, Mr. Blinder today reiterated many of the same positions that he advanced in the speech in Wyoming on Aug. 27 that started the controversy. In that speech he said that when unemployment was high, lowering it should be a legitimate short-term goal of the central bank and that the Fed should use interest rates to do that, as well as to keep inflation in check.
 
Meaning Not Clear
 And his statement that there are no operational differences was left undefined. It could mean that that Mr. Blinder has no problems with Fed policy now because the central bank is pushing interest rates higher while unemployment is low. But Mr. Blinder explicitly left open the possibility of future disagreements with his colleagues on whether creating new jobs should sometimes take precedence over fighting inflation.
Because unemployment now is lower than it has been in years, the practical significance of Mr. Blinder's remarks is slight for the interest rates that Americans pay on everything from car loans to home mortgages.
Mr. Blinder, who has been at the Fed only since June, was clearly worried today about the storm in monetary policy circles that his remarks in Wyoming provoked and which could endanger his prospects of becoming chairman when Mr. Greenspan's term expires in early 1996. Mr. Blinder said today that he had originally intended to give another speech to the mortgage bankers but changed his plans after the stir over his Wyoming speech.
After today's speech, Mr. Blinder also took the highly unusual step of holding an unscheduled news conference to respond to further questions on the issue. It was the first news conference by a chairman or vice chairman of the Federal Reserve in several years.
While Mr. Blinder said he would continue to explain Fed policy publicly, he added that one possible moral of the controversy "is that if you are on a central bank board, you ought to keep your mouth shut because anything you say is likely to be exaggerated -- and I must admit I'm considering that moral more than I did before."
Mr. Blinder suggested today that his Wyoming comments, expressed in the highly technical terms of an economist addressing other economists, might have been exaggerated. He said he had emphasized the potential role of central banks in reducing short-term unemployment because he was speaking there at a conference on unemployment. "Had I been speaking at a conference on price stability, I certainly would have emphasized that there is no long-run trade-off," he said today.
 
Referred to Colleagues
 But he declined to answer whether there were any philosophical splits, referring reporters instead to his colleagues. Some of these colleagues, who have insisted on anonymity, have expressed discomfort in the last two weeks with Mr. Blinder's ideas.
Mr. Greenspan, who attended the conference in Wyoming and listened to Mr. Blinder's speech, has said nothing publicly to extricate his vice chairman from the current dispute, and declined to comment today.
In the arcane world of interest-rate policy, even subtle differences in rhetoric can take on tremendous importance in financial markets as possible guides to future Fed policy. Federal Reserve officials and Wall Street economists said that the views that Mr. Blinder expressed in Wyoming could signal future policy clashes over interest rates if unemployment and inflation rose.
High unemployment confronts central bankers with a choice between reducing short-term unemployment with low interest rates or controlling inflation with high interest rates. Mr. Blinder's comments today and in Wyoming strongly suggested that he would be more reluctant than his colleagues to raise interest rates when unemployment is high.
 
Views in Wyoming
 Mr. Blinder said in Wyoming that he thought the Federal Reserve should try to reduce unemployment and inflation in the short run, but should focus only on controlling inflation in the long run.
The experience of the 1970's soured most Federal Reserve officials on trying to do anything more than controlling inflation. Yet enthusiasm for a broader Federal Reserve mandate remains strong in the academic circles in which Mr. Blinder, a former chairman of Princeton University's economics department, has spent most of his life.
Mr. Blinder said in Wyoming that he thought the mistakes of the 1970's could be avoided by raising interest rates quickly in response to outside shocks to the economy, like the sudden rise in oil prices in 1974.
He said that he agreed with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that interest-rate policy could be used only in the long run to hold down inflation, and could not be used to suppress unemployment over the long term. Allowing higher inflation through low interest rates can only hold down unemployment in the short term, he said.
Mr. Greenspan has said that "ephemeral" reductions in unemployment could be achieved by allowing inflation to rise, but has never defined what this meant. Mr. Blinder said in an interview on Aug. 28 in Wyoming that the reductions were not ephemeral but that they did not last more than a year or two.
But some of Mr. Blinder's remarks today seemed likely to keep alive the perception in monetary policy circles of an intellectual division at the Fed.
 
Laws Termed Inadequate
 Mr. Blinder repeated today his view, strongly expressed in Wyoming, that current laws were adequate in calling for the Federal Reserve to pursue both maximum employment and low inflation. Mr. Greenspan has testified before Congress in favor of amending the Federal Reserve Act to require that the central bank set interest rates only with an eye to holding down inflation.
Many economists nonetheless believe that in practice, Mr. Greenspan has for a long time run monetary policy with at least some attention to holding down unemployment, and would continue to do so even if the law was changed.
Financial economists said that the interest-rate policy positions implied by Mr. Blinder's often theoretical speech today were different from Mr. Greenspan's positions, but only in subtle ways that had no relevance to current interest rates. Mr. Blinder "just does believe much more in the appropriateness of using monetary policy in aiming at more targets than just inflation," said Richard B. Berner, a senior vice president and chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: Harlem Family Battles Burden of the Past

SERIES: Another America: Life on 129th Street -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
It was an exquisitely bad day in a time of long, bad days. The washing machine broke and the food stamps ran out. Despite scores of phone calls, the welfare caseworker could not promise Vikki the bigger apartment she needed to care for the three cousins she was raising and the baby she was expecting.
In a gloomy apartment in Harlem, Vikki, 26, has been waging a lonely campaign to keep it all together. Once a key figure in a local drug operation, she is unemployed, diabetic and overweight. She is the legal guardian of the cousins, whose drug-addicted and abusive parents abandoned them long ago to foster care. 
 Three years ago, when she optimistically became their guardian, she was sure she could do better for the boys, Shawn and David, who are brothers, and Lenny, their cousin. Today they always need more: more money, more food, more love.
"I didn't consider how much it would take to raise these kids," Vikki said. "I just thought we'd all be together and nobody would beat us and we'd get regular meals."
Because the family's life had been so desperate, Vikki decided to have an abortion this summer. She learned that her boyfriend had two other pregnant girlfriends, she said, and she did not want to raise another child on welfare.
On 129th Street, between Malcolm X Boulevard and Fifth Avenue, the traditional family is harder to find than ever. The replacement families vary.
In some apartments, teen-age mothers on welfare double up to get by. In others, the exhausted female companions of grandfathers comfort the children of imprisoned mothers. Other households are headed by children in their teens because their parents are gone, for whatever reason.
The families on 129th street are no different than others in American cities with a growing and increasingly desperate black underclass. In these poor communities people shift through the debris of failed dreams to salvage what they can.
In Vikki's home, a single overhead bulb illuminates the narrow living room, situated in the middle of three small bedrooms. The lineoleum floor is dirty and missing some tiles. Three steel folding chairs sit along the baseboard. The only window overlooks an enclosure filled with junk.
The family members insisted that their full names not be used.
The apartment is the only stable home Shawn, 13, and David, 20, have known, and Vikki is the only real parent they've ever had. She said their mother died of cirrhosis of the liver last October; their father died of AIDS in April.
The bottom bunk bed in Shawn's room belonged to 17-year-old Lenny, who once slept on a park bench to avoid abusive relatives. He is now locked up on Rikers Island for selling drugs. Vikki said he wanted the money to buy school clothes.
Despite such setbacks, Vikki tries to sweeten life in little ways. On Sundays, she often puts together a huge Sunday dinner of "the kids' " favorite foods, like greens and corn bread, baked macaroni, chicken and lasagna. She makes sure that Shawn does his homework, in between his trips to the Y.M.C.A. to play basketball and study karate. She does the laundry and housekeeping and travels to the Bronx every other week to buy cheaper and fresher groceries than she can find in Harlem.
 
Food, Affection, Advice
 Other young people on the block regularly gather at the apartment looking for a meal, affection or advice from Vikki.
Recently, she has been looking for "some kind of role model" for Shawn, a listless child who is animated only when he talks about karate. He has refused the help of at least two psychotherapists.
Vikki doesn't always know what support to offer David. His friends are being picked off by drugs, violence and jail. He is frustrated by his inability to get anywhere without a high school diploma.
The mood in the first-floor apartment is often somber, as Shawn, David and Vikki try to take life one day at a time.
 
The Boys
Quiet Sorrows, Lasting Pain
 Shawn, short and wiry, with slanted almond eyes, flashed a crooked smile whenever someone commented on his wounded expression. It was last March, and Shawn, who never really knew his mother, had just re-established a relationship with his father, who used to beat him so badly that the neighbors would hear him sobbing for hours. For years he lived in foster homes and with other relatves.
Every day in the weeks before his father died, the boy with arms like matchsticks slowly pushed a heavy mop around the apartment, but a bad smell lingered. Perhaps it came from the black cat, Lucky, or the garbage in the hallway. After school, Shawn often went to his room and sat on the lower bunk bed, twisting his hands and staring into space.
These days Shawn insists that he is O.K., although as his father lay dying in a Veterans Administration hospital he skipped school and gambled away his sneakers in a basketball game. In July, he ran away from home for four days and returned without comment, missing Vikki's 26th-birthday party. He calls Vikki "Ma" but does not like her to touch or comfort him.
As a mother, he said his cousin "is not strict like she's supposed to be."
"It's not too good around here," Shawn said of the neighborhood. "When I grow up, if nothing happens to me, I want to leave."
Shawn's favorite subject in school is reading and he wants to be a karate instructor. He does not like to talk about his feelings. On the streets, he has the jaunty, exaggerated bounce of a homeboy.
 
A Palpable Sadness
 David has his own sorrows. A thin young man who often wears his hair in braids, he is a high-school dropout who works as a day-care center assistant. He is a quiet loner with a palpable sadness. Occasionally he shares in the family's social life, as he did the other day when one of the young men on the block came by with a tape of one of his rap songs.
"I just recently started thinking about about all that stuff, my grandmother's house, the foster homes," David said. "That stayed with us so long we were cold toward each other," he said, speaking of his relationship with Shawn.
"It took us a long time to open up to each other. Shawn never talks. Never."
David said he thinks of Vikki like a mother but family life is not for him. He hates the idea of having his own wife and children. His immediate future includes getting a high school equivalency degree or entering the Job Corps.
"I'd rather be alone, secluded from society," he said.
 
Worrisome Talk
 Vikki worries when she hears talk like that. She also worries that she set a bad example for Lenny. To make ends meet on $700 a month in welfare and disability payments, she rented space to drug dealers in their first-floor apartment in the six-story tenement.
A stereo system is all that remains of the drug money. Vikki and her friends spent the rest on nightclubs, clothes, taxicabs hired for two- and three-hour stretches and restaurants like Red Lobster and the International House of Pancakes.
The "crew" of drug dealers broke all Vikki's furniture during long nights of rough-housing. She no longer has a telephone because the dealers made so many expensive calls.
 
The Past
 Scars That Show, Scars That Don't

When Vikki was young, her family consisted of her mother, herself and her older sister, nicknamed Pookie. Their mother, a communications specialist in the Air Force, and their father, a supermarket manager, divorced when Vikki was 2. Her mother remarried, but Vikki doesn't remember her stepfather ever having a steady job.
One morning 12 years ago, after a night of fighting, her stepfather flung acid on the two girls. During the fight Pookie had accused him of molesting her. Both suffered burns on their faces and upper bodies. Vikki said that the last thing she remembers is a schoolteacher who lived down the hall sprinkling her with cold water and praying.
Vikki said she is bitter that her mother, who lives upstairs in Vikki's building, separated from her stepfather but never divorced him. She said that he was never punished for his crime. He is now dying of AIDS, and Vikki -- who is usually unfailingly kind -- said she is glad that he will soon be dead.
The attack left Vikki with dark scars on her face and arms. She tries to hide the way it made her feel.
 
Acting Out in School
 In her youth it was harder to hide the pain; she acted out in school by fighting and cutting class. Her mother shipped her off to live with various relatives, and at one point, she was among eight children and three adults who lived in a two-bedroom apartment in a Bronx housing project. The children's parents had problems: they were addicts or abusive or in jail.
"I used to fight and argue with my cousins all the time," Vikki said. "They smoked crack. I couldn't stand it. My mind was not into school. My mind was into getting enough money to get out of my grandmother's house."
She felt increasingly distraught and restless as she watched her family deteriorate, Vikki said. She took a succession of jobs to help out, from flipping hamburgers to working as a hospital orderly. She helped supervise her boyfriend's drug operation but managed to take a few classes at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.
Pookie went to live with other relatives and eventually became a licensed practical nurse. Although their lives are different, Vikki describes her relationship with her sister as close. Pookie lives in New Jersey now and offers support and advice on rearing "the kids."
 
The Future
Nurturing Hope In a Bleak Time
 The buzzer kept sounding, bringing bad news. Mel, another drug dealer for whom Vikki once worked, was in the hospital because of complications from the shooting last April that left him paralyzed. There were problems with his catheter and an infected bedsore.
Another friend had just found out she was pregnant and wanted to know if she could hold in her stomach to hide it.
Then there were the girls with babies, girls so young that it seemed the babies should have been dolls instead of flesh and blood. They showed off their children and talked about baby clothes, baby weight, problems with food stamps, housing and teen-age fathers.
 
Why So Young?
 "I sit down and ask some young girls why they have babies so young," Vikki said. "They say they want someone to love, someone to call their own. A lot of them have lost their parent. They weren't raised with a father or a mother. You get a boyfriend and try to keep him."
"A lot of guys are on a baby kick, have their baby," she said. "I guess they think it makes them a man."
One of the girls, who did not want her name used, had run away from home. She was 15, her baby was 5 months old, and she and her mother were fighting. Her mother, still at home with two young boys, was pregnant again.
"Do you have anything to eat?" she asked.
The only thing in the house that evening was a bag of Pepperidge Farm Lemon Nut Crunch cookies, so that was what they ate.
"I'm planning to get my own apartment with another girl," the young woman said. "Somewhere nice, not around here."
"I want a good job, so I can take care of my baby," she said. "I don't want to be on welfare, like my mother."
 
Dreams Are Hard to Hold
 Vikki has her dreams, as well, but they are getting harder to hold.
"There are days when I just sit here," she said in the month before her abortion, as the days become longer and her abdomen expanded. "I don't know. I never had bills before. To take care of a whole household and pay bills.
"I want the all-time American dream: husband, kids, a house with a picket fence, two incomes, my kids in colleges, vacations with my kids wherever I want," Vikki said. "What's going to happen to me? My goal is to go into nursing and somewhere down the line be a doctor."
Vikki admits that becoming a doctor is unlikely because of the time and the expense involved. She has a plan, but her voice drops with mingled embarrassment and resignation as she talks about it.
"I be thinking if I can make enough money once dealing drugs, $5,000 or $10,000, I can invest," she said.
 
Another America

HEADLINE: Wall St. Rally Spurred By High-Tech Stocks

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks posted solid gains yesterday as fresh buying in high-technology stocks touched off a rally in the broader market.
The Dow Jones industrial average broke back through the 3,900 level, rising 22.21 points to close at 3,908.46. 
 In the broader market, advancing issues led declining ones, 1,319 to 837, on New York Stock Exchange volume of 296 million shares, up slightly from 292.1 million on Wednesday.
A second day of gains in technology stocks led the way for other stocks to rise, despite a flat bond market, analysts said.
"Sustainable leadership has been hard to find," said Gerry Simmons, manager of equity trading at Interstate/Johnson Lane. "Probably the closest thing we have had to it recently has been technology."
The Nasdaq composite index, often a barometer for technology stocks, rose 5.02 points, or 0.66 percent, to 769.30, after a 4.80-point rise Wednesday.
Some traders said the Nasdaq market was benefiting from buying by portfolio managers who missed Wall Street's August rally and were now searching for laggards.
"They're focusing on the Nasdaq because Nasdaq has lagged the broader market," said Leon Brand, global market strategist at NatWest Securities.
Among technology stocks riding the buying wave were the Compaq Computer Corporation, up 1 1/8, to 36 5/8; Hewlett-Packard, up 2 1/4, to 90, and the Microsoft Corporation, up 11/16 , to 5715/16 .
The stock market's strength in the face of a steady bond market raised some eyebrows, especially ahead of today's potentially volatile report on August producer prices.
"You don't see the kind of the optimism in bonds that you do in stocks," said Walter Revis, market analyst at Principal Financial Securities. "I think we're seeing a little bit of a buying frenzy right here. That's one reason I think stocks look more dangerous than bonds in here."
Although bond traders were nervous about the producer prices report, the 30-year Treasury bond was steady and its yield was unchanged at 7.56 percent.
 
Rise in July Producer Prices
 But the stock market seemed to be anticipating a benign report on wholesale inflation. In July, producer prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent.
A negative surprise on inflation could send Wall Street into a quick retreat, analysts said. "This market doesn't forgive any surprises," Mr. Brand said.
Among individual issues, Kmart's stock rose 1/2, to 18, after the retailer said it would close 110 stores in the United States and cut about 6,000 jobs in a restructuring of its core discount store business.
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing climbed 1 3/4, to 56 3/8. It said it expects its earnings per share to increase by 10 percent a year on average over the next three years.
I.B.M.rose 3/8, to 67 7/8, and Cirrus Logic gained 1 7/8, to 31, after they announced a joint venture to make semiconductor wafers.
Citicorp gained 1 1/8, to 44 7/8. Prudential Securities named it "single best idea" and raised its earnings forecasts.
Shares in Contel Cellular soared 5 3/4, to 23 1/2, on news that GTE had offered $22.50 a share for the 10 percent stake in Contel held by the public. GTE, which owns the other 90 percent, finished up 1/8, to 30 7/8.
Informix fell 1 3/4, to 23 1/4. Merrill Lynch downgraded its opinion of the stock.
Shares of 20th Century Industries fell 3 1/8, to 9 1/2, after it said its earthquake expenses were expected to rise to $815 million from the previously estimated $685 million.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.15, to 473.14. The American Stock Exchange index gained 0.19, to 455.51.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.04, to 260.82.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Rose During July

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Consumers increased their borrowing in July for the 16th consecutive month, though less briskly than in previous months, the Federal Reserve said today.
Total consumer installment credit outstanding grew by $5.57 billion, at a 7.9 percent annual rate, down from a revised $11.16 billion increase in June when credit was rising at a 16 percent annual rate. Previously, the Fed had said June credit rose $10.89 billion. 
 In separate reports today, the Commerce Department said a survey of companies showed they planned to increase spending on new plants and equipment at the highest rate in five years, and the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week. The number of jobless claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 330,000 for the week that ended on Sept. 3, down 3,000 from the previous week.
 
 
Borrowing Costs
 The increase in consumer credit came as consumers' borrowing costs continued to rise. In an effort to head off inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates five times this year, lifting rates on consumer loans.
The Fed's report showed that automobile loans increased $4.14 billion, at a 16.5 percent annual rate, in July, down from $4.97 billion, at a 20 percent rate, in June.
Similarly, growth in revolving, or credit-card, credit eased in July to $3.66 billion, or an annual rate of 14 percent. This credit increased in June by $4 billion, at a rate of 15.6 percent a year.
 
 
'Other Credit'
 The big change came in a category called "other credit," which includes loans for buying mobile homes, boats, trailers and vacations. This credit contracted $2.23 billion in July, at an 11.3 percent annual rate, after growing in June by $2.19 billion, at an 11.2 percent annual rate.
The Commerce Department's survey of 5,000 companies in July and August found that they intended to increase spending in 1994 by 8.8 percent, to $638.4 billion -- the biggest rise since 1989, when investment jumped 11.4 percent.
The investment survey showed growing optimism, notably among manufacturers, that prospects were good for improving business. The new survey updated one done in April and May in which companies said they would raise 1994 spending by a smaller, 8.3 percent. The investment plans for 1994 are up from increases of 7.3 percent in 1993 and 3.4 percent in 1992.
 
 
'Not Surprising'
 "Given the kind of economic growth we've seen, it's not surprising that corporations want to improve their capacity," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis.
The latest investment survey showed manufacturers, who traditionally offer better-paying jobs, intend to increase spending this year by a sturdy 7.3 percent, up from an earlier estimate of 6.9 percent. That is more than double the 1993 investment rise of only 3.1 percent.
All figures are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.
Nonmanufacturing businesses like airlines and utilities said they planned to increase spending by 9.5 percent this year from 1993. They raised capital spending in 1993 by 9.3 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Comments By German and U.S. Aides

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar gained some strength yesterday after German officials and senior Clinton Administration aides said the American currency was undervalued.
Traders said the dollar also received support from speculation that high-level trade talks between the United States and Japan were making some progress. But they said there was no basic underlying economic reason for a greater dollar demand. 
 "It was one of these days of concerted jawboning," said David de Rosa, a director at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. "A lot of people said they wanted the dollar to go higher."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 99.60 Japanese yen, up from 99.45 yen on Wednesday. It also rose to 1.5568 German marks from 1.5507 marks.
Currency traders said the dollar received an early lift from remarks by Hans-Jurgen Krupp, a member of the German Bundesbank's council, who said the strength in the American economy did not justify the dollar's weak level. A day earlier, Mr. Krupp also helped strengthen the dollar by asserting that interest rates in Germany should come down.
Later in the United States, top American officials talked up the dollar further.
"It's verbal support, I would call it," said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the President for economic affairs, said the Administration had "made clear that we'd like to see a stronger dollar."
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said he was "cautiously optimistic" about trade talks with Japan.
The United States has imposed a Sept. 30 deadline for progress on reducing Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States and opening up that country's market wider to American imports.
"I think we're going to go right down to the wire," Mr. Johnson said of the high-level talks.
Many currency traders believe that if negotiations fail, the Clinton Administration would encourage a lower dollar. That would make Japanese goods more expensive in the United States, hurting Japan's exporters.
The dollar also picked up support against the mark amid continued speculation that the Bundesbank would cut German interest rates to improve that country's economy. Lower rates tend to weaken a currency's attractiveness.
Meanwhile, the British pound slipped to $1.5445 in New York, from $1.5448 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Kyocera Told It Has to Pay

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The Kyocera Corporation, a Japanese disk drive manufacturer, said today that an arbitration court ordered it to pay $257 million to the Lapine Technology Corporation and the Prudential-Bache Trade Corporation for breach of contract.
Kyocera's American depository receipts fell $4, to $143.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The decision was made by the arbitration court of the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce, a Kyocera official said.
Kyocera will seek to have the order reversed at a United States district court in California, he said. "This judgment is erroneous and illegitimate in terms of fact and legal judgement," Kyocera said in a statement.
In 1984, Kyocera contracted with Lapine and Prudential to produce 3.5-inch hard disk drives used as memory devices for computers. The disk drives were developed and marketed by Lapine. Lapine was financed and managed by Prudential, Kyocera said.
Lapine is owned by the LaPine Holding Company, in which Prudential has a two-thirds stake and Kyocera has the rest.

Historical Society to Sell
G. Oliver Koppell, the New York State Attorney General, has finally permitted the New-York Historical Society to sell about $20 million worth of art and objects from its collection. The proceeds are to go toward the museum's endowment, which covers some of its operating costs as well as the care of the society's art collection and library. But the sale, expected to take place at Sotheby's in New York early next year, will proceed in a highly unusual fashion.
In an attempt to raise the most money for the financially troubled institution while giving other New York State institutions a break, Sotheby's, the attorney general and the society have come up with what they are calling a "pre-emption plan," whereby New York State museums, libraries and archives will have a right of first refusal to buy items at a discount, but only after the auction. Buyers will be informed before the sale that in fact, they may not be buying at all. If an institution decides it wants a work of art or an object that has been auctioned, that can in effect void the sale of that item to the private bidder. 
 "This seems like the best way of balancing all the interests involved," said Miner H. Warner, the chairman of the historical society.
Mr. Koppell said he had long been negotiating with the society. "They've convinced us that this is necessary," he said. "We realize people have an emotional response to deaccessioning, but we think we have safeguarded the public's interests as well as the interests in the city and the state who have a financial investment in this institution."
New York institutions will be able to buy items after the sale at a graduated discount: 10 percent of the bid price for works costing $25,000 or less, 5 percent for items selling for $25,000 to $100,000, and 3 percent for items selling for more than $100,000, providing that the item sells for more than its high estimate. For works that don't find buyers at auction, the Attorney General's office will have to approve sales item by item.
Mr. Warner said the society was prepared to provide financing for up to five years at commercial interest rates. In addition, institutions may not sell their purchases for 10 years.
While the society will not confirm exactly what it is selling, Mr. Warner said none of its core collection would be auctioned. Eighty percent of the value of what is thought by art experts to be up for sale comes from a group of European paintings, 10 of which have been on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 1978. In addition, the experts say the society is planning to sell much of its European paperweight collection, furniture that is not of museum quality, and redundancies in its silver collection, as well as a group of smaller collectibles.
 
Rescuing 'Three Graces'
 In Britain, Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Dutch-born industrialist and art collector, has become something of a white knight. Last week, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London announced that the baron had pledged the remaining $1.2 million needed to prevent Canova's "Three Graces" from leaving England. But to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., his philanthropic gesture is yet another slap in the face for the museum's five-year struggle to export the 19th-century marble statue of Venus's handmaidens.
"We have been treated very shabbily by a country that taught us fair play," said John Walsh, the director of the Getty.
When the museum learned of the baron's contribution, and heard that it was made on the condition that the statue be exhibited in Spain, it issued a statement saying: "It now seems to us that anything that will frustrate the 'Three Graces' being put on permanent display at the Getty Museum is acceptable to Britain, even if it means endangering the statue itself. Sculpture experts who know that statue well agree that it should not be moved any more than is absolutely necessary."
The Getty was willing to pay nearly $12 million to the current seller, an unidentified Cayman Islands corporation; completion of the sale depended upon obtaining an export license from the British Government. But on Aug. 9, Britain's National Heritage Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, imposed a second three-month delay on exporting the sculpture to give British museums a chance to match the Getty's price and keep the artwork in Britain.
The Victoria and Albert joined forces with the National Gallery of Scotland to raise $8.94 million. (The museums say they plan to share the work.) In addition, $1.5 million came in mid-August from John Paul Getty 2d, the son of the oil baron who founded the Getty Museum; he lives in London and has been a major donor to other British fine-arts projects. Now Baron Thyssen has come up with the rest of the money.
A spokeswoman at the Victoria and Albert said that under the terms of Baron Thyssen's pledge, before the sculpture went on view in Britain it would spend six months or a year at the Villahermosa Palace, next to the Prado in Madrid, where the Baron's art collection is on public view. The baron's secretary said he was traveling and was not available for comment.
Timothy Clifford, the director of the National Gallery of Scotland, said the baron had asked only to borrow the sculpture for an exhibition planned for two years from now. "We're thrilled that it looks as though the 'Three Graces' will stay in England," Mr. Clifford said. "The Baron has plenty of connections with England. He's had two British wives, his son lives here and he keeps an apartment in London."
The Getty is going to court in London today to seek a judicial review of Secretary Dorrell's delay of the export license. "We're hoping the judge will agree that the Secretary of National Heritage acted improperly," Mr. Walsh said.
 
A Contemporary Feast
 Gerald S. Elliott's extraordinary collection of contemporary art has become a bonanza for both the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and for Christie's in New York.
Mr. Elliott, a prominent Chicago lawyer who died in March, amassed significant holdings by such important American and European artists as Bruce Nauman, Donald Judd, Richard Serra, Susan Rothenberg, Anselm Kiefer and Georg Baselitz. At his death, he left the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago 105 works: 65 paintings and sculptures, and 40 photographs. It is the museum's single largest gift.
To pay estate expenses, however, a separate group of 48 works, valued at $4 million, will go on sale at Christie's in Manhattan on Nov. 2. Included is Ms. Rothenberg's "Kelpie," a 1978 painting of two horses that the auction house estimates could sell for $350,000 to $450,000.

Did Football Send Owners To the Table?

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
IF our wonderful baseball owners can get over their gripping obsession with the salary cap, baseball fans may have to give thanks to a strange new ally: football.
My theory is that king football -- and particularly a new American sporting hero named Jeffrey Lurie -- had a great deal to do with the wonderful owners scurrying to New York yesterday. 
 We know the wonderful owners don't like to spend their own money, but there they were, splurging on full-fare, spur-of-the-moment airline tickets, to deal with this ruinous strike, now nearly a month old. About time, wouldn't you say?
It is quite likely that football pushed the owners in two different ways: First, a few diehard loonies like me may have missed baseball over the Labor Day weekend, but from what I gather, millions of others were quite occupied with football. This may have sent a shiver of mortality into the baseball owners, not otherwise known for their perceptiveness.

 The owners could see an entire September and October of North Americans settling into their dens and bars and watching brutes whacking into brutes. They are already spooked by football. They've got players trying to see a fastball in late-afternoon angled sunlight, and post-season games starting at children's bedtimes, and they won't play baseball at all on Monday nights in October because of football.
Then there is the specter of the O. J. Simpson trial, coming soon to a television set near you. This ugly melodrama is not a sports story or a football story, but it is surely a television extravaganza that could keep people from clicking the dial. The baseball owners saw the need to get back to work before their sport was totally irrelevant.
But football may have contributed to the potential end of the baseball strike in another powerful way. Football exposed the salary cap as the last refuge of weasels. Up to now, the salary cap has gotten pretty good press because it helped the National Basketball Association get its house in order. But the N.B.A. of a decade ago is not the National Football League of today.
In this brave new world, the proud owner of the New York Giants, Wellington Mara, was not able to make a large and loyal offer to his old quarterback, Phil Simms, because the Giants were backed right up against that demon of a salary cap. Mara was sad and Simms was enraged at the new order. (That George Young, who made the decision not to pay Simms, may have been right in his football judgment is a different story; Mara would have paid Simms handsomely to be a tutor in uniform.)
But the worst-case scenario of the salary cap happened in Philadelphia. A football fanatic named Jeffrey Lurie recently called in some family money to purchase the Eagles for a reported sum of $185 million, the highest ever paid for a professional sports franchise. The fee was even higher than the $173 million paid last August for the Baltimore Orioles, a team currently not operating because of the ghastly economics of baseball, if you can follow that reasoning.
This Lurie began having pangs about all the money he had shelled out or maybe he just can't help himself from putting the squeeze on people. He began circulating among his new players, forcing at least three Eagles to take salary cuts or else risk being dropped from the team. Lurie's reason? That wicked old salary cap. The Eagles promptly went out and lost their first game. Maybe they'll lose all 16. It would serve Lurie right.
The sight of an owner personally trying to knock back salaries in the week before the season opened is a new low among the moneyed set. Sure, Charles O. Finley tried to fire an Oakland second baseman during the World Series, and sure, George Steinbrenner lambasted a Yankee third-base coach and various pitchers during post-season games, but the salary cap has introduced a new ownership excuse: "The devil made me do it," as Flip Wilson used to say.
A few of the brighter baseball owners just might have observed this Lurie in action, ruining his team's morale, destroying his image, in the name of the great idol of a salary cap. I am also guessing that the baseball players watched Lurie perform, and that was enough to stiffen their resistance to the salary cap. Why give the baseball owners a chance to be like that guy?
None of this guarantees that the owners and the players will be able to save the season. Both sides were bumbling around yesterday, doing homework they could have done a year ago, if you ask me. But if they manage to hold onto the World Series this year, they should thank football for scaring them into action. Football won't ask much in return. Just stay out of its way. That's enough.

HEADLINE: For the New York State Legislature

 BODY:
The New York State Legislature's poor record this year on budgetary and social issues leaves no doubt that Albany could use some shaking up. But who will do the shaking? The paucity of quality challengers taking on incumbents in next Tuesday's primary voting for safely Democratic Senate and Assembly seats is a disappointment. Some of the least worthy incumbents face no challenge.
Here are our endorsements in several of the livelier contests in New York City districts where a primary victory virtually guarantees election. 
 SENATE -- 27th District, Manhattan: The retirement of Manfred Ohrenstein, the Senate minority leader, has produced a three-way race. The most promising candidate is Catherine Abate, a respected Commissioner of Correction during the Dinkins administration. Ms. Abate has knowledge of criminal justice issues, and the resourcefulness to get things done.
Her opponents, Charles Dworkis, a former district assistant for Mr. Ohrenstein, and Anne Compoccia, president of Community Board 1, know the district and generally share Ms. Abate's progressive views. But they cannot match her experience.
ASSEMBLY -- 33d District, Queens: Barbara Clark, an eight-year Assembly veteran, has been most active on education and child care issues. Though she sometimes needlessly alienates her would-be allies, she has generally been an effective advocate for her constituents. Neither of her opponents, Harvey Elwood, a school counselor, or Stephen Jackson, a promising political newcomer, has made the case for unseating her.
37th District, Queens-Brooklyn: In her decade in the Assembly, Catherine Nolan has emphasized family and transportation issues, fighting for increased subsidies for mass transit. Her challenger, Pamela Fisher, the director of a senior citizens' center, seems capable, but she has not made a compelling case for dumping a reasonably effective incumbent.
47th District, Brooklyn: The challenger, Joseph Cardieri, a former District Attorney now in private legal practice, insists that the 22-year incumbent, Frank Barbaro, is out of step with the times and the district. But Mr. Barbaro has used his seniority to push issues of concern to his constituents. He deserves re-election.
51st District, Brooklyn: The incumbent, Javier Nieves, became vice chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus in his first term. But he can point to few other achievements and has alienated community leaders with his unpredictability. The challenger, Felix Ortiz, a former budget analyst for the city, has a firmer grasp of the issues and promises to be a more effective consensus builder. We favor Mr. Ortiz.
54th District, Brooklyn: Darryl Towns, another first-term incumbent, is off to a good start, actively promoting much-needed economic development efforts in his district. His opponents, F. Louis Caraballo, an attorney, and Anibal Ortiz, a former police officer, do not make a case for denying Mr. Towns a second term. We support Mr. Towns.
55th District, Brooklyn: In this race a lackluster 12-year incumbent, William Boyland, faces two challengers. Reginald Bowman, a community activist and school board member, is smart but can be divisive. Beatrice Jones, another community activist who runs a day-care center, is sincere but might not be effective in the rough-and-tumble world of Albany. Mr. Boyland gets our lukewarm endorsement.
68th District, Manhattan: After nearly 20 years in the Legislature, Angelo Del Toro's record should be more impressive. Although chairman of the Education Committee for four years, Mr. Del Toro only recently became energetic in pushing reforms on school custodians and teacher discipline. His opponent, Nelson Antonio Denis, is an attorney who speaks articulately about economic development and the need for expanding youth programs. While Mr. Denis is untested in office, he offers the possibility of much-needed change. We endorse him with hope.

HEADLINE: For a Baseball Case History, Look at Cleveland

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the writings about the baseball strike and its economics, I've seen little about the huge benefits team owners and players get from the investment that cities make in ballparks, arenas, infrastructure such as streets and highways and continual service demands, including the police. The owners receive sweetheart deals to "rent" the stadiums, making huge profits from concessions and advertising, though the cities own and must maintain the facilities. 
 Cleveland has been called one of the unluckiest cities in the major leagues because of its expensive new stadium and a winning team that was an underdog choice and sentimental favorite to win the American League pennant and even the World Series this baseball year.
Sportswriters and commentators have glorified the new stadium, but tell little about the cost to fans and nonfans of Cuyahoga County, who are paying for the stadium-arena complex, known as Gateway. County taxpayers are picking up, by way of "sin" taxes, $275 million of the cost directly and are on the hook for millions more.
The complex's real cost, when interest and infrastructure are added, is some $750 million. County taxpayers are guarantors of $305 million over the $275 million in "sin" taxes.
Cleveland has lost 26,000 jobs since the vote that approved the stadium, when voters were promised 28,000 more jobs. And despite promises of $4.3 million in property tax revenue when the vote for the "sin" tax was promoted, the complex had its property taxes capped in perpetuity by law at what the property was worth when the area was dilapidated.
Taxpayer money has purchased a 900-seat restaurant in the stadium for the Cleveland Indians owner, where ordinary fans are not allowed on game day; and a second, $2.3 million luxury restaurant for the Cleveland Cavaliers owners. Gateway promoters even threw in a separate, $7 million, 57,500-square-foot office building, including $900,000 in furnishings, for the Indians' administrative of
fices, although the lease called for team offices within the stadium.
Ohio chipped in some $45 million in gifts and grants, while other governmental agencies have expended more than $15 million in addition for infrastructure needs. When I asked Gateway's executive director, Tom Chema, if he had reported these as gifts to the Internal Revenue Service, he said, "Absolutely not."
Isn't it time that gifts bestowed by cities fearful of losing sports teams are treated as gifts to owners so that the Internal Revenue Service and taxpayers can get at least a share?
