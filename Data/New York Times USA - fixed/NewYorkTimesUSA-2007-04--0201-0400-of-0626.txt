HEADLINE: Shares Are Flat as Earnings Anxiety Grows

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street ended an erratic session essentially flat yesterday, despite a steep drop in oil prices, as investors grew anxious about first-quarter earnings and hopes dimmed for interest rate cuts.
 Yesterday also was the first opportunity for traders to react to data from the Labor Department that showed stronger-than-expected job growth in March. The numbers, released Friday, indicated the economy might be in better shape than previously thought, helping to offset concerns about slowness in the housing market.
Even so, upbeat news about the economy and corporate activity was interpreted by some on Wall Street as a reason for the Federal Reserve to hold off on cutting rates. Earnings season begins today when Alcoa posts first-quarter results, and profit growth is expected to fall from previous quarters, giving investors reason to be cautious. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.94 points, to 12,569.14. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.85 point, to 1,444.61, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.16 points, to 2,469.18.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.71 points, to 811.64.
 The modest moves left intact last week's advance; the major indexes rose each day last week and returned to positive territory for the year. Most major European markets were closed Friday and yesterday for an extended Easter holiday.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for May delivery fell $2.77, to $61.51 a barrel, as tensions in the Middle East eased. There is also speculation among traders that an Energy Department report will show higher-than-expected inventories.
 Dow Chemical rose $2.16, to $46.63, after a British newspaper reported that it could receive a buyout offer of $50 billion as soon as this week. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, one of the biggest American private equity firms, is said to be among the bidders.
 Citigroup increased a penny, to $51.58, after it announced the acquisition of the Bank of Overseas Chinese in Taiwan to broaden operations in Asia. The bank also said it would detail a long-expected cost-cutting plan tomorrow.
 Burlington Northern Santa Fe gained $5.36, to $88.08, after Berkshire Hathaway announced it bought a 10.9 percent stake. Berkshire -- whose Class A shares rose $151, to $109,000 -- also confirmed that it had made significant investments in two other railroads, but did not disclose their names.
 Advanced Micro Devices warned that its first-quarter revenue would miss Wall Street's expectations because of weaker sales at its computing solutions unit. But its stock rose 49 cents, to $13.35, after the company said it would cut costs.
 The lender American Home Mortgage Investment sank after it cut its 2007 profit forecasts and several analysts downgraded the stock. The company's shares fell 15 percent, or $3.92, to $21.92.
 Other lenders that have been in focus because of their holdings of subprime loans also declined. Accredited Home Lenders Holding dropped 41 cents, to $9.23; M&T Bank fell 72 cents, to $105.27.
 The power company Mirant, which emerged from bankruptcy last year, said it was exploring the possibility of a sale. Shares rose $3.44, to $44.08. 
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to 99 2/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged down to 4.74 percent, from 4.75 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Tax Bites on Travelers Go Deeper

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
For all the complaints travelers have been voicing about delayed flights, declining service, crowded planes and invasive security procedures, there has been comparatively little outcry about another trend: escalating taxes on flights, car rentals and hotel stays.
 But travel companies and trade associations are beginning to reach for the megaphone on their customers' behalf, protesting the growing cost of taxes, many of them financing initiatives that have nothing to do with travel.
''It's probably our No. 1 legislative issue at the moment,'' said Bill Connors, executive director and chief operating officer of the National Business Travel Association, a trade group. ''Local politicians have this idea that travelers are an easy cash cow because they're not there to vote. But it's a form of taxation without representation.''
 In partnership with major car rental companies, the association has focused on fighting high taxes on car rentals and has tried to raise awareness by lobbying state and local officials. Taxes and other charges passed along by car rental companies, like vehicle licensing fees, raise the average rental bill 28 percent at airport locations, according to Travelocity, the online travel agency. These taxes and fees can exceed 50 percent at airports in Kansas City, Dallas, Atlanta and Seattle. 
 Industry analysts say more municipalities are taxing rental customers to pay for local projects like sports stadiums, convention centers, public transportation improvements and even a rodeo arena. 
 As of last October, there were ''something like 86'' special taxes and surcharges around the country levied on car rentals, and another 48 were being considered, said Neil Abrams, president of the Abrams Consulting Group, which follows the car rental industry. 
 As an example, Mr. Abrams cited a proposal to increase the tax on car rentals in Racine, Wis., by $13 a rental to help finance a commuter rail line. 
 ''They see the rental customer who does not vote in local elections as basically an oil well with untapped resources,'' he said.
 Indeed, William McReynolds, Racine's county executive, has emphasized the point that most of the proposed increase in the car rental tax would be borne by out-of-state visitors and businesses. In an interview, he said the car rental fee was proposed as a way to finance the commuter rail line instead of raising the local sales tax. ''The increase in the rental fee is not exorbitant compared to other major communities,'' he said. 
 One reason that these types of taxes have proliferated is that until lately, travelers have not had many advocates speaking on their behalf, while an increase in the sales tax is bound to anger local voters. There is also a lack of comprehensive data about the tax rates charged on car rentals and hotel stays, making tracking them a challenge.
 ''It's not easy to fight this fight because you have to be all over the place,'' said Mr. Connors of the N.B.T.A. ''We've focused on car rental taxes because they're the most egregious, but it's also bad with hotels.'' 
 One of the most thorough studies of hotel taxes, conducted by the American Economics Group, a consulting firm, found that these taxes added 12 percent to an average hotel bill in 2003, compared with 9 percent in 1997. These ''bed taxes'' include local sales taxes as well as any taxes charged specifically on hotel rooms.
 ''I think local politicians get the wrong idea that it's taxing outsiders,'' said Charles W. de Seve, the president of the firm. High taxes, he said, can have a ripple effect on a local economy, maybe causing companies to hold an event elsewhere or send fewer employees to a trade show.
 ''There's a lot of calculating that goes on to figure the effect on any one place,'' he said. He cited New York as an example of a city that set off a backlash when state and local hotel taxes, including sales tax, reached about 20 percent of the total bill in the early 1990s. ''The slogan at that time was, 'New York: stay four, pay five,' because the tax added that much to the bill.''
 The total tax rate on hotel rooms is now roughly 14 percent in New York City. It typically falls in the 14 to 17 percent range in many other large cities.
 Joseph A. McInerney, president and chief executive of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade group, said hotel groups were fighting hotel tax increases partly because of the way the money was spent. ''Only a small portion of it has been going to promote travel and tourism,'' he said. 
 As with taxes on car rentals, taxes on hotel rooms are often used to pay for local projects that may not necessarily benefit visitors; Cincinnati officials have even proposed using money from the county hotel tax to help build a new jail, although a sales tax increase is being considered as a more likely source of financing. 
 Although taxes on air travel have also increased in recent years, that revenue is typically used to pay for travel-related measures, especially security. But airlines -- and many travelers -- still say these taxes are too high.
 ''Too often, airlines are looked at as a piggy bank with unlimited resources,'' said David Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association of America, which represents most major airlines. ''We pay an unprecedented number of taxes and we will continue to oppose increases in the amount and number of taxes that consumers are forced to pay.''
 Because of the way airline taxes are calculated, it is difficult to pin down what percentage of a typical airline ticket goes toward taxes, and estimates placing the average as high as 25 percent have sometimes been met with skepticism. Some airline ticket taxes are charged based on the number of takeoffs and landings in a trip (and vary depending on the airport), so a relatively inexpensive flight with two connections may have a higher percentage of tax than a more expensive nonstop flight. 
 Even so, there is little argument that airline taxes have been increasing. The total price for a domestic ticket includes a 7.5 percent federal tax; a Sept. 11 security fee of $2.50 a flight segment (or takeoff and landing), up to $10; passenger facility charges of $3 to $4.50 per airport, up to $18; and a federal fee of $3.40 a segment. 
 Taxes on international tickets can add $200 or more to the total price, including domestic and foreign taxes, and those have been increasing as well. Britain, for example, recently doubled its departure tax. 
 Ron Wagner, a senior vice president with Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a corporate travel management company, said rising airline taxes are definitely on clients' radar. He noted that airline tickets account for about 80 percent of most companies' spending on travel. ''They're certainly going to look at how taxes affect them,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Steering New Orleans's Recovery With a Clinical Eye

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, April 9 

 BODY:
In a city fond of its own self-portrait, Edward J. Blakely's opinions are a shot of cold water.
 Dr. Blakely, New Orleans's belatedly appointed Hurricane Katrina recovery chief, refers to the city's racial factions as ''a bit like the Shiites and Sunnis,'' calls the civic elite ''insular,'' and says the newcomers he wants to draw here will be impatient with local ''buffoons.'' But unlike other outsiders who come here dispersing critical thoughts, Dr. Blakely might see his bear fruit. For one thing, Dr. Blakely, a globe-trotting academic with a long resume, has a mandate for renewal from Mayor C. Ray Nagin and a city desperate for leadership.
For another, a cool mix of realism and fatalism is, to all evidence, guiding him three months into his tenure as the executive director of this city's Office of Recovery Management. In a city government where hot speechmaking, unfulfilled promises and finger-pointing have reigned, the combination stands out. It was evident in the latest recovery plan, hatched by Dr. Blakely and unveiled last month, and widely praised as the most practicable yet. 
 Dr. Blakely, the former dean of the school of management and urban policy at the New School in New York, may prove to be what has been damagingly lacking here: a firm voice making difficult choices between neighborhoods. He is the latest incarnation of what has become a stock character in the New Orleans saga, the rescuer from afar -- but one with an unusually candid streak. 
 Those who demand a ''right to return'' for former residents are merely ''using people'' for political ends, Dr. Blakely said sharply in an interview. The ''lower-income population'' now ''trapped outside the city'' may not be coming back. New Orleans ''won't be the same'' when the dust settles, he asserted calmly, suggesting that a new population with more ''energy'' may replace the old. 
 Out of these perceptions has come his plan, presented at City Hall late last month by Dr. Blakely, a soft-spoken but precise professor. It bows to political realities in New Orleans without indulging them, in contrast with its several forerunners. The plan focuses on rebuilding 17 compact areas a half-mile in diameter and proposes spending on a few symbolic areas of devastation, like the Lower Ninth Ward in the heavily damaged eastern section, pleasing activists who have strongly urged their redevelopment. 
 But 14 of the 17 areas Dr. Blakely singles out are in the more promising, less flooded western part of the city. A combination of incentives for developers and public infrastructure spending will be used to rebuild these spots, Dr. Blakely says, at a cost of $1.1 billion, money that is not yet in hand and that is dependent in part on an unusual plan to sell bonds based on the money the city might get from its acres of blighted properties. 
 ''He has brought a level of realism to rebuilding New Orleans that hasn't been there,'' said Sean Reilly, a member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority. ''He's got a real, concrete plan. At the end of the day, that's what's been missing: that clear prioritization, 'here's where we're going to invest.' ''
 The plan appears to have the support, provisionally at least, of the mutually suspicious political factions here. Above all, it is backed by Dr. Blakely's own appraisal of the pathologies that have so far stymied recovery in this city's wounded neighborhoods.
 After he was appointed by the mayor, Dr. Blakely, 68, stepped into a planning vacuum in New Orleans. He quickly surprised state officials with a demand for control of recovery dollars, proclaimed his own indispensability and publicly chided New Orleans for what he termed its ''mendicants'' mentality.
 Colleagues elsewhere say this egotism is at least partly justified: Dr. Blakely has held a series of prestigious university positions, has a track record of helping cities recover -- notably Oakland, Calif., after the 1989 earthquake and fire -- and has written well-received studies in urban planning, especially a critical look at gated communities in America. At the University of California, Berkeley, where he headed the urban planning department, he brought the university's resources to bear on Oakland's problems in an innovative way, colleagues say; he is chairman of urban and regional planning at the University of Sydney, Australia, and commutes between New Orleans and Sydney. 
 ''Given a near-hopeless task, this is as good a choice as I could have come up with,'' said Lawrence J. Vale, head of the department of urban studies and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Heavyweight credentials notwithstanding, state officials balked at Dr. Blakely's demand to control some of the recovery money, though they later came to an understanding with him. Dr. Blakely said he was undeterred by the obstacles.
 ''I'm like the doctor, going into surgery,'' he said. ''I'm putting my best thing there. The patient, I hope, lives. But post-surgery, the patient, if they start eating hog maws again and not exercising, what can I do? I approach all my urban planning projects that way.''
 It is too early to say whether Dr. Blakely will succeed where others have failed, and he recently said he might leave his post in a year. But what is clear is that, perhaps for the first time, a ranking New Orleans official is looking out over the ruins and their complicated context with a clinical, outsider's eye. 
 That awareness of entrenched realities here, racial and economic, is reflected in Dr. Blakely's relatively modest plan: it is not an effort to make over the city all at once. Instead, it revolves around localized attention to promising zones that, if they take off, could have a transforming effect on the whole. ''If I could pump life back in these places, you might pump life back into the entire city,'' he said. 
 The picture in its entirety is too daunting to be tackled completely. Most acutely, Dr. Blakely has found a polarized racial environment in New Orleans, very different from Oakland, that he says he must work around rather than try to change. Here, race is ''the first thing in people's minds,'' said Dr. Blakely, who is black. ''It's a culture of domination rather than participation. So whatever group gets something, they try to dominate the whole turf.'' 
 A second entrenched hurdle is the paper-thin economy. If it is not built up -- essentially created wholesale, most promisingly on hopes of redeveloping a downtown medical and bioscience complex here -- all of Dr. Blakely's exercises could be for naught.
 ''We have an economy entirely made up of T-shirts,'' he said in a speech at the University of Sydney this week. ''That is our major import and export.''
 He sees the moribund economic infrastructure as the result, in part, of the city's provincialism.
 ''It's quite interesting how insular people are here,'' Dr. Blakely said. ''They don't know people on Wall Street, they don't know the big development firms, they've not been associated with the kind of urban planning expertise that I take for granted.''
 The tone is clipped and California, different from the easygoing drawl of local officials. Dr. Blakely's skepticism about New Orleans caused a stir last week when he suggested that the city's prehurricane population levels might have been inflated. He later backed down and apologized after Mayor Nagin disagreed.
 Still, the city has a few aces, and Dr. Blakely is banking on them, most notably a ''very good'' university network of five substantial institutions, and a way of life that cannot be replicated elsewhere. 
 Newcomers, pioneers willing to put up with the city's present difficulties, could be the salvation of New Orleans and its future, Dr. Blakely suggested. New Orleans now is ''a third-world country,'' he said. 
 ''If we get some people here, those 100 million new Americans, they're going to come here without the same attitudes of the locals,'' he said. ''I think, if we create the right signals, they're going to come here, and they're going to say, 'Who are these buffoons?' I'm meeting some who are moving here, and they don't have time for this stuff.''

HEADLINE: Sex Offenders Test Churches' Core Beliefs

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE

DATELINE: CARLSBAD, Calif. 

 BODY:
On a marquee outside and on a banner inside, Pilgrim United Church of Christ proclaims, ''All are welcome.'' Sustained by the belief that embracing all comers is a living example of Christ's love, Pilgrim now faces a profound test of faith.
 In late January, Mark Pliska, 53, told the congregation here that he had been in prison for molesting children but that he sought a place to worship and liked the atmosphere at Pilgrim.
 Mr. Pliska's request has plunged the close-knit congregation into a painful discussion about applying faith in a difficult real-world situation. Congregants now wonder, are all truly welcome? If they are, how do you ensure the safety of children and the healing of adult survivors of sexual abuse? Can an offender who accepts Christ truly change?
 ''I think what we have been through is a loss of innocence,'' said the Rev. Madison Shockley, Pilgrim's minister. ''People think of church as an idyllic paradise, and I think that is a great part of that loss.'' 
 Pilgrim's struggle mirrors those of other congregations, of various faiths, across the country.
 Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said that over the last five years pastors had called him to seek advice about how to deal with sex offenders who had returned from prison and wanted to return to church. 
 The Rev. Debra W. Haffner, director of the Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice and Healing in Norwalk, Conn., said she received one or two calls a month from congregations facing a crisis similar to Pilgrim's. 
 Having a policy to deal with sex offenders before a crisis occurs is the best way to avoid turmoil, Ms. Haffner said. But such a policy still may force a congregation to decide under what circumstances an offender can attend, a discussion that can shake many churches to their core. 
 ''They are conflicting ministries,'' the Rev. Patricia Tummino said about reaching out to sex offenders, to children and to adult survivors of abuse. Since the late 1990s, Ms. Tummino's congregation, the First Unitarian Universalist Society in Middleboro, Mass., has dealt with two known sex offenders. ''You can't be all things to all people,'' she said.
 Congregations have always had sex offenders, largely unknown to others, Ms. Haffner said.
 Parole officers have encouraged offenders who have been jailed to seek congregations as a source of community and support, Ms. Haffner said.
 States have computerized registries of sex offenders that let anyone check on a new congregant. Local news media often report on a sex offender's arrival from prison, making it hard for a parolee to remain anonymous. 
 After being released in mid-2006, Mr. Pliska ended up at First Congregational Church, United Church of Christ, in Santa Cruz, Calif. 
 ''My spiritual growth is very important to me,'' Mr. Pliska said in an interview in Mr. Shockley's office. ''I went looking for an open and affirming church and attended a U.C.C. church and liked it.''
 The United Church of Christ takes pride in its liberalism, and it has led other Protestant denominations in the ordination of women and on civil rights issues. 
 In Santa Cruz, Mr. Pliska agreed to avoid children and to always be escorted by another adult. The church has two services, which made it easier for those uncomfortable with him to still worship. 
 But business was slow and he lost his job as a mechanic, Mr. Pliska said, and in December, he moved to Carlsbad, an affluent seaside town 30 miles north of San Diego.
 Mr. Shockley received an e-mail message from Santa Cruz about Mr. Pliska's search for a new congregation. He said he thought that if Pilgrim established the same limits as Santa Cruz had, Mr. Pliska's presence would be as uneventful.
 Before introducing Mr. Pliska to the congregation, Mr. Shockley spoke to a few congregants who had been abused as children and to parents, and none objected to Mr. Pliska's inclusion.
 But Mr. Pliska's introduction unlocked a flood of emotions among the 300 members. 
 ''The scariest moment,'' Mr. Shockley said, ''was when I got the feeling in the congregation about whether Mark could attend or not, and we needed more time, yet people were saying 'If he stays, I leave,' or 'If he leaves, I leave.' ''
 The church has pulled back from that edge, and most people seem to be listening respectfully to one another. A few families have stopped attending. Some new people have started to come, impressed by local news accounts of the congregation's willingness to consider having Mr. Pliska. 
 Tristan Green attends with her three sons, and is torn about having Mr. Pliska in the congregation. She believes he should be welcome but she wonders how she might keep track of the boys during the social hour, whether they would enjoy the freedom to play, whether Mr. Pliska would get the church's pictorial members' directory. 
 ''I'd feel uncomfortable,'' said her oldest son, Sebastian, 9, ''but we're supposed to let everybody come.''
 Samantha Peterson, 21, said she believed Mr. Pliska should attend. ''I feel that those who are fearful have a very valid opinion, but we have a unique opportunity to be really tested and to make the right decision,'' she said. ''I don't think this guy is a danger. He's asking for help.''
 Her mother, Missy Peterson, who also has a 10-year-old son, said she felt guilty about her wariness. But she could not ignore it. 
 ''Why should I reserve judgment and not listen to the bells and whistles in my gut that say 'No'?'' Ms. Peterson asked.
 Adult survivors of sexual abuse are also shaken by the possibility of worshipping with a sex offender. 
 ''There are people who feel that if we don't welcome Mark, we lose who we are,'' said David Irvine, 48, who was sexually abused as a child. ''But what do you say to one member who was abused for 10 years, several times a week? By welcoming one person, are we rescinding our welcome to some of the survivors among us, people in pain and healing, members of our family?''
 An ad hoc committee at the church is trying to develop a ''safe church'' policy that would apply to sex offenders and would also create programs to prevent sexual abuse through education and screening of anyone working with children.
 The policy is expected to be ready for discussion in early May, Mr. Shockley said. Mr. Pliska has been asked not to attend worship services for now, but he meets weekly with a small group from Pilgrim.
 In the meantime, publicity over his arrival at Pilgrim led to Mr. Pliska's eviction and the loss of his job. He is homeless and unemployed. Yet he said he does not regret being open with the church, after spending years hiding who he was.
 ''So far, there is no upside,'' he said. ''But there will be later on. God makes miracles in different ways.''

HEADLINE: World Bank Chief Seeks to Quell Favoritism Talk

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz, president of the World Bank, sought on Monday to quell a spreading debate among bank employees over accusations of favoritism, saying he had arranged for a job at the State Department for a woman friend only after consulting the bank's executive board on how to handle her reassignment. 
 Mr. Wolfowitz also said, in an e-mail message to bank employees, that he took full responsibility for the transfer of the bank employee, Shaha Ali Riza, when he became bank president in 2005.
 He said that he would ''cooperate fully'' with the board's review of the case. 
 The transfer occurred because of bank rules barring bank employees from supervising anyone with whom they had a personal relationship, Mr. Wolfowitz said.
 He added that he understood that many were understandably concerned about ''the rights, obligations and fair treatment of all employees.''
 ''I would like to assure the staff that I have always acted to uphold these rules to the best of my ability, and I will continue to do so,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said in his message.
 The highly unusual message sent out by Mr. Wolfowitz, a former deputy defense secretary who was appointed to the bank presidency by President Bush, came after weeks of discussions, both within the bank and, following an article about the subject in The Washington Post, elsewhere around Washington and in the world of Internet blogs.
 Bank employees were generally critical of Mr. Wolfowitz's appointment two years ago, focusing on his role as an architect of the Iraq war. They have also accused him of relying on a small group of advisers brought from the Pentagon.
 Last week, the staff association of the World Bank charged that Mr. Wolfowitz had violated bank rules by arranging for the reassignment of Ms. Riza, a former communications officer in the Middle East division, to the State Department, where she is still on the bank payroll while directing a program promoting democracy in the Middle East.
 The association also charged that Ms. Riza had gotten a substantial raise. The Government Accountability Project, an independent watchdog group, says her salary is $193,590, more than the $183,500 drawn by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other cabinet members. Bank officials would not confirm Ms. Riza's salary, saying that such matters were confidential.
 The raise Ms. Riza received was twice as large as bank rules allow, the staff association said, Bloomberg News reported.
 Mr. Wolfowitz issued his statement less than a week before the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
 The meetings are to discuss policy issues, like alleviating global poverty, with more than 180 finance ministers from around the world.
 Bank officials say the debate over Ms. Riza and her salary has been overblown as a result of unhappiness with some of Mr. Wolfowitz's policies, including his campaign against corruption and steps taken last year to suspend funding for certain countries deemed to be rife with graft. The statement from Mr. Wolfowitz was seen as an attempt to defuse the issue.

HEADLINE: Pfizer Drug For Diabetes Is Lagging

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Exubera, the first and so far only commercially available inhaled-insulin diabetes treatment, is on the verge of turning into an expensive failure for its maker, Pfizer. 
 At one point, the company regarded the drug as a potential blockbuster. But despite six months of marketing to doctors, Exubera receives only about one of every 500 prescriptions for insulin written in the United States.
A new diabetes pill, Januvia, which is made by Merck and was approved after Exubera, is already prescribed about 40,000 times a week in the United States, 25 times as often as the Pfizer drug. 
 And so Wall Street analysts are cutting their sales estimates for Exubera, which has been dogged by questions about its safety, cost and convenience.
 Pfizer says it has not given up on Exubera and last week started a new marketing campaign to persuade doctors to prescribe the medicine. In January the company projected that despite its slow start, Exubera would eventually achieve worldwide sales of $2 billion. But doctors and analysts are skeptical.
 ''I don't think the drug can be saved,'' said David Risinger, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, who last week cut his estimates for Exubera sales. Mr. Risinger now expects that Exubera will have $310 million in sales worldwide in 2012, down from his previous estimate of $800 million. Other analysts have also cut their forecasts.
 Exubera's problems add to the uncertainties facing Pfizer, whose shares have lost almost half their value since 2000.
 While the company remains highly profitable, its financial health is increasingly tied to Lipitor, a best-selling cholesterol-lowering medicine that faces competition from cheaper drugs and in several years, patent expiration.
 In interviews yesterday, Pfizer executives acknowledged Exubera's problems but said they believed that a new sales push would increase the drug's revenue. The company will work to convince doctors that insulin, in both inhaled and injectable forms, is underprescribed. And this summer, Pfizer plans to begin directly advertising the inhaler to patients. 
 ''Sales have been slower than expected,'' said Olivier Brandicourt, general manager for Pfizer's metabolic and cardiovascular division, which includes Exubera. ''It takes time to educate the physician.''
 Rochelle Chaiken, Pfizer's vice president for global medical affairs, said almost 60 percent of diabetes patients had overly high blood sugar levels despite being on standard oral diabetes medications. Many of those patients should be taking Exubera, she said.
 But Pfizer's marketing may not be enough to overcome the medical, economic, practical and legal concerns that have hurt Exubera. In theory, the drug's biggest advantage over standard injectable insulin is that it is more convenient and does not require needle pricks.
 In reality, though, the Exubera inhaler is bulky and can be hard to use, doctors say. The device is nearly as large as a tennis ball can when it is open, and must be repeatedly pumped before the insulin can be inhaled. Making matters worse, Exubera doses differ from those for standard insulin, and converting doses can be complicated, the doctors say. 
 Also, insurers have been reluctant to pay for Exubera, which costs about $5 a day, compared with $2 to $3 a day for injectable insulin. 
 In addition, the needles now used for conventional insulin injections are smaller and less painful than they once were.
 ''Out of 2,000 times or more I've tried to start patients on insulin, I've only been turned down twice,'' said Dr. John Buse, professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina.
 Doctors and patients have many more options for managing diabetes than they did a decade ago, Dr. Buse said. In the last two years, three new diabetes medicines have reached the market -- Januvia, Byetta and Symlin -- as well as Levemir, a longer-acting version of injectable insulin.
 As with Januvia, sales of Byetta, which is made by Eli Lilly and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, have grown quickly. 
 Another concern for doctors about Exubera is that long-term use of inhaled insulin can damage the lungs. Pfizer's clinical trials show that the drug causes lung function to drop in some patients. 
 The decrease appears to be minor and to reverse if patients stop using the drug. Even so, patients must take a lung-function test before beginning Exubera, something that has discouraged doctors from prescribing it, said Dr. Joel Zonszein, a diabetes specialist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. 
 Dr. Zonszein said he had tried to put about half a dozen patients on Exubera since the drug was introduced last summer. All have stopped using it, he said. ''The inhaled market may just not be there,'' he said. ''The needles we have nowadays are very friendly. They're easy to take.''
 Hoping to encourage sales, Pfizer has transferred responsibility for promoting Exubera from its pain management division to its cardiovascular division. The cardiovascular sales force, which helped turn Lipitor into the world's top-selling medicine, is highly regarded.
 But the change may not make a difference, said George Grofik, a drug industry analyst at Citigroup. In February, Mr. Grofik's team surveyed 35 doctors, polling primary care physicians and diabetes specialists, to get their opinions on Exubera.
 Nearly 9 of 10 doctors had ''medium'' or ''high'' awareness of the drug, the survey found. But more than half said they were concerned about Exubera's safety. They were also concerned about its price and the bulkiness of the Exubera inhaler.
 Because many doctors seem to have made up their minds about Exubera, Mr. Grofik said, Pfizer will face an uphill battle as it tries to change their views.
 And by having its representatives promote Exubera when they make sales calls, he added, Pfizer risks taking attention from Lipitor and other more profitable medications. 
 ''There's an opportunity cost in detailing Exubera that could be used on higher-margin products,'' Mr. Grofik said.
 Over the next five years, other drug companies, including Lilly, may receive approval for their own versions of inhaled insulin, said James Reddoch, a biotechnology analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. The next-generation inhalers are smaller and more convenient than the Exubera inhaler and may attract more prescriptions, Mr. Reddoch said.
 The lack of interest in Exubera has made Wall Street wonder whether the inhaled-insulin market is as large as drug companies once thought, he said. ''It sounds nice on the surface, the fact that you can now breathe in your insulin,'' Mr. Reddoch said. ''But there are problems from a practical standpoint.''

HEADLINE: Challenge to Emissions Rule Is Set to Start

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
The fight over cars and carbon dioxide moves today from the Supreme Court to a federal courtroom in Burlington, Vt., in a case that automakers say could reshape vehicles sold on the East and West Coasts.
 The industry is suing to block a 2004 California regulation on global warming from taking effect. The rule would require a 30 percent cut in emissions of greenhouse gases from cars and trucks sold in Vermont and New York, which follow California's air quality rules, to be fully phased in by the 2016 model year.
In court filings, automakers have argued that regulating the emissions will increase pollution, cause more traffic deaths and lead domestic automakers to stop selling most of their passenger models in states that adopt such regulations. 
 The companies have disputed that global warming is a problem, even though they have acknowledged it in different forums as a serious problem. And they tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to close much of this case to the public. 
 ''This is a huge issue to consumers, because it may well determine what vehicles are available for them to purchase,'' said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes General Motors, Toyota and most other large automakers. ''If it's a big issue for consumers, it's a big issue to us.''
 Environmental groups and the offices of the attorneys general in Vermont and New York, which is a party to the case, say the automakers are overstating the complexity and hardship of such a regulation. 
 ''It's that sky-is-falling approach, but the sky didn't fall with catalytic converters,'' Attorney General William H. Sorrell of Vermont said, referring to the antipollution technology forced on the industry in the 1970s. 
 Last week, in a 5-to-4 decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court ruled that the agency has the authority to regulate heat-trapping gases in automobiles. The Bush administration has long opposed that. 
 Instead, more than 12 states, including California, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont, have already or are in the process of moving to regulate such emissions.
 California has the authority to set air-quality rules, and Northeastern states have long chosen to follow those rules instead of Washington's. The Supreme Court victory was important for the states, because the approval of the environmental agency is needed before California can regulate emissions involving global warming. 
 Automakers have sued to block the California regulation in federal courts in California, Rhode Island and Vermont, though just the Vermont case has gone forward. That case is scheduled to enter the trial phase today. 
 The battle has exposed fault lines among automakers. Two trade groups representing the major manufacturers are involved in the suit, one dominated by domestic producers and one by foreign.
 They have clashed in their legal strategies, and just G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, two of the more outspoken companies opposing the new regulation, are directly listed as plaintiffs. The trade groups had initially sued separately but are now plaintiffs in a consolidated suit. 
 The main legal argument uniting the industry is their contention that states cannot regulate carbon dioxide emissions because that would be little different from regulating fuel economy, and Washington has the sole authority to set mileage standards. The recent Supreme Court ruling, however, appeared to undermine that argument. 
 The industry estimates that the new regulation would impose a 50 percent increase in fuel economy for passenger cars and small sport-utility vehicles but a more modest increase for large trucks, effectively making it harder for a company like G.M. to bring smaller vehicles like the Chevrolet Malibu into compliance than its Hummers. 
 An expert hired by automakers said, according to court filings, that DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor and G.M. ''will need largely to exit'' from the passenger car and small truck markets. 
 Environmental groups say the industry is ignoring the potential effects of its move to bolster alternative fuels like ethanol, as well as the advent of hybrid electric technology and other technologies. 
 Automakers argued in a court filing in January that ''defendants make unsubstantiated predictions that global climate change is having a number of alarming adverse effects.''
 Michael J. Stanton, the president of the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, a plaintiff group, said in an interview the position did not represent the views of the mostly Asian automakers who are his constituents, some of whom are trying to create ''eco-friendly'' reputations. 
 ''We believe that there is enough information out there to address climate change and we know that cars -- passenger cars and light trucks -- contribute, and we want to be part of the solution,'' Mr. Stanton said. 
 The regulation California adopted in 2004 was to begin taking effect with 2009 models and to be phased in over eight years. President Bush and Congress more recently discussed fuel economy rules that could potentially accomplish similar reductions for gases tied to global warming, though no firm plan is in place. 
 Among other points, the industry says more fuel efficient cars could be dangerous, because they will be cheaper to drive and lead people to drive more and potentially have more accidents. 
 ''Everybody's getting a good laugh out of the safety claim,'' said David Bookbinder, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, which is a party to the case. ''Detroit is saying it's a bad idea for everybody to drive more.''

HEADLINE: STUDENT LENDER HAD EARLY PLANS TO WOO OFFICIALS

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER and SAM DILLON

 BODY:
The founders of Student Loan Xpress had an explicit plan for corralling a bigger share of the lucrative student loan business: ''market to the financial aid offices of schools.'' 
 That was how Robert deRose, Michael H. Shaut and Fabrizio Balestri set out, according to a 2002 regulatory filing by the company, a strategy to use university financial aid offices as the gateway to coveted placements on the lists of lenders recommended to students.
 Five years later the company says it is the eighth-largest player in student lending -- and it found many ways to court university financial aid directors. It put them on a company advisory board, paid at least two as consultants and sold stock in the venture to others, investigators and university officials say.
 Yesterday aides to Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York provided new details, saying financial aid officers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and Capella University, an online for-profit institution, had served as paid consultants to the lending company. 
 The company also paid for part of the graduate school tuition for Ellen Frishberg, the Johns Hopkins official, Mr. Cuomo's office said. 
 At another university, Widener in Pennsylvania, the lending company sent executives to conferences held by a firm run by the dean of financial aid. It paid the firm $80,000, Mr. Cuomo's aides said. 
 These were just the latest in a series of revelations that have already shown that financial aid directors at three universities -- Columbia, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Southern California -- held stock in the company, as did an Education Department official who helps oversee student lenders. 
 Yesterday, the three executives were put on leave by the parent company of Student Loan Xpress. It is not clear whether the company or university officials have done anything illegal.
 Mr. Cuomo's aides say they are looking into deceptive business practices, a civil matter. Mr. Cuomo has said the relationships between lenders and the officials whom students rely on for unbiased financial advice pose a conflict of interest.
 Some tactics like using financial aid officers as advisers and consultants are used by other companies. And universities that recommended Student Loan Xpress to students say its loan rates are competitive.
 Still, the three men were all put on leave yesterday by the CIT Group, which bought Student Loan Xpress in 2005. That company and the broader student loan industry are now under scrutiny by Congress, the Department of Education's inspector general in Washington as well as by several state attorneys general. 
 ''As a company that holds itself to the highest standards of business ethics and integrity, we take the allegations raised by Attorney General Cuomo very seriously,'' said Jeffrey M. Peek, chairman and chief executive of CIT. Mr. deRose, Mr. Shaut and Mr. Balestri have not returned repeated calls seeking comment. 
 The quick rise of Student Loan Xpress is a window into an industry in which profits have soared along with tuition and student debt.
 ''All the companies are out there scrapping,'' said Richard Lee Colvin, director of the Hechinger Institute at Teachers College at Columbia University. ''This may be an outlier, but every single company is out there trying to increase its market share.'' 
 All three executives worked in the student loan industry during the 1990s. Mr. deRose ran the student loan business for American Express from his base in San Diego, where Mr. Balestri, who had been a longtime executive at Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student loan company, joined him to direct sales operations. In the 1990s Mr. Shaut had worked at companies involved in the student loan market, too. 
 By 2002, they were all working together in a new company, Education Lending Group, which had Student Loan Xpress as a student loan marketing subsidiary. Mr. Balestri was the president of Student Loan Xpress. Mr. Balestri knew hundreds of loan officials all over the country, and he had built a reputation in the industry as a natural salesman.
 ''He was very good at sales, always upbeat, talking about how great everything was,'' said Dan Davenport, director of admissions and financial aid at the University of Idaho.
 Otto Reyer, director of financial aid at Western University of Health Sciences in California, worked with Mr. deRose and Mr. Balestri at American Express and remembers Mr. Balestri in the same way.
 ''He has a great smile,'' Mr. Reyer said. ''He's somebody you can sit down and talk with, easily. He could sell anything.''
 In his work to build Student Loan Xpress, Mr. Balestri used some novel marketing tactics. In one initiative, he arranged for the company to help sponsor a coast-to-coast ''Scholarships for Everyone'' tour by Ben Kaplan, a 25-year-old Harvard graduate and author of a book outlining tactics for obtaining scholarships.
 Mr. Kaplan said he met Mr. Balestri, whom he knew by his nickname, Breeze, at conventions of college lending officers, and that on the tour he would occasionally mention Student Loan Xpress as a helpful financial resource for students.
 Mr. Balestri was also wooing university officials. People with experience in the student loan industry said that some of the company's tactics were common. Many student loan companies establish advisory boards composed of university financial aid officers, as did Student Loan Xpress. 
 Dana Kelly, director of financial planning at High Point University in North Carolina, said she accepted the company's invitation to sit on its advisory board because she was providing advice about how students might react to various loans. The company was already on the university's ''frequently used lenders'' list, she said, and she received payment only for transportation and lodging at meetings. 
 But in at least one case, Mr. Balestri encouraged a university loan official to buy stock in the company, a practice that several university loan officials say they had never heard of.
 Lawrence Burt, director of the financial aid office at the University of Texas at Austin, said that Mr. Balestri encouraged him to buy shares in Education Lending Group and that he bought 1,500 shares for $1,000 in late 2001. 
 Mr. Balestri, Mr. Burt said, told him ''this is kind of a risky venture. We think it will end up turning a profit but we don't really know for sure.'' Mr. Burt said his purchase was not a conflict of interest because the company at the time was focused more on loan consolidation and only later began expanding its business of originating loans. Mr. Burt said he sold in 2003 when the company was raising more money through the sale of additional shares. The shares of Education Lending Group were worth roughly $10 each. That translates into a profit of about $14,000 for him. 
 Others who put stock up for sale at that time, according to S.E.C. filings, included the financial aid director for Columbia's undergraduate college and its engineering school, David Charlow; Catherine Thomas, director of financial aid at the University of Southern California, and Matteo Fontana, who is general manager in a unit of the Office of Federal Student Aid at the Department of Education, and, according to a person who knows him, a longtime friend of Mr. Balestri's. Mr. Fontana planned to sell about $100,000 in stock up for sale in 2003. In the last few days, these officials have been put on paid leave pending investigations.
 Last week, Ms. Frishberg of Johns Hopkins said she had been encouraged to acquire stock in 2002, at a dinner she and other members of the company's advisory board attended. She turned itdown, she said.
 ''I told them it was not allowed in my position,'' Ms. Frishberg said. 
 Johns Hopkins put her on leave after learning that she had received payments from the company. Mr. Cuomo's office wrote that she received $43,000 for consulting and $22,000 in tuition reimbursement for a doctoral program she was enrolled in. Student Loan Xpress is a preferred lender at Johns Hopkins for some loan programs. 
 Tim Lehman, director of financial aid at Capella University, also served as a consultant to the company, earning more than $12,000, Mr. Cuomo's office said. And Walter Cathie, dean of student financial aid at Widener University, runs a firm that holds conferences on student aid, which representatives of Student Loan Xpress attended at a cost of $80,000, Mr. Cuomo's office said. 
 A spokesman for Widener yesterday said the university was looking into the matter. Irene Silber, director of public relations at Capella, said yesterday that the university had known of Mr. Lehman's consulting arrangement and was reviewing it. She said he did not put Student Loan Xpress on Capella's list of preferred lenders; the company was there when he arrived. 
 Profits at Student Loan Xpress did not materialize overnight. The company lost $28.3 million in 2002. But by 2003 its loan portfolio had tripled in size to about $3 billion and in the first nine months of 2004, it had profits of about $10 million. The real payback came in 2005, when the CIT Group bought the company for $318 million.

HEADLINE: Bush Ties Drop in Illegal Immigration to His Policies

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: YUMA, Ariz., April 9 

 BODY:
President Bush said Monday that tougher enforcement and a new fence at the Mexican border had sharply reduced the influx of illegal immigrants, and he pressed Congress to pass a sweeping revision of the nation's immigration laws.
 ''It's amazing progress that's been made,'' Mr. Bush said on a return visit to a section of the border that he inspected 11 months ago.
 In the last six months, the White House said, Border Patrol reports showed that apprehensions of illegal immigrants along the Mexican border fell by 30 percent, to 418,184, from 594,142 in the comparable period a year earlier. In the Yuma sector, which spans parts of Arizona and California, apprehensions fell by 68 percent, to 25,217, from 79,131 in the comparable period a year earlier. 
 There are now 13,000 Border Patrol agents, up from 9,000 a year earlier. The number will reach 18,000 by the end of next year, Mr. Bush said.
 The White House interprets the decline in apprehensions as a sign that the tighter security is working.
 ''When you're apprehending fewer people, it means fewer are trying to come across,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And fewer are trying to come across because we're deterring people from attempting illegal border crossings in the first place.''
 While Border Patrol commanders have expressed cautious optimism that a corner is being turned, immigration experts note that apprehension figures swing erratically over the years. The numbers can be driven by a variety of factors aside from enforcement, including weather, Latin American economics and decisions by illegal immigrants to make fewer trips back and forth between the United States and Mexico.
 At the dedication of a new Border Patrol station here, Mr. Bush said he hoped to strike a deal with Congress on immigration this year. Along with border control, he said, the essential elements of any bill are a temporary-worker program, a crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants and a procedure that would allow some illegal immigrants to legalize their status.
 The politics of immigration have shifted noticeably since the Senate passed a bipartisan bill by a vote of 62 to 36 last May. When Democrats took control of Congress three months ago, many people predicted that it would be easier to pass a comprehensive bill with the major ingredients sought by Mr. Bush.
 But the outlook is now uncertain. Republicans and some moderate Democrats in Congress say they could not vote for any measure granting legal status to illegal immigrants. 
 Presidential politics appear to have pushed Republicans, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, to the right. Some conservatives, who are influential in selecting a Republican presidential nominee, say that illegal immigrants have taken jobs from Americans and should not be rewarded for their illegal behavior.
 Speaking to dozens of Border Patrol agents, gathered here under a bright sun, Mr. Bush said: ''We've got to resolve the status of millions of illegal immigrants already in the country. People who entered the country illegally should not be given amnesty. Amnesty is the forgiveness of an offense without penalty. I oppose amnesty, and I think most people in the United States Congress oppose amnesty.''
 Mr. Bush, a former governor of Texas, said he was ''working closely with Republicans and Democrats to find a practical answer that lies between granting automatic citizenship to every illegal immigrant and deporting every illegal immigrant.''
 Under his proposal, Mr. Bush said, ''illegal immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay'' could do so in some circumstances, if they paid fines and back taxes, learned English and showed they had worked here for a number of years.
 Illegal immigrants could apply for citizenship. ''Approval would not be automatic,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They would have to wait in line behind those who played by the rules and followed the law.'' 
 Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at the Cornell Law School, said if illegal immigrants had to wait their turn in this way, it might ''take decades'' for them to become citizens. 
 Administration officials estimate that 12 million illegal immigrants are in the United States and say the number has been growing by an average of 400,000 a year.
 A White House draft proposal, circulated on Capitol Hill in the last two weeks, has angered many advocates of immigrants' rights, who assert that it would require illegal immigrants to pay exorbitant fines and fees. The draft says the Bush administration would ''bring illegal workers out of the shadows'' by offering them a new type of document known as Z visas. These visas would last three years and would be ''indefinitely renewable,'' but would cost $3,500 each time.
 The White House proposal would not establish a ''special path to citizenship.'' An illegal immigrant would have to return to his original country, file an application with a United States embassy or consulate and pay a fine -- perhaps $10,000 -- to become a lawful permanent resident. 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and a co-author of the immigration bill passed by the Senate last year, said no measure would be approved this year unless it had ''strong Republican support.'' Democrats said they were counting on the White House to deliver at least 25 Republican votes for the bill in the Senate and 70 in the House.
 In response, Mr. Bush said Monday, ''I've been working to bring Republicans and Democrats together to resolve outstanding issues so that Congress can pass a comprehensive bill and I can sign it into law this year.''

HEADLINE: Iran Says It Can Enrich Uranium on an Industrial Scale

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI; William J. Broad and David E. Sanger contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: NATANZ, Iran, April 9 

 BODY:
Iran said Monday that it was now capable of industrial-scale uranium enrichment, a development that would defy two United Nations resolutions passed to press the country to suspend its enrichment program.
 The announcement was greeted with skepticism by Western diplomats and nuclear experts, who said the declaration seemed to have more to do with political showmanship than technical progress. While reporters were invited to the country's main nuclear complex at Natanz, they were not shown any evidence that enrichment of uranium, the step needed to make reactor fuel or bomb fuel, was under way.
 In a speech on Monday, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned that if the West did not end its pressure against Iran to halt the production of uranium, Iran would review its policy of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitoring entity. 
 It was unclear whether that was a threat to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as North Korea did four years ago, but Mr. Ahmadinejad said the West ''should know that the Iranian nation will defend its rights and that this path is irreversible.'' 
 ''With great pride, I announce as of today our dear country is among the countries of the world that produces nuclear fuel on an industrial scale,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad told government officials, diplomats, and foreign and local journalists at the Natanz site. ''This nuclear fuel is definitely for the development of Iran and expansion of peace in the world.'' 
 The government had decreed April 9 a national nuclear technology day. Monday was the first anniversary of Mr. Ahmadinejad's announcement that Iran had produced enriched uranium at a pilot plant.
 The spokesman for the National Security Council, Gordon Johndroe, told reporters traveling with President Bush that the administration was ''very concerned'' about Iran's declaration, adding, ''Iran's decision to limit even further its cooperation with the I.A.E.A. is unacceptable.'' But the administration has carefully avoided making specific threats about how it might respond, other than to press for tightening sanctions through the United Nations Security Council.
 The Council unanimously passed a resolution on March 24 to expand sanctions on Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear program. The resolution barred all arms exports and froze some of the financial assets of 28 Iranians linked to the country's military and nuclear programs. 
 The United States and some European governments have accused Iran of having a clandestine weapons program, but Iran contends that its program is peaceful, for energy purposes, and that it wants to produce fuel for its reactors.
 Talks between Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, and Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, resumed last week after Iran released 15 British sailors and marines who, Iranian officials contended, had strayed into Iranian waters. Mr. Solana negotiates on behalf of the permanent members of the Security Council -- Russia, China, Britain, France and the United States -- plus Germany.
 Iran's sprawling facility in the desert at Natanz has a small pilot plant where for more than a year engineers have periodically shot uranium gas into scores of spinning centrifuges in an experimental effort to master enrichment, a complex kind of purification process. Uranium enriched to low levels can fuel reactors; if enriched to high levels, it can fuel nuclear weapons.
 Introducing uranium gas into centrifuges at the pilot plant would be nothing new. Injecting it into the larger facility under construction at the site, the one intended for ''industrial production,'' would be a step forward. Nuclear experts said it was unclear what Mr. Larijani was referring to when he said Monday, ''Yes, we have injected gas.''
 The large industrial plant under construction at Natanz is roughly half the size of the Pentagon. Inspectors say Iran is constructing 3,000 centrifuges as a first step toward 54,000. 
 A senior European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because diplomatic negotiations were under way, said he doubted that Iran had crossed the line and begun enriching uranium at the larger plant because Iranian and European negotiators were seriously discussing potential ways to resolve Iran's standoff with the Security Council.
 ''I would be surprised if they fed the centrifuges because it would jeopardize the talks,'' the diplomat said. ''There are proposals out there that are quite serious.''
 The diplomat, who follows the nuclear agency's work, added that none of its inspectors were currently at Natanz but that they were on their way. He said their assessment would clarify what, if anything, the Iranians had actually achieved.
 Frustrated Western experts have said for months that the underlying question is whether the frenetic activity at the desert complex is real, a bluff or a little of both. The issue, they say, is whether Iran has really mastered the centrifuge basics or is involved in a political show to strengthen its bargaining position in the global standoff.
 David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington and a former United Nations weapons inspector, also said Iran for the moment seemed more interested in scoring diplomatic points than in making technical advances.
 ''Ahmadinejad is trying to demonstrate facts on the ground and negotiate from a stronger position,'' he said. ''If they enriched today'' in the cavernous industrial plant, ''it would destroy the ability to go forward on any negotiation.''
 Mr. Albright said such enrichment ''would escalate the confrontation,'' adding, ''It raises all kinds of worst-case scenarios that, if not managed correctly, could escalate up to a military action.''
 It was unclear how seriously to take Iran's threat to reduce further its cooperation with inspectors. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on state matters, issued a forceful warning last month after the Security Council resolution was passed, saying Iran would strike back against any threats or violence.
 ''Until today, what we have done has been in accordance with the international regulations,'' he said in a nationwide address observing the first day of the Persian New Year on March 21. ''But if they take illegal actions, we too can take illegal actions and will do so.''
 Ayatollah Khamenei said the nuclear program was more important than the nationalization of oil in 1958, a source of great pride for most Iranians.
 ''If they want to treat us with threats and use force or violence, the Iranian nation will undoubtedly use all its capabilities to strike the invading enemies,'' he added.

HEADLINE: U.S. Toughens China Position

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 

 BODY:
Has the Bush administration's economic team run out of patience with China?
 For years, President Bush has avoided confronting Beijing with sanctions or legal challenges to its trade practices, preferring to use diplomacy to press China to bring down its trade deficit with the United States, now at $232 billion. But these days, the conciliatory approach looks as if it is being reconsidered, if not discarded.
The latest in a string of tough actions against China came on Monday, when the top American trade envoy, Susan C. Schwab, announced that the United States would take China to court at the World Trade Organization over suspected trade barriers and piracy of books, music, videos and other goods.
 That action came after two other unfair trade complaints earlier this year, one last month threatening stiff new duties on certain imports, and the other in February, challenging China over its subsidies of manufactured goods. 
 Ms. Schwab said that even though negotiations had failed to solve trade problems, the latest steps ''should not be viewed as hostile actions against China'' and that resolving issues at the World Trade Organization in Geneva was ''the normal way for mature trading partners'' to handle differences.
 The new policy risks angering or embarrassing those in Beijing who may be trying to reform economic policies as Washington wants. In addition, many trade experts worry that China might retaliate against American imports or cut back on cooperation sought by Washington on other issues, like diplomatic problems involving Iran, North Korea and Sudan. 
 Still, the new policy was widely seen by trade specialists and industry spokesmen as necessary to send a signal not only to Beijing but also to Democrats in Congress, who plan even tougher sanctions against China if the administration does not act. 
 The announcement by Ms. Schwab on piracy and trade barriers brought cautious praise from an array of Democratic trade hawks, from Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York to Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who won last year in part by taking a tough line on trade. Many Republicans echoed their endorsement. All said the action was overdue and in need of follow-up.
 But even those who praised the administration's actions warned that more such efforts were needed.
 ''I've been sending letters to this administration for years urging these kinds of actions, and they've been ignored,'' said Representative Sander Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the trade subcommittee for the House Ways and Means panel. ''Obviously the pressure has been building in this new Congress.''
 Within the Bush administration the new actions were defended less as a shift than a complement to the policy proclaimed by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. since he took office last summer -- that it is better to solve economic disputes by negotiation. But he has also warned China that it would be dangerous to ignore the restive mood in Congress.
 Unlike Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez, who praised Ms. Schwab's announcement on Monday, Mr. Paulson issued no public statement in support of it. Aides say that as a former Goldman Sachs executive with long business experience in China, he has been reluctant to be identified with punishments or threats.
 Mr. Paulson, who has visited China three times in the last six months, is the instigator of a ''strategic economic dialogue'' with top Beijing leaders aimed at getting them to change Chinese policies and practices over the long term. People who have talked to the secretary about trade with China say he has been taken aback by the anti-China mood in Congress.
 The Treasury chief signed off on the recent steps against China, however, according to administration officials.
 ''What the action today means is that Paulson realizes his approach will not deliver concrete results in time to avoid the risk of serious Congressional reaction,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a policy institute in Washington.
 ''The problem is that the secretary's Chinese friends have not given him much help,'' Mr. Bergsten added, referring to the unwillingness or inability of Mr. Paulson's counterparts to move on issues as quickly as Washington wants.
 Mr. Paulson has tried not to get into the specifics of trade issues like subsidies, the piracy of intellectual property in software, videos and pharmaceuticals or the welter of Chinese trade barriers on American goods and financial services.
 The one issue he has spoken out on the most is currency, echoing the criticism of many economists that China's practice of buying huge amounts of dollars has kept the value of its currency, the yuan, artificially low in order to promote its own exports by making them cheaper.
 But China has taken only moderate steps to allow its currency values to float on the open market. Many in the administration are known to be increasingly impatient over the lack of progress in this area.
 The next test of the administration's tough new approach will be in late May, when a delegation of Chinese officials, led by Vice Premier Wu Yi, will come to Washington for another session of the strategic dialogue started by Mr. Paulson.
 It is to be a second round of the talks begun in December, when the Treasury secretary took a team of cabinet members, and Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, to push the dialogue as the best way to solve problems.
 At the time, Democrats said they would pause in their plans to push for tough measures against China to give the dialogue a chance to work. Now they say it has clearly failed and the more recent escalation is welcome.
 What China will do next is an open question in the administration. The answer may not be clear until Mr. Paulson's economic meeting with the Chinese in May.
 But many Chinese experts warn that the latest steps by the administration will not help persuade China to change its reliance on a low-valued currency and other restrictions on imports and investment. The power and influence of Communist Party leaders tied to the export sector is too great, they say.
 ''If the U.S. takes more actions against China, it will harm Paulson's dialogue with China and future trade meetings,'' said Chen Jianan, a professor of economics at Fudan University in Shanghai. But he said the most recent actions could compel both sides to negotiate.
 In the meantime, China is considered likely to try to ease tensions, not by opening up its own markets, but by opening up its wallet and purchasing more American exports, whether planes or machinery or computer chips.
 There are media reports in China that the leadership will announce new purchases in advance of the May meeting, just as they did before President Hu Jintao's visit to the White House last year. 
 Mr. Gutierrez, the Commerce secretary, has said repeatedly that the way to reduce the trade deficit with China, which now is about a third of the total trade deficit with other countries, is to export more. But Congress is considered unlikely to be impressed by a Chinese shopping spree. 
 All sides agree that the latest American actions portend a period of rough weather in United States-Chinese relations.

HEADLINE: Challenging China

 BODY:
The Bush administration, facing Congressional pressure on trade, has lodged complaints against China three times in the last three months. The big question for trade policy and American businesses in particular is what happens next. 
 If the answer is a methodical working through of some of the difficult issues raised by a large and growing trade relationship, this could still prove to be a productive effort. But if these complaints add up to the hesitant first steps toward an all-out trade war with China, everyone will lose, including American workers, whom the White House and lawmakers say they are trying to protect.
The administration announced yesterday that it was filing two cases against China at the World Trade Organization. The first is over China's failure to crack down on pirated goods like movies and books. It will also challenge Chinese restrictions on the distribution of foreign films, music and more.
 The move came less than two weeks after the Commerce Department said it would impose duties on two Chinese paper makers that it says got an unfair boost from China's government. Experts say such duties could expand to steel, plastic and beyond unless China reins in subsidies. In February, the U.S. opened another subsidy case at the W.T.O.
 What must be avoided are the kinds of misunderstandings -- intensified by growing anti-China sentiment in this country -- that lead to tit-for-tat tariff reprisals until things spin out of control. A trade war would do more harm to American business than to China's subsidies. What would happen to Boeing if the steel used in its jets became more expensive? The last thing a country with a record trade deficit can afford is to hurt its exporters.
 The administration's decision to get tough on China appears to be intended in part to soothe Congress's antitrade passions long enough to win approval of a new free-trade deal with South Korea that would be good for U.S. consumers and exporters. But the White House would do better if it educated Americans about free trade's benefits, which include cheaper clothes, televisions and cars, which hold down inflation. According to the Progressive Policy Institute, a Democratic research group, foreign manufacturers invest more in America than American manufacturers invest abroad. 
 It doesn't feel that way to workers, who know that their wages have stagnated and hear every day that overseas competition is to blame and that little has been done to help displaced workers. But China didn't break the piggy bank. President Bush and Congress did, with ill-conceived tax cuts for the wealthy and the war in Iraq. 
 If used correctly, pressures like the paper duties could help convince China's leadership that its businesses would be more efficient and its economy stronger if they were weaned off subsidies. But America must also invest a lot more at home, by educating its work force for the future, improving the infrastructure that manufacturers need and succoring the older line workers who cannot make the transition to one more career. That would do a lot more good than starting a trade war.

HEADLINE: Deadline Nears In Chavez Fight Against Big Oil

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Simon Romero reported from Caracas, Clifford Krauss from Houston.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 9 

 BODY:
With President Hugo Chavez setting a May 1 deadline for an ambitious plan to wrest control of several major oil projects from American and European companies, a showdown is looming here over access to some of the most coveted energy resources outside the Middle East.
 Moving beyond empty threats to cut off all oil exports to the United States, officials have recently stepped up the pressure on the oil companies operating here, warning that they might sell American refineries meant to process Venezuelan crude oil even as they seek new outlets in China and elsewhere around the world.
''Chavez is playing a game of chicken with the largest oil companies in the world,'' said Pietro Pitts, an oil analyst who publishes LatinPetroleum, an industry magazine based here. ''And for the moment he is winning.'' 
 But this confrontation could easily end up with everyone losing. 
 The biggest energy companies could be squeezed out of the most promising oil patch in the Western Hemisphere. But Venezuela risks undermining the engine behind Mr. Chavez's socialist-inspired revolution by hampering its ability to transform the nation's newly valuable heavy oil into riches for years to come.
 As Mr. Chavez asserts much greater control over Venezuela's oil industry, his national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, is already showing signs of stress. Management has become increasingly politicized, and money for maintenance and development is being diverted to pay for a surge in public spending.
 During the last several decades, control of global oil reserves has steadily passed from private companies to national oil companies like Petroleos de Venezuela. According to a new Rice University study, 77 percent of the world's 1.148 trillion barrels of proven reserves is in the hands of the national companies; 14 of the top 20 oil-producing companies are state-controlled. 
 The implications are potentially stark for the United States, which imports 60 percent of its oil. State companies tend to be far less efficient and innovative, and far more politicized. No place captures the shift in power to nationalist governments like Venezuela. 
 ''We are on a collision course with Chavez over oil,'' said Michael J. Economides, an oil consultant in Houston who wrote an influential essay comparing Mr. Chavez's populist appeal in Latin America with the pan-Arabism of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya two decades ago. ''Chavez poses a much bigger threat to America's energy security than Saddam Hussein ever did.''
 Consider the quandary facing Exxon Mobil after its chairman, Rex W. Tillerson, recently suggested that Exxon might be forced to abandon a major Venezuelan oil project because of its growing troubles with Mr. Chavez. 
 The energy world took notice. So did Mr. Chavez's government. 
 Only a day later, Venezuelan agents raided Exxon's offices here in the San Ignacio towers, a bastion for this country's business elite. The government said that the raid was part of a tax investigation, but energy analysts said the exchange of threat and counterthreat was all too clear.
 Politics and ideology are driving the confrontation here as Mr. Chavez seeks to limit American influence around the world, starting in Venezuela's oil fields. Mr. Chavez views the Bush administration as a threat, in part because it indirectly supported a coup that briefly removed him from power five years ago. Yet the United States remains Venezuela's largest customer.
 Mr. Chavez recently decreed that Venezuela would take control of heavy oil fields in the Orinoco Belt, a region southeast of Caracas of so much potential that some experts say it could give the country more reserves than Saudi Arabia. The United States Geological Survey describes the area as the ''largest single hydrocarbon accumulation in the world,'' making it highly coveted despite Mr. Chavez's erratic policies. 
 By setting a May 1 deadline for what some foreign oil executives consider an expropriation, the Venezuelan leader risks losing Exxon, ConocoPhillips and other companies, which are loath to put their employees and billions of dollars in assets under Venezuelan management. 
 A departure of expertise and investment could weaken an oil industry already unsettled by being transformed into Mr. Chavez's most crucial tool for carrying out his reconfiguration of Venezuelan society. 
 Mr. Chavez has raised taxes on foreign oil companies and forced other oil ventures to come under his government's control. And he has purged more than 17,000 employees from Petroleos de Venezuela after a debilitating strike about four years ago.
 The talks have bogged down over how much the oil companies' stakes in four big Orinoco projects are worth, whether Venezuela's cash-short oil company would pay for the assets in oil instead of cash and, most important, who would manage the reduced operations of the foreign oil companies. 
 Still prevented from producing oil in places like Saudi Arabia and Mexico, the companies desperately want to hold on to their Venezuelan reserves. Companies like Exxon, whose Venezuelan assets were nationalized in the 1970s and returned to it in the 1990s, know the pitfalls of operating here and figure that Mr. Chavez will not be around forever. 
 With oil prices at high levels, oil-rich countries as varied as Angola, Norway and Russia are also waiting to see how the talks unfold. Governments in Kazakhstan and Nigeria are trying to negotiate better terms with foreign oil companies as well. But none are doing so with Mr. Chavez's revolutionary flourish. 
 ''It is a defining moment,'' said Christopher Ruppel, a geopolitical risk analyst at John S. Herold Inc., the energy consulting firm.
 Last week, Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela's energy minister, sent a chilling signal to the oil companies, saying Venezuela might sell refineries in Texas and Louisiana that process crude from Exxon's Venezuelan oil fields. Analysts say Venezuela could be setting the stage to produce much less oil in ventures with American oil companies for export to the United States. 
 The oil companies decline to talk publicly about the negotiations, but people in the industry say Exxon and ConocoPhillips, two of the largest American companies in Venezuela, are digging in their heels. The companies, however, lack a united front: Chevron is expected to accept Mr. Chavez's terms, since it is also negotiating access to a large natural gas project in Venezuela.
 ''If the majors want to negotiate a settlement, they have to be able to let Chavez save face and look like he has won this with his people,'' said Michael S. Goldberg, head of the international dispute resolution group at Baker Botts, a law firm in Houston that represents many of the major oil companies around the world. 
 For decades, Venezuela has been a leading supplier of oil to American refineries, a resilient economic relationship that remains intact despite deteriorating political ties. Venezuela is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United States, accounting for more than 10 percent of American oil imports. 
 Once Venezuela's heavy oil is counted, its reserves may surpass those of Saudi Arabia or Canada, though the oil will be worthless without ventures to extract it. American oil producers are drawn here by Venezuela's 80 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, among the largest outside the Middle East. 
 But Mr. Chavez is chipping away at those ties by forming ventures with state oil companies from China, Iran, India and Brazil. Venezuelan exports of oil and refined products to the United States fell 8.2 percent to a 12-year low in 2006 of about 1.3 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Chavez has accepted higher shipping costs to reach China, expanding exports tenfold to about 160,000 barrels a day since 2004.
 ''If the United States wants to diversify its oil supplies for reasons of national security, then Venezuela should be allowed to diversify its customer base for the same reason,'' said Mazhar al-Shereidah, an Iraqi-born petroleum economist who is one of Venezuela's leading energy experts. 
 But even under the best of circumstances, China's retooling of its refineries to handle Venezuela's sour, or high-sulfur, crude oil could take five to seven years. And it is not clear whether Mr. Chavez's new foreign energy partners are prepared to invest heavily until they are confident they can trust him.
 In a country where many facets of life are politicized, output levels are no exception. Venezuela says it produces 3.3 million barrels a day, but OPEC officials say production is closer to 2.5 million, 1 million barrels less than in 1999 when Mr. Chavez's presidency began.
 No one sees an immediate crisis at Petroleos de Venezuela. But its windfall from high oil prices masks the devilish complexity and rising costs of producing heavy oil. 
 Meanwhile, the company acknowledged last month that spending on ''social development'' almost doubled in 2006, to $13.3 billion, while its spending on exploration badly trailed its global peers. And Petroleos de Venezuela's work force has ballooned to 89,450, up 29 percent since 2001 even as production declined.
 Independent analysts are alarmed by a troubling increase in explosions and refining accidents during the last two years, which authorities brush off as sabotage. Mr. Ramirez, the energy minister, declined repeated requests for an interview. 
 With heavily subsidized domestic oil consumption surging, the government spends an estimated $9 billion to keep gasoline prices under 20 cents a gallon. Moreover, Mr. Chavez uses Petroleos de Venezuela to finance other nationalizations, like its $739 million purchase of an electric utility in Caracas from the AES Corporation.
 Petroleos de Venezuela's cash is said to be running short as Mr. Chavez uses its revenue to cement political alliances with Bolivia, Cuba and Nicaragua. The company has borrowed more than $11 billion since the start of the year, a rapid debt buildup that reflects a wager by Mr. Chavez that oil prices will remain high indefinitely.

HEADLINE: In a Courageous Village, Ballots Bring Bullets

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: DUMMERWALA, Pakistan 

 BODY:
President Bush has become a bosom buddy of President Pervez Musharraf and sealed that friendship with $10 billion in military aid, but any American official who praises Pakistan's ''democracy'' might want to visit this bullet-scarred village in the Punjab.
 Dummerwala held free local elections here last year. But many people voted the ''wrong'' way, causing the candidate of the local feudal lord to lose. So a day after the election, a small army of gunmen arrived and began rampaging through the houses of the clan members who opposed the lord's choice. 
Waheed Rahman, a top student, 14 years old, who dreamed of becoming an engineer, was wounded in the opening minutes of the attack.
 ''When he was shot, Waheed fell down and begged for water,'' said his father, Matiullah. ''They were surrounding him. But they just laughed and shot at the water tank and destroyed it. Then they ripped the clothes off the women and dragged them around half-naked.''
 For the next two hours, the attackers beat the men and abused the women, destroyed homes, and told their victims that the feudal lord had arranged for the police to stay away so he could teach them a lesson.
 Indeed, the police did stay away. Even when two of the villagers escaped and ran to the police station, begging the officers to stop the violence, the police delayed moving for three hours.
 By the time it was over, a woman was dying, as was Waheed, and many others were wounded. 
 The attack here in Dummerwala is a reminder that democracy is about far more than free elections. In Pakistan, many rural areas remain under the thumb of feudal lords who use the government to keep themselves rich and everyone else impoverished.
 For real democracy to come to Pakistan, we'll need to see not only free elections and the retirement of President Musharraf, but also a broad effort to uproot the feudal rulers in areas like this, 300 miles south of Islamabad. That's not easy to do, but promoting education is the best way to combat both feudalism and fundamentalism.
 Instead, we've been focusing on selling arms and excusing General Musharraf's one-man rule. 
 Husain Haqqani of Boston University calculates that the overt and trackable U.S. aid to General Musharraf's Pakistan amounted to $9.8 billion -- of which 1 percent went for children's survival and health, and just one-half of 1 percent for democracy promotion (and even that went partly to a commission controlled by General Musharraf). 
 The big beneficiary of U.S. largesse hasn't been the Pakistani people, but the Pakistani Army.
 General Musharraf has done an excellent job of nurturing Pakistan's economy, but he is an autocrat. As Asma Jahangir, a prominent lawyer in Lahore, told me: ''Until now, Pakistanis have hated the American government but not the American people. But I'm afraid that may change. Unless the U.S. distances itself from Musharraf, the way things are going Pakistanis will come to hate the American people as well.''
 Just last week, General Musharraf's secret police goons roughed up and sexually molested Dr. Amna Buttar, an American doctor of Pakistani origin who heads a human rights organization. Dr. Buttar says that she had been warned by a senior intelligence official not to protest against the government and that she was specifically targeted when she protested anyway.
 When our ''antiterrorism'' funds support General Musharraf's thugs as they terrorize American citizens, it's time to rethink our approach. Imagine if we had spent $10 billion not building up General Musharraf, but supporting Pakistani schools.
 One place we could support a school is here in Dummerwala. After the attack, the victims in the village were so panicky that they pulled all their children out of school. 
 ''They say, 'If you don't cooperate with us, we will kill your sons,' '' said Tazeel Rahman, one of the victims. ''This is not democracy. This is a dictatorship. This is terrorism.''
 (When I interviewed the attackers, they insisted that the victims had simply killed themselves. They compensated for this wildly implausible version of events by sending an armed mob to persuade me of its merits.) 
 We Americans could learn something about democracy from the brave people here. The villagers insist that if they are still alive and allowed to vote, they will again defy their feudal lord in the next election. 
 We in the West sometimes say that poor countries like Pakistan aren't ready for democracy. But who takes democracy more seriously: Americans who routinely don't bother to vote, or peasants in Dummerwala who risk their lives to vote?

HEADLINE: Singapore's Highly Paid Officials Get Richer

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, April 9 

 BODY:
How much money does it take to keep a government minister in Singapore happy?
 The government says a million dollars is not enough, and on Monday it announced a 60 percent increase in ministers' salaries, to an average of $1.9 million Singapore dollars, or about $1.3 million, by next year.
 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's pay will jump to about $2 million -- five times the $400,000 earned by President Bush. 
 In this nation where the bottom line truly is the bottom line, the argument goes, you have to pay to get them and you have to pay to keep them clean.
 ''If we don't do that, in the long term the government system will slowly crumble and collapse,'' Defense Minister Teo Chee Hean told reporters last month. ''Corruption will set in, and we will become like many other countries, and face the problems that many other countries face,'' The Straits Times, Singapore's largest-circulation newspaper, quoted him as saying.
 In announcing the pay increases on Monday, Mr. Teo, who also oversees the civil service, said: ''We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join us. But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us.''
 Singapore's pay system was created in 1994 by the nation's founding prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew. It pegged the salaries of government ministers and top civil servants to the money they might earn at the top of the private sector.
 Under that formula, ministers are to be paid two-thirds of the median of the top eight earners in each of six professions: accounting, law, banking, engineering, multinational companies and local manufacturing.
 There has been no public sign of discontent among the men and women who run Singapore, but last month the prime minister noted that they were earning just 55 percent of that benchmark. Hence the raise for the three dozen men and women who run Singapore.
 Defending the system against an unusual public yelp of pain, Mr. Lee, whose title is minister mentor, painted a horrifying picture of a Singapore governed by ministers who earn no more than ministers elsewhere.
 ''Your apartment will be worth a fraction of what it is,'' he said. ''Your jobs will be in peril, your security will be at risk, and our women will become maids in other people's countries.''
 It is true that Singapore has one of the most efficient and corruption-free governments in the world. Transparency International, a private monitoring agency, recently listed it as the fifth most corruption-free nation of 163 surveyed. 
 It is Asia's second-richest country after Japan, with a gross domestic product per capita of about $31,000. The first Prime Minister Lee said it could well afford to pay its leaders top dollar.
 The average Singaporean earns roughly $3,000 a month, and the government has voiced concern over a widening gap between rich and poor. The ministers' pay was approved three months before the sales tax is to be increased by 2 percent. 
 Talk of the pay raise drew criticism here that included letters to newspapers and an online petition that has more than 800 signatures.
 ''I am sure Enron and Worldcom paid more than top dollar for their top executives, and look where their companies are now -- six feet under,'' Mohamad Rosle Ahmad wrote to the editor of The Straits Times.
 The elder Mr. Lee said naysayers needed a reality check. ''I say you have no sense of proportion; you don't know what life is about,'' he said.
 ''The cure to all this talk is really a good dose of incompetent government,'' he added. ''You get that alternative, and you'll never put Singapore together again.''
 The Straits Times quoted him as saying his current salary as minister mentor was about $1.8 million.
 Some Singaporeans suggested that other motivations should also come into play for government jobs.
 ''What about other redeeming intangibles such as honor and sense of duty, dedication, passion and commitment, loyalty and service?'' asked Hussin Mutalib, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, in a Straits Times online forum.
 Carolyn Lim, a prominent writer, suggested in an essay that Singapore needed a little more heart to go along with its hard head.
 ''To see a potential prime minister as no different from a potential top lawyer, and likely to be enticed by the same stupendous salary, would be to blur the lines between two very different domains,'' she wrote.
 The minister mentor brushed aside such concerns. ''Those are admirable sentiments,'' he said. ''But we live in a real world.''

HEADLINE: Major Gift to WNYC

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
The public radio station WNYC-AM/FM is to announce today that it has received a $6 million gift from the Jerome L. Greene Foundation and that it will name the station's new 120-seat street-level performing space for Mr. Greene, a real estate executive and philanthropist who died in 1999. The gift is believed to be the largest ever received by a public radio station. The donation was made in conjunction with the station's $57.5 million capital campaign, which is also being officially announced today. Gifts of $42.4 million are already in hand, including $5 million from the Kaplen Foundation. The campaign money will also be used to set up a $12.5 million program development fund, with the remainder paying for the station's move in the fall to 160 Varick Street from its 84-year home in the Municipal Building. Laura Walker, the station's president and chief executive, said the money would enable WNYC to double its news staff of 18, adding an arts unit and reporters to cover the New York economy, immigration and the environment.

HEADLINE: Imperial Nights in Tunisia, With Mythology Underfoot

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, sits gazing languorously at herself in the river after a musical solo on an aulos, an ancient double-reed pipe. The river itself is symbolized by an elderly yet muscular man sitting across from her. 
 Athena looks vaguely unhappy, perhaps because the constant playing, which involved using her mouth as a kind of bagpipe, has distorted the shape of her lips. Today she might opt for Restylane or Botox injections, but in the ancient mythological tale, she threw the instrument on the ground in anger. The satyr Marsyas, depicted in the right-hand corner of this mosaic, picked it up and challenged Apollo to a competition. Infuriated by his arrogance, Apollo had Marsyas flayed.
The narrative in this mosaic, discovered in 1974, traverses Greek and Roman mythology and would have been familiar to citizens of fourth-century Kelibia (now in northeastern Tunisia). It is among 26 mosaics -- among the finest in Tunisian museum collections -- that the J. Paul Getty Museum, with the Institut National du Patrimoine in Tunisia, have brought to the United States for the first time. The exhibition runs through April 30 at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, Calif., home to the museum's sprawling collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan artifacts. 
 Muscular gods ride chariots drawn by superb sea horses; voluptuous, half-nude women pour jugs of water down their own backs. Rabbits eagerly nibble grapes, and ferocious lions devour their prey. The panoply of tales told in stone sheds some light on how a wealthy Roman elite lived in North Africa between the second and sixth centuries. 
 ''The exhibition came about from a longstanding relationship with our colleagues in Tunisia,'' the Getty's associate curator of antiquities, Janet Grossman, said in an interview. Over the last decade the Getty Conservation Institute has worked with the Tunisian institute to train technicians to restore mosaics that remain in situ, sometimes buried beneath the rubble of ancient Roman villas and public buildings.
 All of the mosaics on view at the Getty Villa were unearthed over the last 200 years and carefully preserved in Tunisia's museums. 
 By the second and third centuries, the North African region that is now Tunisia was one of the crown jewels of the Roman Empire. Rich in olives and grain, it had become a wealthy outpost of Rome, and Carthage, its sprawling port, was fast growing into a cultural and economic hub. 
 Julius Caesar had assured Rome's dominion over North Africa in the battle at Thapsus of 47 B.C., where troops vanquished forces led by his archrival Pompey. In the following centuries, upwardly mobile citizens across Tunisia vied to imitate the Romans, their gods, their culture, their clothes and their lifestyles. And like conspicuous consumers everywhere, wealthy Tunisians wanted impressive homes: some of these villas were as large as 21,000 square feet.
 Americans who amass new fortunes today race to cover their walls with art that proclaims their status, but the status symbols of ancient North Africa's megawealthy lay literally at their feet. And aside from the prestige value, mosaic floors helped cool interior temperatures in an area of the globe that could be relentlessly hot.
 Archaeologists have found mosaics not just in villa reception rooms, but also in dining rooms and bedrooms. Only the floors of the servants' quarters were left bare. Although mosaics were occasionally created on walls, ''the medium was really viewed as an efficient floor covering, waterproofed, durable and easy to walk on,'' said another expert, Christine Kondoleon, a senior curator of Greek and Roman art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. 
 Despite the obsessive focus on Rome, experts say, the mosaics were also molded by the African experience. They were more colorful and exuberant than other mosaics of that period because of the stones in the area, Ms. Kondoleon said.
 If North Africans were eager to show off their knowledge of Rome, there was a highly practical incentive. Aicha Ben Abed, a scholar at the Tunisian institute, writes in the book ''Tunisian Mosaics: Treasures From Roman Africa'' that a legal statute compensated citizens on the basis of how well they adhered to the values of Roman civilization. Cities that complied most admirably were treated as colonies, which meant that their denizens had the same rights as Roman citizens. 
 A third-century mosaic depicting two lions ferociously tearing apart a boar was found in the dining room of a home in El Jem, inland in southern Tunisia. That same room also revealed a nine-foot-long floor portrait of a procession with Bacchus as its centerpiece. (Although the Getty had planned to include the larger piece in its show, experts decided that possible damage made it too risky to remove from the wall of the El Jem Museum in northeast Tunisia, which has one of the world's richest collections of Roman mosaics.) 
 In Roman mythology, Bacchus, the god of wine and fertility, was thought capable of subduing the forces of nature and wild animals. The lions devouring the boar have fierce paws but somewhat human faces, characteristic of animals in mosaics from that part of the world.
 Kris Kelly, a senior curator at the Getty, said that North African mosaics tended to be more colorful than those from other parts of the Roman Empire because the terrain yielded a wider variety of colored stones and glass. The works also reflect the region's focus on sea fishing along the coast, and hunting and agriculture further inland. 
 A 5-by-7-foot mosaic of Neptune driving two horses while holding his trident was found in 1904 in the coastal city of Sousse; an imposing head of Oceanus, with lobster claws darting from his hair and dolphins swimming out of his beard, was discovered in 1953 in the baths of Chott Merien, another Mediterranean port. 
 Although scholars are well versed in the ancient myths animating the mosaics, they are unsure how much of the actual work was done on site. Ms. Ben Abed says that only a single bas-relief from ancient Roman culture, found in ancient Ostia, depicts a mosaic workshop. In Thuborbo Majus archaeologists found a trove of stone chips and tesserae that made it clear that mosaics were laid on site there.
 Archaeological work began in Tunisia in the early 1800s, when the first excavations in Carthage were carried out by a Dutch military engineer, Jean Emile Humbert. After Tunisia became a French protectorate in 1881, the French government underwrote annual archaeological investigations.
 In 1921 legislation made the Tunisian protectorate the owner of all newly discovered antiquities, with the goal of discouraging private foraging by foreigners. 
 Organizing and shipping the mosaics to the Getty was a challenge. They were taken to Carthage, then shipped by boat to Marseille. From there, they were taken by truck to an airport and flown to Los Angeles. Upon arrival at the Getty Villa in Malibu, which reopened in January 2006 after an expansion and redesign, the mosaics were cleaned. 
 Archaeologists emphasize the importance of leaving mosaics in situ so that scholars can consider the role each played in the society where it existed. In the exhibition and catalog, the Getty has gone to great pains to explain that it is collaborating with Tunisia to teach workers and experts how to conserve the works where they are found. (The show coincides with negotiations by the Getty with the governments of Greece and Italy, which argue that some Greek and Etruscan items in the museum's collection were looted from their soil.) 
 Maintaining Tunisian mosaics in situ is hardly an easy task, given that so many are exposed to the elements in largely undeveloped areas. In some cases workers have had to rebury mosaics to protect them from the elements until conservation is possible.
 For now, Americans have the chance to savor fully restored specimens at the Getty. ''Stories in Stone: Conserving Mosaics of Roman Africa'' runs through April 30 at the Getty Villa, 17985 Pacific Coast Highway, Pacific Palisades, Calif; (310) 440-7300 or getty.edu.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 14, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts on Wednesday about an exhibition of Roman mosaics from Tunisia at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, Calif., misstated the date of the battle of Thapsus, in which Julius Caesar ensured Roman control of North Africa. It took place in 46 B.C., not 47 B.C. Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the commander of Caesar's opponents. They were led by Pompey's father-in-law, not by Pompey, who had been murdered.

HEADLINE: Where the Motto Is: Try, Try Again

BYLINE: By Frank Bruni

 BODY:
AT some point I began to brace for a hailstorm, and to wonder if the locusts would sweep in after that. The E.U. was plagued, on a scale that was almost biblical.
 Where to begin? Maybe with the liquor license, by which I mean the restaurant's unusually protracted struggle to get one. As the E.U. readied to open -- for the first time -- early last year, it confronted both an East Village community board in a killjoy mood and a State Liquor Authority in a withholding phase.
So the restaurant tried to make a booze-less go of it, presenting its vision of an elevated gastropub with only two of those three syllables at its disposal. It closed less than two months later, having learned that the last syllable was sort of crucial.
 By then the first chef associated with the restaurant had already left, and certain patterns had been established. Chefs would come; chefs would go. The E.U. would spring forward; the E.U. would fall back. This instability persisted even after it got a license for wine and beer last September. So did the setbacks, including a burst pipe in its building that flooded the place during dinner service on a weekend night. 
 It toweled itself off. Picked itself up. Got yet another head chef, Akhtar Nawab, a Craftbar alumnus who began in late January.
 And then, at last, its fortunes changed. From the kitchen came a very fine appetizer of grilled octopus, served with chickpeas and preserved lemon, and an even better entree of baked monkfish, the mild, meaty fish less a cynosure than a backdrop for the cockles, mussels, tomato, green peppers and saucisson sec, a French salami, around it.
 In the door came the revelers, enough on many nights to fill all 110 seats and make this restaurant feel like one of the hottest tickets in town. And the E.U., such a tortured comer, showed signs of being a real keeper.
 It still has problems. E.U. stands for European Union, and the putatively pan-European menu that Mr. Nawab has put together is eclectic not only in terms of its national influences but also in the quality of different dishes. The desserts could stand some inspiration and improvement.
 And depending on where you sit and how crowded the E.U. is, its atmosphere can be infectiously lively or insufferably chaotic. In a way that perhaps befits the restaurant's herky-jerky beginnings, you're taking a chance every time you walk in.
 But there are reliable virtues, starting with the restaurant's looks. Before the owners, Bob Giraldi and Jason Hennings, could have predicted their costly catalog of woes, they splurged on the design wizards at AvroKo -- a wise investment.
 Those conjurers of urban cool have used bricks that look centuries old, wood beams that don't look much newer, exposed wine storage areas and strategically placed rolls of butcher paper to give the E.U. a fashionably worn, disheveled look.
 They've carved a sizeable space into intimate neighborhoods: a raw bar up front, a main bar in back, some raised tables with high stools, other tables distributed throughout various passageways and nooks. And they've performed their usual magic with light, acing a dimness that never teeters into gloominess.
 The E.U. strikes a casual tone, evident in the form taken by its menu, which is made of butcher paper and doubles as your place mat. The various boxes and sections of type within this brown rectangle seem to advise a cobbled-together meal rather than a conventional progression of appetizer, entree and dessert, though that progression is an option as well.
 You can do oysters. Or cheeses, with varieties from Italy, France and Spain. Or a charcuterie plate, including prosciutto, which was terrific, and mortadella, disappointingly presented as thin slices rather than fat chunks. Or tapas: mushrooms, beets, olives and raw scallops with hearts of palm, olive oil, lemon and sea salt. 
 Most of this fare is less labor-intensive than purchasing-intensive. The E.U. provides a case study of how a restaurant can stretch out its menu without taxing its kitchen.
 Not that the kitchen doesn't make an effort, and an often impressive one at that. Like the monkfish, wild striped bass was impeccably cooked, and it came with an enticing pistachio vinaigrette that reflected Mr. Nawab's frequently clever touches.
 By seasoning pork meatballs with cumin and fennel seed, frying them until their outsides are crunchy and saucing them with yogurt, he comes up with an appetizer plate that could almost be mistaken for unusually substantial, oddly juicy falafel. And seems, in the process, to look beyond Europe's boundaries.
 He also taps into America, bringing it and Europe together in a plump but otherwise unremarkable burger, which you can order in a style identified as Italian (pecorino on top) or English (Cheddar).
 Following the leads of such recent restaurants as Sascha (now closed) and the Waverly Inn (not yet, um, open), he concocts a chicken pot pie, which in this case is really a mash of chicken, root vegetables and bechamel under a clumsy, fragile multi-tiered lid of puff pastry that shatters and scatters at the touch of a fork.
 He's doing the in-vogue comfort foods of the urban gourmand: braised veal cheeks with a horseradish-spiked creme fraiche; roasted chicken and ''dumplings,'' which turn out to be ricotta and spinach malfatti good enough to be stars of their own; a big fat sweetbread with a Marsala sauce and, for a pubby touch, a bruschetta-style piece of toast below it.
 These dishes worked in solid, unspectacular fashions, but others proved disappointing. While I was delighted by bright green fava beans with lamb loin and shoulder, I would have sacrificed them for more tender meat. A sirloin special one night and a pork special on another were also unusually tough.
 A version of a linzer torte was drier than it should have been, and an inevitable clutch of beignets had a somewhat deflated look and taste.
 You'd be better off skipping sweets and sipping more wine, from a smart list that touches down in all the major winemaking countries of Europe, does a quick survey of regions and grapes and keeps the trip relatively affordable. There's not a bottle over $70. Most are under $50. And Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden all contribute to an impressive range of beers.
 As a watering hole, the E.U. actually feels charmed, though I articulate that with my fingers crossed (a tough trick when you're typing), and in spite of my parting glance at the restaurant around midnight one busy, noisy night. I walked out as three grim-faced police officers walked in.

 CORRECTION:
A restaurant review last Wednesday of E.U., in the East Village, referred incorrectly to the beers served there. No beer from Denmark is available. The restaurant serves beer from the Czech Republic, not Czechoslovakia, which divided in 1993 to create the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
 The review also referred incorrectly to the main ingredient in a potpie. It is vegetables, not chicken.

HEADLINE: Uptick as Street Awaits Quarterly Results

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks edged higher yesterday ahead of first-quarter earnings reports, giving the Dow Jones industrial average an eighth consecutive increase, though a modest one, for its longest streak since 2003.
 The aluminum producer Alcoa, which is a Dow component and the first large company to report earnings, posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit, pleasing investors, who bid the company's stock up in after-hours trading.
But stocks showed little overall movement for a second day as investors awaited word of how companies fared during the first quarter and also of their expectations for the coming quarters. 
 ''A lot of people are going to be watching earnings very closely, and not just the numbers but the guidance that they give going forward,'' said J. Michael Barron, chief executive of Knott Capital.
 The Dow rose 4.71, to 12,573.85. Broader stock indicators edged higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.78, to 1,448.39, and the Nasdaq composite index advanced 8.43, to 2,477.61.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.87, to 814.51.
 Oil prices rose on concern about Iran's uranium enrichment announcements. A barrel of light crude for delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 38 cents, to settle at $61.89.
 Tim Hartzell, chief investment officer at Kanaly Trust, said that investors were perhaps too dour in their assessment of corporate earnings, though he, too, was waiting to get a sense of how the numbers stacked up before making any big moves. 
 Mr. Hartzell noted that companies' cash flows remained strong, and he said he expected companies to continue to repurchase stock, which could help bolster per-share profit figures.
 With no major economic data scheduled for release yesterday, investors looked to speeches by Federal Reserve officials, but appeared to be unmoved by what they heard.
 Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, said yesterday that inflation expectations remained ''well anchored'' and said inflationary pressure had been ''falling back again.'' 
 Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, said the economy had been growing but that its expansion was slowing. He also said that inflation remained stubbornly high.
 Alcoa rose 3 cents, to $34.90, in regular trading and rose in extended trading after it released its earnings.
 Citigroup rose 82 cents, to $52.40, ahead of the announcement of a major revamping planned for today, in which some 26,000 workers will be reassigned or see their jobs eliminated. 
 D. R. Horton, the nation's largest home builder by deliveries, said its second-quarter sales orders fell 37 percent, led by even steeper declines in California and the Southwest. Shares fell 34 cents, to $21.70.
 The biopharmaceutical company Adolor fell $5.12, to $3.60, after it suspended clinical studies and withdrew an application for a drug to relieve constipation.
 Shares of the drug maker Mylan Laboratories jumped 60 cents, to $21.80, after the company raised its profit forecast, citing strength in its generics and new product sales.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32, to 99 8/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.72 percent, from 4.75 percent.

HEADLINE: Jailed Adviser Is Sentenced And Fined In Fraud Case

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Martin A. Armstrong, the financial adviser who has spent seven years in jail on a contempt-of-court charge, was sentenced yesterday to five years in prison for running what prosecutors said was a $3 billion Ponzi scheme. 
 Judge John F. Keenan of the Federal District Court in Manhattan also ordered Mr. Armstrong, 57, to pay $80 million -- plus one dollar -- in restitution to the fraud victims. 
 ''Every criminal case is a human tragedy,'' Judge Keenan said at the hearing yesterday. ''But yours is particularly sad.''
 Mr. Armstrong, the founder of Princeton Economics International, has been held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan since January 2000. He has been jailed for contempt of court because he has not produced $15 million in gold and antiquities, as well as documents, stemming from a related civil suit filed by the government. It is one of the longest-running charges of contempt in American legal history. 
 Last summer, after spending several days in solitary confinement, Mr. Armstrong reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy in the criminal case, which centered on what prosecutors said was a plan from 1992 to 1999 to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses. 
 Ruling that the civil and criminal matters were separate, Judge Keenan chose not to credit Mr. Armstrong with the time he has already served. Instead, Mr. Armstrong will serve out his prison term after the civil case has been completed. A court hearing in the civil case is scheduled for April 27. 
 David Cooper, one of Mr. Armstrong's lawyers, said: ''This would have been a rational sentence in reasonable circumstances. But something is crazy about the law.'' 
 In court yesterday, Mr. Armstrong repeatedly denied that he had deliberately deceived investors. Instead, he blamed others, including the traders who carried out the trades. 
 ''In all honesty, I was too occupied, and I didn't pay enough attention to what some people did,'' he told Judge Keenan. ''I judged people too good.'' 
 His contempt charge stems from a related civil lawsuit filed by federal regulators. When he was unable to produce the gold bars and antique coins, as well as documents, that were requested by the government, the judge then overseeing the case, Richard Owen, ordered him jailed. 
 In most such cases, a person is held for contempt for 18 months at most, but Judge Owen repeatedly reimposed the jail time, demanding the production of the materials. He was removed from the case by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in November. 
 Mr. Armstrong and his lawyers have said that the contempt charge inhibited his ability to defend himself. With his assets frozen because of the civil case, he has been unable to pay his lawyers. 
 During yesterday's two-hour hearing, with his mother and two adult children in attendance, Mr. Armstrong and his lawyer combed through the government's presentencing memorandum, raising a score of objections. Judge Keenan, at times leaning back in his chair, his arms behind his head, overruled most of them.
 During a 25-minute speech before the court, Mr. Armstrong spoke at length about Japanese investing strategy and the intricacies of investing in Japanese yen. Judge Keenan interrupted him several times, reminding him of how long he had been speaking. 
 ''You're talking about Japanese markets and Japanese law,'' Judge Keenan said at one point. ''You should be talking about yourself.''

HEADLINE: Tied to a City, a Farmers' Market Proves Hardy

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me. 

 BODY:
Until last summer, the 136-year-old building at 28 Monument Square had been one of the most visible eyesores at the center of this energetic Atlantic Coast city. You would never know it now. 
 Most days, a steady stream of customers follow their noses, thirst and appetites into the building, home of the new Public Market House, where in a narrow corridor flanked by vendors they can buy fresh-cut flowers, cheese from Maine farms, a sandwich on fresh-baked bread and beer from state microbreweries.
The seven-month-old market occupies the basement and first floor of the partly renovated four-story building at the heart of downtown, which was last home to a failing surplus store. 
 Kris Horton, whose K. Horton Specialty Foods has become a local landmark, led an active public campaign last year to establish the new market after the Libra Foundation, a philanthropic organization in Maine, sold the last of its real estate holdings in Portland, including the larger indoor Portland Public Market, two blocks away. Ms. Horton and other food and farm-product vendors had worked in that market since 1998. 
 The new Public Market House, situated in a square that has supported a large outdoor seasonal farmers market for decades, has become the latest example of how fresh local food and downtown markets can stimulate activity in American cities, big and small. 
 Although the Public Market House is and will continue to be significantly smaller in size and sales than the old market it replaced, it will not be subsidized. Moreover, the Public Market House's proximity to the existing outdoor Wednesday farmers' market prompted the authors of a new economic study to propose promoting the indoor market as the centerpiece of a ''market district.'' 
 ''Markets bring life to a city,'' said Nelle Hanig, a business development specialist in Portland's Economic Development Division, who helped accelerate the permit process to have the market built. ''This one is already a destination. The location of the Public Market House is important to its success. It's right in the middle of town. It's becoming a focus of activity, and that's always good in a city.''
 The study, completed last month for the Portland Downtown District, an economic development agency, said that the Public Market House is already attracting enough shoppers to generate $1.2 million annually in sales. The building's owner is planning to renovate the second floor to provide space for four or five more vendors, who could generate a further $1.2 million in sales. 
 The market district, the study said, might also include a covered outdoor market with 25 vendors on nearby Lancaster Lane, as well as producers selling goods on ''day tables'' in Monument Square. 
 The old market's sale last August and the steady departure of vendors until its formal closing in January stirred passions throughout the city. Downtown workers and weekend shoppers from the suburbs loved the old market's homegrown vendors and special events. 
 But vendors paid less than $20 a square foot to rent space in a market that cost the foundation as much as $75 a square foot, said Morris Fischer, president of CB Richard Ellis-the Boulos Company, which represented Guggenheim Real Estate, the New York investment firm that bought the market last August. 
 ''Libra could not get it to a break-even point,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''Libra supported it for a long time hoping they could make sense of it. They came to the conclusion they couldn't do it any longer. Others who looked at it said the same thing.'' 
 It seems, however, that the old market may be put to a new public use. On March 19, the Portland City Council approved a measure to ask voters to allow the city to buy and convert the old market into the city's public library, replacing the current main library building, which is next door. A referendum to approve a $1 million bond is set for June 12. Most observers expect voters to approve the bond. 
 Voters previously approved a $4 million bond to improve library services, and if the June referendum passes that money would also be used to renovate the market. The balance of the $9.5 million purchase and renovation project would be raised by the library.
 Last summer, Ms. Horton and her partners in Market Vendors -- A Country Bouquet, Maine Beer and Beverage and Big Sky Bread Company -- worked with the owner of 28 Monument Square, as well as a contractor, a banker, tradesmen and city officials to quickly renovate the derelict building, which had been closed for two years. The project took six weeks and cost the building's owner, H. Alan Mooney, $250,000. The Public Market House opened as scheduled on Sept. 1.
 Mr. Mooney, a prominent engineer, had paid $725,000 to buy 28 Monument Square after learning that Ms. Horton and her partners, all of whom he knew, were intent on establishing a new market. ''If I didn't have a tenant ready to get into the building immediately, I wouldn't have taken it on,'' Mr. Mooney said. 
 He said that he is planning to spend $300,000 more this spring to renovate the market's second floor to make room for new vendors, prepare the third and fourth floors for professional offices and restore the 12,000-square-foot building's historic facade.
 The catalyst in this tale of civic renewal was the announcement by the Libra Foundation in February 2006 that it would sell the last of its holdings in downtown Portland, including the Portland Public Market, which the foundation built and opened in 1998.
 The $9.4 million, L-shaped expanse of glass and soaring timber beams had a huge fireplace at its center, and a parking deck attached by an overhead walkway. The market took in $6 million in sales in its first year, and sustained that sales level throughout most of its short life. 
 The market was also a centerpiece of the Libra Foundation's novel strategy of using its considerable assets -- $220 million -- to buy and renovate downtown office buildings to jump-start Portland's reeling economy. Along with the Portland Public Market, the foundation -- started here in 1989 by Elizabeth Noyce, the former wife of Robert N. Noyce, a founder of Intel -- opened a downtown bank, bought and renovated seven office buildings and bought three large parking decks. 
 When the foundation started its acquisition program in the early 1990s, office vacancy rates hovered at more than 60 percent and Portland's economy and reputation were stagnant. 
 Portland, a city of 64,000, is now a place where housing values are stable, personal incomes are rising and historic neighborhoods overlooking Casco Bay and the Atlantic are so popular among young people, urban professionals and retirees from Boston and New York that the office and housing vacancy rates are under 3 percent. 
 Four years ago, according to Owen Wells, the foundation's president, Libra changed course to take advantage of the economic conditions it had helped to foster. ''We wanted to capitalize on strong real estate markets in Portland,'' he said. 
 In 2002 and 2003, Libra sold three buildings and a parking deck for $31 million. Three years later the foundation completed the sale of its other downtown real estate -- four office buildings, two parking decks and the Portland Public Market -- to Guggenheim Real Estate for more than $55 million, $20 million more than the original investment. 
 Three months after its formal closing, the old market's windows are streaked and grimy. Two blocks away, though, on a bright winter afternoon, the new Public Market House swarms with customers. 
 ''I believe in the spirit of a public market being a community,'' said Ms. Horton, while attending to early afternoon customers. ''We found out that a lot of other people in Portland feel the same way.''

HEADLINE: Profits Soar at Alcoa On Strong Demand And Higher Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The aluminum company Alcoa reported its most profitable first quarter ever yesterday as rising metal demand from China and the aerospace industry bolstered prices.
 Net income rose 8.9 percent, to $662 million, or 75 cents a share, from $608 million, or 69 cents, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 11 percent, to $7.91 billion. 
 The company, which has its headquarters in New York, is the first on the Dow Jones industrial average to report earnings this quarter.
 Aluminum prices rose 15 percent in the quarter and have more than doubled in the last five years. Citigroup says global demand may exceed supply this year. 
 ''The market environment is fundamentally very good,'' Charles A. Bradford, an analyst at Soleil Securities in New York, said before the earnings were released. ''Aerospace executives are pleading with the aluminum companies to boost output, and world economies, especially China, are doing well.''
 Excluding revamping costs and a loss of 2 cents a share from discontinued businesses, profit was 79 cents a share. That beat the 78-cent estimate of analysts.
 The company sold metal at $2,902 a metric ton, on average, in the quarter, compared with $2,534 a ton a year earlier. Metal production rose to 899,000 tons, from 867,000 tons, while shipments rose to 518,000 tons, from 488,000 tons. Total aluminum product shipments rose 1 percent, to 1.37 million tons.
 Shares of Alcoa were the best performers on the Dow during the quarter, rising 13 percent. Part of the rally reflected speculation that the company would be a takeover target. 
 Alcoa, which rose 3 cents, to $34.90, in regular trading, gained as much as 85 cents in after-hours trading. The earnings were released after the market closed.

HEADLINE: Euro Rises on Signs of Faster European Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The euro advanced to a record against the yen and a two-year high against the dollar yesterday as signs of faster economic growth in Europe prompted traders to increase their bets on higher interest rates. 
 Anticipation increased that the European Central Bank would lift borrowing costs, now at 3.75 percent, after economic reports yesterday showed that German exports rose for the first time in four months and that French industrial production was stronger than forecast.
The euro rose 0.59 percent, to $1.3433, against the dollar in New York, after touching $1.3455, the highest since March 2005. Against the yen, the euro gained 0.40 percent, to 159.99 yen, touching a record of 160.10, after the Bank of Japan left its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, the lowest among major economies. The European currency began trading in January 1999.
 The median forecast of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News is that the European bank will raise borrowing costs a quarter of a percentage point, to 4 percent, by November. All 37 economists surveyed expect the central bank's policy makers to hold rates steady at their meeting tomorrow.
 The dollar fell against the euro and yen after the United States government said it would file complaints against China with the World Trade Organization, raising concern that a dispute between them will escalate and slow growth in both economies. China had a $6.87 billion trade surplus with the United States in March.
 The dollar declined 0.22 percent against the yen, to 119.06 yen.
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the European bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, are scheduled to meet with other finance officials and central bankers from the Group of 7 nations to discuss global economic and trade affairs in Washington tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Today in the N.H.L., Nothing Rolls Off the Ducks' Backs

BYLINE: By LEE JENKINS

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., April 9 

 BODY:
The Anaheim Ducks used to have an animated Tinkerbell that fluttered across the scoreboard and sprinkled pixie dust onto pictures of players' heads.
 Tinkerbell cannot possibly recognize her team anymore. The Ducks have essentially traded pixie dust on the head for punches to the face.
''We fight,'' Anaheim General Manager Brian Burke said. ''It's what we do. We put a premium on it.'' 
 Burke may not sound politically correct, but he is refreshingly honest. While the National Hockey League has restricted contact and condemned violence, the Ducks have proved that fighting still works -- both as a promotional tool and a strategic technique.
 The Ducks won the Pacific Division this season for the first time, and as they prepare to open the Stanley Cup playoffs Wednesday night against Minnesota, they are giving most of the credit to their knuckles.
 They do not apologize for their 1,457 penalty minutes, which led the N.H.L. Nor do they apologize for their 71 fighting majors, 24 more than any other team. As usual, they defend themselves with both fists raised.
 ''The night before you play our team, it's a little nerve-racking,'' Anaheim forward Brad May said. ''You sleep with the lights on.''
 It is still hard to be intimidated by a franchise called the Ducks, especially since they were named after a fuzzy Disney movie. But look around the Honda Center -- formerly known as the Pond -- and you may find a few scattered teeth.
 The Ducks were founded in 1993, not as a fight club, but as a marketing arm for the Walt Disney Company and a source of family entertainment in Orange County. If they happened to win a few hockey games along the way, it was almost a bonus.
 Then Disney sold the team two years ago to Henry and Susan Samueli, an Orange County couple. With input from fans, the Ducks junked their purple-and-teal uniforms for black and gold. They traded their duck-billed logo for a bold script. 
 After spending a decade as the butt of jokes, the Ducks started to retaliate. Hockey in Orange County became as serious as a stiff-arm.
 ''Other players come in now and look at our lineup and you know what they're thinking,'' forward Shawn Thornton said. ''Let's keep it quiet and get out of here.''
 The team is no longer named the Mighty Ducks, perhaps because they do not need to convince anyone of their might. Anaheim demonstrates its muscle the old-fashioned way.
 By dropping their gloves at the drop of a helmet, enforcers explain that they are protecting star players, allowing them to skate without fear. The Ducks' top scorers, Teemu Selanne and Andy McDonald, responded this season with a combined 75 goals.
 The last time Anaheim made the Stanley Cup finals, in 2003, McDonald had to sit out because of post-concussion syndrome and the Ducks lost to the Devils. When the Chicago Blackhawks hammered McDonald during a game this season, three Anaheim players took turns rushing to his defense. 
 ''This way, you don't get abused on the ice,'' McDonald said. ''You know that you've got 22 guys waiting to stand up for you. It's a good set-up for someone like me.''
 McDonald is sometimes overshadowed by his bodyguards. Anaheim forward George Parros racked up 18 fighting majors this season, the most in the N.H.L., and he grew a bushy black mustache, the envy of enforcers everywhere.
 The 'stache, as Parros calls it, has become so fashionable in Orange County that fans tape black whiskers to their upper lips before games. Parros, who graduated from Princeton with a major in economics, can only imagine the marketing possibilities.
 ''People are always calling me a meathead, a dummy, telling me I'm too stupid to be a real player,'' Parros said. ''I guess they don't know where I went to college.''
 Parros seems as unlikely a fighter as Burke does a fighting advocate. Burke, a graduate of Harvard Law School, used to be the N.H.L.'s dean of discipline. But he was also general manager of Vancouver when Todd Bertuzzi played for the Canucks and punched Colorado's Steven Moore from behind and slammed him to the ice in 2004.
 Moore fractured three vertebrae in his neck, but Burke stood by his player. Since then, many executives have tried to distance themselves from fighting. Burke has cast himself as the voice of the pugilist. He stands out only in his candor.
 ''The people who are in the game -- the players, coaches, fans -- they all want fighting,'' Burke said. ''The debate is always started by outsiders. I'm sick of it.''
 Burke has done his best to keep tough guys employed. While many teams in the salary-cap era play without a heavyweight, opting for skill over strength, the Ducks have four legitimate enforcers on their roster.
 Those four bruisers -- May, Parros, Thornton and Travis Moen -- are not exactly Philadelphia's Broad Street Bullies of the 1970s. But in the modern N.H.L., where fighting has been on the decline, they are about as rugged as it gets.
 ''Every rose has thorns,'' May said. ''We're the thorns.''
 Sitting in their dressing room, the Ducks are as likely to be talking about right hooks as wrist shots. They monitor the Web site hockeyfights.com, which features penalty statistics that the N.H.L. does not always publish. Parros and Thornton take boxing lessons in the summer to hone their craft.
 ''If I didn't learn how to do this, I probably would have been sent home a long time ago,'' Thornton said. ''Even now, if I were on another team, I don't know that I'd be in the N.H.L.''
 The Ducks insist that they are not trying to reverse the trend against fighting. They are only trying to win their first Stanley Cup, regardless of the collateral damage.
 In the playoffs, fights are rare. Teams are careful not to commit penalties and give up unnecessary power plays. One of Anaheim's greatest strengths could be neutralized.
 Then again, the Ducks went all the way to the Western Conference finals last season, and they did not exactly leave peacefully.
 ''We fought in the first round, the second round and the third round,'' Burke said. ''And if we got to the finals, we would have fought there, too.''

HEADLINE: A Word of Advice During a Housing Slump: Rent

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A promotional spot for the National Association of Realtors came on the radio the other day. The spot, introduced as something called ''Newsmakers,'' was supposed to sound like a news report, with the association's president offering real estate advice.
 ''This is the best time to buy,'' Pat Vredevoogd Combs, the president, said cheerfully. ''There's a lot of inventory in the marketplace. Interest rates are low. It's a wonderful tax deduction.''
 By the Realtors' way of thinking, it's always a good time to buy. Homeownership, they argue, is a way to achieve the American dream, save on taxes and earn a solid investment return all at the same time. 
 That's how it has worked out for much of the last 15 years. But in a stark reversal, it's now clear that people who chose renting over buying in the last two years made the right move. In much of the country, including large parts of the Northeast, California, Florida and the Southwest, recent home buyers have faced higher monthly costs than renters and have lost money on their investment in the meantime. It's almost as if they have thrown money away, an insult once reserved for renters. 
 Most striking, perhaps, is the fact that prices may not yet have fallen far enough for buying to look better than renting today, except for people who plan to stay in a home for many years. 
 With the spring moving season under way, The New York Times has done an analysis of buying vs. renting in every major metropolitan area. The analysis includes data on housing costs and looks at different possibilities for the path of home prices in coming years.
 It found that even though rents have recently jumped, the costs that come with buying a home -- mortgage payments, property taxes, fees to real estate agents -- remain a lot higher than the costs of renting. So buyers in many places are basically betting that home prices will rise smartly in the near future.
 Over the next five years, which is about the average amount of time recent buyers have remained in their homes, prices in the Los Angeles area would have to rise more than 5 percent a year for a typical buyer there to do better than a renter. The same is true in Phoenix, Las Vegas, the New York region, Northern California and South Florida. In the Boston and Washington areas, the break-even point is about 4 percent.
 ''House prices have to fall more before housing becomes a clear buy again,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com, a research company that helped conduct the analysis. ''These markets aren't as overvalued as they were a year ago or two years ago, but they're still unfriendly. And that's one of the reasons the market is still soft -- people realize it's not a bargain.''
 There is obviously no way to know what home prices will do in the next few years. But there are two big reasons to doubt the real estate boosters who insist that it's once again a great time to buy. 
 The first is history. After the last big run-up in house prices, in the 1980s, a long slump followed. In the New York area, prices peaked in early 1989 and then fell 9 percent over the next three years, according to government data. (Adjusted for inflation, the drop was much bigger.) Not until 1998 did prices pass their earlier peak. 
 Keep in mind that the 2000-5 boom was even bigger than the '80s boom and that house prices on the coasts, according to the official numbers at least, have fallen only slightly so far. So it is hard to imagine that prices will rise 5 percent a year, or another 28 percent in all, over the next five years.
 The second reason for skepticism is that buying has never been quite as beneficial as Realtors -- and mortgage brokers, home builders and everybody else who makes money off home purchases -- have made it out to be. Buyers have to pay property taxes on top of their mortgage, while renters have the taxes included in their monthly rent bill. Buyers also face thousands of dollars in closing costs (and, in Manhattan, co-op charges). Renters, meanwhile, can invest what they would have spent on closing costs and a down payment in the stock market, which hasn't exactly delivered a bad return over the last 20 years. 
 And that famous mortgage-interest tax deduction? Yes, it reduces the borrowing costs that come with a mortgage, but it doesn't eliminate them. Renters don't face any such borrowing costs.
 Almost two years ago, I interviewed a thoughtful 37-year-old man named Tchaka Owen, who happens to be a real estate agent. (Whatever the sins of the Realtors' association, there are a lot of smart, helpful agents out there. Just remember that they have a financial interest in getting you to buy a house.) 
 Mr. Owen and his girlfriend, Polly Thompson, had recently moved from the Washington suburbs to the Miami area and decided to rent a two-bedroom apartment with spectacular bay views. ''You can get so much more for your money, renting instead of buying,'' he said at the time.
 Sure enough, house prices soon began to fall in South Florida, and Mr. Owen and Ms. Thompson started to think about buying a place. A three-bedroom Mediterranean-style house that they liked was originally listed for $620,000 last year, but the price was later cut to $543,000. They bought it in June for $516,000. Since then, the market has fallen further, but Mr. Owen said he didn't mind, because they plan to stay in the house at least a decade. ''We love it,'' he told me.
 Clearly, there are benefits to owning a house beyond the financial, like the comfort of knowing you can stay as long as you want or can fix the roof without permission. But real estate has been sold as more than a good way to spend money. It has been sold as a can't-miss investment. Back in 2005, near the peak of the market, the chief economist of the Realtors' association, David Lereah, published a book called ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' The can't-miss argument was wrong then, and it may still be wrong today.
 After hearing that radio spot, I called Ms. Combs and asked her whether she thought there was any chance that she and her fellow Realtors had gone a bit too far in promoting the boom. ''I absolutely disagree,'' she said, still cheerful. ''We help people look at the marketplace.''
 So I asked what advice she gave her own clients in Grand Rapids, Mich., where she is an agent. ''We often tell people that they need to stay in a house five to six years for it to make sense,'' she said.
 That's a nuance that didn't make it into her ''Newsmakers'' interview. In Grand Rapids, where the median home costs $130,000, it is probably good advice. In a lot of other places, it may still be too optimistic.

HEADLINE: On the Trail of Wholesome Pet Dinners

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 10 

 BODY:
The health-conscious customers at the store in the trendy South End neighborhood want wholesome food: vegetable and fruit chews; high-protein, low-carb nuggets; and organic meals containing cottage cheese.
 The nutritious fare, however, is not for them; it is for their dogs and cats.
The store, Pet Shop Girls, specializes in organic, holistic and raw pet food, and its sales have gone up sharply since a major recall of pet food was announced March 16. 
 The Food and Drug Administration found melamine, a slow-release fertilizer also used to make plastics, in wheat gluten that may have gotten into the recalled food. The F.D.A. said there were 16 confirmed pet deaths from contaminated food, including nine from a routine company taste test, but officials said the number was likely to be much higher.
 Banfield Pet Hospital, which operates 615 hospitals nationwide, said it had confirmed that six more pets had died from contaminated food. The hospital said it had treated about 1,600 pets believed to have eaten recalled food in the past three weeks.
 ''Because of the recall, people are asking more questions, wondering what is in this bag of food,'' said Jen Buhler, manager of The Pet Shop Girls, which sells homemade ''muttzoh balls'' -- mashed dry dog food boiled in chicken broth -- and bacon bon-bons made with bacon, wheat flour and cheddar cheese.
 On Tuesday, Menu Foods, which made most of the recalled food, expanded its recall for the second time in less than a week, adding 34 varieties of cat food. 
 The company said the food was manufactured at a Canadian plant in December 2006 and January 2007 with a batch of wheat gluten potentially contaminated with melamine. The gluten was shipped to the Ontario facility from its Emporia, Kan., plant. The previously recalled food was manufactured there, and at a plant in Pennsauken, N.J., the company said.
 Lists of recalled foods are available online at www.menufoods.com/recall. 
 Stores and Web sites that sell pet food made from free-range meat, organic vegetables and brown rice say business has increased markedly since the recall, which affected both low- and high-end brands. 
 Shelley Gunton, a co-owner of Castor and Pollux Pet Works, a natural and organic pet supplies company in Clackamas, Ore., said Web traffic had increased tenfold since mid-March and sales were up nearly 50 percent.
 ''Somebody feeding brand X at the moment will call and say they want to switch to a more organic product, but they want to understand the difference, what it means to be a certified organic pet food,'' Ms. Gunton said. ''We want to make sure people feel comfortable purchasing organics and won't go to bed worrying about their pets.''
 For pet food to be labeled organic, at least 95 percent of the ingredients must be certified organic for human consumption, said Andrea Caroe, chairwoman of the National Organic Standards Board, which is part of the Food and Drug Administration.
 According to a survey by the Organic Trade Association, organic pet food sales totaled $30 million in 2005, a 46 percent increase from the previous year. Sales were expected to grow by about 36 percent in 2006, and at least 25 percent each year until 2010, the group said.
 Andi Brown, founder of Halo Pet Foods, which says it takes a holistic approach to pet care, selling food made from human-grade ingredients as well as herbal grooming aids and supplements, said sales of certain food products had increased by more than 90 percent since mid-March. Internet orders have doubled, Ms. Brown said.
 ''It's very sad that it had to come to this,'' Ms. Brown said. ''People are fearful, scared out of their wits.''
 Bree Weasner, who runs preciouspets.org, which sells natural pet products, said food sales had more than doubled.
 ''I've always worked seven days a week, but since the recalls I've never worked so many hours,'' Ms. Weasner said. 
 John Gigliotti, owner of waggintails.com, which sells natural dog, cat and bird food, said business was up 30 percent to 40 percent, spurred mostly by word of mouth. Many customers he talks to are disturbed that officials still do not know whether the melamine made pets sick, he said, and Mr. Gigliotti said he thought the recall would lead to a long-term rise in organic pet food sales.
 ''When the dust settles and we know what happened, it will simply reinforce what we've been talking about for years, which is economy-minded manufacturers use economy ingredients,'' Mr. Gigliotti said. ''Now people want to know all the behind-the-scenes stuff.''
 Scott Andrews, 45, a tax accountant from Boston, said he did not know what to feed his beagle, Sam. Mr. Andrews said for the time being he planned to give Sam food that was organic or made in New England by small manufacturers.
 ''Every time I open a can, I think of the recall,'' Mr. Andrews said in Pet Shop Girls as Sam sniffed around. ''I just don't know what to trust, I guess.''

HEADLINE: 'First Suburb' Gets a Taste Of Disorder

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
In the annals of the American suburbs, you could devote a whole chapter to New Rochelle. It's where Norman Rockwell lived and worked for decades, where Rob Petrie stumbled over that ottoman at the start of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' a place that so defined what the Brookings Institution, in a report last year, called ''America's First Suburbs'' that it made it onto the study's first page.
 Chances are the chaotic scene that broke out here Sunday night, when 200 police officers in riot gear were called from across Westchester County to deal with more than 1,000 unruly teenagers ejected from a local entertainment complex, won't rate as much more than a footnote to the tale. But as the first suburbs, the inner-ring suburbs that are home to a fifth of the nation's population, consider their second acts, what's happening in New Rochelle now could be every bit as meaningful as what went on before. 
Can you have suburban life and a 40-story Trump Plaza high-rise poking its way incongruously toward the heavens above Westchester, like Yao Ming at a birthday party for toddlers? Exactly how much urban street life do Rob and Laura want? It's the story of life, not just here, but in White Plains and Yonkers and Stamford, all places at the forefront of redefining what suburbs are supposed to be.
 Whatever that redefinition turns out to be, it's a safe bet the idea was not what happened Sunday night at New Roc City, a fortresslike entertainment center with high-tech bowling, glow-in-the dark miniature golf, an 18-screen multiplex and other diversions. What set things off is still a little murky -- one theory is that the center is especially crowded on Easter -- but it is clear that hundreds of teenagers from New York took the train north to New Rochelle and showed up in such numbers that they couldn't all fit in. Fits of ill temper ensued, then fights, gunshots and confrontations with officers on the streets outside. A 15-year-old Bronx youth was stabbed in the chest, two robberies were reported and six people were arrested. 
 This would be a bad night anyplace but was particularly so in New Rochelle, which is in the middle of a construction boom that will add 2,000 new housing units in and near downtown -- most of them decidedly upscale. Bird's-eye views of street melees are not prime selling points.
 That said, New Roc has been around since 1999 with no major incidents, so it's hard to see one incident doing much damage. Instead, it's more likely to be a speed bump on a voyage that's still taking shape. So Mayor Noam Bramson, 37, sounds like a guy selling not just a new downtown but a new way of thinking about suburban life. 
 New Rochelle boomed with the first generation of suburbs (think ''Ragtime,'' written by E.L. Doctorow, who lived there), peaked around World War II, began a decline in the 1950s that hit bottom in the 1990s, and now is in the middle of what Mr. Bramson called ''the most dramatic physical and economic transformation in our modern history.''
 THAT means two things. First is a huge bet on upscale residential housing in a downtown that's still pretty shabby. Second is a view that suburban need not mean low density, that New Rochelle can maintain its neighborhoods of lovely Tudors on rolling lawns but might have to lose the Rob Petrie-era sense that suburban life and urban life are worlds apart.
 ''I think what we're seeing is a changed perception of how our urban planning has to unfold and also a willingness, I think, to dispense with the illusion that places like New Rochelle are villages,'' Mayor Bramson said. ''Instead, we need to embrace and accept in the heart of our downtown urban density and scale.''
 This, in fact, is pretty much the remedy being embraced by other suburban cities, some far down the path (Stamford), some barely out of the gate (Yonkers). It beats accepting decline, but there's no guarantee it works. LeRoy W. Mitchell, an accounting professor at Iona College in New Rochelle, said that thus far there had been no indication that development was doing anything to lower taxes or that the tax incentives used to lure development were providing much in the way of economic benefit to current residents. Instead, he said, the growth is jamming downtown streets not prepared to handle it.
 The consensus is that New Rochelle is probably getting it right by trying to define a new urban-suburban hybrid and that impossibly high Manhattan prices and an aging population of folks ready to ditch the empty nest for a suburban Trump aerie make the time right. But it will take a while, and maybe a few more bad nights, to figure out how much life there is in this new niche that's not the city and not the burbs of myth and fable but something in between.

HEADLINE: English as Language Of Global Education

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

DATELINE: PARIS, April 7 

 BODY:
When economics students returned this winter to the elite Ecole Normale Superieure here, copies of a simple one-page petition were posted in the corridors demanding an unlikely privilege: French as a teaching language. 
 ''We understand that economics is a discipline, like most scientific fields, where the research is published in English,'' the petition read, in apologetic tones. But it declared that it was unacceptable for a native French professor to teach standard courses to French-speaking students in the adopted tongue of English.
In the shifting universe of global academia, English is becoming as commonplace as creeping ivy and mortarboards. In the last five years, the world's top business schools and universities have been pushing to make English the teaching tongue in a calculated strategy to raise revenues by attracting more international students and as a way to respond to globalization. 
 Business universities are driving the trend, partly because changes in international accreditation standards in the late 1990s required them to include English-language components. But English is also spreading to the undergraduate level, with some South Korean universities offering up to 30 percent of their courses in the language. The former president of Korea University in Seoul sought to raise that share to 60 percent, but ultimately was not re-elected to his post in December. 
 In Madrid, business students can take their admissions test in English for the elite Instituto de Empresa and enroll in core courses for a master's degree in business administration in the same language. The Lille School of Management in France stopped considering English a foreign language in 1999, and now half the postgraduate programs are taught in English to accommodate a rising number of international students.
 Over the last three years, the number of masters programs offered in English at universities with another host language has more than doubled, to 3,300 programs at 1,700 universities, according to David A. Wilson, chief executive of the Graduate Management Admission Council, an international organization of leading business schools that is based in McLean, Va. 
 ''We are shifting to English. Why?'' said Laurent Bibard, the dean of M.B.A. programs at Essec, a top French business school in a suburb of Paris that is a fertile breeding ground for chief executives. 
 ''It's the language for international teaching,'' he said. ''English allows students to be able to come from anyplace in the world and for our students -- the French ones -- to go everywhere.'' 
 This year the university is fluidly celebrating its 100th anniversary in its adopted tongue. Its new publicity film debuted in English and French. Along one of the main roads leading into Paris loomed a giant blue billboard boasting of the anniversary in French and, in smaller letters, in English. 
 Essec has also taken advantage of the increased revenue that foreign students -- English-speaking ones -- can bring in. Its population of foreign students has leapt by 38 percent in four years, to 909 today out of a student body of 3,700. 
 The tuition for a two-year master's degree in business administration is 19,800 euros for European Union citizens, and 34,000 euros for non-EU citizens. 
 ''The French market for local students is not unlimited,'' said Christophe N. Bredillet, the associate dean for the Lille School of Management's M.B.A. and postgraduate programs. ''Revenue is very important, and in order to provide good services, we need to cover our expenses for the library and research journals. We need to cover all these things with a bigger number of students so it's quite important to attract international students.''
 With the jump in foreign students, Essec now offers 25 percent of its 200 courses in English. Its ambition is to accelerate the English offerings to 50 percent in the next three years. 
 Santiago Iniguez de Ozono, dean of the Instituto de Empresa, argues that the trend is a natural consequence of globalization, with English functioning as Latin did in the 13th century as the lingua franca most used by universities. 
 ''English is being adapted as a working language, but it's not Oxford English,'' he said. ''It's a language that most stakeholders speak.'' He carries out conversation on a blog, deanstalk.net, in English. 
 But getting students to feel comfortable speaking English in the classroom is easier said than done. When younger French students at Essec start a required course in organizational analysis, the atmosphere is marked by long, uncomfortable silences, said Alan Jenkins, a management professor and academic director of the executive M.B.A. program. 
 ''They are very good on written tasks, but there's a lot of reticence on oral communication and talking with the teacher,'' Dr. Jenkins said, adding that he used role-playing to encourage students to speak. He also refuses to speak in French. ''I have to force myself to say, 'Can you give me that in English?' ''
 Officials at Ewha Womans University in Seoul are also aware that they face a difficult task at the first stage of their Global 2010 project, which will require new students to take four classes in English, two under the tutelage of native English-speaking professors. The 120-year-old university has embarked on a hiring spree to attract 50 foreign professors. 
 At the beginning, ''teaching courses in English may have less efficiency or effectiveness in terms of knowledge transfer than those courses taught in Korean,'' said Anna Suh, program manager for the university's office of global affairs, who said that students eventually see the benefits. ''Our aim for this kind of program is to prepare and equip our students to be global leaders in this new era of internationalization.''
 The Lille management school is planning to open a satellite business school program next fall in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where the working language will also be in English. 
 ''Internationally, the competition is everywhere,'' Dr. Bredillet said. ''For a masters in management, I'm competing with George Washington University. I'm competing with some programs in Germany, Norway and the U.K. That's why we're delivering the curriculum in English.''

HEADLINE: A New Fractional: Owning a Piece of a Yacht

BYLINE: By SHELLEY EMLING

 BODY:
An eighth of a yacht is better than none. Or so reasons Han Verstraete, chief executive of YachtPlus.
 A London-based operation that is building a fleet of 10 yachts, YachtPlus is the latest company to jump into fractionals, a shared-ownership structure that allows people to buy only part of a costly item. ''Wealthy people today do not invest in only assets but in experiences,'' Mr. Verstraete said. ''My typical customer will have three real estate assets and perhaps also do some sharing of jets. The yacht experience is the experience these people are seeking next.''
 James Lawson, senior research director at Ledbury Research, a consulting firm in London, agreed with this assessment. ''Many wealthy people are looking for driving lessons organized by Ferrari, cooking lessons by celebrity chefs, and exclusive travel and holiday experiences,'' he said. ''Experience is becoming more important than ownership.'' 
 Fractional ownership is cousin to the timeshare, a sales arrangement born in the 1960s that usually involves the right to stay in an accommodation for a specific period of time but, because of abuses by some developers, can sometimes conjure up images of high-pressure salesmen who gloss over the fine print. 
 Today there are many ways to have a fractional lifestyle. One such service, bagborroworsteal.com, sells the use of a revolving array of designer handbags and jewelry that can cost thousands to own but $20 to $175 a month to use. Buyavineyard.co.uk sells partial titles to some French vineyards; and several luxury hotel companies, including Ritz-Carlton and the Four Seasons, offer fractional ownership of some properties they own or manage around the world. 
 As for Mr. Verstraete, he hopes YachtPlus, at yachtplus.co.uk, will do for boats what NetJets did for private jets. Founded in 1986, NetJets is the world leader in fractional jet ownership, with a fleet of more than 650 jets worldwide and thousands of shareholders.
 Mr. Verstraete said eight shares would be sold for $2 million each in each of the company's 40-meter, or 132 foot, yachts, covering five weeks of use per year. Charters to others will be offered during any unused weeks, with the owners receiving the revenue. 
 So far, YachtPlus has sold the 32 fractions for the first four boats, he said. Mr. Verstraete said that, generally, the buyers were what he calls the ''emancipated wealthy'' -- hedge fund managers and private equity fund managers who can take more time away from the office. He said most were Europeans, with a sprinkling of Americans. 
 Two of the boats, which are being built in the Cantieri Navali Rodriquez shipyard in La Spezia, Italy, are expected to be ready next summer, with another one finished every four months after that. 
 Mr. Verstraete said the fleet of 10 yachts would be parked in the Caribbean in the winter and the Mediterranean in the summer. All crew members will be YachtPlus employees, which means, Mr. Verstraete said, that owners and their guests will be ensured excellent service. 
 ''My vision is to make this the contemporary yachting brand,'' he said. ''The similarity is with a fashion label that everyone wants.'' The boats are being designed by Norman Foster, the renowned architect whose firm, Foster + Partners of London, is responsible for such projects as the new Beijing airport and 30 Saint Mary Axe, the iconic London building commonly called the Gherkin. 
 With the capacity to sleep 18, the yachts will have floor-to-ceiling windows on the main and upper decks, as well as in the owner's suite, and a glass spiral staircase linking all four decks. ''The philosophy is that this won't be just another white boat,'' Mr. Verstraete said. 
 The founders and initial shareholders in YachtPlus, which was organized in 2005, include Ruggero Magnoni, vice chairman of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers, and Fabio Cane, head of the private equity operations of ?? Banca Intesa in Italy. Mr. Verstraete himself was previously associated with Marquis Jet, a NetJet competitor. 
 Another company, Yacht Share, operates out of Miami with an arrangement that is more like a traditional timeshare. As explained on theyachtshare.com, a $40,000 membership fee, in addition to monthly payments, provides 28 days a year on a captained luxury yacht that sleeps six -- but does not provide an equity stake in the boat, as the fractional ownership does. Participants do, however, receive privileges at the Sunset Harbour Yacht Club in the South Beach area of Miami as well as at the Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, Fla. 
 ''Typically a yacht is used only three to four weeks of the year by its owner,'' said Robert Kyle, chief executive of Yacht Share. ''It sits the rest of the time in a marina, becoming part of the local skyline.''
 While fractional ownership can be a rewarding experience, experts warn that consumers must first do their homework.
 ''Are there deep pockets behind it? Do they have experience?'' said Milton Pedraza, chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a research firm in New York. ''You need to make sure there are operators who really understand the economics of what they are doing and who really know how to deliver on the services they promise.'' 
 Mr. Pedraza said he expected fractional ownership to spread. ''We're seeing it in recreational vehicles,'' he said. ''Soon you'll also see it in helicopters. Just about every luxury asset you can think of can and will be fractionalized.''

HEADLINE: China Says It Regrets U.S. Action

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Wednesday, April 11 

 BODY:
The Chinese government expressed ''deep regret and strong dissatisfaction'' on Tuesday with the Bush administration's decision to file two complaints against China with the World Trade Organization.
 Separately, it released statistics showing that Chinese exports grew last month at the slowest pace in five years, but that hardly tempered the entire first-quarter surplus, which doubled from the previous year.
The American decision to complain to the W.T.O. ''will seriously undermine the cooperative relations the two nations have established in the field and will adversely affect bilateral trade,'' Wang Xinpei, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, said in a statement on the ministry's Web site. 
 Mr. Wang's emphasis on bilateral trade could suggest that the dispute with the United States would remain limited to trade issues, and would not necessarily spill over into areas like pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
 But David Zweig, a China specialist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said that Chinese officials appeared to be worried that President Bush was losing his ability to block protectionist moves in Congress, and they were prepared to retaliate, at least on trade issues, if the United States continued to step up pressure on China. 
 The Chinese reaction to the trade complaints was slightly stronger than China's statement on March 31 regarding American duties on imported paper. That statement expressed ''strong dissatisfaction,'' but did not mention ''deep regret.''
 The Bush administration announced on March 30 that it would impose duties on imports of coated paper from China to counteract what it said were government subsidies to the Chinese paper industry.
 An editorial in the official China Daily newspaper on Wednesday took the toughest Chinese position yet, warning that, ''In fact, actions against China could trigger an outbreak of massive protectionism that could seriously undermine global economic growth.''
 The editorial described the United States as engaging ''in a series of protectionist actions,'' and added that, ''While such protectionist moves may appeal to some U.S. industries or interest groups for a while, they do nothing to promote the restructuring the U.S. economy needs to reduce its budget and trade deficits.'' 
 China's customs agency released statistics Tuesday showing that Chinese exports to the rest of the world grew last month at the slowest pace in five years, rising just 6.9 percent from a year earlier. Correspondingly, the country's trade surplus narrowed to $6.9 billion in March, from $23.8 billion in February.
 But the surplus for the entire first quarter doubled from a year earlier, to $46.4 billion. And economists predicted that the surplus would continue to rise and dismissed the importance of the slowdown in March.
 ''So, in our view, this number will do nothing, zilch, nada, to address political concerns in the U.S. about China's overall trade surplus,'' Stephen Green, an economist in the Shanghai offices of Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in a research note.
 The deceleration followed a slowdown of exports from the major Southeast Asian economies: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. That has prompted some in Asia to worry whether industrialized countries were losing some of their appetite for Asian goods.
 But economists said that last month's slowing of exports from China was probably temporary, a result of short-term events.
 Many exporters made extra shipments in February before a threatened phase-out of certain tax rebates in China. Exporters had expected the phase-out to be broadened at the start of March to cover more products, but this has not yet happened.
 The Chinese New Year also fell unusually late in February, so many factories that closed then may have had fewer goods ready for shipment in March, said Liang Hong, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of Goldman Sachs. The Chinese New Year started nearly three weeks earlier last year, so exports were stronger in March 2006. 
 The slowing of exports was not a result of any sudden move in the value of China's currency. The currency, the yuan, was virtually unchanged against the dollar in March, after rising steadily through January and February. 
 The statistics released on Tuesday were a ''flash'' estimate of overall exports, imports and the trade balance that the government provides on a schedule set months in advance. It did not include figures for trade with individual countries.
 Ma Jun, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Deutsche Bank, said that the bank's monthly survey of Chinese purchasing managers had found that their incoming orders for future exports had increased faster in March than in any month since the survey began in early 2005.
 Facing criticism from Congress that more should be done to address the widening United States trade deficit with China, the Bush administration announced Monday that it would file complaints with the W.T.O. The complaints, which were lodged at the organization's headquarters in Geneva on Tuesday, accuse China of tolerating widespread violations of trademarks and copyrights and of unfairly limiting the importation of books, journals, movies, videos and music to state-owned companies.
 The Commerce Ministry in China posted its response on its Web site at midday Tuesday, an unusually quick move by the Chinese government's standards.
 Mr. Wang denied the American allegations, saying that ''the Chinese government has always been firm in protecting intellectual property.'' He added that until now, China and the United States had been ''in good communication and consultation with each other over access to the Chinese publication market.''
 The statement and the one on March 31 regarding coated-paper duties were both notable for citing Mr. Wang by name, instead of a more senior official. Chinese government ministries cite spokesmen and spokeswomen in most pronouncements, but sometimes cite more senior officials on issues considered to be of grave importance.
 China is far more dependent on exports for economic growth than any other large country, and it has shown reluctance to be drawn into a broad dispute with the United States.
 The Chinese government faces domestic pressures to not be seen as caving in to American pressure.
 A steep rise in China's currency would make Chinese exports less competitive in foreign markets and would make imports more competitive in China, so the Bush administration and many members of Congress have made this a top priority. Complaints to the world body and duties on narrow categories of American imports like coated paper tend to have a limited effect on monthly trade figures.
 But senior Chinese officials are worried that a steep rise in the currency could result in job losses at factories and on farms as imports become more competitive, and that unemployed workers could become a threat to social stability.

HEADLINE: Romney Says He'll Expand Armed Forces By 100,000

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney made his most extensive remarks on military and foreign policy on Tuesday, saying that if elected president he would push to add at least 100,000 troops to the armed forces and significantly increase military spending. 
 Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who is vying for the Republican nomination for president next year, outlined his proposals in a speech at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum at Texas A&M University in College Station. Warning of the threat posed by radical Islam, he said the military needed to change to respond to it.
''Our objective is a strong America and a safe world,'' he said, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. 
 Mr. Romney restated his support for President Bush's troop buildup in Iraq, saying the alternative would bring chaos to the region and ''present grave risks to America.'' He made his remarks, in which he also criticized Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her visit to Syria, a day before a Republican rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, was to give a major address on Iraq.
 Mr. Romney devoted the bulk of his proposals to beyond the Iraq war. This year, Mr. Bush requested a military budget for 2008 of $481.4 billion, excluding money for military operations, an 11 percent increase over last year. If approved, it would elevate military spending to levels unseen since at least the 1980s, when adjusted for inflation.
 Mr. Romney said an additional $30 billion to $40 billion a year over the next few years was needed to ''modernize our military, address gaps in our troop levels, ease the strain on our National Guard and Reserves and support our wounded soldiers.''
 Under his calculations, he said, the United States should commit to spend at least 4 percent of its gross domestic product on the military, up from 3.9 percent. ''But increased spending must not mean increased waste,'' he said.
 Mr. Romney has sought to portray himself as a Washington outsider who would use his business experience, which has made him by far the wealthiest of the hopefuls, to transform government. He said he would organize business leaders and military experts to ''carry out a stem-to-stern analysis of military purchasing.''
 Mr. Romney also said he would overhaul the civilian bureaucracies that deal with foreign policies like banking, energy and commerce, to improve coordination in confronting needs overseas. 
 ''Just as the military has divided the world into common regions for all of its branches,'' he said, ''so too the civilian agencies should align along consistent boundaries.''
 The goal, he added, is to avoid what occurred in Iraq, when ''many of our nonmilitary resources moved like they were stuck in tar.''
 ''They fight over which agency will pay the $11 per diem cost of food at the same time that we are spending over $7 billion a month and taking human casualties,'' he said.
 He proposed appointing one official with authority over all those civilian agencies and departments, not unlike the military commander of the Central Command. He also called for multilateralism, saying one of his first acts as president would be a ''summit of nations'' that would include moderate Islamic states, as well as other leading developed countries. Such a meeting, Mr. Romney said, could result in a commitment to invest in countries confronting Islamic extremists. 
 ''American military action cannot change the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of Muslims,'' he said. ''Only Muslims will be able to defeat the violent radicals. But we can help them.''

HEADLINE: Buildings Called Key Source Of City's Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Laying the groundwork for a plan to reduce the production of greenhouse gases in the city, the Bloomberg administration released a study yesterday showing that New York's roughly 950,000 buildings are responsible for a vast majority of the city's carbon dioxide emissions.
 In sharp contrast to the national average of about 32 percent, the city's buildings are responsible for 79 percent of the greenhouse gases produced by the city and are being cut each year, according to the study, conducted by the city's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability. Transportation systems, including mass transit, cars and trucks, are responsible for most of the remaining 21 percent of the emissions, which are considered a major factor in global warming. 
The release of the inventory marked the first concrete step in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ambitious effort to set the city on a greener path as it plans for the addition of one million residents by 2030. In December, Mr. Bloomberg outlined goals to help guide the city's growth in a more environmentally sound way, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent.
 ''Even though New Yorkers already generate less than a third of the carbon emissions that the average American does, we can and we must do more,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in announcing the results of the study at a news conference in Lower Manhattan.
 Officials said that the inventory was a critical tool in understanding the sources of the city's emissions so that they could better devise strategies to reduce them. Still, they declined to provide details on how they would accomplish their goals, saying that the mayor would reveal his proposals on Earth Day, April 22.
 ''We know that we have to dramatically rethink the way we work with buildings,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor who is overseeing the 2030 plan. ''We know that on-road vehicles produce 18 percent of carbon emissions from this city. We have to deal with that problem if we are going to reach the 30 percent reduction.''
 Mr. Doctoroff said later that he had expected buildings to produce closer to 60 to 70 percent of the total, meaning that vehicles account for a smaller part of emissions in the study than officials originally estimated. Even so, many environmental advocates and business leaders say that it will be nearly impossible to ease traffic congestion, which has both environmental and economic consequences, without enacting some sort of pricing restrictions in the busiest parts of the city.
 Both Mr. Doctoroff and the mayor avoided any discussion of congestion pricing, dodging the subject when asked about it by reporters. There is support within the administration for such a plan, but it was unclear yesterday whether Mr. Bloomberg, who has in the past declared it a political no-fly zone, has been persuaded to back it.
 The report did offer some clues to approaches the city might pursue. According to the report, which broke out a separate analysis of government emissions, the city has already managed to reduce its emissions by roughly 446,000 metric tons a year. Its efforts have included using cleaner fuels, buying energy-efficient equipment, planting street trees and increasing the use of alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles.
 That, the report said, shows that these methods are effective and support ''similar actions across the private sector.''
 Based on 2005, when the city's total greenhouse gas emissions were 58.3 million metric tons, officials said that New York was responsible for 1 percent of the country's emissions, putting it on a par with countries like Portugal and Ireland. But the report noted that its levels were relatively low when measured per capita, coming in at 7.1 metric tons per person, well below San Francisco, at 11.2 metric tons, and the national average, at 24.5.
 The report said that this is because less energy is needed to heat, light, cool and fuel buildings in the city because they are more densely packed and homes are below average in size. In addition, the city's public transit system allows fewer New Yorkers to drive.
 Mr. Bloomberg also announced that the city would play host to a meeting about climate change in May, with mayors from more than 30 of the world's largest cities, including London; Paris; Tokyo; Moscow; Istanbul; and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The meeting is being organized by the Partnership for New York City, a business group, and the Clinton Climate Initiative, a project of the William J. Clinton Foundation.

HEADLINE: Gay by Design, Or a Lifestyle Choice?

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
RON GEREN, an actor in Los Angeles, commutes to auditions and jobs throughout Southern California in a sleek black Mazda MX-5 Miata convertible. But for a recent date with a woman, he rented a Cadillac Escalade because he was so used to friends saying his Miata is ''gay.'' 
 ''Guys say, 'Hey, that's cute,' '' Mr. Geren, 40, said, adding that the comments come from gay as well as straight men. ''You have to fend off that perception.''
 A few years ago, Meghan Daum, an op-ed contributor to The Los Angeles Times, wrote about a promising first date with a man that never led to a second one because, she later learned, the guy saw that she drove a Subaru Outback station wagon and concluded she must be a lesbian. 
 And when Joe LaMuraglia, the founder of Gaywheels.com, an informational site modeled on the likes of Autoweb.com, told his partner he wanted to buy a Mini Cooper convertible, the boyfriend joked that he would not be seen in it because the couple ''would look like such a gay cliche,'' Mr. LaMuraglia said. 
 Cars are no more straight or gay than cellphones, office chairs or weed whackers. But in recent years that truism has not stopped a perception among some motorists that certain cars can, in the right context, be statements about a driver's sexual orientation. 
 At a time when car makers are marketing aggressively to gay consumers and mainstream culture has become more literate about stereotypically gay tastes through television shows like ''Will & Grace'' and ''The L Word'' (on which one of the main characters, Alice, drove a Mini Cooper), it may not be surprising that some people make such assumptions about motorists based on their cars. 
 Indeed, the extravagant displays of muscle car machismo and sensuous, high-design femininity on display this week at the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center would seem to cry out for deconstruction along gender- and sexual-identity lines.
 But to some people, such stereotyping is homophobia, pure and simple. A poll seeking to determine the most gay automobiles, conducted by a South African Web site, was a topic of heated interest last December on Gizmodo, the New York-based technology blog, where one reader wrote: ''Since when are cars gay or straight? We're really polling people's prejudices here.''
 Others, though, including gay theorists, say many gay motorists happily embrace certain cars as reflections of identity. 
 ''People presume you want to throw off a stereotype,'' said Judith Halberstam, a lesbian who is a professor of gender studies at the University of Southern California. She drives a black Mazda 3 hatchback that she considers ''butch.'' But, she said, ''If you are a masculine woman, you might not feel bad about it, so you might become excited about knowing how to fix your pickup, or driving a '68 Mustang.'' 
 ''Not all gays want to present an image that is normative,'' she said. 
 Ramone Johnson is a gay journalist and former Saturn engineer who compiles an annual ''Top 10 Gay Cars'' list for About.com, which is owned by The New York Times Company. Mr. Johnson said that ''traditionally we are used to being defined by others.'' Driving a stylish car can be a way of ''taking control back'' and saying ''this is who I am,'' he said. 
 Mr. Johnson maintains that ''soft lines'' and a ''vibrant personality'' -- say like those on a Volkswagen New Beetle -- are typical attributes of a gay man's car, and fashion-forward red gauges and other styling cues, for example, make the Pontiac G6 more of a gay car than its sibling, the Grand Am, because the features express a taste for freedom and fun. 
 Neither automobile manufacturers nor dealers compile statistics on the sexual orientation of buyers. 
 Frank Markus, who is gay and the technical director for Motor Trend magazine, said auto companies tend to associate gay consumers with higher disposable incomes since fewer have children (one reason many are free to opt for less practical cars, like two-seaters or convertibles, as well). Tellingly, when the American Family Association, a conservative Christian group, pressured the Ford Motor Company to pull advertising from gay publications like The Advocate in 2005, the ads were for Land Rover and Jaguar, two high-end brands owned by Ford. 
 Subaru has been the most prominent company to embrace the gay market. As long ago as 2000, the automaker created advertising campaigns around Martina Navratilova, the gay tennis star, and also used a sales slogan that was a subtle gay-rights message: ''It's not a choice. It's the way we're built.'' Little wonder that many lesbians refer to their Outbacks as ''Lesbarus.'' 
 Even General Motors recently began to include questions about sexual orientation on some internal market surveys, although data are not yet compiled, said Adam Bernard, who tracks the product strategies of G.M.'s competitors and who also coordinates an advocacy group for gay employees at the company called GM Plus. Since 2003, he said, the group has consulted with marketing executives at the company about increasing sales to gay consumers.
 Lacking a precise portrait of its gay car buyers, the company still has taken increasing strides to break into this market, Mr. Bernard said, advertising its Cadillac, Saturn and Saab divisions in gay publications and Web sites like PlanetOut.com. 
 Company executives, he said, do not seem to feel skittish about losing market share among straight consumers if gay buyers suddenly seize on a particular model. ''I don't think internally we ever asked the question, 'If we put Cadillac in The Advocate, are we going to lose straight Cadillac buyers?' '' 
 ''Frankly,'' he added, ''the money's all the same color.''
 Mr. Markus of Motor Trend said cliches about gay drivers tend to collapse on close inspection, like the gay man who is a ''gym bunny'' and gravitates toward Jeeps and convertibles ''to show off his hot body.'' But, he added, ''If you could actually push a button and see what every gay person drives, it's probably not too different from what the average person drives, but it might skew higher in price.''
 On Gaywheels.com, one indicator of actual gay buying trends is the list of vehicles most frequently researched. As of last October, the Toyota Yaris, a $12,000 economy car, led that list, followed by the Toyota Camry, which was the No. 3-selling car in America last year. 
 It would be hard to find a more conventional automobile.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Agency Proposes Health Coverage That Most Can Afford

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 11 

 BODY:
Massachusetts is poised to become the first state to make it possible for 99 percent of its adults to be covered by health insurance, with an ambitious plan that sets limits for the premiums people would be expected to pay.
 State officials said that under the plan, they expected that all but about 65,000 of the 328,000 adults who are currently uninsured would be able to get affordable coverage. 
 The proposal sets a sliding scale of affordability standards in which, for example, a single person earning $40,001 a year would be expected to pay no more than 9 percent of income, or about $300 a month, for health insurance; a single person earning $25,000 a year would be expected to pay a much smaller percentage, about 3.3 percent of income, or $70 a month.
 The plan is expected to be approved by the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority on Thursday. 
 Jon Kingsdale, the executive director of the authority, the agency set up to administer the plan, said setting the affordability standards ''was always the most difficult and innovative element'' of the state's groundbreaking health care law, passed a year ago.
 The law required all residents to get health insurance or face a fine or tax penalty. But from the beginning, there was concern that available health plans might be too expensive for some people, or, that some affordable plans might provide skimpy coverage. Last month, the authority voted to require all plans to have substantial coverage, including prescription drug benefits, which raised further questions about how expensive the insurance would be.
 ''To do this right means we're walking a tight rope,'' Mr. Kingsdale said. ''We don't want to be too punitive, we don't want to put too high a standard of affordability, but we don't want to let too many people out of a universal requirement. We've been putting a lot of stakes in the ground, but this is the center pole that will allow us to put up the tent and get everybody covered.''
 The plan, if approved Thursday, would still need to be presented at public hearings across the state and face a final vote in June. The proposal would cost the state $13 million more than the $200 million it was planning to spend.
 This proposal changes premiums and subsidy rates that were established earlier. It would allow about 52,000 more low-income people to qualify for free or cheaper coverage. A person earning up to $15,315, one and half times the federal poverty level, would not have to pay anything under this proposal.
 Individuals earning $30,630 to $50,001 would not be eligible for state subsidies, but they would not be penalized if they could not find health insurance priced at $150 to $300 a month. People who earn more than $50,001 would not be given a cap on insurance costs.
 People who claim they cannot afford coverage under the new system could apply for a waiver.
 The proposal represents a carefully hammered-out compromise. Business groups wanted to make sure that premiums for state-sponsored insurance would not be too much less than the employee contributions to an employer's plan because they fear that people would flock to the government-sponsored plans, driving up the cost to the state. Advocates for poor people had wanted lower costs for more residents.
 ''It doesn't go the whole way, but it's good enough for today,'' said John McDonough, executive director of Health Care for All, an advocacy group. ''I know there's a lot of trash talk around the country about, 'Oh it's falling apart in Massachusetts.' It ain't true. We are going to be far and away the state with the lowest number of uninsured by a country mile.''
 Leslie A. Kirwan, the Massachusetts secretary of administration and finance, who is chairwoman of the authority's board, said the support of advocates like Mr. McDonough was earned in part by action by Gov. Deval L. Patrick, who agreed to waive fees that more than 10,000 poor families were paying for their children to be covered by Medicaid.
 ''There were real doubts about whether we could forge a compromise that the advocates could embrace and also make sure that the business community embraced it,'' Ms. Kirwan said.
 An employers' group gave the plan cautious support on Wednesday.
 ''It does seem that what the Connector is putting forth is reasonable, but I haven't looked at all the details,'' said Eileen P. McAnneny, vice president of government affairs for Associated Industries of Massachusetts, which represents 7,500 employers. ''You have to be very careful -- if you set up subsidies that are more generous than employer plans, that encourages employers to drop coverage. Health care costs are expensive for employers, too.''
 Jonathan Gruber, an authority board member and economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had argued against expanded subsidies, saying they were unnecessary and costly to the state. Still, he said Wednesday that he would vote for the plan.
 ''If they're going to throw money at an issue, they threw it in the right place,'' he said. ''That said, it is a lot of money, and going forward we're going to have to be careful not to address all the problems by putting more money into it.''
 For Andrea Pena, a single mother of three, the proposal would make possible better and more secure health care coverage. Ms. Pena, a 39-year-old dental assistant who lives in public housing in South Boston, has been receiving Medicaid, but the income from her two part-time jobs recently increased to above $20,000, threatening to disqualify her from state aid. Under the new plan, Ms. Pena would be eligible for free state-sponsored insurance that would provide better dental and vision coverage.
 ''Just imagine if something were to happen to me,'' Ms. Pena said. ''Thanks to this I don't have to worry about that any more.''

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Cuts U.S. Growth Forecast for Year to 2.2%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund yesterday cut its forecast for economic growth in the United States this year to 2.2 percent, the slowest expansion in five years, citing a weakening housing market. 
 The forecast for the American economy compares with a September estimate of 2.9 percent, the I.M.F. said in its twice-annual World Economic Outlook released yesterday. The United States economy grew 3.3 percent in 2006.
Home construction has slumped as builders try to trim a glut of unsold properties that has reached a 15-year high, the I.M.F. said. Home building will remain more of a drag than an anchor as a ''robust'' labor market and high corporate profits stimulate a rebound in growth next year to 2.8 percent, the fund said.
 ''A growth pause still seems more likely at this stage than a recession,'' the I.M.F. report said. ''The expansion is expected to gradually regain momentum, with quarterly growth rates rising during the course of 2007.''
 The fund left its forecast for global growth this year unchanged at 4.9 percent, even as it cut estimates for the United States. It would be the first time in four decades that the world economy powers ahead with little help from its biggest participant.
 The downgrade means the United States will probably not lead the Group of Seven nations in growth for the first time since 2003, ranking fourth behind Britain, Canada and Japan, according to the I.M.F. The United States has not trailed Japan, which struggled with falling prices for much of the last decade, since 1991.
 This year will also be the first since 2001 in which European economic growth will be faster than that in the United States, according to the I.M.F. forecast. The economy of the 13 nations using the euro will grow 2.3 percent this year, the I.M.F. estimates. The lender increased its forecast for Europe from 2 percent.

HEADLINE: Canadian Rail Workers Reject Contract Offer

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, April 11 

 BODY:
Labor disruptions again hit the Canadian National Railway after workers overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative contract leading to pickets and lockouts in some cities.
 A 15-day strike in February led to plant closings and shipping disruptions throughout North America, but the union said on Wednesday that it would try to limit the current walkout's impact on rail customers. 
However, later in the day, the Montreal-based railroad locked out about 280 workers in five cities who had originally intended only to remain off the job for a few hours.
 About 2,800 conductors and yard workers began a rotating strike after 79 percent of the members of the United Transportation Union at the railroad rejected a one-year agreement providing for a 3 percent wage increase and a signing bonus of 1,000 Canadian dollars ($870).
 Tim Secord, the national legislative director of the Ottawa-based union, said the rotating pickets were re-established just before midnight Tuesday to pressure the railroad to resume talks. 
 ''C.N. has now seen fit to lock out our members at these locations effectively escalating the level of disruption,'' Mr. Secord said on Wednesday night. ''That is not what we want.''
 A spokesman for Canadian National, Mark Hallman, said the lockouts were necessary to maintain the railroad's operating schedules.
 ''We have to have a predictable source of manpower resources,'' Mr. Hallman said, adding that the railroad will continue to lock out striking workers ''at the company's discretion.''
 The union will continue with its plan for rotating strikes despite the lockouts, Mr. Secord said, although it will not take any action that could disrupt commuter trains in Montreal and Toronto.
 According to Mr. Secord, the union's members are largely satisfied with the economic portions of the tentative agreement. Their concerns he said, are more focused around work rules and surveillance of employees by the railroad.
 The previous walkout led to shipping delays and parts shortages that forced the Ford Motor Company of Canada to temporarily close an assembly plant in Ontario. 
 Chemical, paper, lumber, coal, sulfur and grain producers also experienced production and shipping problems. Canadian ports, which handle merchandise from Asia bound for the United States, often on Canadian National trains, also became congested, adding to delays.
 After the federal government threatened to introduce back-to-work legislation that would have imposed a contract through arbitration, the two sides worked out the tentative agreement.
 Mr. Hallman said the railway would operate with management employees, as it did in February, if the labor shutdown expands.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
THE T.G.I. Friday's restaurant chain has introduced a note of sanity into American food consumption by offering smaller portions at lower prices. This was a response to a slackening of demand in the restaurant business, as well as a desire by some consumers for more healthful eating options. These smaller portions are identified as ''Right Portion, Right Price'' options. 
 Two cheers for T.G.I. Friday's.
Why only two? Because if the chain is really serious about helping to change American eating habits, it can do more. Specifically, it can offer the smaller portion as the ''regular'' and allow customers to order ''supersized'' portions for a higher price. Although the two portions wouldn't change in size no matter what they were called, research evidence suggests that labeling the smaller portions ''regular'' will move far more people to order them than if the portions were labeled as they are now. 
 Why? Ask yourself what happens if a customer simply orders the ''cajun shrimp and chicken pasta.'' Doing it the T.G.I. Friday's way, the customer gets the large portion; the other way, the customer gets the small portion. The two versions of the menu differ in what customers get if they say nothing about portion size. They differ in which option is the ''unmarked'' or ''default'' option. One ''default'' is a small portion, the other a big one.
 And the choice of default matters -- a lot. Some examples:
 In the United States as well as many European countries, when people renew their driver's license, they also decide whether they want to be organ donors. As a 2003 study in the journal Science found, more than 90 percent of Europeans are organ donors, while only about 25 percent of Americans are -- even though most Americans approve of organ donation. In the United States, to be an organ donor you have to sign a form. The reverse is true in Europe, where you are an organ donor unless you expressly indicate that you don't want to be.
 Another study, in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, found that when employers switch procedures for voluntary 401(k) contributions from ''opt in'' (you sign a form to take part) to ''opt out'' (you sign a form not to), rates of participation go up by as much as 30 percentage points.
 Results were similar when New Jersey and Pennsylvania both started offering lower cost, ''no fault'' (limited-liability) auto insurance at the same time. In New Jersey, but not in Pennsylvania, ''no fault'' was the default. More than 70 percent of car owners in each state chose the default. In the years since these programs were introduced, Pennsylvanians have paid millions more in auto insurance premiums than residents of New Jersey.
 These examples are not identical to the T.G.I. Friday's story. With these, doing nothing has a consequence -- organ donation or not, 401(k) sign-up or not -- whereas at T.G.I. Friday's, you have to order something. The T.G.I. Friday's version of setting a ''default'' is just what you get if you say nothing about portion size. 
 But there is every reason to suspect that this version of a default will also have an effect. It's close to impossible to be neutral when setting options in front of people; the format almost always nudges people in one direction or the other. Most infer that the default option is the recommended one. In the case of T.G.I. Friday's, most people will probably infer that the unmarked portion size is the normal portion size, the appropriate portion size -- the one that most customers select.
 Now another opportunity to be sensitive to the potential importance of setting defaults is imminent: how will the medical community respond to the new evidence that magnet resonance imaging breast scans can pick up things that mammograms miss? 
 The early consensus seems to be that these costly M.R.I.'s are a real breakthrough -- but not for everyone. Because of a reasonably high rate of false positives, M.R.I. scans will detect many tiny abnormalities that turn out to be benign, or not even tumors. Still, once the abnormalities are detected, there will be painful, stress-inducing, expensive follow-ups, some of which carry their own risks. So it is argued that M.R.I.'s are the right choice for women who are at relatively high risk for breast cancer, but not for the population at large.
 Will the average woman accept old-fashioned mammograms when M.R.I.'s are available? That will likely depend on how much effort doctors (and, of course, health insurance providers) make to identify mammograms as the default. If mammogram is the standard diagnostic tool -- if it is performed unless there are specific contraindications -- patients may continue to find it acceptable. 
 But what if mammogram and M.R.I. are presented as more or less equal alternatives, each with its own set of risks and benefits, and the doctor and patient together decide which course to pursue? Given the history of medicine in this country (jumping at every high-tech option), I think many more women will insist on the M.R.I., with no obvious overall benefits but substantial additional costs -- medical, psychological and financial. 
 Of course, if further research should indicate that M.R.I.'s are the right approach for everyone, the default will change. But unless the medical community takes steps to prevent it, the default may change without good reason, the result of patient demand. Default options should be selected thoughtfully, not carelessly, and should aim to enhance the well-being of affected parties.
 The legal scholar Cass Sunstein and the economist Richard Thaler call this thoughtful selection of defaults ''libertarian paternalism.'' It's paternalistic because defaults are chosen with an eye both on enhancing welfare and on the human tendency to do nothing (which increases as the number of options increases). It's libertarian because people can choose to opt out. 
 Applied to T.G.I. Friday's menu modification, the ''paternalistic'' decision to make the small portion the standard one would almost certainly increase the number of customers who ''choose'' it by a wide margin. And the availability of the ''supersized'' portion would give people an alternative that satisfies libertarian concerns about freedom of choice. I suspect the same is true when it comes to the choice between mammography and M.R.I., though of course the stakes there are much higher.

HEADLINE: City Seeks Broader Power to Fix Troubled Buildings at Landlords' Expense

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
New York City wants to strengthen its hand against recalcitrant landlords by giving itself broad new powers to overhaul entire building systems -- like heating, electrical or plumbing -- in long-troubled properties, and to force landlords to pay for the work.
 A bill to be introduced in the City Council today with the Bloomberg administration's support would give the Department of Housing Preservation and Development the right to go into buildings that have dozens of serious housing code violations and a history of emergency repairs, do cellar-to-roof inspections and fix not only immediate problems, but also the underlying systems. 
The proposed program, which city officials said would go beyond anything they knew of elsewhere, is intended to bring as many as a thousand severely run-down buildings into compliance with the housing maintenance code over the next five years and to shore up the supply of habitable apartments for lower-income families at a time when the inventory of lower-priced housing is rapidly declining.
 ''If a tenant abandons an apartment because it's not habitable, then that unit is at risk of coming off the rolls of regulated and affordable units,'' said Ray Brescia, associate director of the Urban Justice Center, a legal-services organization that supports the plan, ''because the landlord can make the repairs that it's been neglecting, then jack up the rent over the regulated amount.'' 
 Under the city's rent rules, the landlord of a rent-stabilized apartment can raise the rent 20 percent after it is vacated and can also add 2.5 percent of the cost of any improvements or renovations to the monthly rent. If a vacant apartment's rent hits $2,000, it falls out of the regulation system and the rent can rise to the market rate.
 Under the current code-enforcement program, the city can make emergency repairs on specific problems in privately owned buildings when an owner fails to do so, and then try to collect the costs from the owner. 
 The bill, which needs to be approved by the Council and the mayor, and would take five months to be put into effect if passed, would significantly expand that power.
 The new rules would apply to buildings with at least 27 uncorrected code violations, over the previous two years, of the sort considered hazardous to health and safety, and with an average of five such violations per unit. The buildings must also have unpaid charges left over from earlier instances when the city had made emergency repairs.
 The housing agency would give an owner four months to correct the violations and pay all outstanding charges. If the owner failed to do so, the agency would inspect the entire building, issue a comprehensive repair order and undertake the repairs itself if the landlord still did not do so.
 If an owner failed to pay all the fines, fees and costs owed for the work done, the city would place a lien on the building. The owner would be unable to refinance or sell it without first paying the lien.
 The city wants to add 200 buildings a year over the next five years to the new alternative enforcement program.
 ''What has tended to happen is that we get buildings that get a lot of emergency repairs over and over again,'' said Shaun Donovan, the housing commissioner, describing the current system. ''We might go in and fix the heating or take care of a lead-paint violation, but not get the underlying problems fixed for the long term.''
 Under the new rules, the city could not only fix a leak in one apartment's ceiling; it could also replace plumbing lines, if necessary, on several adjacent floors. And if inspectors found that the cause of heat shortages in that building was an antiquated boiler, the city could replace the boiler, too.
 Mr. Donovan said that he expected the program to cost the city about $10 million a year, much of which it hoped to recoup from landlords. Currently, he said, the city collects more than 90 percent of its costs through the liens it places on buildings.
 Christine C. Quinn, the council speaker, who worked as a tenant organizer between 1989 and 1991, said the new bill, which she is sponsoring with three other council members, arose out of a yearlong series of discussions with city officials, building owners and advocates for tenants on how best to take aim at the city's most persistently dilapidated buildings.
 Asked to give an example of a building that might become a target, administration officials described a 12-unit apartment house in East New York, Brooklyn, that they said has 178 uncorrected violations that are considered hazardous or immediately hazardous, and $10,000 in unpaid emergency-repair charges. The violations include gushing water leaks, loose plaster and electrical problems.
 Councilwoman Letitia James, a co-sponsor of the bill, whose district includes Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights and parts of Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant, said that more than 10,000 buildings in the city received emergency repairs last year; 46 percent of them also received repairs in 2005 and 22 percent also did in 2004.
 Referring to two large and troubled apartment complexes in her district, she said, ''Elevators don't work, rats run rampant,'' and she described ''mold in apartments, roofs that leak, windows that don't work, ceilings that are collapsing.''
 She said that tenants are unable to move out because they want to remain in the area and cannot find other apartments they can afford.
 ''It's willful and intentional negligence,'' Ms. James said. ''These landlords want tenants to move. They recognize the housing market, they recognize that gentrification is spreading across Brooklyn and they want to capture the market. It's like displacement by neglect.'' 
 The proposed legislation, called the Safe Housing Act, has the support not only of tenant advocacy groups like Mr. Brescia's, but also of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents property owners.
 ''As an owners' organization, we've always sort of been tainted by bad landlords, which probably represent 1 percent of all building owners in the city,'' said Frank P. Ricci, the association's director of government affairs.
 Of the proposed bill, he said, ''We think it's reasonable in that it's really going to target owners who are irresponsible.''
 Most of the buildings that are likely to be affected are relatively small, city housing officials said. They estimated that one-quarter have just 3 or 4 apartments, half have 5 to 8 apartments, one-eighth have 9 to 20 apartments and one-eighth have 21 or more apartments .

HEADLINE: Lender to Pay So Students Can Learn Loan Options

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Sallie Mae, the nation's largest lender to college students, agreed yesterday to pay $2 million to settle an investigation by the New York attorney general's office and said it would close down student call centers it has run for college financial aid offices. 
 The loan company, which manages student loans for nearly 10 million borrowers at more than 5,600 colleges, also agreed to adopt a code of conduct prepared by the office of the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, who announced the settlement at a news conference in Manhattan yesterday. The code prohibits loan companies from giving gifts or trips to university financial aid administrators. It also bans arrangements in which universities are paid for loan volume. 
The settlement comes just as many high school seniors are choosing where they want to go to college and are weighing financial aid packages from the institutions that have accepted them.
 It is the latest in a continuing investigation into the financial relationships between student loan companies and colleges and universities, which students typically rely on for advice about borrowing.
 Citibank paid a similar $2 million settlement recently, and New York University, Syracuse, St. John's and Fordham -- all in New York -- and the University of Pennsylvania agreed to pay more than $3.2 million to student borrowers who had received loans from companies that paid money to the institutions based on the loan volume they delivered. 
 But Sallie Mae, which began as a government-sponsored enterprise that bought student loans from banks before it expanded and became fully private, is the giant of the field with a $142 billion loan portfolio.
 In a statement on its Web site, Sallie Mae said it had ''cooperated with this inquiry since its inception, and, as the industry leader, we have been confident throughout that our policies and procedures would stand tall.'' 
 Mr. Cuomo said Sallie Mae had paid for entertainment and travel for financial aid administrators, paid them for serving on advisory boards and had run call centers for about 20 university aid offices in which students' questions were shuttled to Sallie Mae operators. The company's call center operators in the future will identify themselves as Sallie Mae employees, Mr. Cuomo said.
 A Sallie Mae spokesman, Tom Joyce, said the company would no longer market the call center service and would end such existing relationships with colleges over the next 18 months.
 The 20 universities include Pace University and Mercy College in New York City and Texas Tech and Wayne State University.
 Sallie Mae also agreed to disclose, upon request of colleges, the interest rates actually charged to students. 
 ''The ultimate success of these student loan investigations will be measured by the degree to which they result in cheaper college loans,'' said Michael Dannenberg, director of the education policy program at the New America Foundation, a Washington public policy institute.
 Sallie Mae must certify compliance with the terms of the settlement by Aug. 15.
 Besides the settlements, financial aid directors at six universities and one federal Education Department employee have been put on leave after the disclosure of various kinds of financial arrangements, including stock ownership and consulting deals, with lenders. 
 The revelations have sent ripples of concern through colleges and universities. Robert M. Berdahl, president of the Association of American Universities, wrote in an e-mail message to members this week, ''Given the current media environment, even if you find that your student aid office is doing nothing illegal, you should also ask if your student loan business arrangements, policies and practices can stand the test of full public disclosure.''
 Some high school counselors say students are not showing much concern as they choose their colleges.
 ''I don't think they've paid all that much attention to it,'' said Bob Sweeney, a school counselor at Mamaroneck High School in New York. ''All they care about is that they got in, and they're celebrating that.''

Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about an agreement by Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, to settle an investigation by New York's attorney general into relationships between universities and student loan companies misidentified in some copies the lender that runs call centers for financial aid offices at Texas Tech and Wayne State University. It is Nelnet, not Sallie Mae.

HEADLINE: How U.S. Turned North Korean Funds Into a Bargaining Chip

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
For 18 months, the Bush administration has maintained that the freezing of $25 million in an account in Macao linked to North Korea was strictly a law enforcement action against money-laundering, not a bargaining chip in a diplomatic effort to persuade North Korea to disarm its nuclear arsenal.
 Now, in a startling reversal, the administration has formally acknowledged that the $25 million was indeed a bargaining chip and that the money would be returned to companies and individuals charged with illegal activities. 
The administration had said the money would be returned to North Korea for ''humanitarian'' purposes, but on Wednesday officials acknowledged that they had no way to ensure that would happen. 
 Nevertheless, they defended the action as necessary to secure the nuclear disarmament deal.
 ''This was the right decision,'' said James R. Wilkinson, chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. ''At the end of the day, our government has been successful in fighting illicit behavior, and there is a much better chance at a change in North Korean behavior.''
 Mr. Wilkinson, who led an American delegation that returned last weekend after 13 days of negotiations in Beijing, said that although the money was being returned to its original owners, the administration had sent a strong signal of its power to crack down on arms proliferation, money-laundering and counterfeiting.
 ''The international community now clearly understands just how potent our financial actions can be,'' he said. ''Our sanctions programs are designed to combat illicit behavior and help achieve political movement. Because of Treasury actions, both have happened in this case.''
 The fact that the money was going to the original account holders at the bank in Macao was first reported Wednesday by The Washington Post.
 It was not clear when the money would actually be transferred. Of the total, $13 million is to be returned to 17 individuals and companies deemed by the Treasury to have been involved in illicit activities, and $12 million more will go to 35 entities labeled by the United States as legitimate. 
 American officials want a quick transfer because North Korea has said it will wait for all the money to be returned before it complies with its pledge to shut down a reactor and reprocessing facility at its nuclear center in Yongbyon. The deadline in the agreement is Saturday.
 The administration's reversal on the money was especially striking because President Bush, in January 2006, said the United States would not lift its restrictions on the frozen money just to get North Korea to negotiate.
 ''There is no compromise when it comes to, you know, 'Hey, come back to the table so you can counterfeit our money,' '' he said. ''I mean, no. We are going to uphold the law and protect the currency of the American people.''
 But in fact the news report about the Macao bank, Banco Delta Asia, was the second disclosure in a week about the administration's waiving its tough approach to North Korea. 
 On Sunday, The New York Times reported that the United States let an arms shipment from North Korea go to Ethiopia, despite a United Nations ban on purchases of North Korean arms. 
 The shipment was cleared because Ethiopia was engaged in an offensive against Islamists in Somalia.
 Administration officials said that after Mr. Wilkinson returned from Beijing, Secretary Paulson and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice conferred with White House officials and a consensus was reached that the money would have to be returned if the deal with North Korea was to be salvaged.
 The North Korea deal has drawn criticism from conservatives, including some former officials of the administration. 
 But Ms. Rice and her envoy on the matter, Christopher R. Hill, have defended it as a major diplomatic achievement. 
 The United States did not freeze the funds. That action was taken by China and Macao, a semiautonomous region of China. 
 But the Chinese authorities have been waiting for a green light to transfer the funds to North Korea and did not want to transfer them to another bank in their territory.
 At one point, the State and Treasury Departments announced that the money would be transferred to a Chinese bank for eventual use for ''humanitarian'' purposes by North Korea, but that arrangement fell through.
 In the end, what started out as a law enforcement action became a tool of diplomacy. 
 ''The North Koreans have said all along, 'Fix this problem and we'll deal with you,' '' said Charles L. Pritchard, a former administration envoy on North Korea and now president of the Korea Economic Institute, a policy group.
 He added that the Treasury Department became ''part of the problem'' in meeting North Korea's demands, and that with the return of the money, the administration had ''cut the cord'' from its officials who want to deal with North Korea by squeezing it as much as possible.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Middle East: Hamas Criticizes U.S. Security Aid For Abbas

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
Hamas, the militant group now in a fragile unity government with the rival Fatah faction, criticized a $59 million American aid package authorized earlier this week to bolster Palestinian security measures as ''dirty'' and ''ill intentioned'' because most of the money is to be used to support the Fatah forces of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas said all the money should be channeled through the Palestinian treasury. In Brussels, the Palestinian finance minister, Salam Fayyad, asked the European Union for $1.3 billion to avert an ''acute financial crisis'' this year. The European Union deals with Mr. Fayyad, an internationally respected independent member of the unity government, but boycotts Hamas, which it defines as a terrorist organization. The Union, which suspended direct aid to the Palestinian Authority when Hamas came to power a year ago, said it would not be resumed at this stage. ISABEL KERSHNER

HEADLINE: Allies Meet to Discuss Afghan War, as Taliban Offensive Looms

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: QUEBEC, April 11 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and allied defense ministers gathered here on Wednesday to discuss the war in Afghanistan at a moment of reckoning for the nations carrying the brunt of combat there. 
 The spring thaw is again opening the way for a new Taliban offensive. And even as the allies prepare for another season of fighting, critics of the Bush administration continue their accusations that the focus on the Iraq war has jeopardized the early military victory in Afghanistan in 2001.
The session of defense ministers from nations contributing troops to the NATO mission in southern Afghanistan, the spiritual home of the Taliban, was requested by Canada, which lost six soldiers on Sunday, the costliest day for its military since the Korean War. 
 The recent squabbles, over the insistence by some NATO countries on limiting how their troops can be used in Afghanistan, have gone quiet, at least in public. And shortages in equipment and personnel for the new NATO mission in Afghanistan have been reduced. They are now mostly seen in a lack of helicopters and transport planes, and military trainers, Pentagon officials said.
 The question facing Mr. Gates and his counterparts from Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark and the Netherlands, with lower-level officials invited from Estonia and Romania, is more strategic, and more stark: Does the alliance have the ability, and the will, to sustain the most complicated and bloody combat mission in NATO history for years to come? It is universally agreed that is what will be required.
 Officially, the purpose of the session here is to ''facilitate dialogue'' and ''share best practices'' so the allies can pull together, a senior Defense Department official said. 
 Even so, the senior official acknowledged that continued shortfalls in fulfilling commitments of troops and equipment for the mission would be on the table as the ministers gather Wednesday night and all day Thursday.
 The senior Defense Department official said Mr. Gates's goals for the session were to ensure a more comprehensive approach to the NATO mission in Afghanistan, one in which reconstruction and development are linked seamlessly with combat operations.
 The goal is for military operations to clear southern Afghan regions of fighters for the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but for those missions to be followed rapidly by investments in infrastructure and other reconstruction. The hope is that a sustained security presence will help create zones hospitable to international aid agencies and the Afghan government to set up long-term municipal services.
 As of the first week of March, the international mission in Afghanistan had 35,000 troops from 26 NATO nations and 11 other allies. About 15,000 of them were from the United States. In addition, the American military has 11,000 troops in Afghanistan on separate counterterrorism and training missions.
 Mr. Gates arrived here with no new offers of troops or equipment, officials said.
 As the ministers gathered, military officers and intelligence specialists were analyzing surveillance in anticipation of an imminent spring offensive by the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Those attacks have not yet begun in earnest, according to American military assessments.
 ''But this is an experienced and adaptable adversary,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
 Mr. Cordesman expressed doubts that Taliban forces would wage the unusually large attacks they did last year because they suffered significant losses in conventional battles against NATO, Afghan and allied troops.
 Instead, he said, Taliban and Qaeda forces are expected to focus on hit-and-run attacks, suicide bombings and improvised roadside explosives that have been used with such devastating effect in Iraq.
 Many military officers and Pentagon officials with time on the ground in Afghanistan contend that the coalition should do more at the lowest levels to help the Afghan people.
 Instead, many development and reconstruction efforts today are from the top down, with insufficient progress to improve the lives of those at the bottom of the economic and social ladder in Afghanistan's far-flung and backward provinces, these officials say.
 Americans who have deployed to Afghanistan say this is especially true in rural areas that are most susceptible to coercion by the Taliban, warlords or drug traffickers.
 In those areas, NATO and its allies are expected this spring to try to put much more emphasis on schools, roads, power, potable water, irrigation, economic development and the justice system, even as they continue combat operations against insurgents, to Pentagon and military officials said.

HEADLINE: China and Japan in Delicate Minuet To Ease Deep Diplomatic Tensions

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 11 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China began a three-day visit to Japan on Wednesday, in what both countries described as an important step forward in repairing diplomatic relations. 
 Shortly after Mr. Wen's arrival, he and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held talks and issued a statement that promised, in general, to increase cooperation in economic, energy, environmental and military matters.
''Both countries support each other's peaceful development, and will enhance political trust between the two countries,'' the statement read.
 Mr. Wen is the first Chinese prime minister to visit Japan in nearly seven years. Mr. Abe went to Beijing shortly after becoming prime minister last fall, making the first public move to defuse tensions between the nations, traditional rivals. 
 Relations deteriorated under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who made annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese war dead, including war criminals of World War II.
 China responded to Mr. Abe's visit by discouraging the kind of anti-Japanese content on television and the Internet that had fanned nationalist sentiment. Recently, China issued only muted criticism of Mr. Abe's denial that the Japanese military had directly coerced women into sexual slavery during the war. 
 Still, little progress was made, in recent months or on Wednesday, on the flash points: disputed gas and oil fields in the East China Sea; visits to Yasukuni and other problems related to history; and suspicions each harbors about the other's military ambitions. 
 The statement said China and Japan had agreed to ''look at history frankly and jointly build a beautiful future.'' Before his visit, Mr. Wen warned Mr. Abe against visiting the Yasukuni Shrine. Mr. Abe, a one-time committed visitor to Yasukuni, softened his position as prime minister, saying that he would neither deny nor acknowledge having visited the shrine.
 But news that Mr. Abe had quietly visited the shrine -- leaked strategically to the Japanese media last year -- could derail the current rapprochement. And other delicate anniversaries, most significantly the 70th anniversary of the Rape of Nanjing, occur this year.
 The statement also said, ''China said Japan should play a more constructive role in the international community.'' But China and Japan have been looking warily at each other's more assertive diplomacy.
 China has opposed Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and is suspicious of its strengthening securities ties with the United States and Australia.
 Meanwhile, Japanese officials regularly criticize China's growing military budget and, in a dig at Beijing, talk of strengthening ties with Asian nations that share values of democracy and human rights.

HEADLINE: In the Real World of Work and Wages, Trickle-Down Theories Don't Hold Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, is the author of ''The Economic Naturalist,'' which will be published next month. Contact: www.robert-h-frank.com.

 BODY:
When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton famously replied, ''Because that's where the money is.'' The same logic explains the call by John Edwards, the Democratic presidential candidate, for higher taxes on top earners to underwrite his proposal for universal health coverage. 
 Providing universal coverage will be expensive. With the median wage, adjusted for inflation, lower now than in 1980, most middle-class families cannot afford additional taxes. In contrast, the top tenth of 1 percent of earners today make about four times as much as in 1980, while those higher up have enjoyed even larger gains. Chief executives of large American companies, for example, earn more than 10 times what they did in 1980. In short, top earners are where the money is. Universal health coverage cannot happen unless they pay higher taxes. 
Trickle-down theorists are quick to object that higher taxes would cause top earners to work less and take fewer risks, thereby stifling economic growth. In their familiar rhetorical flourish, they insist that a more progressive tax system would kill the geese that lay the golden eggs. On close examination, however, this claim is supported neither by economic theory nor by empirical evidence.
 The surface plausibility of trickle-down theory owes much to the fact that it appears to follow from the time-honored belief that people respond to incentives. Because higher taxes on top earners reduce the reward for effort, it seems reasonable that they would induce people to work less, as trickle-down theorists claim. As every economics textbook makes clear, however, a decline in after-tax wages also exerts a second, opposing effect. By making people feel poorer, it provides them with an incentive to recoup their income loss by working harder than before. Economic theory says nothing about which of these offsetting effects may dominate. 
 If economic theory is unkind to trickle-down proponents, the lessons of experience are downright brutal. If lower real wages induce people to work shorter hours, then the opposite should be true when real wages increase. According to trickle-down theory, then, the cumulative effect of the last century's sharp rise in real wages should have been a significant increase in hours worked. In fact, however, the workweek is much shorter now than in 1900. 
 Trickle-down theory also predicts shorter workweeks in countries with lower real after-tax pay rates. Yet here, too, the numbers tell a different story. For example, even though chief executives in Japan earn less than one-fifth what their American counterparts do and face substantially higher marginal tax rates, Japanese executives do not log shorter hours. 
 Trickle-down theory also predicts a positive correlation between inequality and economic growth, the idea being that income disparities strengthen motivation to get ahead. Yet when researchers track the data within individual countries over time, they find a negative correlation. In the decades immediately after World War II, for example, income inequality was low by historical standards, yet growth rates in most industrial countries were extremely high. In contrast, growth rates have been only about half as large in the years since 1973, a period in which inequality has been steadily rising.
 The same pattern has been observed in cross-national data. For example, using data from the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development for a sample of 65 industrial nations, the economists Alberto Alesina and Dani Rodrick found lower growth rates in countries where higher shares of national income went to the top 5 percent and the top 20 percent of earners. In contrast, larger shares for poor and middle-income groups were associated with higher growth rates. Again and again, the observed pattern is the opposite of the one predicted by trickle-down theory.
 The trickle-down theorist's view of the world is nicely captured by a Donald Reilly cartoon depicting two well-fed executives nursing cocktails on a summer afternoon as they lounge on flotation devices in a pool. Pointing to himself, one says angrily to the other, ''If those soak-the-rich birds get their way, I can tell you here's one coolie who'll stop'' working so hard. 
 This portrait bears little resemblance to reality. In the 1950s, American executives earned far lower salaries and faced substantially higher marginal tax rates than they do today. Yet most of them competed energetically for higher rungs on the corporate ladder. The claim that slightly higher tax rates would cause today's executives to abandon that quest is simply not credible. 
 In the United States, trickle-down theory's insistence that a more progressive tax structure would compromise economic growth has long blocked attempts to provide valued public services. Thus, although every other industrial country provides universal health coverage, trickle-down theorists insist that the wealthiest country on earth cannot afford to do so. Elizabeth Edwards faces her battle with cancer with the full support of the world's most advanced medical system, yet millions of other Americans face similar battles without even minimal access to that system. 
 Low- and middle-income families are not the only ones who have been harmed by our inability to provide valued public services. For example, rich and poor alike would benefit from an expansion of the Energy Department's program to secure stockpiles of nuclear materials that remain poorly guarded in the former Soviet Union. Instead, the Bush administration has cut this program, even as terrorists actively seek to acquire nuclear weaponry. 
 The rich are where the money is. Many top earners would willingly pay higher taxes for public services that promise high value. Yet trickle-down theory, which is supported neither by theory nor evidence, continues to stand in the way. This theory is ripe for abandonment.

HEADLINE: Rising Inflation May Mean More Fed Rate Increases

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
At their last meeting, Federal Reserve officials agreed that more interest rate increases might be needed to tame rising inflation, though they also expressed concern that the economy could slow more than forecast. 
 Minutes from the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, released yesterday, reinforced its position that inflation remained the biggest threat to the economy.
Investors interpreted that yesterday to mean that a rate cut in the near future was unlikely.
 They had initially read the Fed's statement from that meeting as encouraging the idea that an interest rate cut could happen within the next few months.
 Stock prices fell sharply after the minutes were released at 2 p.m. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 89.23 points, or about 0.7 percent, in yesterday's session. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.52 points, or 0.66 percent.
 The minutes showed that central bankers grappled with a growing uncertainty about which direction the economy was headed. 
 So for the first time since Ben S. Bernanke became chairman in February 2006, the Fed decided to omit language indicating its bias toward ''additional firming'' of rates in the statement that accompanied its decision to hold short-term interest rates at 5.25 percent.
 ''In light of the increased uncertainty about the outlook for both growth and inflation, the committee also agreed that the statement should no longer cite only the possibility of further firming,'' the minutes said. 
 ''Instead, the statement should indicate that future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth.''
 The Fed ''is feeling an increased intensity and unpredictability of crosswinds in the outlook,'' Brian A. Bethune, an economist with Global Insight, said in a research note.
 The revised language allows the Fed room to move rates in either direction. 
 ''They're adding flexibility by acknowledging that there's at least some possibility of a rate cut,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist of Lehman Brothers. ''But that doesn't mean they're taking the eye off the ball here in terms of inflation.''
 The Fed minutes echoed recent statements by Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials who have maintained that their focus was on inflation. 
 After the Fed's March 21 statement, stocks rallied on the hope that interest rates would soon fall. That is a notion that Mr. Bernanke and others at the Fed have sought to dispel in recent weeks.
 Speaking yesterday in North Carolina, Jeffrey Lacker, the hawkish president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said that rate increases might be needed if inflation did not fall back. 
 Other Fed officials have made similar statements in recent days. Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, and Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, also hinted this week at further rate increases if inflation continued to rise.
 ''A number of Fed officials have come out and repeated their mantra,'' Mr. Harris of Lehman said. ''They're saying things have to be quite painful if we're going to cut rates.''

HEADLINE: Four Years Later in Iraq

 BODY:
Four years ago this week, as American troops made their first, triumphant entrance into Baghdad, joyous Iraqis pulled down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein. It was powerful symbolism -- a murderous dictator toppled, Baghdadis taking to the streets without fear, American soldiers hailed as liberators. 
 After four years of occupation, untold numbers killed by death squads and suicide bombers, and searing experiences like Abu Ghraib, few Iraqis still look on American soldiers as liberators. Instead, thousands marked this week's anniversary by burning American flags and marching through the streets of Najaf chanting, ''Death to America.''
 Once again, tens of thousands of American troops are pouring into Baghdad. Yesterday the Pentagon announced that battle-weary Army units in Iraq would have to stay on for an additional three months past their scheduled return dates.
 Mr. Bush is desperately gambling that by stretching the Army to the absolute limits of its deployable strength, he may be able to impose some relative calm in the capital. And he seems to imagine that should that gamble succeed, the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki will, without any serious pressure from Washington, take the steps toward sharing political power and economic resources it has tenaciously resisted since the day it took office a year ago. 
 Unless Mr. Maliki takes those steps -- eliminating militia and death squad members from the Iraqi Army and police, fairly sharing oil revenues, and rolling back laws that deny political and economic opportunities to the Sunni middle class -- no lasting security gains are possible. More Iraqi and American lives will be sacrificed. 
 Even among Shiites, who suffered so much at the hands of Saddam Hussein and who are the supposed beneficiaries of Mr. Maliki's shortsighted policies, there is a deep disillusionment and anger. This week, a Washington Post reporter interviewed Khadim al-Jubouri, who four years ago swung his sledgehammer to help knock down the dictator's statue. Mr. Jubouri said that ever since he watched that statue being built he had nourished a dream of bringing it down and ushering in much better times.
 Now, with friends and relatives killed, kidnapped or driven from their homes, the prices of basic necessities soaring and electricity rationed to four hours a day, Mr. Jubouri says the change of regimes ''achieved nothing'' and he has come to hate the American military presence he once welcomed. 
 Mr. Maliki's supporters can be even more frightening to listen to. This week's demonstration in Najaf was organized by the fiercely anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose political party and militia helped put Mr. Maliki in power and are still among his most important allies. 
 Two months into the Baghdad security drive, the gains Mr. Bush is banking on have not materialized. More American soldiers continue to arrive, and their commanders are talking about extending the troop buildup through the fall or into early next year. After four years, the political trend is even more discouraging. 
 There is no possible triumph in Iraq and very little hope left.

HEADLINE: Developer That Bought Times Building Puts Up For-Sale Sign

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
What a difference 885 days make.
 This week, Tishman Speyer Properties put the historic headquarters of The New York Times Company on West 43rd Street on the block for $500 million -- nearly three times the amount Tishman Speyer paid for it, $175 million, in November 2004.
''It's indicative of how fast rents have moved up and how much capital is chasing deals,'' said Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics, which tracks real estate deals. ''There's just so much money in the market. I don't see it stopping in the short term.'' 
 The average rent for first-class office space in Midtown has climbed to a record high of $70.77 per square foot, according to a report released on Tuesday by Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate broker. In addition to American investors and pension funds, foreign investors have also found New York attractive, because it is less expensive than cities like London, Paris and Hong Kong. At the same time, interest rates are still relatively low and the dollar is weak against the euro.
 ''People from Europe come here and think they're getting a bargain,'' Mr. Fasulo said.
 It seems as if every week brings news of another record-breaking deal for office towers or residential buildings in a city grappling with prosperity and success. Some analysts wonder what will happen when the real estate boom runs out of air. In the meantime, there is growing concern that rising office rents could drive some companies out of New York, while housing costs are making New York less hospitable for poor, working-class and even middle-class families. 
 Robert C. Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine, has put a $59 million price on his 25-room mansion on the Upper East Side, while the average apartment in Manhattan sells for $1.2 million.
 Harry B. Macklowe, the developer, recently bought eight first-class office buildings in Midtown for a total of $7.2 billion, or more than $1,100 a square foot.
 In December, a New Jersey real estate family, the Kushners, announced that it was buying the 41-story skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue for $1.8 billion, or $1,200 per square foot, from Tishman Speyer. 
 At $500 million, the company or investor that buys The New York Times headquarters would be paying $666.66 a square foot, seemingly a bargain by comparison. But the 750,000-square-foot, 15-story building, which opened in 1913, is no one's idea of a first-class office tower. It needs an expensive, top-to-bottom overhaul before it can be rented to corporate tenants.
 But there are not that many alternatives in Midtown.
 ''It's the only office building north of 42nd Street that can deliver in the next 24 months more than 300,000 square feet of contiguous space'' that would rent for less than $100 per square foot, said Darcy A. Stacom, the broker at CB Richard Ellis who sold the property for The Times in 2004 and is now handling it for Tishman Speyer.
 The Times Company plans to move this year into its new headquarters, a skyscraper between 40th and 41st Streets, across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
 At the time the deal was struck, some real estate executives suggested that Tishman Speyer had overpaid for the Times building. But rents have marched steadily upward since then, while vacancy rates plummeted. So far this year, Manhattan office buildings are selling for an average of $834 a square foot, up from $300 in 2004, according to Real Capital Analytics.
 ''The value of the building has increased significantly since we bought it,'' said Rob Speyer, senior managing director of Tishman Speyer. ''It's in the best interest of our investors to realize that value.''
 Right now, financial institutions -- everything from investment banks to hedge funds and private equity companies -- are driving the market. They collectively accounted for more than a third of the space leased in Manhattan so far this year. Those companies are also paying the highest rents, with financial companies signing more than 12 of the 18 leases this year for space costing $100 or more per square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
 But skyrocketing rents are one reason that JPMorgan Chase & Company is looking at moving thousands of employees from Midtown to Lower Manhattan, where rents are one-third less. It is also why Citigroup announced last year that it was moving 1,200 executives to Jersey City from downtown. Two years earlier, Citigroup moved 1,900 employees out of Lower Manhattan, most of them to a corporate campus in Warren, N.J.
 ''The flip side of all this prosperity,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, ''is that lower- and middle-income workers are being priced out of the housing market and the technical and operational jobs at our major industries can no longer afford the rents.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 12 about the $500 million asking price for the building at 229 W. 43rd Street that houses the headquarters of The New York Times -- nearly three times the amount a developer paid for it in November 2004 -- included an outdated reference to an Upper East Side mansion with a high price tag. The 25-room building, which is listed at $59 million, is no longer owned by Robert C. Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine.

HEADLINE: Increasing Board Size, Toyota Names First American Director

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 12 

 BODY:
Toyota announced a management shuffle on Thursday that would elevate the president of its North American operations, James E. Press, to be the first non-Japanese to sit on the automaker's board.
 The move comes amid concerns at Toyota over political resentment in the United States, where Japanese carmakers have prospered while the American producers struggle. It also reflects the efforts of Toyota, a solidly Japanese company, to become more international these days, as it produces and sells more vehicles overseas than in Japan.
The changes announced on Thursday would increase the number of board members to 30 from 25. Mr. Press, 60, was among nine new directors appointed. Four members retired, including the executive vice president, Yoshimi Inaba, a popular executive who had led Toyota's important China operations for two years. 
 The changes are subject to approval by a meeting of shareholders in June, the company said.
 In addition to his new board seat, Mr. Press was promoted to senior managing director, an executive post in the Japanese parent company just two rungs below Toyota's president, Katsuaki Watanabe. Mr. Press is also the first non-Japanese to advance to this level in Toyota's 72-year history, the company said.
 His promotion came after years of discussion at Toyota about whether to name Americans, Europeans and other non-Japanese to its board. In the last few years, sales outside Japan have far outstripped those at home, but the makeup of the board did not reflect that.
 About four years ago, Toyota created the senior managing director post as a first step toward giving more authority to non-Japanese, short of board seats.
 Mr. Press is to join a board with 29 other members, most of whom have spent their entire careers at Toyota.
 He joined Toyota from Ford in 1970, when the Japanese automaker sold just over 200,000 cars in the United States, all imported from Japan. Last year, it was the third-largest seller of autos in the United States, behind General Motors and Ford.
 Mr. Press rose through the ranks of the company's North American sales subsidiary, where he was known for close ties with dealers. He took over as president of Toyota's North American operations last year after his predecessor, a Japanese executive, resigned after being named in a sexual-harassment lawsuit. The suit was settled, and the executive later retired.
 If any American executive was to be named to the board, the most likely candidate was Mr. Press, senior Toyota executives have said. They characterized him as having the best understanding of any American executive of the company's corporate culture, which stresses a long-term view, employee involvement, adherence to Toyota's manufacturing process and continuous improvement.
 Mr. Press has taken a more visible role in the American operations over the last year. Last month, he testified to Congress alongside executives from Detroit automakers, with legislation under consideration that would raise fuel-economy standards to as much as 40 miles a gallon, from the current 27.5. And in February, he spoke to the Economic Club of Chicago, where he stressed the company's interest in the environment.
 Toyota has built market share in the United States with fuel-efficient vehicles like the Camry and Corolla sedans at a time when the American producers have been closing factories and laying off workers. Its success has prompted some Toyota executives to express concern about possible trade problems with Washington.
 While Toyota has not been singled out, some in Congress criticize Japan, saying it undervalues its currency, the yen, to help drive down the prices of its autos. Four House Democrats recently wrote to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., saying the yen's value had increased Japanese auto exports to the United States.

HEADLINE: Off the Air: The Light Goes Out for Don Imus

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER and JACQUES STEINBERG; Tina Kelley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CBS brought a weeklong confrontation over a racial and sexual insult by the radio host Don Imus to an end yesterday when it canceled the ''Imus in the Morning'' program, effective immediately.
 The move came a day after the cable television network MSNBC, a General Electric unit that has simulcast Mr. Imus's radio program for the last 10 years, removed the show from its morning lineup. The two moves, taken together, mean that Mr. Imus, who has been broadcasting the program for more than 30 years, no longer has a home on either national radio or television.
It is possible, though, that he could re-emerge on satellite radio.
 Mr. Imus received the news at home in a telephone call. Many of his listeners learned of it during the afternoon radio show ''Mike and the Mad Dog,'' which announced it on WFAN, the CBS-owned New York station that also carried Mr. Imus's program. 
 The CBS chief executive, Leslie Moonves, met yesterday afternoon with the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, leaders in what became a national movement to remove Mr. Imus from the air in the wake of his comments disparaging members of the Rutgers women's basketball team. On April 4, Mr. Imus referred on the air to the Rutgers athletes as ''nappy-headed hos.''
 Both CBS and MSNBC had been under pressure from black leaders and women's groups, then advertisers began abandoning the Imus program and its networks this week, pulling out the financial underpinnings from the show. 
 In a statement, Mr. Moonves said: ''Those who have spoken with us the last few days represent people of good will from all segments of our society -- all races, economic groups, men and women alike. In our meetings with concerned groups, there has been much discussion of the effect language like this has on our young people, particularly young women of color trying to make their way in this society.''
 He went on to say, ''That consideration has weighed most heavily on our minds as we made our decision, as have the many e-mails, phone calls and personal discussions we have had with our colleagues across the CBS Corporation and our many other constituencies.''
 The CBS decision came hours before Mr. Imus and the Rutgers basketball team met at the New Jersey governor's mansion in Princeton. The Rutgers group at the meeting included some parents, university adminstrators, and the Rev. DeForest Soaries of the First Baptist Church in Somerset, N.J., where the Rutgers head coach, C. Vivian Stringer, is a parishioner. 
 At 10:50 p.m., after three hours, Mr. Imus left without commenting. The Rutgers group stayed about an hour longer. Ms. Stringer spoke for the group before leaving.
 ''It was a very productive meeting,'' she said. ''Players, coaches, parents, administrators, the pastor, and Mr. Imus were able to really dialogue. I'm extremely proud of our 10 young basketball players.''
 Asked if Mr. Imus apologized, Ms. Stringer declined to answer. ''We've said as much as we can say tonight.'' 
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who had offered the mansion as a meeting site, was injured in an traffic accident and did not take part. 
 Neither of Mr. Imus's employers, however, was willing to wait to see if the meeting would produce anything like a rapprochement. 
 CBS and NBC originally announced a two-week suspension for Mr. Imus that was to begin on Monday, but the protests increased as the week went on. They gained momentum first from a news conference by the Rutgers team and then by the recounting of previous episodes when Mr. Imus and his supporting cast engaged in racially charged banter.
 Executives at NBC said the discomfort of staff members and concerns about the network's reputation had influenced the decision to cut ties with Mr. Imus. But it was paying only a license fee to carry the show. CBS Radio and WFAN produced the show and contracted with Mr. Imus as its star.
 CBS also manages Westwood One, the syndicator that has sold the Imus show to other stations around the country. Mr. Imus, 66, was among the most recognizable voices on radio, and commanded a salary estimated at $10 million a year.
 With his longtime base gone, Mr. Imus may well try to turn to satellite radio. But before he can entertain such a possibility, he would presumably have to reach some accommodation with CBS. He recently signed a five-year contract extension.
 Even then, it seems unlikely that he would match his current salary in a fledgling medium with a fraction of the audience of conventional radio, particularly as the two main satellite companies -- Sirius and XM -- try to cut costs in pursuit of a merger. Moreover, with Congress and the Federal Communications Commission reviewing that proposed deal, they may be reluctant to take on a tainted figure like Mr. Imus, who would stir controversy among the regulators who must approve the merger.
 That said, the chief executive of Sirius, Mel Karmazin, is a longtime friend of Mr. Imus and was for many years his boss at Infinity Broadcasting, which later merged with CBS. A Sirius spokesman did not immediately return a call last night seeking comment. An XM spokesman said he had no comment.
 The CBS action on Mr. Imus came on an extraordinary day. For four and a half hours yesterday morning, he turned his radio program into a live fund-raiser for three charities -- two benefiting children with cancer, and the other related to sudden infant death syndrome -- an endeavor he has undertaken each of the last 18 years.
 Among the guests were children and parents who had been beneficiaries of his efforts -- particularly the Imus Cattle Ranch for Kids With Cancer, a program that the host founded at his New Mexico ranch along with his wife, Deirdre. 
 Through the broadcast, though, Mr. Imus continually referred to the perilous predicament he was in.
 He strongly suggested, for example, that he believed that his long career on conventional radio, at least, was drawing to a close, which gave the broadcast something of a funereal atmosphere.
 ''This may or not be our final radiothon,'' he said, just before 6 a.m. ''But let's say for the sake of being safe that it is.''
 At several points, he lashed out at the ''hypocrisy'' in media coverage of the fallout from his remark.
 He also expressed bitterness that MSNBC had ''pulled the plug'' on televising his program less than 12 hours before the fund-raiser was to begin. ''They got their pound of flesh,'' he said.
 At the same time, Mr. Imus also acknowledged that, ultimately, he alone was to blame for his predicament. ''I said a stupid, idiotic thing that hurt these kids,'' he said of the Rutgers players. ''If I hadn't have said it, we wouldn't be here.''
 As he left his studio in Secaucus, N.J., at midmorning yesterday, the house band he hired for the fund-raiser, led by Levon Helm, serenaded him with ''Hail to the Chief.''
 The radiothon, which continued throughout the day and was to conclude at 10 a.m. Friday, had brought pledges in excess of $1.6 million by 6 p.m. yesterday. In a sign that the attention swirling around Mr. Imus might have actually helped the fund-raiser, donations were running substantially higher than at the same point in previous years, WFAN said.
 In a memo sent to CBS employees announcing Mr. Imus's dismissal, Mr. Moonves said: ''This is about a lot more than Imus. As has been widely pointed out, Imus has been visited by presidents, senators, important authors and journalists from across the political spectrum. He has flourished in a culture that permits a certain level of objectionable expression that hurts and demeans a wide range of people. In taking him off the air, I believe we take an important and necessary step not just in solving a unique problem, but in changing that culture, which extends far beyond the walls of our company.''
 With Mr. Imus now gone from their lineup, CBS Radio and WFAN were under pressure yesterday to find someone to replace him. At least temporarily, WFAN planned to install ''Mike and the Mad Dog,'' a sports talk show, in the morning hours that Mr. Imus had occupied, according to a company executive.
 But the prospect of such added responsibilities did not stop the two hosts -- Mike Francesa and Christopher Russo (the ''Mad Dog'') -- from blistering their employer, CBS Radio, for cutting ties to Mr. Imus in the midst of the fund-raiser.
 ''They should know better,'' Mr. Russo said on the air. ''A sophomore in college handles this better.''

HEADLINE: A Reeling Richardson Keeps Hope Afloat

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''How are you doing?'' I said to the recently unemployed Micheal Ray Richardson earlier this week.
 ''I'll tell you what, I'm not sinkin','' he said by telephone from Albany in the 25th anniversary year of his most famous quotation until late last month.
 Richardson's ship may not be going down as the Knicks did during the spring of 1982 and as his N.B.A. career did four years later. But his hope of rising in the coaching ranks is listing perilously after his suspension from the Albany Patroons' Continental Basketball Association championship series against the Yakama Sun Kings. 
 He wasn't trying to be funny, wasn't prostituting his values for the sake of ratings and profit, when he cursed out a courtside fan during the first game of the series in Albany. But he embellished the attack with an anti-gay slur, and this after giving a pregame discourse to two reporters from The Albany Times-Union that was interpreted by some, not all, probably not even most, to be anti-Semitic.
 Even if it was, in the case of the fan, an angry slip of the tongue, and even if it was just awkward phrasing in the discussion with reporters that ensued after his quip about being represented by ''big-time Jew lawyers,'' Richardson is out of work now, begging not to be written off and remembered as a bigot.
 ''I'm 52 years old and all I want is some peace,'' he said. ''I never judge anyone, not after all the things that have happened to me.''
 He was a gifted athlete who snorted away what might have been a Hall of Fame career, who survived the worst of times when many expected him to one day turn up dead. After eight stormy years, Richardson was banished from the N.B.A. by Commissioner David Stern for failing a drug test in 1986, and he went off to play abroad, from Italy to, yes, Israel, deep into his 40s. 
 Defrocked jock and shock jock, Richardson and Don Imus, whose failures to mince their messages occurred one week apart and have resulted in screeching employment derailment, have operated in separate universes, but not without lifestyle parallels.
 Both came to stardom young and couldn't resist the potentially ruinous temptations of the New York City high life. Through good times and bad, both had defenders and sycophants to forgive them, swear by their intentions, by their good hearts. 
 People, myself included, who have known Richardson from the beginning, long ago reached the conclusion that he is an endearing soul with a nasty habit of making trouble for himself. We fondly remember him coming to New York for the first time as an N.B.A. rookie from the University of Montana, being asked how he came by the nickname of Sugar, and the uncomfortable seconds that ensued as Richardson, with a chronic stutter, struggled to say, ''Because I'm sweet on the court.''
 So those of us who rooted for him to survive and succeed will be quick to point out that Richardson telephoned the Albany fan the next day to apologize for the outburst -- contrary to Imus's second-day suggestion that those upset by his horrific and now job-fatal slander of the Rutgers women's basketball players needed to get a life.
 Soon as Richardson realized that a firestorm was brewing over his comments on Jewish ingenuity and influence, he called Stern, who had arranged a job for him in the Denver Nuggets' community relations department when Richardson returned from Europe in 2003, leaving behind in France a Moroccan wife and two young children. Then he contacted Joe Taub, the former owner of the Nets and a longtime Richardson supporter.
 Both men, at times filling the paternal void in Richardson's life, are Jewish. Richardson had to explain what he had been trying to say.
 ''Micheal has played and lived in Israel, has been to that airport in Tel Aviv,'' Stern said in a telephone interview, insisting Richardson would not be excommunicated from his league this time, that he was still on the active list to staff brand clinics. ''He knows the Middle East is a tough neighborhood. Saying Jewish people have to be smart to survive didn't strike me as anti-Semitic.''
 Stern's support didn't get Richardson reinstated in Albany or a contract for next season. Jim Coyne, the Patroons' general manager, said there were other issues: a midseason powder Richardson took to attend the N.B.A. All-Star Game in Las Vegas, a trade he made without consulting Coyne.
 There were also earlier exchanges with fans, Coyne said, situations that ''a coach should be above.'' Coyne and the team's president and owner, Benito Fernandez, decided after the playoffs that it was best for Richardson to move on. But where?
 ''The best thing for Micheal would be to work for the N.B.A. or one of its teams, scouting in Europe,'' Coyne said. ''He knows the territory, he knows talent, and that would take him away from the pressure of the game, the heat of the moment.'' 
 And out of the combustible environment that always made him such a risk to implode.
 It has been 10 years since Richardson startled Stern in Paris at a McDonald's Open game, held out his hand and thanked him for sending him away, for setting him straight. Kicking Richardson out of the N.B.A. was no act of friendship. Hindsight allows us to define it, in part, as one of mercy. 
 Hard truths are invaluable for those who believe they are untouchable, who stretch the rules, or the limits of decency. As he most likely heads to the satellite dial, the talk-radio European league, think Imus isn't wishing that some of his big-shot friends had been willing to sacrifice their own airtime and agendas until he curtailed the crudeness? That he had had a corporate commissioner to administer tough love?
 Maybe Stern can sit Richardson down soon, tell him to forget another C.B.A. coaching job and the lawsuit against the Albany reporter and his corporate superiors that Richardson's attorney has been crowing about this week. Maybe Stern can send Richardson back to Europe and to his family, to where he resumed his livelihood two decades ago and saved something worth much more. His soul.

HEADLINE: Turmoil Grows For Wolfowitz At World Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz's tenure as president of the World Bank was thrown into turmoil on Thursday by the disclosure that he had helped arrange a pay raise for his companion at the time of her transfer from the bank to the State Department, where she remained on the bank payroll.
 In a chaotic day of revelations and meetings at a normally staid institution, Mr. Wolfowitz apologized for his role in the raise and transfer of Shaha Ali Riza, his companion, to a few hundred staff members assembled in the bank building atrium, only to be greeted by booing, catcalls and cries for his resignation.
Earlier, the bank's staff association had declared that it was ''impossible for the institution to move forward with any sense of purpose under the present leadership.'' The association had helped spearhead an investigation into Ms. Riza's transfer and raise, details of which came into the open in the last 24 hours. 
 The events injected a new ugliness into what had already been a bitter rift between Mr. Wolfowitz and many of the bank's employees, who have questioned his suitability for the job as a former deputy secretary of defense and architect of the Iraq war, and have challenged many of his policies at the bank, especially those cracking down on corruption in which he suspended aid to several countries without consulting the board.
 The World Bank's 24-member executive board, the body that elected Mr. Wolfowitz to the job after he was nominated by President Bush in 2005, held hurried meetings throughout the day amid mounting speculation that it might reprimand him or ask him to resign.
 But shortly after 10 p.m. a bank official released a statement from Mr. Wolfowitz to the board members saying that ''in the interests of transparency,'' he was requesting the ''immediate public release of all documents related to the board's current review of the case involving myself and Ms. Riza.'' The statement appeared to reflect a concern by the bank president that he was being tarred by selective leaks. 
 The board was also reported to be meeting late into the evening over what further information to make public about the matter. Whatever the outcome, the controversy appeared certain to produce more meetings and engulf delegates at the annual spring session of finance ministry officials in Washington, sponsored by the bank and the International Monetary Fund.
 Mr. Wolfowitz apologized at a morning news conference and at the atrium meeting after the staff association disclosed that it had found a dated memorandum from Mr. Wolfowitz to a vice president for human resources at the bank, apparently instructing him to agree to the terms of a raise and reassignment for Ms. Riza.
 The transfer and a subsequent raise eventually took her to a pay of $193,590 from $132,660, tax-free because of her status as a diplomat, and exceeding the salaries of cabinet members. ''In hindsight, I wish I had trusted my original instincts and kept myself out of the negotiations,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said.
 ''I made a mistake, for which I am sorry,'' he added, pleading for ''some understanding'' of the ''painful personal dilemma'' he faced when he left the Pentagon to become bank president. Mr. Wolfowitz said he had been seeking to avoid a conflict of interest by having Ms. Riza, with whom he had a personal relationship, transferred from his supervision.
 What drove the anger at the bank was not that Mr. Wolfowitz had denied earlier that he had sought Ms. Riza's transfer, but that he had been less than fully candid in discussing it until documents surfaced showing his direct role. His earlier insistence that he had consulted with ethics officials was disputed by some of them, who say they were not involved in the salary aspect of discussions.
 Mr. Wolfowitz, who is divorced, has been close to Ms. Riza for several years, according to people who have worked with them. She was a communications officer in the Middle East and North Africa bureau of the bank when Mr. Wolfowitz arrived in 2005, and was transferred that September to the Middle East and North Africa bureau to help set up a semi-independent foundation to promote democracy in that region.
 Her initial supervisor at the State Department was Elizabeth Cheney, whose father, Vice President Dick Cheney, has been a longtime associate of Mr. Wolfowitz. Ms. Riza now serves as a consultant to the foundation, the Foundation for the Future, while drawing her World Bank salary, the State Department said.
 Mr. Wolfowitz, in his talk to the bank staff, essentially implied that his fate was up to the board. ''I proposed to the board that they establish some mechanism to judge whether the agreement reached was a reasonable outcome,'' he said of the arrangement for Ms. Riza. ''I will accept any remedies they propose.''
 He also appealed to the staff members to look beyond his role in planning the Iraq war and join him in fighting poverty in Africa and other missions of the bank. 
 ''For those people who disagree with the things that they associate with me in my previous job, I'm not in my previous job,'' he said.
 Many bank officials said board members were likely to wait to decide what to do after checking with their finance ministers, many of whom were on their way to Washington for the annual meetings.
 A decision as big as whether to remove Mr. Wolfowitz or encourage him to step down would be likely to involve leaders of the bank's main donor countries in discussions with President Bush, bank officials said.
 The bank's five largest donors -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France and Britain -- each nominate one board member, but their voting power is based on shares in the bank. The United States, with 16 percent, has the largest share, making it customary for the White House to nominate the bank president.
 But the bank has been gripped by resentment for years over the perception that the United States has too much influence. That trend reflects declining American influence at the bank at a time when European and Asian countries have gained in economic clout.
 There is speculation among bank officials that if Mr. Wolfowitz leaves, European members and others will agitate for more of a say in choosing his successor, a possible factor in whether Mr. Bush decides to go along with his removal.
 At the White House, Tony Fratto, a spokesman, said: ''Of course, President Wolfowitz has our full confidence'' and in dealing with the controversy over his involvement with Ms. Riza, ''he has taken full responsibility and is working with the executive board to resolve it.''
 The storm over Mr. Wolfowitz has been brewing for a week, following disclosures by the bank's staff association and the Government Accountability Project, an independent watchdog group, that Ms. Riza had received an unusually large raise. They questioned whether the proper procedures had been involved. 
 The controversy gained steam after the issue was mentioned by Al Kamen in his Washington Post column. The Financial Times has also disclosed details of the matter.
 Subsequently, Mr. Wolfowitz asserted that he had consulted the board and the bank's general counsel, the board's ethics committee director, and the human resources director to arrange the transfer.
 These officials then contradicted Mr. Wolfowitz, saying that while they supported the transfer and a raise, they were not involved in the amount. Alison Cave, chairwoman of the bank's staff association, said the amount of the raise and the procedures followed seemed to violate bank rules. Ms. Cave also said the records showed that Ms. Riza was to return to the bank at the higher salary level and be given a rating of ''outstanding'' in her performance reviews while with the foundation.
 Mr. Wolfowitz did not deny his involvement, but Thursday was the first day that evidence surfaced of his direct role. 
 Bank officials said they were somewhat mystified that the details of the transfer, worked out in 2005, did not get out until now. Some attributed it to the changed landscape in Washington.
 Mr. Wolfowitz has also been undeniably weakened by his recent tangles with the board.. 
 For example, as part of his broad anticorruption drive, Mr. Wolfowitz for a time suspended aid to India, Chad, Kenya and other countries without consulting the board. Uzbekistan's aid was suspended after it ousted American troops in 2005, leading to charges of political motivation.
 Last month, the bank adopted a new anticorruption policy that insisted that Mr. Wolfowitz consult board members, and it placed other restrictions on his ability to act. Resentment of Mr. Wolfowitz has extended to his two top aides, Robin Cleveland and Kevin Kellems, both of whom worked with him on defense matters in the Bush administration. Although some bank officials said the board might have decided to reprimand or dismiss one or both of them for the salary increase, that was no longer deemed a way out of the crisis for Mr. Wolfowitz.
 He also appeared a victim of his own declaration that he would bring a new era of accountability to the bank. He boasted that he had doubled the staff of the public integrity division so it could prosecute cases of graft against corporations and bank employees, stirring resentment throughout the bank that he saw them all as corrupt.
 Some bank officials, speaking anonymously so they could be candid, said that instead of ousting Mr. Wolfowitz, the board might prefer that he remain but in a weakened position.
 ''It's a coin toss right now whether Wolfowitz stays,'' one official said. ''But the board might prefer to have a weak president dangling by the thread so they can run the policies themselves for the next two years.''

HEADLINE: City's Catskill Water Gets 10-Year Approval

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
After an exacting review that lasted several years, federal environmental officials have concluded that New York City's upstate water supply is still so clean that it does not need to be filtered for another decade or longer. 
 The Environmental Protection Agency's announcement yesterday extending the city's current exemption from filtration requirements means that at least until 2017, New York City will not have to spend as much as $8 billion to build a filtration plant that would cost millions of dollars a year to operate.
About 90 percent of the one billion gallons used in the city each day comes from a system of huge reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains, 120 miles north of the city. The remaining 10 percent is drawn from closer reservoirs surrounded by development in Westchester County and will have to be filtered. A $2 billion filtration plant under construction in the Bronx is scheduled to be operational by 2012. 
 As a condition for the extension for the Catskill filtration exemption, the city has agreed to set aside $300 million over the next 10 years to acquire land upstate to restrain development that causes runoff and pollution. 
 The city will purchase land outright, or work with nonprofit land trusts to acquire easements that would keep land in private hands but prohibit them from being developed. 
 The city also committed itself to reducing the amount of turbidity, or cloudiness, in certain Catskill reservoirs by erecting screens, building baffles and using other technology to allow sediment to settle before water enters the final parts of the drinking water system. 
 Environmental advocates had expected the federal government to issue a five-year extension and were pleased that it turned out to be twice as long. 
 ''It represents a commitment among all of the parties -- the city, state and federal government -- to focus on the challenges of protecting the source water supply rather than pursue a costly and gargantuan construction project,'' said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
 New York is one of the few major water systems in the country that are exempt from the filtration requirements. They are evaluated every five years by federal officials to ensure that the water remains pure. 
 A standard five-year filtration avoidance renewal was about to be issued last month before Gov. Eliot Spitzer's office raised concerns about the size of the city's land acquisition program, according to people involved in the negotiations. 
 The city had proposed spending $89 million over five years, a significant decrease from the $30 million a year that it had allocated over the previous decade. 
 Judith A. Enck, the governor's deputy secretary for the environment, felt the proposal was not ambitious enough. ''We were hoping for a more significant commitment to land preservation,'' she said, especially in the agricultural sector. After reopening negotiations, the city promised to increase its commitment to acquiring land in exchange for a longer exemption from the filtering requirement. 
 ''The pieces shifted slightly and a new opportunity opened up,'' said Emily Lloyd, commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which runs the water system. ''There was also a lot of interest on the part of everyone seeing the land protection program going forward.''
 In the end, the city agreed to duplicate its successful land acquisition effort over the last decade. It applied $59 million that is left over from the previous $300 million commitment, and agreed to add an additional $241 million over 10 years. 
 As in the past, the city will acquire land when owners are willing to sell it, rather than through condemnation. 
 Ms. Lloyd said that the city had not set a goal for the number of acres to acquire, and that it would not establish yearly quotas as some advocates have suggested, because that could lead to inflated prices and purchases not critical to watershed protection. 
 In some major watersheds around the country, 100 percent of the land is publicly owned or otherwise protected from development. 
 Even with recent land purchases, New York City remains far behind other systems in protecting its watershed. Over the last 10 years, the city has added about 78,000 acres to its holdings in the Catskill and Delaware watersheds, bringing its total to about 114,000 acres. That, combined with state forestry land, means 31 percent of the one-million-acre watershed is currently protected. 
 Still, federal officials are confident that the city's water will continue to meet health standards and that the economies of communities in the watershed can be preserved.
 ''We realize that we can't take all the land out of circulation and that there is a need for both environmental protection and economic development,'' said Alan J. Steinberg, regional administrator of the federal environmental agency. ''This plan shows a way to balance them.'' 
 Walter Mugdan, the federal agency's director of environmental planning, said the city had until December to complete a review of proposed projects intended to clear up the Catskill water supply and reduce the amount of chemical additives that are now used to remove sediment.

HEADLINE: Rent Board Statistics Show Ups, Downs and Betweens

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
The Rent Guidelines Board, embarking once again upon the annual drama of deciding the size of the allowable rent increases for rent-stabilized apartments, reviewed yesterday a hodgepodge of statistics -- some of them contradictory -- intended to shed light on how much New Yorkers can afford to pay.
 At a meeting in Lower Manhattan, the board received its staff's yearly study of ''income and affordability,'' one of several reports it will consider before June 22, when it will decide the rent increases that landlords can claim for the city's one million rent-stabilized apartments. The report found unemployment down, wages up and gross city product growing; but it also found the household income of tenants in rent-stabilized apartments shrinking. 
Evictions were up by almost 8 percent in 2006, according to housing court statistics in the report. The number of homeless families moving into permanent housing was down, and fewer people on public assistance were being placed in jobs. At the same time, overall homelessness levels were down in 2005 and 2006, though they started to rise in late 2006, the report found.
 ''I'm trying to just make plain old sense of it,'' said Betty Phillips Adams, a longtime advocate for low-income housing who is one of the five public members on the nine-member board. It appeared to her, she said, that while the rents in stabilized apartments had been going up, the income of residents in those apartments was going down.
 But Magda L. Cruz, a real estate lawyer who is one of the board's two members appointed to represent building owners, said, ''All the indicators seem to be very, very positive.'' And she said to Ms. Adams, ''I'm taking the same data that you're looking at and seeing a much rosier picture.''
 When a member of the board's staff judiciously declined to draw conclusions from the data and suggested instead that the numbers spoke for themselves, Marvin Markus, the chairman, said, ''We give diplomacy classes for that.''
 The report, which examines housing affordability and tenant income in the New York City rental market, found that the city's economy grew in 2006 for the third straight year and that the gross city product (the total value of goods and services produced) grew by 3.7 percent. Unemployment dropped for the third year in a row, labor force participation rose slightly, and overall real wages for workers grew by 0.8 percent in 2005, the latest year for which there were statistics.
 But the report also found that income levels for tenants in rent-stabilized apartments dropped by 8.6 percent between 2001 and 2004, the latest figures that were used, and that nearly 23 percent of all renter households had incomes below the poverty line. Between 2002 and 2005, the median monthly contract rent for all tenants, excluding fuel and utility payments, rose by 20 percent.
 While the median ratio of gross rent to income in 2005 was 31.2 percent, nearly 29 percent of rental households spent more than half of their household income on rent. And while the total number of people on public assistance dropped between June 2005 and June 2006 for the second consecutive year, the number of new applications rose in the first four months of the 2007 fiscal year. Job placements among recipients of public assistance declined, and the number of food stamp recipients grew.
 Ms. Cruz asked the board's staff to find out what percentage of people on public assistance live in rent-stabilized apartments, as opposed to public housing.
 And Adriene L. Holder, a Legal Aid Society lawyer and one of the two board members appointed to represent tenants, said that the city's economy might appear robust but that many people working multiple jobs earned so little that they still qualified for food stamps and legal services.

HEADLINE: Can It Be? A Miracle On 2nd Ave.

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Here are some of the amazing things that are going to happen now:
 Writers with books to peddle and politicians with ambitions to nourish will set aside self-interest and not lend respectability to routinely offensive radio shows like the one that Don Imus had taken from him yesterday.
The Rev. Al Sharpton, self-anointed confessor to sinning white men, will finally apologize for the racial fires he ignited in the Tawana Brawley hoax. 
 Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will acknowledge that his failure to ensure adequate radio communications cost firefighter lives at the World Trade Center.
 The city's tabloid newspapers will renounce their preoccupation with Anna Nicole Smith and spend a sliver of their owners' billions to cover something only slightly less important, like the war in Iraq.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will announce that he doesn't always know what is best for New Yorkers.
 All this, and more, will happen because we live in the age of miracles. We saw the evidence yesterday. There was a groundbreaking for the Second Avenue subway. It doesn't get more miraculous than that. Now anything is possible, including behavior change that had seemed unimaginable.
 The notion of an underground railway along Second Avenue has roots in the Jazz Age. Across eight decades, there were at least three previous groundbreakings. Nothing came of them other than a few truncated tunnels to nowhere. For New Yorkers, the Second Avenue subway has been what a pennant is for the Chicago Cubs, what peace is for the Middle East, what wisdom is for General Motors: the unattainable.
 That reality was on the minds and tongues of officials who gathered yesterday for a ceremony in a section of tunnel about 40 feet below Second Avenue, at East 99th Street.
 ''For too many years, the Second Avenue subway was a bad joke,'' said Elliot G. Sander, the executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney borrowed from Langston Hughes to describe the subway line as ''a dream deferred.'' Gov. Eliot Spitzer drew on a different muse, Yogi Berra, to call the groundbreaking ''deja vu all over again, all over again, all over again.''
 But the Second Avenue subway is more than a laugh line. It is as good a symbol as any of New York's shrunken will to build on a grand scale whenever a project needs significant government involvement.
 Delay, for years, has been the city's default position. Sometimes the blame lies with financial troubles. Often, delay goes hand in hand with New York's favorite indoor sport: filing lawsuits. Whatever the reason, you have to wonder if the Latin words on the City Seal should be replaced with a quotation from Cicero: Nihil agere delectat. It is pleasant to do nothing.
 PICK a world city -- Paris, Tokyo, London -- and you will find that it has invested heavily to expand its mass transit system. Pick any city except New York, of course. Ideas come and ideas go, and nothing happens. For decades.
 That is true, most conspicuously, of the desperately needed Second Avenue subway. In its absence, the crowded East Side of Manhattan has only the trains running beneath Lexington Avenue. Some stations on the Lexington line, notably the one at 86th Street, are so jammed during rush periods that the real miracle is that riders have not been accidentally pushed en masse onto the tracks.
 Daniel L. Doctoroff, Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, suggested at yesterday's ceremony that more than a shortage of money kept the Second Avenue line in limbo. ''We lost our nerve,'' he said.
 But the bad old days are over, he and other officials insisted. This time, it's ''the real deal,'' Mr. Sander said. This time, said Peter S. Kalikow, the transportation authority's chairman, ''we do have the money.''
 We'll see. Things could still go wrong. For Gene Russianoff, a leader of the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' advocacy group, it will be no shock if financing for mass transit ''turns to guacamole.'' The city may yet be left with a runt of a line consisting of only a few stations -- a stubway, as some have called it.
 Ah, but why be glum? Maybe, as Ms. Maloney said, ''the fourth groundbreaking is the charm.'' And with a Second Avenue subway, all those other miracles -- an apologetic Mr. Sharpton, a remorseful Mr. Giuliani, a humble Mr. Bloomberg -- should fall seamlessly into place.

HEADLINE: College Administrator's Dual Roles Are a Focus of Student Loan Inquiry

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Walter C. Cathie, a vice president at Widener University, spent years working his way up the ranks of various colleges and forging a reputation as a nationally known financial aid administrator. Then he made a business out of it.
 He created a consulting company, Key West Higher Education Associates, named after his vacation home in Florida. The firm specializes in conferences that bring college deans of finance together with lenders eager to court them.
 The program for the next conference, slated for June at the Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards in Baltimore, lists seven lenders as sponsors. One sponsor said it would pay $20,000 to participate. Scheduled presentations include ''what needs to be done in Washington to fight back against the continued attacks on student lenders'' and the ''economics and ethics of aid packaging.''
 Investigations into student lending abuses are broadening in Washington and Albany. Mr. Cathie is still at Widener, and his roles as university official and entrepreneur have put him center stage, as a prime example of how university administrators who advise students have become cozy with lenders. 
 Widener, with campuses in Pennsylvania and Delaware, put Mr. Cathie on leave this week after New York's attorney general requested documents relating to his consulting firm and told the university that one lender, Student Loan Xpress, had paid Key West $80,000 to participate in four conferences.
 Mr. Cathie said in an interview yesterday that he still hoped to pull off the June event. ''Though who knows, if nobody comes, I guess it'll implode,'' he said.
 Several of the scheduled speakers said in interviews that they were canceling. 
 ''Yes, I've made money,'' he said, ''but I haven't done anything illegal. So I'd sure like this story to get out, that -- you know, Walter Cathie is a giving individual, that he's been very open, that he's always taken the profits and given back to students.'' 
 He said he had donated some consulting profits to a scholarship fund in his father's name at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked for 21 years. ''I've been in this business a long time, I've always been a student advocate, and I haven't done anything wrong,'' Mr. Cathie said. 
 Others say his case illustrates how some officials have become so entwined with lenders that they have become oblivious to conflicts of interest.
 ''The allegations made against Mr. Cathie and his institution point at the structural corruption of the student lending system,'' said Barmak Nassirian, a director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. 
 The system has become so complex, and involves so much money, Mr. Nassirian said, ''the temptation has become too great for many of the players to take a little bite for themselves.''
 The program for the conference in June lists corporate sponsors. One is Student Loan Xpress, whose president, according to documents obtained by the United States Senate, provided company stock to officials at several universities and at the Department of Education. 
 Another is Education Finance Partners Inc., which Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has accused of making payments to 60 colleges for loan volume. Neither company returned calls for comment. 
 The program lists as a speaker Dick Willey, chief executive of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Authority, a state loan agency facing calls for reform after reports that board members, spouses and employees have spent $768,000 on pedicures, meals and other such expenses since 2000. 
 Mr. Willey's spokesman, Keith New, said that Mr. Willey would not speak at the conference, but that the agency intended to sponsor it with a ''platinum level'' commitment of $20,000.
 Mr. Cathie came to Widener in 1997, initially as its dean of financial aid, after years at Allegheny College, Carnegie Mellon and Wabash College in Indiana, building a background in enrollment management and financial aid.
 In 1990, well into his tenure at Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Cathie and his boss, William Elliott, an admissions official who is today Carnegie Mellon's vice president for enrollment, began organizing annual conferences for college administrators to debate policy issues, both men said. 
 They named their conferences the Fitzwilliam Audit after the Fitzwilliam Inn in New Hampshire, where they were held, Mr. Cathie said. 
 Mr. Elliott and Mr. Cathie sponsored about 14 of them from 1990 through 2004, both men said. At first the conferences focused mostly on admissions issues, but they evolved to include student finance, and some bankers and other lenders began to attend, Mr. Elliott said. 
 The cost was about $400 per person, and bankers paid the same for their participation as any college official, Mr. Elliott said.
 During the 1990s, Mr. Cathie became increasingly focused on School as Lender, a program that allows universities to partner with banks to lend tuition money to graduate and professional students, and keep a portion of the lending profits. After arranging for Widener to participate in the program, Mr. Cathie began to market his experience as a consultant for other universities.
 With critics saying the School -as Lender arrangements put universities in the position of profiting from their students' indebtedness, Congress imposed a moratorium last year. But Mr. Cathie has been a passionate proponent. 
 Phyllis Hooyman, director of financial aid at Hope College in Michigan, said that in 2005, she saw him attack critics of the program at a convention of aid administrators in New York so vehemently that some audience members walked out. ''He just became visceral,'' she said.
 On his resume, Mr. Cathie reports that he has consulted for more than 40 colleges and universities, and several of his colleagues in university finance say he gained a national reputation through his consulting work.
 ''I knew he had a fairly successful consulting business,'' said Craig Munier, director of scholarships and financial aid at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, who has frequently disagreed with Mr. Cathie over policy issues. 
 ''But I was not aware that he was receiving payments of this kind,'' he said, referring to the payments by Student Loan Xpress to help sponsor Mr. Cathie's conferences. ''To me, $80,000 sounds like a lot of money.''
 In 2004, Mr. Cathie helped sponsor one of the last of the Fitzwilliam meetings, Mr. Elliott said, and about the same time, through Key West Higher Education Associates, Mr. Cathie sponsored the first of four conferences specifically for finance issues and School as Lender. 
 Mr. Elliott said that the Key West gatherings were fundamentally different because Mr. Cathie had, by the time he founded Key West, developed closer ties with the lenders.
 ''By the time Walt started Key West, he was working with the college lenders,'' Mr. Elliott said, ''and as far as I know, he might have been working with them to get colleges to become their clients.'' 
 Key West invited lenders to participate in the conferences with $20,000 corporate sponsorships, Mr. Cathie said. A top official at Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, has addressed at least one conference, and Student Loan Xpress helped sponsor four of them.
 Student Loan Xpress was also on the list of preferred lenders that Widener University recommends to its students. In a letter sent to Widener on Monday, Benjamin M. Lawsky, an aide to Mr. Cuomo, said that ''more than 90 percent of Widener students (and their parents)'' had taken loans through that company in recent years.
 ''Please advise this office as soon as possible whether Widener was aware that Mr. Cathie, its dean of financial aid, was running Key West,'' and that Student Loan Xpress had made $80,000 in payments to Key West, Mr. Lawsky wrote. 
 In the interview, Mr. Cathie said that he had fully disclosed his consulting activities, and his sponsorship of the conferences, to Widener University and that no one had ever objected.
 Daniel Hanson, a spokesman for Widener, declined to say when the university first learned of Mr. Cathie's Key West conferences, or to say why James T. Harris, Widener's president, is listed as a speaker for the one in June.

HEADLINE: A Tradition of Quality And Strong Brands Leads Export Growth

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: JENA, Germany 

 BODY:
For those seeking the elixir that has given new life to Germany's economy, a visit to this ancient university town in the eastern part of the country would be a good place to start.
 Jena is booming these days, as local companies like Jenoptik, which makes lasers and sensors, rack up orders from China, Russia, Europe and the United States. Even the surging euro, which is near record levels against the dollar and the yen -- making German exports more expensive in many foreign markets -- has not yet dented demand.
''There's no better proof that our products are superior than to have an indirect price increase of 30 percent without losing any sales,'' said Alexander von Witzleben, the self-confident chief of Jenoptik.
 Germany's transformation from Europe's sick man to its most stalwart performer is by now well entrenched. So sanguine are German executives about their future that many brush aside fears that a slowdown in the United States could knock their export-led recovery off track. 
 The American consumer may still be the main engine that drives the global economy, but Germany's advance -- it has been the world's largest exporter of goods for the last four years -- is propelled by other sources. It is one more sign that the rest of the world does not depend as much on the American economy as it once did. 
 Mr. von Witzleben said that Germany now exports more to Russia and the former Soviet satellites than it does to the United States. It ships nearly as much to Britain as to America, and its total exports within Europe are five times its shipments to the United States.
 ''Germany is projecting itself into the global economy, using its historic strengths of good quality and strong brands,'' said Nicolas Sobczak, senior European economist at Goldman Sachs in Paris. ''The simple fact that the German labor market is turning, that you have genuine job creation, shows that this is a genuine German renaissance, one that is independent of the U.S.,'' he continued.
 The numbers tell the story. Unemployment is dropping rapidly -- at 9.8 percent, it has fallen below double-digits for the first time since 2002 -- while investor confidence is soaring. An increase in the value-added tax in January, which economists once warned would torpedo the recovery, caused scarcely a ripple. 
 Germany's rise has set it apart from its European neighbors. While Italy struggles to regain its export momentum and France waits for a presidential election that could reshape its political and economic landscape, Germany has doggedly molded itself into a globally competitive player.
 The therapy was often brutal: waves of layoffs and cost-cutting during the lean years from 2002 to 2005. But having fended off steep wage increases at home and moved some manufacturing to lower-cost markets abroad, many German companies are reaping profits.
 The crucial factor in Germany's success, Mr. von Witzleben of Jenoptik said, is that it churns out what he calls global niche products: sophisticated high-technology tools that have worldwide but narrow markets. Fast-growing developing economies, like China's, are keener to buy such rarefied products than to make them. 
 Only Japan currently competes in many of these areas -- and perhaps not coincidentally, the Japanese economy is also humming.
 ''We are protected because the big Asian gorillas are not interested,'' Mr. von Witzleben said. ''If I were in the business of flat-panel television screens, it would be a different story.''
 Jenoptik, which was built on the ruins of an East German state enterprise, concentrates on making lasers used in medical devices and chip factories. It also builds sensors that steer satellites. 
 Of its $645 million in sales, 57 percent comes from exports. Its order book is running well ahead of last year, when it recorded a 7 percent gain over 2005. Germany has hundreds of medium-size companies like Jenoptik, and many of them are making similar inroads overseas. This success is proving difficult for other major European countries to replicate -- for reasons of politics, economic policy or the structure of their industries.
 ''Germany is pretty much out of sync with the rest of Europe, which is muddling through,'' Mr. Sobczak of Goldman Sachs said.
 Europe, of course, benefits from a resurgent Germany simply because of its size. It accounts for a fifth of the economic activity of the European Union, and its trade within Europe is booming.
 Last year, German exports to Poland rose 29 percent, while imports from Poland rose 23 percent. Such numbers have fueled the euro, which is trading at the highest levels against the dollar since March 2005.
 All told, the German economy should grow about 2 percent this year, according to public and private projections. That is less than the 2.7 percent it grew last year, when the world economy was more robust. But it is more than respectable, economists say, given that the European Central Bank has raised interest rates seven times since late 2005.
 There are, of course, caveats. Germany's consumers, rattled by layoffs, have yet to reopen their wallets and purses. Unless they start spending, economists say, the recovery could peter out.
 The euro's relentless rise will eventually start to bite. And a sharp slowdown in the United States would reverberate here, regardless of Germany's modest dependence on trans-Atlantic trade.
 ''If the U.S. consumer were to collapse because of the housing market, the Fed would cut rates and the dollar-euro rate would shoot up,'' Mr. Sobczak said. ''That could be a killer for Europe.''
 Still, Germany may be more insulated from the United States than other major European countries, like France and Spain. Those economies are being lubricated mainly by domestic consumption, which hinges on the vibrant housing market in both countries.
 A sharp decline in the American real estate market, economists say, would have an echo effect on France and Spain. In Germany, by contrast, housing prices are already depressed.
 Germany's renaissance is challenging other preconceptions about this economy -- Europe's largest and the third biggest in the world, behind the United States and Japan. While previous economic upturns have bypassed the depressed eastern part of the country, there is evidence that in pockets, at least, eastern Germany is also catching the favorable winds of trade and export.
 In Jena, for example, the unemployment rate declined to 11.1 percent in 2006, from 16.3 percent in 1998.
 In a recent ranking of the most competitive and economically promising regions of Germany, 3 of the top 20 cities are in the east: Dresden, Potsdam and Jena. The most competitive city is a longtime winner, Munich, according to the study by a Swiss consulting firm, Prognos.
 Eastern Germany's three southernmost states -- Saxony, Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt -- are growing faster than Germany as a whole, while the northern states in the east are languishing.
 As it regains its edge nationally, analysts say, Germany is becoming marked by ever sharper disparities between vibrant and struggling regions. While Jena's population is growing, rural regions not far from the city continue to lose people, particularly young women, to the West.
 In Jena, which was settled in the ninth century and was the site of one of Napoleon's famous battles in 1806, few people have the time to fret about troubles elsewhere. With two universities, a clutch of scientific research institutes and a park for high-tech start-ups, Jena bustles like a transplanted Silicon Valley.
 ''It's better to have successful cities, which can then reflect their success on to the rural areas,'' said Albrecht Schroter, a Protestant minister who is the mayor of Jena.
 For Mr. von Witzleben, these differences are not only inevitable but commercially advantageous. Salaries for engineers, he said, are 35 percent lower here than in Baden-Wurttemberg, where the main city, Stuttgart, is the prosperous home of DaimlerChrysler. 
 ''This is our big chance,'' said Mr. von Witzleben, 43, who speaks in rapid and idiomatic English.
 While Jenoptik has a union, it is not subject to the kind of industrywide contracts that cover workers at big companies like DaimlerChrysler. That gives it the flexibility, for example, to ask for overtime without making costly payments. Employees take part in a profit-sharing plan.
 Jenoptik has kept the vast majority of its production in Germany. While Mr. von Witzleben has contemplated opening a factory in China, he concluded it would not generate enough savings to justify the investment.
 Jena was the home of Carl Zeiss, the celebrated optical firm that moved its headquarters to West Germany after World War II. With its roots in the old Zeiss, Jenoptik has a tradition of precision engineering and technology that allows it to compete in elite fields.
 The company, for example, makes ''star sensors'' that navigate satellites in orbit. Boeing has installed Jenoptik sensors in its satellites that beam television signals to American homes.
 ''If I told you 15 years ago that this former Communist combine would become a preferred supplier to Boeing,'' Mr. von Witzleben said, ''you would have told me to stop drinking wine.''

HEADLINE: The Good Life at the Top of the Napa Valley

BYLINE: By AMY GUNDERSON

 BODY:
CALL it the ultimate wine-country fantasy: Buy a weekend retreat in Napa Valley and swaddle the house in cabernet vines, then start bottling the yield into vintages good enough to attract the praise of the finicky wine news media. Well, Randy and Lisa Lynch did just that that five years ago. The Lynches, who own an advertising agency in San Ramon, Calif., bought a three-bedroom vacation home in Calistoga, in Napa's far north, and planted 12 acres of cabernet, merlot and petit verdot grapes.
 ''We were searching for agricultural property, but what drew us to this area was its beauty,'' said Mr. Lynch, who said the place cost a few million dollars but declined to be more specific. He then took weekend wine recreation to a new level when he bought an existing winery, Bennett Lane, and started producing cabernet sauvignon and red and white blends. 
Life in Napa Valley is about relishing, well, the good life. Enjoying the outdoors, eating well and, of course, savoring a glass or two of wine are all part of the lure for the tourists who flock to this Northern California enclave as well as the second-home owners who put down weekend roots. The valley, even with its agricultural economy, still carries an air of elitism. This is, after all, where so-called cult wineries have waiting lists of people clamoring to shell out $300 for a single bottle of cabernet, Thomas Keller serves nine-course $240 tasting menus at the French Laundry, and an acre of good vineyard land can bring more than $275,000.
 But Napa Valley isn't just a stomping ground for rich wine buffs. Calistoga has long had a reputation as a spa town, attracting visitors who want to soak in its natural hot springs or sink into a vat of heated mud at one of the spas that line Lincoln Avenue downtown. While other Napa Valley towns, like Yountville and St. Helena, have atmospheres that lean toward wine-country quaint, Calistoga is less polished. ''It's less chi-chi than other towns,'' said Mike Silvas, an owner of Morgan Lane Real Estate, which has five offices in Napa Valley. ''For a long time, it was the cowboy town. It has moved away a bit from that. Now there are paved sidewalks. There used to be wooden walkways not so long ago.'' The Scene 
 Calistoga has its roots in water. Literally. The town's natural hot springs have attracted visitors to its spas since the 19th century. But this is Napa, after all, so weekend life is also about the wine. Rental bikes have padded carrying bags for wine, and restaurants that don't have full liquor licenses might serve margaritas made with Napa Valley towns at higher prices. ''There was absolutely nothing you would want to stay in,'' Ms. Bazinett said. ''For the type of house comparable to the lodge at Calistoga Ranch, you would really have to be a $2 million-plus buyer.'' Their share entitles them to a minimum of three weeks of stays a year at the home, where they ride bikes and hike through the property, attend wine tastings and store their wine in the resort's wine cave, which is carved into the side of a hill. percent of transactions last year were for properties of more than an acre, a larger percentage than in neighboring St. Helena. Annual real estate sales generally involved around 60 properties, but those numbers could rise with new construction. New permits for hookups to the town's sewer system for all development ceased until capacity could be increased. But in 2004, the town started to grant a limited number of permits each year. Last year, eight new homes hit the market. On the luxury end, there is another alternative. Calistoga Ranch, a hotel off the Silverado Trail operated by Auberge Resorts, has 10th shares of two-bedroom homes, complete with an outdoor living area centered around a grand fireplace. Susan and Bill Bazinett, from Danville, Calif., bought a share for $425,000 in 2005 after looking at full-ownership homes in other Pros 
 Compared with other desirable Napa Valley towns like St. Helena and Yountville, Calistoga offers more for your dollar. ''Calistoga affords buyers about 20 percent more bang for their buck relative to St. Helena,'' Ms. Greer said, noting that average square footage costs for a home in Calistoga run just under $500 contrasted with $625 a square foot in St. Helena. Cons 
 Since Calistoga is the northernmost town in Napa Valley, getting there on weekends means contending with traffic congestion caused by all the other weekenders. The drive on a Saturday up Highway 29 can be slow in summer and in the fall harvest season, which draws tourists and means more activity at wineries. Calistoga installed a new water system a few years ago, so homeowners pay more for their water than other towns in wine country The Real Estate Market 
 Calistoga real estate falls toward the bottom of Napa Valley prices. But don't expect to find a bargain. Mixed in with the older in town bungalows there are more secluded, and wallet-stunning wine country spreads like a $15,995,000 nine-bedroom house on 153 acres, and a three-bedroom house complete with a wine cellar and a tasting room of $6.800 million. There are options, though, for buyers seeking a more modest dwelling. 
 ''There are still quite a few fixer-uppers,'' said Sharon Carone, a co-owner of Calistoga Realty. A bungalow in town, ideal for someone who wants to park the car and walk to lunch or dinner, starts at $600,000. A similar home that needs work might be closer to $500,000, she said.
 These smaller homes can fly off the market. Earlier this year, a listing for a two bedroom Craftsman bungalow, under 1,000 square feet, went into contract within a week of going on the market at $545,000. ''Those kinds of properties get picked up very quickly,'' Mr. Silvas said. Buyers in Calistoga can also find bigger parcels. Some 40 percent of transactions last year were for properties of more than an acre, a larger percentage than in neighboring St. Helena.
 Annual real estate sales generally involved around 60 properties, but those numbers could rise with new construction. New permits for hookups to the town's sewer system for all development ceased until capacity could be increased. But in 2004, the town started to grant a limited number of permits each year. Last year, eight new homes hit the market.
 On the luxury end, there is another alternative.

Susan and Bill Bazinett, from Danville, Calif., bought a share for $425,000 in 2005 after looking at full-ownership homes in other Napa Valley towns at higher prices.

HEADLINE: Retailers Post Robust March Sales but See Harder Days

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
After robust sales in March, there are signs that consumers are already spending less. And problems like rising gasoline prices, a rougher housing market and the possibility of higher interest rates are likely to make the retail business even tougher in the months ahead. 
 Although many stores reported yesterday that they surpassed expectations last month, several warned of disappointments ahead.
Wal-Mart Stores, whose customers cut back on shopping when gas prices were high last year, said April's selling environment would be tough, while Federated Department Stores said first-quarter sales would be at the low end of expectations. 
 The arrival of warmer weather helped retailers like Wal-Mart, and an early Easter also bolstered business, though it will depress April's results. Other winners for March included Costco Wholesale, J. C. Penney and the teenage apparel retailer Pacific Sunwear of California.
 According to the International Council of Shopping Centers-UBS, same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, posted a 5.9 percent gain, exceeding estimates for 4 percent to 5 percent. Same-store sales are the industry standard for measuring a retailer's health. 
 Michael P. Niemira, chief economist at the council, expects same-store sales growth to be no more than 1 percent this month, in part because the weather turned cooler.
 A bigger worry is gasoline prices; there are predictions of $3-a-gallon gasoline nationwide by summer.
 Wal-Mart same-store sales were up 4 percent, above the 1.6 percent estimate from Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
 But Thomas Schoewe, Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, warned that ''while the earnings guidance is still attainable, given the tough sales environment for the April period, it will be a challenge.'' Wal-Mart said April same-store sales would range from unchanged to a 2 percent decline.
 Federated, which operates Macy's and Bloomingdale's, posted a modest same-store sales increase of 2.3 percent, below the 3.3 percent estimate from Wall Street. 
 Among stronger performers, Penney had a 10.6 percent gain in same-store sales business, above Wall Street's forecast of 7.5 percent.
 Gap Inc., which has struggled for months, had a successful March, reporting that same-store sales rose 6 percent, beating Wall Street expectations for a 1.1 percent decline.

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Hints at a Rate Increase in June

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 12 

 BODY:
With Europe seeming to shrug off the recent rise in the euro, the European Central Bank on Thursday fed widespread expectations that it would raise interest rates again in June 
 An increase then would be its eighth since it began to tighten credit in December 2005.
Sticking to a policy of ''no surprises,'' the bank left its key rate unchanged at 3.75 percent at its monthly meeting here. Its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said the bank would monitor inflation very closely -- a phrase interpreted by financial markets to mean a rate increase in two months.
 ''I would not say anything today that would be aimed at changing expectations for the month of June,'' Mr. Trichet said, adding that the bank does not, as a policy, commit itself to any course in advance.
 Mr. Trichet resolutely declined to comment on the recent rally in the euro against the dollar and the Japanese yen. Economists said that this reflected the bank's relative lack of concern that a buoyant currency would derail Europe's growth by hobbling its exports in important foreign markets.
 ''They're not particularly worried about the euro,'' said Holger Schmieding, an economist at Bank of America in London. ''It's a sign of confidence at the E.C.B. that Europe can grow on its own -- that its growth no longer hinges critically on the U.S., even if the U.S. is still important.''
 With a rate increase all but confirmed, the euro briefly rose above $1.35 against the dollar in trading in New York. The euro was stable in trading against the yen, but at near-record levels.
 Mr. Trichet did repeat statements by European officials that the yen should reflect the state of the newly robust Japanese economy. The yen's weakness has caused tension between Europe and Japan.
 But the euro's rally has not elicited a chorus of anguished voices from European politicians, or calls for a response from the European Central Bank, as was the case with previous currency swings.
 ''What makes this euro rally stand out from the rallies in 2003 and 2004 is that the euro zone is showing a dose of domestic growth,'' said Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign exchange analyst at CMC Markets in New York. ''The euro zone is being driven by internal demand.''
 Mr. Laidi said that there was little reason to expect a halt in the euro's upward march. On Thursday, three major economic institutes, in Germany, France and Italy, raised their projections for European growth in the first quarter of 2007, saying growth would accelerate.
 ''The key is whether the euro goes above $1.36 before the end of this month,'' Mr. Laidi said. ''Definitely, that might jolt Trichet into making some kind of comment about exchange rates.''
 At a news conference here, Mr. Trichet appeared anything but jolted. He noted with satisfaction that in its latest World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund projected that Europe would grow at roughly the same rate as the United States and Japan this year.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL and ISMAIL KHAN; Carlotta Gall reported from Islamabad, and Ismail Khan from Wana, South Waziristan.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, April 12 

 BODY:
After some of the heaviest fighting in two years in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan's generals are claiming initial success in their latest efforts to combat foreign militants and regain some control in one of the most lawless regions.
 President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged Thursday for the first time that the Pakistani military had been involved in the recent heavy fighting in the tribal area of South Waziristan and said that nearly 300 foreign militants had been killed. 
The commander of Pakistani troops in the tribal areas, Maj. Gen. Gul Muhammad, put the figure much lower, at 150 to 200, in a briefing for journalists in Wana, the main town of South Waziristan, on Wednesday. By some estimates only dozens have been killed. Foreign journalists are not permitted to visit the tribal areas, except a few selected ones under strictly controlled visits, and there has been no independent verification of casualty figures.
 The military does appear to have gained more control in the immediate region of Wana, and General Muhammad said the progress made in clearing the area of foreign militants -- mainly Uzbeks and other Central Asians who have been allied with Al Qaeda -- would serve as a model to use in the rest of the region, including the equally lawless North Waziristan next door.
 Pakistan has been under heavy pressure from the United States and NATO countries to contain the spreading lawlessness of its tribal areas which Pakistani, Afghan and foreign militants have been using to wage an expanding insurgency across the border in Afghanistan. South Waziristan had become a Taliban state in all but name after a peace deal with militants in 2005 gave them freedom to operate while the military withdrew to its barracks. 
 The Pakistani military abandoned broad-scale military operations in favor of negotiated peace deals with the militants over the past two years. The strategy has been criticized for allowing militants a haven to regroup and increase their attacks across the border in Afghanistan and possibly farther afield. The military has now set upon a third way to tackle the problem of militancy in its tribal regions, backing local armed tribesmen who have turned against the foreigners and their local protectors. 
 A rift emerged between a local commander and Uzbek fighters in his region in November and the military, and intelligence agencies admit they have sought to exploit the growing animosity among the local tribespeople toward the foreign militants, whom they accused of thuggery, robberies and murders. 
 ''It's indigenous and it's picking up momentum,'' General Muhammad said. ''It's a homegrown affair.'' 
 In a speech at a military conference in Islamabad on Thursday, President Musharraf said: ''The people of South Waziristan now have risen against the foreigners. They have killed about 300 of them, and they got support from the Pakistan Army. They asked for support.'' 
 Military and paramilitary forces have moved in and occupied strategic hilltops and ridges in several areas that were until now controlled by militants in Shin Warsak, Kalosha and Tora Gola, General Muhammad said. The immediate Wana region was almost clear of Uzbek militants, and tribal volunteers were chasing them in Nandran, a mountainous area near the Afghan border. 
 Even as it explains the recent developments as a homegrown uprising, the government is claiming credit for the shift in tribal dynamics as a result of its three-pronged strategy, referred to by General Muhammad as coercive deployment, political engagement and socio-economic development, to ''win over the hearts and minds of the people.''
 Yet it remains unclear whether all is as the military says. Promised meetings with members of the political administration of South Waziristan and with tribal elders did not materialize on the journalists' visit to the region Wednesday.
 And while the military has tried to depict the fighting as local tribespeople moving against the foreigners, in fact it has been led by a Pakistani Taliban commander, Maulavi Nazir, who has close links to the Afghan Taliban and Arab members of Al Qaeda. One of his accusations against the Uzbek group of militants has been that they did not want to fight foreign troops in Afghanistan, but preferred to attack pro-American Pakistanis, whether tribal elders or government members. 
 Answering a volley of questions regarding Mr. Nazir, General Muhammad said only that the militant commander was subservient to his tribe and not above it. 
 Hundreds of foreign militants remain in the region, probably including the leaders of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al- Zawahri, officials admit. ''It will take time,'' the general said. ''There are no quick fixes in this war. We are here for a long haul.''

HEADLINE: Defense Chiefs of NATO and Other Allies to Press for More Trainers for Afghan Forces

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12 

 BODY:
Defense ministers from NATO nations and other allies meeting Thursday in Quebec agreed to press for a new deployment of 3,400 trainers for the Afghan police and armed forces, increasing by almost one-tenth the international military commitment there.
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said his discussions with counterparts whose nations contribute forces to southern Afghanistan, which has taken the brunt of the fighting with Taliban insurgents, focused on ''enhancing the capability of the Afghan Army and police.'' 
He said the assembled defense ministers had discussed whether European nations that had not committed combat troops to Afghanistan might pick up the bulk of the expanded training mission. As an example, he suggested mounting an effort similar to a European Union training unit that had been proposed for service in Kosovo.
 ''One of the things we talked about was approaching other Europeans about filling some of those positions, because it's a training job, and they have some real expertise in that area,'' Mr. Gates said aboard his plane on the way back to Washington.
 ''Where you have nations that are not willing to put combat troops in, it is an area where those who are not willing to do that or able to do that may be able to pick up the slack in this area,'' Mr. Gates added. ''Those of us who are contributing most of the combat forces don't have additional forces available.''
 Mr. Gates did pledge that American forces would fill some of the new training jobs, about 60 percent of which will be dedicated to improving the Afghan police and the rest to training the Afghan Army.
 The Quebec session, which brought together defense ministers from Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States, with lower-level officials invited from Estonia and Romania, was requested by Canada, which lost eight soldiers in southern Afghanistan just this week, its highest rate of combat deaths since the Korean War.
 The NATO-led security and development effort in Afghanistan today consists of 35,000 troops from 26 NATO nations and 11 other allies. Of those, 15,000 are from the United States. The American military has another 11,000 troops in Afghanistan carrying out separate counterterrorism and training missions.
 But some of the allies contributing troops to Afghanistan have said their forces may only be deployed to parts of the country where the violence is lower than in the south or in the east. And some of those foreign units operate under restrictions concerning the types of missions they are allowed to undertake.
 After the talks in Quebec, the Canadian defense minister, Gordon O'Connor, told reporters that he and his counterparts ''talked about how we could coordinate our efforts better in the south, how we could better train the Afghan Army and the police, how we could coordinate our efforts in reconstruction.''
 Mr. Gates said that despite the complexity, and violence, encountered while securing and rebuilding southern Afghanistan, the spiritual home of the Taliban, he sensed no lessening of commitment from the allied ministers.
 ''I think all of us anticipate that this is a years-long process, and I didn't hear any flagging on the part of anybody,'' Mr. Gates said. ''We realize that creating these Afghan capabilities is going to take time.''
 Likewise, Mr. Gates said, there is agreement among the allies on the broad strategy for the mission in Afghanistan.
 ''I think even those that prefer to focus their forces and their efforts more on the development and reconstruction side acknowledge that there has to be a secure environment in which they can do that,'' Mr. Gates said. ''They just don't want to do it. But I think there is a general understanding that it has to be both.''

HEADLINE: Who's Going to Solve the China Question?

BYLINE: JAMES KANTER


HIGHLIGHT: China will replace the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases by the end of the decade. But it's far from clear what China's responsibilities should be in curbing global warming.

China will replace the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases by the end of the decade. But it's far from clear what China's responsibilities should be in curbing global warming. Part of what makes the China Question so thorny is the notion of global equity: Developed nations like the United States probably are responsible for about three-quarters of the greenhouse gases already polluting the atmosphere; Moreover the average American will pollute far more than the average Chinese for years to come. So why should developing nations like China be penalized when the Chinese are just as eager as some 19th century Americans to escape poverty and join the middle classes? The China Question is so delicate that many leading policymakers already back a fledgling system whereby the developed world effectively bribes the Chinese and others to clean up their factories and utilities by using a carbon credits system overseen by the United Nations. That's the solution British economist Nicholas Stern favored during an interview with the IHT earlier this year in Davos, Switzerland. New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, in an op-ed piece published in Saturday's IHT, outlines another way to get China down the path to shrinking its carbon footprint. Friedman wants rich-world governments -- and the United States government in particular -- to use taxes and subsidies to lower the price of clean technologies so poorer nations can afford to make a green switch. "That's how you get scale innovation at the China price," Friedman writes (and explains in a video). Do you think the kinds of policies advocated by Stern and Friedman are going to help solve the China Question? Or do these policies merely let China pollute as much as it wants while the developed world does the heavy lifting? Might other policies -- such as heavier taxes on some goods from heavy polluters like China -- actually do more to change behavior and curb emissions?

HEADLINE: Lottery Used To Narrow Work Visa Petitions

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Swamped by petitions for work visas from highly educated or skilled foreigners, immigration authorities have conducted a lottery for the first time to determine which ones will be considered, federal officials announced yesterday.
 A computer randomly selected 65,000 petitions from among the 123,480 that had passed a preliminary check for eligibility, said Shawn Saucier, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees the visas.
 The lottery, conducted Thursday, brought cries of pain from technology companies and immigration lawyers around the country. They lamented the limit that Congress has imposed on the high-skilled visas, known as H-1B, and the luck-of-the-draw method to make the cut. 
 ''The people we need to contribute to our innovation economy are being subjected to a perverse form of 'Wheel of Fortune,' '' said Robert Hoffman, vice president for government and public affairs at the Oracle Corporation, the information software giant based in Redwood Shores, Calif.
 The immigration authorities resorted to the lottery after the annual ceiling for the visas was exceeded by the cascade of petitions it received on April 2, the first day of the application period. In all, the agency received 133,000 packages with visa petitions on April 2 and 3, more than double the 65,000 high-skilled visas that are available for the year beginning Oct. 1.
 For the past three years, petitions for the visas have far exceeded the cap. But this year was the first time that the cap was surpassed on the first day, triggering the lottery, according to the agency's regulations.
 The H-1B visas are three-year work visas for immigrants who have at least a bachelor's degree, either from an American or a foreign university. Immigrants seeking the visas generally are young adults who are software and computer engineers, construction engineers, doctors and nurses, mathematicians and scientists.
 In 2005, the last year for which figures are available, about 40 percent of the visas went to immigrants from India. About 54 percent of the immigrants who received the visas that year had a master's degree, a doctorate or a professional degree. High-skilled visa holders can extend for another three years before they must return home. They can also apply to become permanent residents.
 With about half of this year's applicants eliminated in the lottery, thousands of immigrants waiting overseas for jobs and foreign students graduating from American colleges have been left in limbo.
 ''Many members of the Class of 2007 effectively received deportation orders and lost their post-graduation jobs last week,'' said an April 9 editorial in The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper. Harvard seniors would not be able to apply for this year's high-skilled visas until after they graduated in June.
 For three years after 2001, the visa limit was raised by Congress to 195,000. It reverted to the 65,000 in 2003. The immigration agency is still accepting petitions for H-1B visas from those with advanced degrees from American universities, who do not fall under the limit of 65,000.
 Some critics of the visas argue that American companies use them to hire foreign software programmers with unexceptional skills who may be willing to work for lower wages than Americans.
 ''If you wanted to find a labor shortage, you would look at the data and ask if there has been dramatic wage growth among those workers,'' said Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors curbing immigration. ''We just don't find evidence that wages are rising.''
 Corporate executives and lawyers said that employers seeking visas for immigrants must demonstrate to the Department of Labor that no American workers are available.
 ''There are penalties, and the Department of Labor really is enforcing these rules,'' said Angelo A. Paparelli, an immigration lawyer. ''So where's the harm?''
 Several lawyers warned that businesses that could not hire skilled foreign employees might move abroad.
 Mr. Hoffman said Oracle hired 100 to 125 new H-1B visa workers each year, mainly software engineers, many of them foreign graduates of engineering programs in American colleges. ''The competition for this talent is global,'' he said.
 Mr. Saucier said Citizenship and Immigration Services would review the petitions to decide whether the applicants who survived the lottery met the requirements for approval.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 18, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a lottery by immigration authorities to select applicants for 65,000 visas for highly skilled foreign workers misstated the requirements employers must meet in order to sponsor the visas, known as H-1B. For most of these visas, employers must affirm to the Labor Department that they will pay the immigrant at least the prevailing wage for the job and that hiring the immigrant would not negatively affect the labor conditions of United States workers in similar jobs. Employers do not have to show that no American workers were available for the job.

HEADLINE: Sales Abroad Propping Up The Economy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
A weakening economy is getting some relief from abroad as American companies step up their sales to foreigners, the latest data, released yesterday, suggests.
 The government reported both the trade deficit for February, which shrank slightly, and the Producer Price Index for March, measuring the prices of merchandise sold to wholesalers and retailers. The prices were flat across an array of products, except for food and energy.
 The latest numbers were meaningful, economists said, not on their own, but in the context of the last year. The United States appears to be gradually transferring to Europe and Japan its role as the locomotive for global growth. 
 ''Europe and Japan, and also most of the developing world, are growing more quickly than we are, and now we are finding ways to get a lift from their growth,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ''It's the opposite of what happened for a decade.''
 The Producer Price Index fit this pattern. The overall increase was 1 percent, down from 1.3 percent in February, but well above the average monthly increase of 0.4 percent over the last six months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. 
 The rise, however, was entirely because of an increase in petroleum and food prices; elsewhere in the economy weakening demand appears to be taking pressure off prices. The more expensive food reflected the increasing price of corn, now that so much of the crop goes into ethanol production. Other than food and energy, there was no increase at all.
 ''That takes away a little of the sting from earlier readings on core inflation,'' said Edward McKelvey, senior United States economist at Goldman Sachs, ''and it is certainly consistent with a slowing economy.''
 While the core Producer Price Index has risen at an average monthly rate of just 0.2 percent since October, it jumped by 0.4 percent in February. 
 The trade deficit narrowed in February, to $58.4 billion from a revised $58.9 billion in January, the Commerce Department reported. That was the smallest monthly deficit since November. Exports and imports both fell, but imports more than exports, mainly because of a midwinter drop in oil prices.
 The export decline, although involving such basic items as aircraft and machinery, struck Brian A. Bethune, an economist at Global Insight, as ''anomalous, given that the fall in the value of the dollar makes a lot of our goods more competitive.''
 Imports, which totaled $182.43 billion in February, continued to swamp exports at $124.99 billion that month. But over the most recent year, the dollar value of exports has risen nearly twice as much as the dollar value of imports. 
 ''That is the key,'' Mr. Bethune said, citing in particular rising exports of aircraft and other capital goods at a moment when capital investment is shrinking in this country. 
 Given the recent easing of the trade deficit, Mr. Bethune and other economists argue that trade is less likely to pull down the nation's economic growth rate, as it occasionally did last year. That is an important contribution, given that growth appears to be declining from a 2.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year to less than 2 percent in the just-completed first quarter, according to many estimates.
 Even China offered some relief last month. The deficit with that country fell 13.3 percent, to $18.4 billion -- a bit of relief that in Mr. Paulsen's view will momentarily take some pressure off China to agree to demands for a faster devaluation of the yuan, among other measures. 
 ''They can point to the February number as evidence of progress,'' Mr. Paulsen said.
 Still, despite the modest recent improvement in America's overall trade deficit -- $117.3 billion in January and February, down from $129.4 billion in those months last year -- the long-term imbalance continues to discourage many trade experts.
 ''I see nothing on the horizon that will reduce the deficit significantly,'' said Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, which favors tariffs as a remedy. ''Growth here is slowing, and there has been some pickup in growth overseas. And you have a weaker dollar, which makes our exports less expensive. But these are not enough.'' 
 The mild producer price increase suggested to some economists that the Federal Reserve is not likely to raise interest rates for the foreseeable future, to avoid deepening a slowdown that is already evident. 
 Mr. Bethune noted, for example, that prices of capital equipment fell 0.1 percent last month, reinforcing other evidence that American companies are cutting back their investments in new equipment, and this on top of a weaker housing sector.
 ''It is reassuring not to have this pipeline pressure,'' Mr. Bethune said, referring to the drop in capital equipment prices. ''When companies have to pay more for machinery and equipment, there is the potential for this extra cost to feed through to the prices of final goods and services.''

HEADLINE: In Illinois, Hunters Discover Ideal Setting for Trophy Bucks

BYLINE: By TOM VAUGHN

DATELINE: PITTSFIELD, Ill. 

 BODY:
The natural abilities of the United States' most widely distributed big-game animal, the white-tailed deer, are amazing. It can leap tall fences, see small movement from a great distance, and even tell if a tiny, drifting scent belongs to the same farmer who is out in his fields regularly or to one of the human predators who infiltrate the woods every fall.
 A deer can also cause a debilitating increase in the pulse of an archery deer hunter, especially when it eases into view like royalty with a crown of antlers, massive in diameter and spread. And, if such a trophy buck resides in a region where there are many more like him, it can also change a local economy. This may be the animal's most impressive feat. 
The deer have done just that for Pike County in west-central Illinois. 
 Every truly dedicated deer hunter has heard stories about huge bucks taken from Pike County. It leads all Illinois counties every year in total deer taken. It has also led the nation in number of submissions to the Boone and Crockett Club record book for nontypical bucks for the past 10 years. 
 Brenda Middendorf is the coordinator of Access Illinois Outdoors, which she said was ''similar to a dating service'' for landowners with hunting property and hunters wishing to find land to hunt on for a fee. She said the fame of the area's large-sized ungulates has helped raise total land value in the county an estimated $80 million.
 There are 58 registered outfitters and 260 guides in the county, and Middendorf said any business operator who could conceivably serve a tourist would say that hunting season makes their economic year. 
 Tim Krumwiede, a district wildlife biologist for Region IV of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, said the bucks' presence in Pike County was no mystery. Trophy deer are produced by outstanding habitat that provides good nutrition and great cover, combined with factors that reduce the loss of the animals before they have a chance to grow big. 
 The central latitudes of the United States have increasingly milder winters that are strong enough to allow deer to grow large, Krumwiede said, but not harsh enough to reduce buck numbers. The rich agricultural production of this region does not hurt, either. 
 Pike County lies in what hunters call the Golden Triangle, formed by the confluence of two river systems, the Illinois and the Mississippi. The Illinois River flood plain on the east and the Mississippi's on the west are bordered by bluffs, creating an intervening topography of ridge tops with small pasture and crop fields. They are bordered by draws and hills of quality hardwood timber, especially in the southern part of the county. The steep hills and brushy hollows allow deer to hide or escape easily and, with the forest browse and acorns, create ideal deer territory.
 Pike County also benefits from factors that are not influenced by nature, like sound management. Many outfitters have adopted restrictions on the antler size of bucks harvested and have incorporated wildlife-specific foods plots that last through the year. 
 As Pike County's reputation among hunters has spread throughout the country, access to land has become an issue. Land leases and purchases have boomed, with more and more people wanting to grow and hunt trophy deer --then profit by offering hunting opportunities to others. Some outfitters are based in other states, and a huge influx of nonresident hunters occurs every fall. 
 Chamber of Commerce members are pleased, landowners supplement their income by leasing land for $70 to $90 an acre and some residents have become millionaires by selling their property. But the surge of outsiders has its drawbacks. Cathy Chamberlain of Nebo, who rents and leads her horses for a local guest lodge, expressed an increasingly common sentiment here: The locals are feeling crowded by hunters from other places who are flocking to Pike County. 
 ''My sons used to hunt this land,'' she said, referring to the 1,200 acres owned by the lodge. ''Now, they have about 30 acres they can hunt.''
 Jeremy Priest of Pittsfield, a hunter and taxidermist, said he grew up freely hunting his grandfather's land. ''Now I have to lease 300 acres of land from my own grandfather to be able to hunt,'' he said. ''I'll get a guide's license and take other hunters to help with the cost.''
 Despite the frustration of limited land access, no one here is hoping the coveted deer population goes away. After all, this is a region that takes its hunting seriously. The first Friday of deer season when firearms are permitted is a school holiday.

HEADLINE: Financially, Solar Power for the Home Is a Tough Sell

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
With a $2,000 federal tax credit and generous rebates from states like New Jersey and California, it has never cost less to install a solar power system. 
 And it still makes no economic sense. You might want photovoltaic solar panels to generate your own electricity out of a belief that you will save the planet. But, as is the case with hybrid vehicles, you certainly should not do it to save money.
An online calculator (www.findsolar.com/index.php?page=rightforme) created by solar power advocates and the Department of Energy demonstrates just how hard it is to justify the switch. 
 For instance, a homeowner in New Jersey whose electric bill is an above-average $100 a month could buy a system for about $54,000, it says. After the state rebate of $18,468 and the $2,000 federal tax credit, the system would cost $33,532.
 And how many years will it take before you see any savings? From 11 to 22 years. The average payback is 14 years, said Polly N. Shaw, a senior regulatory analyst with the California Public Utilities Commission.
 The calculator provides a lot of other information, but it doesn't figure in the $1,580 a year your cash outlay would have been making had you left the money in a conservative investment like a government bond. That's more than enough to cover the monthly electric bill.
 As electricity costs -- or the incentives -- go up, the numbers start to make more sense. A person living in the scorching desert of California, where the financial incentives are said to be the most enticing, and paying $250 a month to stay cool would break even in three to eight years.
 You can find what rebates governments and utilities are offering at a Web site set up by the North Carolina Solar Center and the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, www.dsireusa.org.
 ''At this stage, you don't put in photovoltaic panels for economic reasons,'' said John Anderson, senior principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy consultant and research organization in Snowmass, Colo. He said the energy generated by utilities for 10 cents a kilowatt- hour held a distinct advantage over solar power that cost 20 cents to 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. 
 Ron Kenedi, vice president of the solar energy solutions group at Sharp, a major maker of solar panels, said, ''The utility rates -- that's who we compete against.'' 
 The other variable, the cost of the solar panels, has not been dropping much. An incentive program two years ago in Germany distorted the market and created worldwide shortages of the silicon-based devices. Demand is still ahead of supply, which means prices have not declined. 
 Solar power advocates are urging Congress to make the tax credit even sweeter. It is set to expire at the end of the year, but until then your federal income tax can be sliced by a third of the cost of a system, up to $2,000. The lobbyists want the cap removed, as it is for businesses installing solar panels.
 (If you made energy improvements in 2006, whether they are expensive solar systems or just insulating the attic, you can claim them on your tax return due Tuesday.) 
 Until Congress makes any change, the most compelling argument you will hear from advocates and installers is how solar power will increase the value of your home. Many pointed to a 1998 study by ICF Consulting (''Evidence of Rational Market Valuations for Home Energy Efficiency,'' www.icfi.com/Markets/Community--Development/doc--files/apj1098.pdf) that concluded that every $1 reduction in annual energy costs would increase a home's value by $20.73. 
 ''If their reduction in monthly fuel bills exceeds the after-tax mortgage interest paid to finance energy efficiency investments, then they will enjoy positive cash flow for as long as they live in their homes and can also expect to recover their investment in energy efficiency when they sell their homes,'' the study's authors wrote. 
 The calculator cited above incorporates that theory. It said the New Jersey property would increase $11,000 to $21,000 in value. The California property, with a $22,412 solar system, would be worth $21,000 to $49,000 more. If true, appreciation like that would easily justify the expenditure. 
 The finest kitchen renovation with a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Italian mosaic backsplash and black slate countertops would never yield that kind of return. But like all the estimates of what a home improvement yields, it is only a guess.

HEADLINE: If It's a Merger, 2nd Thoughts Should Follow

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE term ''merger mania'' may be more than a snappy description of the recent pace of corporate deal-making. It could be an astute diagnosis of a malady spreading through boardrooms and financial markets. 
 Research shows that mergers are often poorly timed, with the volume of deals reaching a crest just ahead of peaks in the stock market. And there is little evidence that they improve the fortunes of shareholders -- except those of the investment banks that instigate the transactions.
 The value of global mergers and acquisitions totaled $1.2 trillion in the first quarter, according to the research firm Dealogic. That is the highest amount ever and 23 percent more than the comparable figure for the 2006 quarter. 
 American deals accounted for $442 billion, down a bit from the fourth quarter and a shade below the record set in the first quarter of 2000, when the technology boom began to go spectacularly bust. 
 The feverish activity could help the stock market -- for a while. Because cycles in mergers and acquisitions tend to lead the market averages, every transaction may be buying a bit more time for the bulls, said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup Investment Research. 
 But what's in it for merger participants themselves? The fact that the pace of corporate coupling increases after asset prices have soared might make you wonder. 
 So might the de-merger mania that is occurring alongside the wave of takeovers; some companies created through mega-mergers are effectively undoing those transactions or thinking seriously about it. Altria recently cut loose Kraft, which it acquired in the 1980s in the largest corporate combination until then, and DaimlerChrysler is thought to be eager to dispose of its American half, even if it means accepting far less than the $36 billion it paid for Chrysler in 1998. 
 The present run of mergers is fueled by very low yields on junk debt, which can make the numbers work out when they otherwise would not. As long as the financing cost is less than the anticipated cash flow from the combined corporate entity, a merger may seem reasonable. How the businesses will fit together and make their way in the marketplace is almost beside the point. 
 Mergers often fail to produce expected benefits because the assumptions used to justify the transactions are too optimistic and the sale prices prove too high, said Alan Brown, head of investment at Schroder Investment Management in London. ''All the evidence points to most deals not being good for the investor in the acquiring company, at least in the short to medium term,'' Mr. Brown said. 
 Data compiled by Thomson Financial confirms Mr. Brown's observation. Share prices of 14 of the 20 companies executing the largest mergers last year fell in the 90 days after the transactions were announced. Of the 15 deals that had a 180-day history since announcement, stocks of 8 of the acquirers had declined. 
 When deciding whether to invest in a company involved in a big deal, the critical factors are the reasons for undertaking the transaction and the price, Mr. Brown said. 
 ''One has to look for a really compelling logic for the deal and then that the price is reasonable,'' he advised. ''Too many deals founder not on the logic but on the price that the seller has managed to extract.'' 
 Mergers that work best often involve two similar businesses that are joined to try to achieve economies of scale and added commercial clout, like Exxon and Mobil, Nationsbank and Bank of America, and Procter & Gamble and Gillette. 
 ANOTHER common rationale is to create more profit opportunities by merging companies that seem to be two sides of a coin, usually a business that sells one type of content and a second that distributes it. Time Warner and AOL, and Travelers and Citibank, are examples. These deals often reap fewer gains, perhaps because participants overestimate the potential for cross-selling. 
 For Mr. Levkovich, the value of a merger depends on the deal makers more than the deal. If a company's executives do a good job adding value for shareholders generally, chances are the transactions they arrange will do the same. And if the people in charge are weak, a big merger is unlikely to make up for their deficiencies. 
 ''Good management trumps what may seem to be questionable deals,'' he said. ''In contrast, seemingly obvious deals could collapse into bankruptcies with bad management.''

HEADLINE: More Con Than Neo

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Usually, spring in Washington finds us caught up in the cherry blossoms and the ursine courtship rituals of the pandas.
 But this chilly April, we are forced to contemplate the batrachian grapplings of Paul Wolfowitz, the man who cherry-picked intelligence to sell us a war with Iraq.
 You will not be surprised to learn, gentle readers, that Wolfie in love is no less deceptive and bumbling than Wolfie at war. 
 Proving he is more con than neo, he confessed that he had not been candid with his staff at the World Bank. While he was acting holier than thou, demanding incorruptibility from poor countries desperate for loans, he was enriching his girlfriend with tax-free ducats.
 He has yet to admit any real mistakes with the hellish war that claimed five more American soldiers as stunned Baghdad residents dealt with the aftermath of bombings of the Iraqi Parliament, where body parts flew, and of a bridge over the Tigris, where cars sank.
 But he admitted on Thursday that he'd made a mistake when he got his sweetheart, Shaha Ali Riza, an Arab feminist who shares his passion for democratizing the Middle East, a raise to $193,590 -- more than the taxpaying (and taxing) Condi Rice makes. No doubt it seemed like small change compared with the money pit of remaking Iraq -- a task he once prophesied would be paid for with Iraqi oil money. Maybe he should have remunerated his girlfriend with Iraqi oil revenues, instead of ripping off the bank to advance his romantic agenda. 
 No one is satisfied with his apology. Not the World Bank employees who booed Wolfie and yelled, ''Resign! Resign!'' in the bank lobby. 
 Not Alison Cave, the chairwoman of the bank's staff association, who said that Mr. Wolfowitz must ''act honorably and resign.'' 
 Not his girlfriend, who says she's the suffering victim, forced by Wolfie's arrival to be sent to the State Department (where, in a festival of nepotism, she reported to Liz Cheney). 
 And not his critics, who say Wolfie has been cherry-picking again, this time with his anticorruption crusade. They say he has used it to turn the bank into a tool for his unrealistic democracy campaign, which foundered in Baghdad, and for punishing countries that defy the United States. 
 Wolfie also alienated the bank by bringing two highhanded aides with him from Bushworld, aides who had helped him with Iraq. One was the abrasive Robin Cleveland, called Wolfie's Rottweiler. The other was Kevin Kellems, known as Keeper of the Comb after his star turn in ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' where he handed his boss a comb so Wolfie could slick it with spittle for TV. (Maybe his girlfriend didn't get enough of a raise.) Like W., Wolfie is dangerous precisely because he's so persuaded of his own virtue.
 Just as Ms. Riza stood behind her man on the Iraq fiasco, so Meghan O'Sullivan stood behind W.
 Ms. O'Sullivan, a bright and lovely 37-year-old redhead who is the deputy national security adviser, is part of the cordon of adoring and protective women around the president, including Condi, Harriet Miers, Karen Hughes and Fran Townsend.
 Even though her main experience was helping Paul Bremer set up the botched Iraq occupation and getting a reputation back in Washington ''for not knowing how much she didn't know,'' as George Packer put it in ''The Assassins' Gate,'' Ms. O'Sullivan was promoted nearly two years ago to be the highest-ranking White House official working exclusively on Iraq and Afghanistan.
 It was clear that she was out of her depth, lacking the heft to deal with the Pentagon and State Department, or the seniority to level with W. ''Meghan-izing the problem'' became a catchphrase in Baghdad for papering over chaos with five-point presentations.
 But W. was comfortable with Meghan, and Meghan-izing, so he reckoned that a young woman who did not report directly to him or even have the power to issue orders to agencies could be in charge of an epic bungle, just as he thought Harriet Miers could be on the Supreme Court.
 This vacuum in leadership spawned the White House plan to create a powerful war czar to oversee Iraq and Afghanistan, who could replace Ms. O'Sullivan when she leaves. The push to finally get the A-team on the case is laughably, tragically late.
 The Washington Post reported that at least five retired four-star generals have refused to be considered; the paper quoted retired Marine Gen. Jack Sheehan as saying, ''The very fundamental issue is, they don't know where the hell they're going.'' I couldn't have said it better myself.

HEADLINE: Washington Dares to Challenge the Lender It Depends Upon

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
IS it risky for a big borrower to offend its largest lender?
 China, which is the subject of increasing protectionist pressures in the United States, is not only the largest contributor to the large American trade deficit. It is also the largest lender to the United States. 
Last year, when the Treasury debt increased by $184 billion, almost half of that amount -- $87 billion, or 47 percent of the total -- was provided by lenders in China, according to federal government statistics.
 With other foreigners buying large amounts of Treasury debt and the Federal Reserve buying nearly a fifth of the newly issued bonds, only 4 percent of the money came from American investors and institutions. American banks were net sellers of Treasuries, as were individual Americans.
 With variations, the same trends have persisted since 2002, when the United States government again began adding to the national debt, after a brief period of paying debt down.
 For the five-year period, foreigners picked up two-thirds of the $1.5 trillion in additional national debt, with China taking about a third of the foreign total. The Federal Reserve, which is part of the government but treated as if it were not, took about a sixth of the debt, and Americans took the rest.
 In that way, the Bush administration debt has been very different from that of the Reagan administration, which from 1981 to 1988, added $1.35 trillion. Then the Fed took a smaller share, about 8 percent, and foreigners bought only a sixth of the debt. The rest was purchased by Americans, and when defenders of the national debt told worriers that it was ''just money we owe to ourselves,'' they had a point.
 China now has the money to buy bonds because of the large and rising trade surplus it runs with the world, and particularly with the United States. By American figures, China's surplus in bilateral trade of goods last year was almost $233 billion. By China's measurement, it was $144 billion. Either way, it was very large.
 Although protectionist tendencies in the United States do not break perfectly along party lines, some Democrats have been more vocal in urging action against what they see as unfair trade from China.
 The change in control of Congress may have played a role in the Bush administration's decision to take two trade disputes to the World Trade Organization, and to impose countervailing duties in a third.
 For China, a trade war with a major buyer of its goods would present clear risks, and it is far from clear that it would benefit if it took, or even threatened, financial retaliation. So far it has not done so.
 A Chinese decision to sell large amounts of Treasuries -- or even to stop buying -- could drive the dollar down sharply.
 Such a move would also be likely to raise interest rates in this country. Higher rates might slow the economy and reduce demand for Chinese products just as the value of the bonds China owns was declining. Few think China will take such risks.
 Nonetheless, the Bush administration does find itself dependent on foreigners, most particularly China, to keep financing United States government spending.

HEADLINE: Shock Talk Without Apologies

BYLINE: By ROBERT WRIGHT. 
Robert Wright, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, runs the Web site Bloggingheads.tv.

 BODY:
There has to be an Imus event every once in a while. Ethnicity being the volatile thing it is, gratuitously inflammatory remarks have to be discouraged, so bounds of acceptable speech have to be clarified. Clarity comes when, inevitably, someone oversteps and gets slapped down.
 Maybe this particular boundary could have been clarified with less punishment, given how abjectly Don Imus has apologized. Still, there had to be a price, and, compared with the prices paid in some multiethnic societies (remember Yugoslavia?), this is a bargain. 
But is America's machinery for stigmatizing bigotry really working coherently? 
 If social harmony is the goal, sanctions should be focused along the ethnic fault lines that are most precarious. 
 The black-white boundary is such a line, given both the history of oppression and ongoing economic disparities between blacks and whites. But what about the line between Muslim America and Judeo-Christian America? 
 Here, economics isn't the issue. American Muslims are better educated and wealthier than Muslims in Western Europe -- one reason homegrown terrorism has been a problem in Europe and not here. Still, given that jihadist leaders around the world would love to ignite American strife, and given how few radically aggrieved Americans it takes to commit terrorism, this ethnic boundary is dicey, and worth minding. 
 Which brings us to Ann Coulter. Full disclosure: Ms. Coulter once cited an Op-Ed essay I wrote for this newspaper about the Danish cartoon controversy as evidence that people like me had ''affection'' for terrorists. Thus ended any claim I might have to evaluate her work objectively. If you want a subject on which I report and you decide, today's not your day. 
 In a speech last year before the Conservative Political Action Conference, Ms. Coulter used the word ''raghead.'' This is a dual-use slur, applied to both Arabs and Muslims, but she was talking about an Iranian, so presumably she was focusing on the religious dimension (consistent with her post-9/11 advice that we ''invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.'') The word raghead -- whose only function is to denigrate -- seems as legitimately offensive to Muslims as Mr. Imus's utterance was to blacks. The difference is that Ms. Coulter didn't apologize. 
 Brace yourself for the seismic damage done to her career. The leaders of CPAC reassessed their relationship with her and invited her back to speak this year, an occasion she used to trot out the word ''faggot.'' And Ms. Coulter continued to be interviewed respectfully on CNN and (again and again) on Fox News -- treatment that presumably wouldn't be accorded a pundit who used the ''n-word'' without apology. 
 Why the Imus-Coulter disparity? Maybe part of it is that Ms. Coulter isn't as structurally susceptible to sanction as Mr. Imus. She doesn't have her own radio or TV show, so advertisers on CNN and Fox have two degrees of separation from bigotry. Still, there are pressure points big enough for an Al Sharpton to find. Ms. Coulter's column appears in newspapers with major advertisers. 
 Maybe the problem is that Muslims don't have an Al Sharpton. And, truthfully, I wouldn't wish one on them. But couldn't they at least have an NAACP? 
 Actually, they have something like that: the Council on American-Islamic Relations. But CAIR is tarred by such people as Daniel Pipes for alleged sympathy to terrorists. I don't personally trust Mr. Pipes's judgment in Muslim-related matters, but I haven't done the dissertation it would take to get to the bottom of his indictment. What I do know is that if Muslims never achieve the kind of political organization that gets mainstream respect, and indeed feel that all attempts at political organization draw special scrutiny because Muslims are viewed with special suspicion ---- well, that won't help matters.
 I'm not making a moral argument. If I were, I would get into homophobia and anti-Semitism and other varieties of bigotry. This is a pragmatic argument about social cohesion. By my lights, the two American fault lines most likely to become chasms in the long run are between blacks and whites and between Muslims and non-Muslims. 
 And if anything, I'd say that the second fault line is the more treacherous. America has already done things abroad that are helping to make the ''clash of civilizations'' thesis a self-fulfilling prophecy. Let's not make that kind of mistake at home.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Is Heartened by Inflation Data

BYLINE: The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street closed out a bumpy week with a moderate gain yesterday as investors, heartened by inflation data, bought optimistically ahead of next week's rush of earnings releases. 
 The Dow Jones industrials had their 10th advance in 11 sessions, and all the major indexes closed out the week higher.
After some wavering early in the day, investors ultimately decided to extend the climb yesterday, encouraged when the Producer Price Index from the Labor Department came in flat for March, once prices for energy and food were stripped out. Including energy and food, wholesale prices rose 1 percent, a smaller rise than the 1.3 percent jump in February. 
 The stock market's advance was damped only slightly by the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which weakened in early April and raised worries that consumers could rein in spending. The report also suggested that consumers were more uneasy about inflation than they were last month. 
 Though investors decided to buy ahead of next week's first-quarter results, which the market anticipates will show slowing corporate growth, inflation concerns are likely to keep factoring into stocks' performance, especially with the latest figures from the Consumer Price Index due next week.
 ''Inflation is a little higher than investors would want, and the economy is a little weaker,'' said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund. ''The equity market is put in a difficult position. The Fed might lower interest rates, but until we get closer to the easing process, stocks will see more gyrations up and down.''
 The Dow closed up 59.17 points, or 0.47 percent, at 12,612.13.
 The index was helped by news from Merck, which rose $3.85, or 8.3 percent, to $50.21. The drug maker's shares soared after a federal judge in New Jersey dismissed a lawsuit related to its discontinued pain reliever Vioxx and after the company raised its profit outlook for 2007.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.05 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,452.85, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 11.62, or 0.47 percent, to 2,491.94.
 The 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32, to 98 30/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.76 percent from 4.73 percent on Thursday.
 A report from the Commerce Department that the trade deficit narrowed for a second consecutive month gave some support to stocks. Also easing some inflation jitters, crude oil prices retreated slightly on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling 22 cents, to $63.63 a barrel, after surging earlier in the day.
 Analysts predict that the next few weeks will show that companies are still posting profit over all, but that growth in the first quarter will be slower than in past years.
 ''The U.S. economy is weak, and margins have compressed a bit,'' said Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist for ING Investment Management. ''Earnings cannot continue at a double-digit rate forever.''
 But so far, he said, earnings have been coming in better than expected. A big reason, he said, is that nearly half the revenue from the 30 Dow stocks comes from foreign countries -- and growth in many of those countries was faster than it was in the United States.
 General Electric, one of the few Dow components to release its earnings before next week's rush, rose 20 cents, to $35.38, after it posted first-quarter results that matched Wall Street projections. 
 The company said, however, that profit was ''tempered'' in its domestic mortgage business because of subprime loans -- a weak spot in the economy that has caused some big dips on Wall Street recently.

HEADLINE: Companion Of Wolfowitz Rejects Portrayal

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13 

 BODY:
Before she became the subject of intensive news coverage as the companion of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the World Bank president, Shaha Ali Riza was known as a highly educated international bureaucrat who worked on issues related to women and girls in developing countries. 
 The Libyan-born Ms. Riza, a British citizen, holds degrees from the London School of Economics and Oxford University. She had already worked at the World Bank for seven years by 2005, when Mr. Wolfowitz, whom she had been seeing for several years, arrived as president.
 At the bank, Ms. Riza worked with the Middle East and North Africa Social and Economic Development Group, as the senior gender and civil society coordinator in the office of the group's chief economist. She was later appointed the group's senior communications officer.
 Ms. Riza, who speaks Arabic, French, Italian, Turkish and English, was married to Bulent Aliriza, a Turkey expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and has a son. She could not be reached for comment. Mr. Wolfowitz is divorced.
 Her friends say that she has complained in recent days that she is being portrayed in the news media in a one-dimensional way, as Mr. Wolfowitz's partner or close friend, not for her accomplishments. They say she believes that she is a vehicle for employees of the bank to get rid of Mr. Wolfowitz, with whom they have clashed on policy and style.
 On April 9, Ms. Riza wrote a memo to the bank committee investigating her transfer to the State Department and an unusually large pay increase. She maintained that she did not see any conflict of interest, and reminded the committee that she had not wanted to leave the bank for the State Department. Ms. Riza made no mention in the memo of her pay raises, which increased her salary by more than $60,000 to $193,590. The World Bank's staff association has questioned the propriety of the increase.
 ''I have now been victimized for agreeing to an arrangement that I have objected to and that I did not believe from the outset was in my best interest,'' Ms. Riza wrote, describing the ''personal pain and stress that my son and I have been subjected to, and the damage that this whole episode has caused me professionally, physically and psychologically.''

HEADLINE: Oversight Report Says U.S. Food Aid Practices Are Wasteful

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The United States government's food aid programs are riddled with wasteful practices, including the ''inherently inefficient'' sale of American-grown food in poor countries to finance antipoverty programs run by aid groups, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office released yesterday. 
 The G.A.O.'s yearlong investigation of food aid also found that rising shipping and logistical costs have halved the amount of American food delivered to the hungry in Africa, Asia and Latin America over the past five years. 
The agency which briefed Congress last month on its preliminary findings, released its full report yesterday. It was especially critical of the practice known as monetization, which involves shipping food at great expense across oceans to the developing countries.
 There, managers at nonprofit groups double as grain traders, selling the food on local markets to generate cash for development programs.
 Thomas Melito, the G.A.O.'s director of international affairs and trade, said this practice was a highly inefficient way to raise money for development, given that over a third of food aid spending has been consumed by the rapidly rising costs of ocean shipping. 
 Under American law, virtually all food given as aid must be grown in the United States, which means it has to be shipped out. 
 Federal agencies were unable to provide comprehensive estimates of how much money such sales had generated compared with the costs of buying, shipping and selling the food abroad, Mr. Melito said.
 Over the past three years, more than $500 million in food aid has been sold in developing countries to raise cash for programs to combat poverty, federal statistics showed.
 ''The sales are likely to generate less than 50 cents on the dollar, and it may be much less,'' he said. 
 As a growing number of scholars and advocates have questioned the effectiveness of the American food aid system in recent years, monetization has received tougher scrutiny.
 Some critics of food aid have characterized the nonprofit groups, along with shipping and agribusiness interests, as the so-called Iron Triangle of food aid -- a coalition that has fended off changes to the status quo.
 But the charitable groups have split sharply over the issue of their own sales of food aid in poor countries. CARE, Catholic Relief Services and Save the Children last year signed a declaration, along with British, French and Canadian aid groups, stating that such sales are usually inefficient and divert food from direct transfers to the hungry.
 CARE, which has raised about $62 million a year for its programs through such sales, has decided to stop ''monetizing'' food by 2009, with few exceptions, though doing so will mean a major financial hit. Officials of the group said they concluded it would be more efficient for the government to simply give nonprofit groups cash for antipoverty programs.
 They also said they worried that sales of American-grown food in poor countries had the potential to hurt farmers there who were also seeking the best price for their crops on local markets.
 ''We had to be consistent with our own beliefs and values in the best way to help poor people,'' Dr. Helene D. Gayle, the president of CARE, said in an interview yesterday.
 But the Alliance for Food Aid, a group of 14 other nonprofit organizations, including World Vision and Adventist Development and Relief Agency International, strongly supports continued monetization. 
 The Alliance's members say that such sales provide poor countries with imports, keep hard currency in the countries and generate cash to help the needy.
 Ellen S. Levinson, the Alliance's executive director, said that nonprofit groups usually received at least 80 percent of the aid's value in sales revenues, and sometimes more than 100 percent. ''It's a good package, but it has to be done properly,'' she said.

HEADLINE: G.E.'s Earnings Increase 2%; High-Cost Products Sell Well

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
The General Electric Company benefited from robust sales of engines, turbines and other big-ticket items in the first quarter, even as it grappled with problems in its consumer finance, plastics and health care businesses.
 A result, G.E. said yesterday, was that earnings in the quarter were up 2 percent over last year and revenue was up 6 percent. The numbers -- specifically, earnings of $4.5 billion, or 44 cents a share, on revenue of $40.2 billion -- were in line with Wall Street's expectations, but many analysts expressed relief.
''There were few surprises, and the quality of the earnings was really high,'' said Deane M. Dray, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who rates G.E. shares a buy. 
 Indeed, in January, when G.E. reported an earnings increase of 11 percent for 2006, investors worried that the numbers reflected favorable tax rates and earnings restatements, and sent G.E. shares down.
 Yesterday, G.E. shares closed at $35.38, up 20 cents, partly because investors felt that earnings growth stemmed from sales and productivity gains. Many were pleased that G.E. used the $558 million gain from the sale of its reinsurance business to offset charges related to an asbestos settlement and to 3,900 job cuts.
 ''I feel better about the stock's long-term prospects,'' said Robert Spremulli, an analyst at TIAA-CREF, which owns G.E. shares.
 The quarter had its blips. A new rule in Japan that limits interest rates to 20 percent is causing snags for GE Money. In the United States the unit suffered from the debacle in the so-called subprime mortgage market, which serves people with questionable credit. 
 G.E. is a wholesaler in that market, issuing mortgages and selling the debt to other companies. ''In the fourth quarter, the capital markets just shut down,'' said Mark W. Begor, who heads GE Money's American operations. 
 Just as bad, the number of people defaulting on payments soared. Such defaults drove the delinquency rate for GE Money to 5.5 percent. While the unit's sales rose 14 percent, its profits inched up only 2 percent. 
 G.E. lost $373 million in subprime mortgages, and has put up $330 million in reserves. Mr. Begor said it has also tightened its lending criteria.
 GE Healthcare has had to shut two equipment factories while it fixes quality issues raised by the Food and Drug Administration. Medicare has reduced reimbursements to clinics for M.R.I. tests, leading to fewer equipment orders.
 Those factors resulted in a $50 million hit to earnings. 
 But those areas of weakness were offset by booming sales of locomotives, aircraft engines and other items needed in growing economies. Across the company, G.E. has a backlog of $6 billion in orders. 
 ''We are in the first inning of a nine-inning game in infrastructure,'' Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, said in a conference call. 
 Investors believe him. ''The growth seems poised to continue over the next few years,'' said Daniel J. Rosenblatt, an analyst with Marble Harbor Investment Counsel, which has added to its G.E. holdings. 
 G.E. expects the domestic market to pick up soon, too. Keith S. Sherin, the chief financial officer, predicts that sales of big gas turbines will rise as environmentalists continue to oppose new coal plants and as nuclear plants age.
 He also predicts that domestic airlines, which have not been buying planes lately, will be ready to add to their fleets in a few years. 
 Profits are up at NBC Universal. And G.E. is close to a deal to sell its plastics business, which faces price pressures and soaring materials costs. ''The auction is going very well,'' Mr. Sherin said. 
 G.E. is sticking with its estimates of earnings of $2.18 to $2.23 a share for the full year, and is promising to increase earnings 10 to 12 percent for the foreseeable future. 
 ''Wall Street still discounts conglomerate stocks, but this quarter showed the power of a diverse portfolio to manage through troubles,'' said Richard D. Steinberg, president of Steinberg Global Asset Management, which owns G.E. shares.
 Solaris Asset Management, not a G.E. shareholder now, may soon become one. ''Problems like the subprime delinquencies are just a pimple on a company of G.E.'s size,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer for Solaris. ''This stock has underperformed so badly that yes, I think it is presenting a buying opportunity again.''

HEADLINE: Pope Describes His Book on Jesus as a 'Personal' View, Not Doctrine

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER; Peter Kiefer and Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting.

DATELINE: VATICAN CITY, April 13 

 BODY:
A pope, by definition, stands for certainty, at times even infallibility. So a few words from Benedict XVI in the first book of his two-year papacy may come as a surprise. 
 ''Anyone is free to contradict me,'' he wrote in the preface to the book, ''Jesus of Nazareth,'' which will officially be released Monday, his 80th birthday. The book makes no claims of speaking officially for the Roman Catholic Church, he wrote, but rather expresses his ''personal search for the face of the Lord.''
The cover even puts his given name, Joseph Ratzinger, before the one he chose when he became pope. 
 A book by any pope -- especially one both praised and criticized for his strong views as a cardinal and doctrinal chief to John Paul II -- is unlikely to be read as simply a personal musing. 
 In fact, some church experts said, the pope's decision to write personally was aimed at reclaiming his vision of Jesus as the divine son of God rather than as a symbol or mere historical figure. He also hopes to reach beyond Europe, where the church claims ever fewer believers. 
 ''It is a way for Benedict XVI to reach an audience that is as vast as possible, without an intermediary,'' said Sandro Magister, a writer for L'Espresso magazine and one of Italy's leading Vatican experts. ''He writes, and they go out and buy it. Almost like a personal dialogue.''
 ''It is not a marginal book, but rather very central to this papacy,'' Mr. Magister added. ''He wanted to select this argument because it is absolutely central.''
 The book, the first of two volumes, may generate all the more interest as his only lengthy publication as pope, apart from one encyclical, the highest form of church teaching. Before becoming pope, Cardinal Ratzinger, one of the church's leading theologians, wrote many books, and he remains a prolific writer of speeches and homilies.
 His publishers seem to have high hopes: on Monday, the book will appear in his native German, as well as in Polish and Italian. Rizzoli, which is publishing the Italian edition, has scheduled a first printing run of 350,000 copies. Doubleday, which will publish the book in the United States on May 15 and has also published books by John Paul II and John XXIII, will print 200,000 copies. The book is being translated into 20 languages. 
 On Friday, the Vatican played host to a gala book presentation and news conference that was packed with cardinals and Italian officials like Giulio Andreotti, a seven-time prime minister.
 But while few had time to read through the book's 400 pages -- released to the news media and dignitaries only on Friday morning -- there was some muted criticism that the pope's book has taken attention away from other church business.
 ''If you are in the position to govern, then govern; if you are a writer, then write,'' one of Italy's top Vatican scholars said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of his close ties to the church and because he had not yet read the book. ''But the idea of a sovereign that also writes complicates things because this is not an official act.''
 In fact, Cardinal Ratzinger started the book before he became pope. He says in the preface that he began writing it in 2003 on his summer vacation, when he was still in charge of church doctrine. Since becoming pope, he said, ''I used all of my free moments to carry the project forward.''
 His intention, he said, was to foster an ''intimate friendship'' with Jesus in an effort to restore what he believes to be Jesus's most significant role: as the divine son of God. 
 ''I have tried to present the Jesus of the Gospels as the real Jesus, as the historical Jesus in the true sense,'' he wrote. ''Yes, it really happened. Jesus is not a myth. He is a man made of flesh and blood, a totally real presence in history.''
 The book seemed in part to be aimed at refuting accounts of Jesus like that in ''The Da Vinci Code,'' which presented him as a mortal who married, and stressing his divine role rather than that of a social reformer. But despite the pope's past battles against liberation theology, which views Jesus as the liberator of the poor, he does portray social justice as central to Jesus's message. 
 ''Faced with the abuses of economic power, faced with the cruelty of capitalism that downgrades man to a commodity, we have begun to see more clearly the dangers of wealth and understand in a new way what Jesus meant when he warned against wealth,'' the pope wrote. 
 The book, 10 chapters long, covers the story of Jesus's life from his baptism in the Jordan River to the transfiguration, in which he ascended a mountain to speak with Moses and Elijah. 
 In his preface, Benedict wrote that that he plans a second volume on the rest of Jesus's life. But, at 79, he said he felt he needed to publish what he had already written.
 ''I do not know how much more time and strength will be granted to me,'' he wrote.

HEADLINE: Banker Gathers His Defenders, but There Aren't Many

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz, the embattled president of the World Bank, worked behind the scenes on Friday to gain the support of finance and development ministers from around the world, but there were few endorsements of his leadership outside the Bush administration.
 ''We must just allow the process to work through,'' said Trevor Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa, referring to the bank board's announcement on Friday that it would continue to weigh Mr. Wolfowitz's role in the transfer and pay raise of his companion after he became president in 2005. 
Mr. Manuel also said the bank must avoid a rush to judgment. But Mr. Manuel is close to Mr. Wolfowitz, and the failure to praise him was significant. Mr. Wolfowitz visited South Africa this year and has called Mr. Manuel one of Africa's most talented leaders.
 In Paris, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was similarly tepid and noncommittal, noting that the bank's board had a process under way. He said France would make its own views known when appropriate.
 Throughout the day, Bush administration officials praised Mr. Wolfowitz's leadership, but at an evening news conference, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that because the bank board was still considering the matter, he would not comment on what he thought the outcome should be. 
 ''This should not be read as any lessening of the United States' support for Paul Wolfowitz,'' he said. Asked specifically if he would call for Mr. Wolfowitz to remain as head of the World Bank, he responded, ''I said what I said.''
 The disclosure on Thursday of Mr. Wolfowitz's involvement in the raise given to his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, has stirred a furor within the bank and prompted demands from its staff association that he step down. Board members are said to be considering whether to reprimand him or encourage him to resign. 
 Bank officials familiar with the thinking of some of the 24 members of the board, who represent countries or groups of countries, said they were uncertain how to proceed and would be consulting this weekend with finance ministers here for meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
 The bank leadership was also looking for a signal from the United States, including an indication as to whether President Bush would insist that Mr. Wolfowitz had done nothing wrong, or whether some in the administration might encourage him to resign from an institution that is in a virtual uprising against his leadership.
 ''He could decide that his relationship with the staff and the board is so soured that he doesn't have the trust he needs to go forward,'' one administration official said, adding that he saw no evidence the White House was pushing for that. 
 Early Friday morning, after meeting the previous evening, the bank's board released a sheaf of documents about Mr. Wolfowitz's decision to direct the bank's vice president for human resources to reassign Ms. Riza to the State Department with a promotion, a raise and guarantees of future raises and promotions.
 The staff association has charged that several of Mr. Wolfowitz's actions violated normal bank rules.
 The board issued a statement saying that Mr. Wolfowitz did not involve the ethics and legal counsel in many of the decisions relating to the transfer, contrary to earlier suggestions by Mr. Wolfowitz. But it did not conclude that he had deliberately flouted the rules.
 The 7,000 employees of the World Bank in Washington have been exchanging e-mail messages and comments, many of them critical of Mr. Wolfowitz but some expressing sympathy with his situation and his dealings with Ms. Riza, who had been a bank officer for seven years when he became president in 2005. 
 Supporters and critics of Mr. Wolfowitz seized on the documents as evidence for the two different points of view.
 On one hand, the documents made it clear that Mr. Wolfowitz was very much involved in the decision to give Ms. Riza a raise to more than $190,000 a year, with the aim of compensating her for the disruption of the transfer, but critics said he violated his own preaching to the bank about the need for transparency and integrity.
 On the other hand, Mr. Wolfowitz's defenders noted that the documents showed he had tried to recuse himself from involvement in personnel decisions affecting Ms. Riza when he arrived at the bank, and reluctantly became involved in her transfer only after the head of ethics for the board directed him to do so.
 Mr. Wolfowitz remained out of public view on Friday, as did Ms. Riza, a British citizen who was born in Libya. But the board's documents provided a glimpse into the emotions of both as they struggled to reconcile their professional and personal lives.
 In his first month at the bank, Mr. Wolfowitz appeared from the documents to have been almost preoccupied by the matter. He had at first tried to allow Ms. Riza to stay at the bank and even to deal with her professionally there, with the promise to recuse himself if conflicts arose. That wish was denied by the ethics staff.
 With some irritation, Mr. Wolfowitz wrote a note in August 2005 saying the ethics committee had ''explicitly directed me to resolve the matter by providing instruction'' to a vice president for human resources. Later, he sent that vice president a directive that Ms. Riza be given promotions and pay raises. The documents show that the officials involved in making arrangements for the transfer to the State Department included J. Scott Carpenter, a deputy assistant secretary of state.
 Ms. Riza displayed even more displeasure in a letter written to the board this month from her position as an adviser to a semi-independent foundation that promotes democracy. She said she felt ''victimized for agreeing to an arrangement that I have objected to, and that I did not believe from the outset was in my best interest.''

HEADLINE: Between Bush And the World

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13 

 BODY:
When President Bush appointed Paul D. Wolfowitz as the president of the World Bank two years ago, the White House had to put down an insurrection among European nations that viewed the administration's best-known neoconservative as a symbol of American unilateralism and arrogance.
 For a while, Mr. Wolfowitz seemed to defuse those fears, even taking on the Bush administration over how best to aid the poorest nations of Africa. But now it is clear that the chorus of calls in recent days for Mr. Wolfowitz's ouster is only partly about his involvement in setting up a comfortable job, with a big pay raise, for a bank officer who is Mr. Wolfowitz's companion. 
At its core, the fight about whether Mr. Wolfowitz should stay on at the bank is a debate about Mr. Bush and his tumultuous relationship with the rest of the world, particularly the bank, the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which have viewed themselves -- at various moments since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- as being at war with the Bush White House and its agenda. 
 As finance ministers gathered in Washington on Friday for the bank's weekend meeting, Mr. Wolfowitz worked behind the scenes, seeking support for keeping his job. But there were few endorsements of his leadership beyond those offered by the Bush administration. 
 In foreign capitals, and among the bank's staff members, it has been noted that Mr. Wolfowitz's passion for fighting corruption, which he has said saps economic life from the world's poorest nations, seemed to evaporate when it came to reviewing lending to Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, three countries that the United States considers strategically vital. Some longtime bank staff members complained that Mr. Wolfowitz relied too little on experts in international development and too much on a pair of aides who served with him in the administration.
 Members of the bank's board from around the world began comparing what they called the murky way in which the bank made some policy decisions to the secretive habits of the Bush administration. 
 Nancy Birdsall, the president of the Center for Global Development, a group that monitors aid to the world's poorest nations, described what she termed ''real doubts about Wolfowitz's judgment'' inside the bank. 
 Mr. Wolfowitz came to the bank with heavy political baggage. Since the bank was set up at the end of World War II, its president has always been an American, a fact that has engendered more and more resentment over time. That reaction was compounded when Mr. Bush selected Mr. Wolfowitz, who had served as deputy secretary of defense and an architect of the Iraq war.
 ''It took a huge amount of effort to quiet this down,'' a member of the bank's board of governors and an early supporter of Mr. Wolfowitz recalled Friday of the early insurrection. ''And you would think, knowing that he was going into an institution that was deeply suspicious of him and the Bush administration, that he would have done everything he could to allay those concerns.'' 
 At first, Mr. Wolfowitz did so. He made Africa his first priority. He displayed a passion and energy for the work -- much as he did many years ago as ambassador to Indonesia, where he immersed himself in the culture and took on a dictator, Suharto. His campaign against corruption was intellectually unassailable and quintessentially American, and he was certainly right as far as the facts were concerned, members of the bank's staff and leadership say. 
 But eventually his focus on that issue put him at odds with career officials at an institution that is famously resistant to outside influence, and which believes that fighting poverty has to come first, even if that means dealing with countries whose leaders are not above skimming a few million dollars along the way. 
 ''He came in to a mood of skepticism and strong reservations by many,'' said Geoffrey Lamb, a former vice president of the bank, who worked closely with Mr. Wolfowitz on questions of finance for the world's poorest nations before he retired last summer. ''My feeling was that he provided a bit of reassurance, by moving actively on aid to Africa and debt forgiveness. Clearly, those early perceptions have changed a lot.'' 
 Over time, Mr. Wolfowitz created an impression that at critical moments he was putting American foreign policy interests first, most notably when he suspended a program in Uzbekistan after the country denied landing rights to American military aircraft, and directed huge amounts of aid to the countries he once recruited to sign on to Washington's counterterrorism agenda. 
 It did not help that he relied heavily on a pair of aides drawn from the Bush administration, Robin Cleveland and Kevin Kellems, who created an inner circle that the bank's professional staff members said they had great trouble piercing.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's defenders say that he was right to come in with a mission of shaking up the ingrown bureaucracy at the bank, and that the place desperately needed shaking up. But even they acknowledge that management has never been his strong suit, and that his judgment in dealing with the transfer of his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, was questionable. 
 In the backlash against Mr. Wolfowitz, though, there is also an undercurrent of settling scores -- including those that go beyond the World Bank. Europeans still fume over Mr. Bush's decision to send John R. Bolton, one of the biggest critics of the United Nations, to New York to serve as ambassador there -- an experiment that ended when it became clear that the newly Democratic Senate would not confirm him to finish Mr. Bush's term.
 Others recall that the administration tried to fire Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the Egyptian-born head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who famously declared in early 2003 that there was no evidence Saddam Hussein had reconstituted his nuclear weapons program. Dr. ElBaradei proved to be right, and was soon awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
 So far, the White House has expressed confidence in Mr. Wolfowitz, but not with much vigor. There were no signs that President Bush was about to rush to his aid, though that could still happen. European and Asian officials bet it will not.
 ''There is a sense that we're finally at a moment when Bush needs the world more than the world needs Bush,'' said a senior foreign official who flew into Washington recently for the annual meeting of the bank and the International Monetary Fund. ''And there's more than a little of that mixed in this whole argument over Wolfowitz's fate.''

HEADLINE: The Science Of Attacking Cholesterol

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
Science is making progress in understanding how cholesterol damages human health, and the pharmaceutical industry is tackling the challenge with a variety of drugs, says Fred Hassan, chairman and chief executive of Schering-Plough. 
 The company is completing the purchase of Organon BioSciences to gain access to medicines in that company's research pipeline like asenapine for schizophrenia. It reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Following are excerpts from a recent conversation: Q. Why do Americans have such a huge problem with cholesterol? A. The problem has become more visible because science is now validating what was seen in the Framingham study that followed many people in the town of Framingham, Mass., for decades. 
They came up with this hypothesis: if you have high levels of L.D.L.'s [low-density lipoproteins], you have a problem. If you can reduce the L.D.L. part, the bad cholesterol, you have a much better outlook when it comes to heart attacks and strokes. Q. Has our rich lifestyle contributed to the problem? A. It's partly heredity, partly lifestyle. They've done studies in some countries where people are pretty lean, but had cholesterol problems, like the farmers in Finland. The studies say that in China 30 or 40 years ago, before things got mechanized, people had much lower L.D.L.'s than they do now. Q. Do all the additives in our foods have an impact on our cholesterol? A. Yes, if you eat too much of the bad stuff, especially these hydrogenated fats, the margarine-type things, that's not good. And also there's now a growing theory, if you are obese because of eating too many carbohydrates, that doesn't help you. It's a whole bundle of problems. Q. How does your drug Zetia attack the cholesterol problem? A. Cholesterol, including L.D.L.'s, are manufactured in the liver. Statins, which came into the market in 1987, work by interfering with that process in the liver. But Zetia, which was a major advance we achieved in 2002, prevents the absorption of bad cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract. It's a separate mode of action. That's helpful for a whole bunch of people who don't tolerate statins very well. Q. Is that fundamentally different from what Pfizer's Lipitor does? A. Yes. Lipitor works in the liver. And we work more in the gut. Vytorin works for both. That's a drug we share with Merck in a joint venture. Q. What drugs did you recently acquire? A. We have five projects in Phase 3 of clinical trials. That means you're not far from registering and launching the drug. The one that gets written about the most is called asenapine, which is for schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. There is a huge demand for new drugs in this area because many existing drugs don't work. Patients sometimes have to cycle through different drugs before they find the right one. And some of them have controversial side effects such as obesity. Q. Is Schering-Plough unusual in having this many new drugs or is the whole industry on the verge of delivering new compounds? A. We as a company are doing better than we've ever done in our history. I just met with our researchers, which is not very usual for a C.E.O. But I see research as the primary engine.
 The industry as a whole is going through a tough time. There is a lot of concern over safety. When that happens, the balance moves in favor of asking more questions and more studies. The cost of developing new drugs has gone up. It has created an economic imbalance for some companies. That's why you see a lot of people reductions and layoffs at companies where their ability to come up with new drugs is not keeping up with the rate at which drugs are going off patent. Q. Wouldn't you agree that the image of the pharmaceutical industry has taken a hit because of pricing? A. We as an industry have worked very hard to reduce the pain by working with the government on reimbursement and trying to have patient assistance programs for those who have issues making co-payments. By and large, a lot of the burden has been lifted from the seniors who are a very large part of the market. But we have to do a lot more for the uninsured and the underinsured. And we have to be honest with each other and understand that if we are looking for better-quality care and longer lives, we have to make more money available for health.

HEADLINE: Talk of Possible $20 Billion Deal for Sallie Mae Pushes Shares Higher

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Shares of Sallie Mae, the nation's largest lender to college students, surged nearly 15 percent yesterday on the prospects that the company could be bought out in a deal worth more than $20 billion.
 Sallie Mae, officially the SLM Corporation, is in talks with the Blackstone Group and a group consisting of the private equity firm J. C. Flowers & Company and JPMorgan Chase, people briefed on the discussions said yesterday.
 Representatives from all three companies declined to comment. 
 Several analysts yesterday cited what they called significant hurdles to completing a deal. For one, buyers would need to structure a transaction in a way that would not load the company up with a huge amount of debt and endanger its credit ratings. 
 More difficult than the financial challenge may be the political one. While no longer a government-sponsored enterprise, Sallie Mae, now wholly owned by its shareholders, has a special relationship with Washington in its role as the biggest originator of federally guaranteed loans, according to StudentMarketmeaure, a research firm.
 Nonetheless, the prospect of a deal appeared to hearten investors. After The New York Times reported yesterday that Sallie Mae was in talks on a buyout, shares of the company rose $6.01, or 14.75 percent, to $46.71 -- the biggest single-day gain ever for the company.
 Bradley Ball, an analyst with Citigroup, wrote in a note yesterday that an offer for Sallie Mae at $48.72 would seriously undervalue the company. He maintained a target price of $55 a share.
 Kathleen Shanley, an analyst with the research firm Gimme Credit, wrote yesterday that Sallie Mae was a ''poor candidate'' for a leveraged buyout. ''The company is dependent on access to the debt markets, has a razor-thin net interest margin and uses derivatives to manage its interest rate exposure,'' she wrote. 
 Still, there are obvious attractions to Sallie Mae. It is by far the leader in the student loan business, with a $142 billion loan portfolio. It is both a lender and debt collector, making profits off both sides of its loans. Last year, the company earned $1.2 billion.
 For JPMorgan, a deal would bolster its own student lending business, run through its Chase Education Finance unit. The bank has made several acquisitions in recent years to bulk up that business, including a $633 million purchase of Collegiate Funding Services in 2005.
 From 1996 until 2005, Sallie Mae and JPMorgan ran a joint venture for student loans. JPMorgan originated the loans, which Sallie Mae then bought and serviced.
 The venture was dissolved after JPMorgan sued Sallie Mae, contending that its partner was undercutting the enterprise by lending directly to students.
 The discussions over a possible deal are taking place at a time when the student loan business has come under increased scrutiny, by the New York attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, and by lawmakers in Washington. Senate and House committees are looking into the relationships between lenders and college financial aid offices. 
 In a statement yesterday, Representative George Miller, Democrat from California and chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, said he was skeptical of efforts to take Sallie Mae private.
 ''The American people must be able to hold lenders and schools accountable to ensure that federal student aid dollars are being properly used to help students and families pay for college,'' he said.
 Some analysts noted yesterday that the involvement of a financial company like JPMorgan, with large capital and established influence in Washington, could make a buyout of Sallie Mae more palatable to lawmakers and regulators.

HEADLINE: Safety Records a Click Away

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
AFRICAN airlines have fatal accidents nine times more often than North American ones, and Asian and Latin American carriers are roughly six times deadlier than North American carriers. What can a traveler do to judge the safety of third world carriers?
 Karen J. Hofman, a public health expert in Washington who travels often to Africa and Asia, says she is nervous about flying on LAM, the national airline of Mozambique, which a South African travel agent booked her on for a flight between Johannesburg and Maputo, Mozambique. She has never flown it before, and is concerned about its safety. So she looked it up on the Internet, and quickly found that because of safety problems, LAM was on a French government blacklist, and thus forbidden to fly to that country. 
''I called my travel people in South Africa and I said, 'I'm really nervous,' '' she said. ''They said that particular flight from Johannesburg to Maputo would be O.K.'' 
 She plans to make the trip in July.
 Last year, France took LAM off the blacklist, but the list itself has grown and morphed into a banned list now used by the whole European Union. It is quite specific, with some airlines banned from flying some planes into the region but allowed to fly others. For example, Pakistan International Airlines, known as PIA, is allowed to fly its Boeing 777's to Europe, but nothing else. 
 While it seems as if almost every big airliner that crashes anywhere in the world has an American or two aboard, the United States government avoids making any judgments about airlines that do not fly to this country, and does not monitor those that do as closely as it watches American carriers. But the ability of Americans to get a clue about the safety of foreign operators is growing. 
 The industry's trade group and cashier, the International Air Transport Association, told its 251 members in 2005 that to maintain their membership, they would have to submit to an extensive safety audit. Six carriers were kicked out for failure to initiate the audits by the end of 2006. The audits must be finished -- and flaws corrected -- by the end of next year, and officials expect to expel another half-dozen or so carriers then. 
 But almost all airlines should comply, because the organization provides vital commercial functions, like settling up between airlines when a passenger uses a ticket on one carrier to board the plane of another. 
 The safety audits involve five days of inspections by a six-member team. Any findings must be addressed, and there are follow-up audits. 
 The audit program was not created to allay (or confirm) the anxieties of passengers. Instead, it is supposed to save airlines money. American carriers cannot enter code-share agreements with foreign airlines unless those airlines have had safety audits. The Federal Aviation Administration will accept the new standardized audit, so a United States airline does not have to send its own people to do the job. 
 The international trade group lists the airlines that have a passing grade on a current audit at www.iata.org/ps/services/iosa/registry.htm. But it does not list the ones that failed. 
 The European Union's banned list is less comprehensive, because it covers only airlines that are judged not safe and that want to fly to Europe. An English-language version of the list is available at ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/list--en.htm. It names nearly 100 airlines, mostly African and some from Central Asia. 
 According to Douglas E. Lavin, the International Air Transport Association's vice president for North America, his group's audit is ''an answer to the blacklist,'' as the European list is known. The blacklist does not give airlines the information they need to solve their problems, he said, and the audit program covers airlines that do not want to fly to Europe.
 The Federal Aviation Administration is much less comprehensive, concerned only with airlines that fly to the United States. While it does occasional brief inspections of foreign planes landing in America, it does not rate airlines. Instead, it decides whether its counterparts in foreign governments have the resources necessary for effective oversight. It does not distinguish among airlines in those countries. 
 There are 20 countries on its list not meeting the F.A.A. standards, including Belize, Congo, Paraguay and Ukraine. The list is available at www.faa.gov/passengers/international--travel.
 Knowing about an airline, of course, does not give complete information about the how safe a trip might be. Accidents can be caused by bad airports or air traffic control systems. And the biggest risk of accident in foreign travel may not be in the air at all, but on the streets or highways. 
 But the I.A.T.A. rating and the European blacklist offer clues. 
 ''I do like that,'' said Dr. Hofman of the European list. ''It's kind of like a Moody's bond rating, for airlines.''

 BODY:
 Hard, brittle beats. Noisy new-wave grooves. A preening, party-obsessed lead singer. In many ways the duo GHOSTLAND OBSERVATORY from Austin, Tex., seems like an old-fashioned band, eager to recreate the sights and sounds of an earlier era. 
In this case that earlier era is 2002. Back then partyers and journalists were talking about a playful club scene sometimes known as electroclash, although the term came to be used as a punch line: a ridiculous name for a ridiculous scene that seemed to disappear as soon as it (noisily) arrived. But like many ridiculous pop-culture phenomena before it, electroclash has proved remarkably durable. The demand for danceable new music is, as economists would say, inelastic, and Ghostland Observatory has figured out a way -- hammy but apparently effective -- to satisfy it. The duo has built a cult following the even-older-fashioned way: through raucous live shows. Expect one Wednesday night at the Bowery Ballroom. 8 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. On Thursday and Friday nights, a different kind of dance party: HOT CHIP, a British band with a knack for creating moody and wriggly electronic tracks; thanks in part to some memorable music videos the group has found an American following that ranges from house-music connoisseurs to indie-rock purists. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; Thursday, $22 in advance, $25 at the door; Friday, sold out.

HEADLINE: Cartoons With Heart and a Little Mandarin

BYLINE: By MICHAEL DAVIS

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif. 

 BODY:
HERE in the animation capital of the nation, computer artists dressed in Cali-casual are ensconced in a converted warehouse that could rightly be called the House That Slime Built: Nickelodeon Studios, a hothouse of toon talent. Walk through the lobby, past the basketball court-theater, past the gratis cappuccino bar, and soon enough a visitor comes upon an area where the walls are awash in apricot, sunny yellow and fuchsia. Lines of tasseled red lanterns hang overhead, the lighting is subdued, and, in a corner office, stands Karen Chao. 
 She's the creator of ''Ni Hao, Kai-lan!,'' an animated series for preschoolers based on her memories of growing up in a bicultural household with two overachieving brothers, a doting immigrant grandfather and a father with one foot in the Old World and one in the New. Ms. Chao and her mother, Hai-lan (Helen), were outnumbered but unbowed, honoring some gender traditions that dated to Confucian times while questioning others. ''Ni hao'' means ''Hi'' in mandarin, and Kai-lan is the Chinese name Ms. Chao was given at birth, later Anglicized to Karen. 
The series, which will make its debut on Nick Jr. in August, has been nurtured from what was a wisp of an idea four years ago, in experimental shorts called ''Downward Doghouse,'' then later into a series with Asian-influenced characters, settings and situations. Conceived here in Southern California but animated and partly designed in Taipei and Shanghai, the 20-episode project is Nickelodeon's big-ticket domestic and international television release for 2007. 
 What's remarkable is that this highly personal, highly stylized, faintly feminist project has sprung from an artist whose previous experience in television was limited to watching it. What Ms. Chao, 29, has lacked in experience, though, she has made up for in fortitude. ''My dad instilled in me at the age of 7 that as long as you put your whole heart into a project, the outcome will be magnificent,'' Ms. Chao said. 
 Her father, Jack, fled the People's Republic of China in 1962 with a single Hong Kong dollar in his pocket. He immigrated to New York in 1970, taking work as a delivery boy, and eventually moved to Texas. He is now a multimillionaire seafood distributor in Orange County, Calif., who is so protective of his daughter that he once ran background checks on a suitor she brought home to meet the folks. 
 Ms. Chao, who earned a degree in digital art from the University of California, Irvine, in 2000, didn't quite follow the path her father preferred. ''He set me up for an internship at PaineWebber, but I doodled on the cold-call sheets and taped the phone receiver down,'' she said. ''I wasn't a very good worker bee, but Dad was ecstatic because I was wearing business outfits with shoulder pads and big pants. In Chinese culture criticism is love. So my dad must really, really love me, because he has a lot to say.'' 
 In 2001 Ms. Chao, then working as a graphic artist, took an advanced course in Adobe Illustrator software. ''The first thing I drew was Kai-lan,'' she said, a version of herself at 5. After Ms. Chao created a Web site with a handful of other characters, her work was noticed by Mary Harrington, Nickelodeon's top animation executive from 1992 to 1997, who had developed ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and ''Rugrats.''
 ''I loved her artwork,'' said Ms. Harrington, now the executive producer of Ms. Chao's show. ''There was no real story there, but there was a sensibility and heart. We connected creatively and decided to take the plunge. I tease her that when we go out on the streets, people think she's my adopted Chinese daughter.''
 Though Ms. Chao was signed to a development deal, she said that her parents refused to believe she could support herself in the cartoon business. ''My dad said, 'What are you doing there all day at Nickelodeon?' '' she recalled. ''To him it was mind-boggling. I was goofing off and drawing pictures all day.''
 Mr. Chao proposed that he and his wife meet Ms. Harrington over lunch. Ms. Harrington politely obliged. ''I never had someone ask me to go to lunch with their parents in my business life, but I was honored,'' she said. By the time dessert was served, Jack Chao had bestowed his daughter's boss with the Chinese nickname ''May-me,'' which means ''pretty woman.''
 As a child in Texas, Ms. Chao collected bootleg tapes of Japanese anime dubbed in Chinese. She also was mad for Hello Kitty, whose graphic style has rubbed off on the ''Ni Hao'' characters. ''Everything I draw is childish,'' Ms. Chao said. Ms. Harrington confirmed dryly, ''Yes, preschool was the prime of her life.''
 Kai-lan inhabits a fantastical realm with an impulsive tiger, a koala who longs to be a panda, a pink rhino and a dumpling-loving monkey. Kai-lan is ''a born leader who makes affirmative connections with people and nature, paying attention to the feelings of others,'' said a consultant for the series, Dr. Janxin Leu, a cultural psychologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who studies the dynamics of Chinese-American families. She is part of an advisory team of educational researchers and social scientists that helped develop curriculum goals for a show that builds on the interactivity of ''Blue's Clues'' and the bilingualism of ''Dora the Explorer.'' 
 Aspects of Ms. Chao's father and her grandfather, Wensang Chao, are blended into the character Yeye, a frolicsome patriarch who encourages Kai-lan to discover why things happen. The Kai-lan-Yeye relationship is at the core of fanciful stories meant to help young viewers understand the link between feelings and actions. ''Every episode has Kai-lan promoting respect for elders and the importance of family,'' Ms. Harrington said. 
 In the premiere episode Kai-lan and Rintoo, the temperamental tiger, provide a lesson in the roots and ramifications of anger. The best friends enter a dragon boat festival, only to lose in the first race. Rintoo, agitated, says: ''I don't want to race anymore. We lost and it's not fair.'' He then whacks the boat with his tail, and it lands atop a pagoda. He stomps off and the narrative pauses to allow Kai-lan to think out loud.
 ''The series is about cause and effect, how feelings and behaviors are interconnected, and what language we can use to talk about feelings to bring them under control,'' said Dr. Laura G. Brown, another of the show's consultants. Later in the episode, Kai-lan teaches viewers to say ''jump'' in Mandarin, China's official language. 
 Vocabulary words will be a regular feature, which may be the right idea at the right time, as interest in the study of Mandarin increases in the United States. An estimated 50,000 American children are being taught Mandarin in public schools, with an additional 50,000 studying in private settings. Next month the first 2,000 high school students will take the College Board's new Advanced Placement exam in Mandarin. The number is small but an indication of big things to come, said Tom Matts, director of the board's World Languages Initiative. ''We expect to see growth in this course unlike any other introduced in the last decade or so.'' 
 By comparison, said Marty Abbott, director of education at the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language in Washington, 300 million Chinese are learning English, including every schoolchild 7 or older. ''All indications are that we are not getting our children prepared for the global economy,'' Ms. Abbott said. ''But we get a lot of calls from parents of preschoolers and elementary school students asking how they can help establish language programs in their schools. They've seen how engaged their children are with Dora. There's a natural curiosity and openness to language at that age.'' 
 Since 2000 Viacom, Nickelodeon's parent company, has had channels in South China's economically booming Pearl River Delta. MTV and Nickelodeon are available there, despite China's strict policies controlling foreign media. ''Ni Hao'' eventually will be seen in Asia, Australia, Latin America and Europe.
 Ms. Chao said she wanted Kai-lan ''to be a Chinese-American role model, to be independent, to have a voice, to take the initiative and to not always have to follow others.'' Ms. Harrington, the executive producer, said she hoped the series would have a special resonance for the estimated 60,000 girls in the United States who have been adopted from Chinese orphanages. 
 One such child is Jade-Lianna Peters, who voices the title character. Abandoned at a shrine in infancy, she was taken to an orphanage and put up for adoption at 8 months old. John and Kathleen Peters, a childless couple from Milwaukee, flew to China holding a photograph of her the size of a postage stamp. ''When they placed her in my arms, she stared at me for about five minutes, and I stared back,'' Mrs. Peters said. ''Then, all of a sudden, she let out this big sigh, as if she were saying, 'If this is what I'm stuck with, it will at least be interesting.' '' 
 Now 10, Jade-Lianna, who is being tutored in Mandarin, reads lines from a studio in suburban Milwaukee, linked by high-speed cable to the Nickelodeon center in Burbank, her sandpapery voice adding nuance and energy to a story about a backyard safari. 
 Listening in from California, Ms. Chao is thrilled by Jade-Lianna's interpretation of Kai-lan's exuberance and affection for Yeye. ''In Chinese culture everything is expressed in terms of the heart,'' Ms. Chao says. ''When a child is happy, she is said to have an open heart. When sad, her heart has been hurt. My father often speaks of this. He says being part of a family means having one heart.''
 ''Whenever I go home, that's when I feel the safest.'' She says. ''That's the soul of 'Ni Hao, Kai-lan!' ''

HEADLINE: Start-Ups and Catch-Ups

BYLINE: By ENRIQUE T. SALEM; As told to Amy Zipkin.

 BODY:
I ATTENDED Culver City High School in greater Los Angeles and played high school football. I played offensive guard, defensive tackle and was also a long snapper. I worked out year-round. I was a good student, my class valedictorian, but I was not big enough to play Division 1.
 I was recruited by the Ivy League and got accepted to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia and Dartmouth. 
Harvard flew me out to Cambridge on a Friday and assigned someone to be my host. I spent part of the weekend on campus meeting professors. Sunday morning I was talking to my host as I was leaving. I said, ''I've got a decision to make.'' He said: ''You'll make it. Just don't make the decision based on a name.''
 Then I went up to Hanover, N.H. Hanover was really beautiful. Dartmouth had the most Ivy League titles in football and a great computer science department. I said, ''Where do I want to spend four years of my life?''
 The cold in Hanover was incredible. I did adapt. The first year I went home for the holidays. I left Los Angeles to come back to school on Jan. 1 since classes started on Jan. 2. The Rose Bowl was being played in Los Angeles, and temperatures were in the 70s. When I arrived in Hanover it was 14 below zero. I said: ''What have I done? This is nuts.'' I thought about coming home. I'd get around campus by going through buildings and sprinting across open spaces with my head down. 
 After I graduated I went right back to Los Angeles and got an entry-level job as a programmer analyst at Security Pacific Bank. I'd arrive at 6 a.m. and work until 8 p.m. It was pretty much head down for a year and a half. 
 Then I went to work at a start-up of six people, and when it reached 10 people, it was acquired by VM Software. In all, I've worked for six start-ups and all have been acquired.
 So I went back to the bank. And then I met Peter Norton, went to work for him, and Norton Computing was acquired by Symantec. 
 By 1999 I was running a division of Symantec, traveling a tremendous amount and chasing the Internet dream. I left Symantec for Ask Jeeves. We were going through the Internet bubble. The company had $6 million in revenue and a market capitalization of $7 billion.
 I then spent 13 months at another start-up and was recruited to be the C.E.O. of Brightmail, in which Symantec had a 12 percent stake. It had been founded during the bubble to solve the problem of spam and had lost its way.
 In April 2002, about two months after I got there, PC Magazine had a review of products that were able to fight spam. In effectiveness, we came in dead last. I'd go to parent meetings at my daughter's school and people would ask what I was doing. When I told them they would say: ''God bless you. We hope you win.'' Everyone wanted us to be successful in fighting spam.
 I recruited a new head of sales, Mike Conner, and a new head of engineering, Brad Kingsbury. Four months after the first rating, I found out the magazine was going to do another review in the November issue. PC Magazine said they needed our software by Sept. 1. For the next weeks, it was lots of coffee and lots of pizza. By the time the issue came out, we had gone from last to first.
 I have a 20-gear bike and I ride it all the time. When I got back from college, I did rides around Los Angeles and then didn't do them for eight or nine years. 
 Last year I did a ride with a group from my daughter's school. We took our bikes on BART to the Embarcadero in San Francisco. We rode over the Golden Gate Bridge through Sausalito to Point Reyes, past Stinson Beach and then took the ferry across the San Francisco Bay. The ride was approximately 75 miles.
 I've competed in a 100-mile bike race from Carmel to Big Sur. When I participate in a biking event, the goal is to finish. Often, people will ask how I did in a particular ride of any significant distance and I will usually respond with, ''I survived.'' ENRIQUE T.

HEADLINE: 'For Sale' May Mean 'You Lose'

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THERE are quiet fire sales occurring inside the corporate bankruptcy world that hurt bondholders and other creditors while, in many cases, enriching insiders at failed companies. 
 That is the message of a comprehensive and troubling new study by Lynn M. LoPucki, a bankruptcy expert who is a professor at the law school of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Joseph W. Doherty, director of the law school's Empirical Research Group. The study, titled ''Bankruptcy Fire Sales,'' examined 54 large companies that were going through the bankruptcy process from 2000 through 2004. It compared how much money creditors received when companies were sold during bankruptcy proceedings with how much they received when the companies emerged from bankruptcy, reorganized and got a fresh start.
The study found that bankrupt companies whose managers chose to sell them -- an increasingly popular route in recent years, according to Mr. LoPucki -- received roughly half what was generated at companies that decided to reorganize. This suggests that creditors and shareholders can nearly double their recoveries by pushing their companies to reorganize rather than to sell, the authors said. 
 Management also appears to be using the veil of bankruptcy to cash in, according to the study. In 11 of 30 bankruptcy sales examined, the chief executives involved received specific benefits associated with the decision to sell. These benefits included severance payments generated by the sales or job offers from buyers after C.E.O.'s sell their companies. In other cases, chief executives became paid consultants to companies buying the assets. 
 Unfortunately, creditors and shareholders are often helpless bystanders in the bankruptcy process, at the mercy of insiders and their legal and financial advisers. Even so, the study comes at a time when investors are not much interested in what Mr. LoPucki calls a deeply biased bankruptcy process. Mergers, takeovers and hot initial public offerings are so much more compelling. 
 But investors should pay closer attention to the bankruptcy process, given how many formerly highflying subprime mortgage lenders are teetering on the edge of collapse or are already falling apart. 
 According to the study, companies that sold out during the bankruptcy process received an average of 35 percent of their book value, or net worth. Conversely, companies that reorganized did so at a value of 80 percent of book value. That's some spread. And it was found across industries as diverse as retailing, energy, airlines, entertainment and technology. 
 ''Companies that file bankruptcy have internal incentive types of problems that make them willing to sell their property for less than it's worth,'' Mr. LoPucki said in an interview last week. ''The judges are supposed to control it. But they are making rulings that are favorable to the people that bring them cases, so they will continue to bring them cases.''
 Big bankruptcy cases, of course, generate enormous fees and revenues for the court system. And judges are increasingly willing to let companies and their lawyers call the shots in these proceedings, Mr. LoPucki said. 
 This phenomenon was explored extensively in Mr. LoPucki's 2005 book, ''Courting Failure: How Competition for Big Cases Is Corrupting the Bankruptcy Courts.'' He said competition has been pursued most aggressively in the bankruptcy courts in Delaware and New York City.
 In filing for bankruptcies, companies can choose the court where their case will be heard. New Century Financial, a subprime lender that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, is a case in point. Based in California and incorporated in Maryland, New Century chose to file its case in Delaware, where a subsidiary is incorporated. A company spokeswoman did not respond to an interview request inquiring about their choice of venue for their bankruptcy filing. 
 ''This is a very sophisticated game,'' Mr. LoPucki said. ''The judges are not blatantly favoring one party over another; it's very subtle. But when you see the pattern -- and I see them in the cases -- then you realize there is something very wrong going on. The parties who bring them the cases are getting what they want.'' The LoPucki-Doherty study is a compelling rebuttal to academics who have argued in recent years that auctions were more effective than reorganizations at extracting value from a bankrupt company. Trust in the market's ability to price assets rationally was behind that view; not surprisingly, bankruptcy sales have grown considerably. 
 Especially popular, Mr. LoPucki said, are sales under Section 363 of the federal bankruptcy code, which allows managers to sell a company quickly without giving creditors the chance to vote on the deal or providing a detailed disclosure statement required under reorganization law. Compounding the problem is that once a judge approves a sale, appeals are not available. 
 As it turns out, ''the market'' that is entrusted to price a bankrupt company may also be subject to what economists call an ''agency problem'' -- characterized by managers and other parties putting their own interests ahead of those of owners or creditors in bankruptcy cases. 
 Consider the October 2001 bankruptcy of Polaroid. In April 2002, its co-chief executives sold the company to the sole private bidder for approximately $465 million, a price widely criticized as too low and far below the $1.8 billion in assets that Polaroid had listed in its bankruptcy petition. 
 The creditors raised their objections to the judge overseeing the case in Delaware, arguing that the company would be worth more in reorganization. The judge approved the deal nonetheless. After the sale closed, Polaroid disclosed that the co-chiefs had each received stock in the acquiring company valued at $3 million to $4 million. Ka-ching!
 Mr. LoPucki argues that investment bankers hired to sell a company have few incentives to maximize the bids they receive. Investment bankers may not think it worth their while to curry favor with the sellers who hired them because the companies are going out of business, he speculates. Furthermore, underpricing an asset creates value for the buyer, who may then compensate the banker with future business, he says. 
 While bankers often receive ''success'' fees totaling 1 percent of a company's sale price, Mr. LoPucki said a fee resulting from a higher price is often not worth the extra effort required to achieve it. Better to go on to the next deal. 
 THAT leaves creditors and judges to make sure the process is effective, Mr. LoPucki said. Too often the creditors are powerless and the judges passive or eager to please.
 As a result, Mr. LoPucki said, bankruptcy courts are not fulfilling their obligation to ensure that the best interests of the debtor's estate are being served, the study concluded. ''There are billions of dollars being pulled out of this system,'' he said. The Michigan Law Review plans to publish the LoPucki-Doherty study in November. A copy is at www.law.ucla.edu/docs/lopuckidohertyfire--4-11-07.pdf. 
 That creditors would be treated like steerage passengers on the S.S. Bankruptcy is not really surprising. The practices described in the study and the results they bring are completely in keeping with the treatment that many public company shareholders receive today from me-first managers. Whether the company is thriving or diving, being an insider has never been better.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Could Set The Tone On Wall St.

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
ONE facet of economic activity after another will have its moment under the microscope this week. Reports are expected on home construction, inflation, manufacturing and leading indicators, but one measure of consumers' willingness to keep spending may matter most on Wall Street, in one economist's opinion. 
 ''There are a lot of pieces of information to sift through, and the most important probably is retail sales,'' said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance, the Boston fund manager. As other pillars of growth have begun to look shaky, consumer spending has taken on a more crucial role in supporting the economy, he said.
''Business investment has really tailed off, and with government spending unable to grow very much, it kind of leaves you with consumers,'' Mr. MacIntosh explained. ''How the consumer acts is how the economy will act, and retail sales are a good indicator of that.''
 A Bloomberg News poll of economists expects the report, to be released Monday, to show a 0.8 percent increase in retail sales for March, excluding cars. 
 Mr. MacIntosh prefers to focus on the ''ultracore retail sales'' figure, which also excludes gasoline. A climb in gas prices adds to retail sales, but not in a desirable way; factoring it out provides a truer reading, he said. 
 Mr. MacIntosh expects a 0.3 percent increase after a 0.3 percent decline in February.
 Traders would respond well to a number ''significantly higher'' than a 0.3 percent gain, he predicted, while a smaller reading could send stocks lower.
 ''People are a little afraid that the economy is getting a little too weak,'' he said. With a Federal Reserve rate increase apparently off the table, equity investors, he said, ''are looking for a little more growth.''
 The construction industry could do with some growth, but the March housing data, to be released Tuesday, may not be the place to find it.
 Building permits are expected to show a decline to an annual rate of 1.510 million units from 1.532 million in February. 
 A fall in housing starts is also anticipated, to 1.498 million units a year from 1.525 million. 
 At this point, the housing numbers may not be that significant, though, Mr. MacIntosh said.
 ''Housing is tertiary,'' he said. ''People on the margin are now unable to borrow against their house, but it's still a very small part of the overall economy.'' DATA WATCH -- The same could be said about manufacturing, so the weakness expected in numbers scheduled for Tuesday is unlikely to move the stock market, Mr. MacIntosh said. 
 The Bloomberg survey estimates that the nation's factories operated at 81.9 percent of capacity in March, compared with 82 percent the previous month. 
 No rise is foreseen in industrial production after a 1 percent gain in February.
 The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, is expected to rise 0.2 percent in March, the same gain as in the previous month. And the Conference Board's index of leading indicators, due Thursday, is expected to show a gain of 0.1 percent in March, after a 0.5 percent drop in February.

HEADLINE: Creativity, Innovation and the Cultural Parade

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
STEREOTYPES about national origin are the dirty secret of technology communities. 
 The riffs on nationalities go something like this: The Chinese do not invent anything; they only copy. Italians design beautiful shoes, but who ever heard of a Tuscan computer programmer? Russians dominate chess, yet cannot seem to engineer a children's toy. Germans excel when they control all variables -- of a high-performance automobile. The French routinely lead in technologies that require large government subsidies. The Japanese so yearn for acceptance that individuals won't promote a new idea without the approval of their peers.
 If I have offended anyone, I will not apologize. I am recycling crass stereotypes about national traits in the service of a better understanding of how innovation works.
 Talk of national identity rarely comes up in public, but privately many people -- from academia to venture capital firms -- take for granted that the contours of a career in technology are often shaped by the national origin of the technologist. 
 ''Though the reasons can differ a fair amount, national origin does correlate with the innovativeness of the people of a country,'' says Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University.
 When a train set a new land speed record this month by reaching an astonishing 357 miles an hour, there was no mystery about where the train's designers lived or the speed test took place.
 France. 
 ''The French government has always been very good at making things where government support is critical,'' like trains, nuclear power plants and airplanes, Mr. Mokyr says. ''But the French are not terribly good at creating Googles or Microsofts, where private action is central.'' 
 The French engineering company, Alstom, after all, is the world market leader in high-speed trains. But a well-informed person would be hard-pressed to name a leading French information technology company.
 Indeed, many of France's best computer brains work in Silicon Valley. These Franco-geeks, who number in the thousands, even have two associations, SiliconFrench and DBF. 
 ''The French business system is constraining for individuals while supportive of scientists and engineers working on large, rigid systems that actually benefit from top-down decisions and slow change,'' says Jean-Louis Gassee, a former Apple executive who helped organize DBF and is a partner at Allegis Capital in Palo Alto, Calif.
 Comprehending innovation through the prism of national identity has its risks. In the 1970s, many people dismissed the Japanese as mere imitators and failed to see how the knowledge gained from copying would lead to path-breaking technologies. The success of Toyota, Sony and Japan's vibrant animation industry provide cautionary tales for those who might dismiss entire nationalities as copycats or only as consumers of advanced innovations. 
 Nations can and do change, sometimes by smart planning, sometimes by serendipity. Finland, home to the mobile phone powerhouse Nokia, was an agricultural country 50 years ago. So was Ireland, now home to thriving clusters in electronics and pharmaceuticals. Ireland's investment recruitment agency is now crowing about the virtues of ''the Irish mind'' in a series of print ads. The most popular ad, using a drawing of the Irish rock star Bono, declares: ''The Irish. Creative. Imaginative. And flexible. Agile minds with a unique capacity to innovate, without being directed.''
 Friends of Israel's top engineering school, Technion, are paying for a similar series of ads, which appear periodically on the Op-Ed page of this newspaper. ''The brainpower of its people'' is ''Israel's only natural resource,'' one ad declares. 
 Mr. Mokyr notes that ''these ads pertain to highly trained people.'' He adds: ''It's not that the people of one country are inherently smarter than those of others. But some nations invest more in education, or are more efficient in producing skilled people.'' 
 Why this is so has been debated endlessly by economists since Adam Smith, the 18th-century author of ''The Wealth of Nations.'' 
 There is little debate, however, that small countries are freer these days than large ones to boast about the supposed talents of their people. That is partly because larger countries can inspire fear or may have a history of invading others. Irish chauvinism seems benign, yet some people may regard praising the genius of ''the German mind,'' for instance, as objectionable, given the history of German aggression in World War II.
 Some countries are too big and diverse for easy generalizations. Talk of ''the American mind'' makes no sense because ''the U.S. is so multicultural,'' says Andreas Bechtolsheim, a native of Germany and a prominent computer designer in Silicon Valley.
 While migration and the flow of knowledge across borders have led to a flattening of the world, different technological strengths remain associated with different nations. So nations bent on becoming more innovative in other fields must confront their own collective strengths -- and weaknesses. 
 And that means taking stereotypes seriously, while not being imprisoned by them.
 Consider China, the fastest-growing economy. ''Chinese technologists are highly sensitive to their reputation as imitators, and they are trying to find areas where they can break through,'' says Carlos Genardini, an American who is chief executive of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks, an innovation incubator. 
 ''Building the designs of others is a hard habit to break,'' Mr. Genardini says. Sometimes success is the enemy. ''The Chinese make a good living from making the products of others,'' he adds. ''Why change?''
 One reason is political pressure. This month, the United States said it would ask the World Trade Organization to compel the Chinese government to do more to reduce, if not eliminate, factories devoted to churning out copies of American movies and other products.
 Self-interest ultimately ought to persuade the Chinese that creativity trumps copying. That is because profits and industrial leadership, often go to the companies and countries that create distinct technological systems. Think Intel's microprocessor family and Microsoft's Windows operating system. 
 Or France's high-speed trains.
 THINKING ahead, China's technologists talk openly about ''a second modernization'' and the importance of creativity. Yet China's creative potential is limited by the hegemony of an authoritarian Communist Party, which recently showed its muscle by issuing new warnings against Chinese use of the Internet for suspect social and political purposes. Despite exhortations to be more original, Chinese people ''feel a widespread fear of stepping out of the box,'' says Justin O'Connor, a professor of ''cultural industries'' at the University of Leeds in Britain who is studying China's recent experience. 
 China, of course, was the world's leading technological power -- 500 years ago. The grand sweep of history engenders humility and hope. National traits are fluid. Always shaped by unpredictable experience, these traits are subject to design and redesign. Just as technologists invent great products, countries invent, and reinvent, people.

HEADLINE: This Time, Rate Cuts May Not Work Magic on Stocks

BYLINE: By NORM ALSTER

 BODY:
SOONER or later, the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates and buoy the stock market. That assumption -- that a rising market will follow a Fed rate cut as surely as night follows day -- is widely held. 
 But John P. Hussman, manager of the Hussman Strategic Growth fund, argues that this assumption is wrong. Investors need to look at other factors for a realistic assessment of the state of the stock market, he and several other analysts say. 
''The idea that stocks will do particularly well if the Fed cuts rates is an idea that's not well supported by the data,'' Mr. Hussman said. 
 Certainly, Fed rate cuts stimulate the stock market in certain periods -- ''after the economy is already clearly in a recession'' and stock values have already come down, he said. In such cases, ''by the time the Fed eases there's a great deal of room for price-to-earnings multiples to increase, he said.'' When P/E multiples climb, stock prices generally rise.
 But at the moment, stocks are already fairly expensive, Mr. Hussman said. He bases this assessment on the fact that the P/E ratio of the S.& P. 500 index stands at 17 even as corporate earnings have risen to record levels. History shows that when the P/E ratio of the S.& P. 500 is at least 17 -- and when overall corporate earnings have surpassed previous levels -- Fed rate cuts generally do not take the stock market higher. (Mr. Hussman calls the P/E in such times the ''price-to-peak-earnings ratio.'')
 In fact, in periods since 1955 when the P/E of the S.& P. 500 has been 17 or more, stocks, on average, have declined by 2.3 percent, annualized, in the six months following the first Fed rate cut in a market cycle. 
 After that initial decline, however, the market has generally recovered: stocks have returned 6.2 percent, annualized, over the 18 months after the first Fed rate cut. 
 But don't relax just yet.
 Conditions in the bond market make the current prospects for the stock market worse than these figures suggest, Mr. Hussman said. At the moment, there is an inverted yield curve -- bond market terminology for a situation in which short-term interest rates are higher than longer-term rates. 
 Historically, when all of these bond and stock market conditions are combined, as they were when the Fed first cut rates in 1968 and 2001, stocks have been especially weak. In the first six months after cuts in those years, they declined by an average of 6.8 percent, annualized. And over the 18 months after the first cuts, they lost an average of 9.3 percent, annualized.
 Mr. Hussman says he is not convinced that the Fed, still concerned about inflation, will ease interest rates anytime soon. And if it doesn't, he said, the outlook for stocks may be worse yet. ''In my view,'' he said, ''the stock market risk/reward ratio is not appealing at this time.'' But his bearish assessment of the stock market's prospects is not universally held. 
 Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn., for example, says he expects the stock market to rise this year, whether or not the Fed cuts rates. Private equity firms have accumulated a huge reservoir of capital that they will continue to deploy to acquire publicly traded companies, he said, and that should buoy the markets. 
 ''I think we're in a bull market,'' he said. ''It will continue for the rest of the year. The market is going to do well, with interruptions and bumps along the way.'' 
 He acknowledged that the growth rate for corporate earnings is declining, a development that has generally been a drag on the market. But he said that analysts' estimates had already ''come down so sharply'' that further bad news on that front wasn't likely to have much market impact.
 In early January, analysts tracked by Thomson Financial were forecasting an 8.7 percent increase in first-quarter earnings for the S.& P. 500 companies. 
 But since then, the aggregate forecast has been ratcheted all the way down to 3.4 percent, said David Dropsey, senior research analyst at Thomson. Since January, the forecast for full-year earnings growth has been trimmed to 6.2percent from 9.3 percent.
 David M. Jones, president of the economic consulting firm DMJ Advisors, says he believes that ''in the short run -- over the next month or two or three -- the bulls win out'' as hopes for a Fed rate cut overwhelm concern over falling profits. 
 But three to six months out, Mr. Jones says, as the housing downturn proves ''longer and deeper than generally expected,'' growing evidence of a slowing economy and decelerating profit growth will prompt a correction, in his view.
 ''The rate of profit growth will slow more than expected,'' he said.
 And what if the Fed defies market expectations and does not cut rates at all this year? In that case, Mr. Jones shares Mr. Hussman's bearishness.
 ''If the Fed does nothing, it would mean an even bigger market decline,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Beware of too much bullish talk. You want to be careful with your investments and be aware of the possibility of a big correction.'' 
 JOE BATTIPAGLIA, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company, has a similar view. He is not sure that companies can match even the current earnings growth forecasts. 
 ''Earnings growth expectations for the S.& P. 500 may be too high,'' Mr. Battipaglia said. 
 Noting that net new borrowing by consumers was down 38 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, versus the period a year earlier, he sees the prospect of a ''consumer-led pullback'' for the first time in 15 years. 
 This would hurt the stock market, he said, with the S.& P. dropping 5 percent or more.
 If Fed rate cuts won't necessarily signal a market upturn, where should investors focus? 
 Corporate profit trends are a fairly reliable indicator, Mr. Battipaglia said. ''The first sign of a turn-up in the corporate profit growth rate,'' he said, is a bullish signal that has ''great predictive accuracy.'' 
 Such a turn-up, he added, could materialize toward year-end.

HEADLINE: The Power of Green

BYLINE: By Thomas L. Friedman. 
Thomas L. Friedman is a columnist for The New York Times specializing in foreign affairs.

 BODY:
I.
 One day Iraq, our post-9/11 trauma and the divisiveness of the Bush years will all be behind us -- and America will need, and want, to get its groove back. We will need to find a way to reknit America at home, reconnect America abroad and restore America to its natural place in the global order -- as the beacon of progress, hope and inspiration. I have an idea how. It's called ''green.''
In the world of ideas, to name something is to own it. If you can name an issue, you can own the issue. One thing that always struck me about the term ''green'' was the degree to which, for so many years, it was defined by its opponents -- by the people who wanted to disparage it. And they defined it as ''liberal,'' ''tree-hugging,'' ''sissy,'' ''girlie-man,'' ''unpatriotic,'' ''vaguely French.'' 
 Well, I want to rename ''green.'' I want to rename it geostrategic, geoeconomic, capitalistic and patriotic. I want to do that because I think that living, working, designing, manufacturing and projecting America in a green way can be the basis of a new unifying political movement for the 21st century. A redefined, broader and more muscular green ideology is not meant to trump the traditional Republican and Democratic agendas but rather to bridge them when it comes to addressing the three major issues facing every American today: jobs, temperature and terrorism.
 How do our kids compete in a flatter world? How do they thrive in a warmer world? How do they survive in a more dangerous world? Those are, in a nutshell, the big questions facing America at the dawn of the 21st century. But these problems are so large in scale that they can only be effectively addressed by an America with 50 green states -- not an America divided between red and blue states.
 Because a new green ideology, properly defined, has the power to mobilize liberals and conservatives, evangelicals and atheists, big business and environmentalists around an agenda that can both pull us together and propel us forward. That's why I say: We don't just need the first black president. We need the first green president. We don't just need the first woman president. We need the first environmental president. We don't just need a president who has been toughened by years as a prisoner of war but a president who is tough enough to level with the American people about the profound economic, geopolitical and climate threats posed by our addiction to oil -- and to offer a real plan to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
 After World War II, President Eisenhower responded to the threat of Communism and the ''red menace'' with massive spending on an interstate highway system to tie America together, in large part so that we could better move weapons in the event of a war with the Soviets. That highway system, though, helped to enshrine America's car culture (atrophying our railroads) and to lock in suburban sprawl and low-density housing, which all combined to get America addicted to cheap fossil fuels, particularly oil. Many in the world followed our model.
 Today, we are paying the accumulated economic, geopolitical and climate prices for that kind of America. I am not proposing that we radically alter our lifestyles. We are who we are -- including a car culture. But if we want to continue to be who we are, enjoy the benefits and be able to pass them on to our children, we do need to fuel our future in a cleaner, greener way. Eisenhower rallied us with the red menace. The next president will have to rally us with a green patriotism. Hence my motto: ''Green is the new red, white and blue.''
 The good news is that after traveling around America this past year, looking at how we use energy and the emerging alternatives, I can report that green really has gone Main Street -- thanks to the perfect storm created by 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the Internet revolution. The first flattened the twin towers, the second flattened New Orleans and the third flattened the global economic playing field. The convergence of all three has turned many of our previous assumptions about ''green'' upside down in a very short period of time, making it much more compelling to many more Americans. 
 But here's the bad news: While green has hit Main Street -- more Americans than ever now identify themselves as greens, or what I call ''Geo-Greens'' to differentiate their more muscular and strategic green ideology -- green has not gone very far down Main Street. It certainly has not gone anywhere near the distance required to preserve our lifestyle. The dirty little secret is that we're fooling ourselves. We in America talk like we're already ''the greenest generation,'' as the business writer Dan Pink once called it. But here's the really inconvenient truth: We have not even begun to be serious about the costs, the effort and the scale of change that will be required to shift our country, and eventually the world, to a largely emissions-free energy infrastructure over the next 50 years. II.
 A few weeks after American forces invaded Afghanistan, I visited the Pakistani frontier town of Peshawar, a hotbed of Islamic radicalism. On the way, I stopped at the famous Darul Uloom Haqqania, the biggest madrasa, or Islamic school, in Pakistan, with 2,800 live-in students. The Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar attended this madrasa as a younger man. My Pakistani friend and I were allowed to observe a class of young boys who sat on the floor, practicing their rote learning of the Koran from texts perched on wooden holders. The air in the Koran class was so thick and stale it felt as if you could have cut it into blocks. The teacher asked an 8-year-old boy to chant a Koranic verse for us, which he did with the elegance of an experienced muezzin. I asked another student, an Afghan refugee, Rahim Kunduz, age 12, what his reaction was to the Sept. 11 attacks, and he said: ''Most likely the attack came from Americans inside America. I am pleased that America has had to face pain, because the rest of the world has tasted its pain.'' A framed sign on the wall said this room was ''A gift of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.''
 Sometime after 9/11 -- an unprovoked mass murder perpetrated by 19 men, 15 of whom were Saudis -- green went geostrategic, as Americans started to realize we were financing both sides in the war on terrorism. We were financing the U.S. military with our tax dollars; and we were financing a transformation of Islam, in favor of its most intolerant strand, with our gasoline purchases. How stupid is that? 
 Islam has always been practiced in different forms. Some are more embracing of modernity, reinterpretation of the Koran and tolerance of other faiths, like Sufi Islam or the populist Islam of Egypt, Ottoman Turkey and Indonesia. Some strands, like Salafi Islam -- followed by the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia and by Al Qaeda -- believe Islam should be returned to an austere form practiced in the time of the Prophet Muhammad, a form hostile to modernity, science, ''infidels'' and women's rights. By enriching the Saudi and Iranian treasuries via our gasoline purchases, we are financing the export of the Saudi puritanical brand of Sunni Islam and the Iranian fundamentalist brand of Shiite Islam, tilting the Muslim world in a more intolerant direction. At the Muslim fringe, this creates more recruits for the Taliban, Al Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Sunni suicide bomb squads of Iraq; at the Muslim center, it creates a much bigger constituency of people who applaud suicide bombers as martyrs.
 The Saudi Islamic export drive first went into high gear after extreme fundamentalists challenged the Muslim credentials of the Saudi ruling family by taking over the Grand Mosque of Mecca in 1979 -- a year that coincided with the Iranian revolution and a huge rise in oil prices. The attack on the Grand Mosque by these Koran-and-rifle-wielding Islamic militants shook the Saudi ruling family to its core. The al-Sauds responded to this challenge to their religious bona fides by becoming outwardly more religious. They gave their official Wahhabi religious establishment even more power to impose Islam on public life. Awash in cash thanks to the spike in oil prices, the Saudi government and charities also spent hundreds of millions of dollars endowing mosques, youth clubs and Muslim schools all over the world, ensuring that Wahhabi imams, teachers and textbooks would preach Saudi-style Islam. Eventually, notes Lawrence Wright in ''The Looming Tower,'' his history of Al Qaeda, ''Saudi Arabia, which constitutes only 1 percent of the world Muslim population, would support 90 percent of the expenses of the entire faith, overriding other traditions of Islam.'' 
 Saudi mosques and wealthy donors have also funneled cash to the Sunni insurgents in Iraq. The Associated Press reported from Cairo in December: ''Several drivers interviewed by the A.P. in Middle East capitals said Saudis have been using religious events, like the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and a smaller pilgrimage, as cover for illicit money transfers. Some money, they said, is carried into Iraq on buses with returning pilgrims. 'They sent boxes full of dollars and asked me to deliver them to certain addresses in Iraq,' said one driver. ... 'I know it is being sent to the resistance, and if I don't take it with me, they will kill me.' ''
 No wonder more Americans have concluded that conserving oil to put less money in the hands of hostile forces is now a geostrategic imperative. President Bush's refusal to do anything meaningful after 9/11 to reduce our gasoline usage really amounts to a policy of ''No Mullah Left Behind.'' James Woolsey, the former C.I.A. director, minces no words: ''We are funding the rope for the hanging of ourselves.''
 No, I don't want to bankrupt Saudi Arabia or trigger an Islamist revolt there. Its leadership is more moderate and pro-Western than its people. But the way the Saudi ruling family has bought off its religious establishment, in order to stay in power, is not healthy. Cutting the price of oil in half would help change that. In the 1990s, dwindling oil income sparked a Saudi debate about less Koran and more science in Saudi schools, even experimentation with local elections. But the recent oil windfall has stilled all talk of reform.
 That is because of what I call the First Law of Petropolitics: The price of oil and the pace of freedom always move in opposite directions in states that are highly dependent on oil exports for their income and have weak institutions or outright authoritarian governments. And this is another reason that green has become geostrategic. Soaring oil prices are poisoning the international system by strengthening antidemocratic regimes around the globe.
 Look what's happened: We thought the fall of the Berlin Wall was going to unleash an unstoppable tide of free markets and free people, and for about a decade it did just that. But those years coincided with oil in the $10-to-$30-a-barrel range. As the price of oil surged into the $30-to-$70 range in the early 2000s, it triggered a countertide -- a tide of petroauthoritarianism -- manifested in Russia, Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Sudan, Egypt, Chad, Angola, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. The elected or self-appointed elites running these states have used their oil windfalls to ensconce themselves in power, buy off opponents and counter the fall-of-the-Berlin-Wall tide. If we continue to finance them with our oil purchases, they will reshape the world in their image, around Putin-like values.
 You can illustrate the First Law of Petropolitics with a simple graph. On one line chart the price of oil from 1979 to the present; on another line chart the Freedom House or Fraser Institute freedom indexes for Russia, Nigeria, Iran and Venezuela for the same years. When you put these two lines on the same graph you see something striking: the price of oil and the pace of freedom are inversely correlated. As oil prices went down in the early 1990s, competition, transparency, political participation and accountability of those in office all tended to go up in these countries -- as measured by free elections held, newspapers opened, reformers elected, economic reform projects started and companies privatized. That's because their petroauthoritarian regimes had to open themselves to foreign investment and educate and empower their people more in order to earn income. But as oil prices went up around 2000, free speech, free press, fair elections and freedom to form political parties and NGOs all eroded in these countries.
 The motto of the American Revolution was ''no taxation without representation.'' The motto of the petroauthoritarians is ''no representation without taxation'': If I don't have to tax you, because I can get all the money I need from oil wells, I don't have to listen to you.
 It is no accident that when oil prices were low in the 1990s, Iran elected a reformist Parliament and a president who called for a ''dialogue of civilizations.'' And when oil prices soared to $70 a barrel, Iran's conservatives pushed out the reformers and ensconced a president who says the Holocaust is a myth. (I promise you, if oil prices drop to $25 a barrel, the Holocaust won't be a myth anymore.) And it is no accident that the first Arab Gulf state to start running out of oil, Bahrain, is also the first Arab Gulf state to have held a free and fair election in which women could run and vote, the first Arab Gulf state to overhaul its labor laws to make more of its own people employable and the first Arab Gulf state to sign a free-trade agreement with America.
 People change when they have to -- not when we tell them to -- and falling oil prices make them have to. That is why if we are looking for a Plan B for Iraq -- a way of pressing for political reform in the Middle East without going to war again -- there is no better tool than bringing down the price of oil. When it comes to fostering democracy among petroauthoritarians, it doesn't matter whether you're a neocon or a radical lib. If you're not also a Geo-Green, you won't succeed.
 The notion that conserving energy is a geostrategic imperative has also moved into the Pentagon, for slightly different reasons. Generals are realizing that the more energy they save in the heat of battle, the more power they can project. The Pentagon has been looking to improve its energy efficiency for several years now to save money. But the Iraq war has given birth to a new movement in the U.S. military: the ''Green Hawks.''
 As Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, who has been working with the Pentagon, put it to me: The Iraq war forced the U.S. military to think much more seriously about how to ''eat its tail'' -- to shorten its energy supply lines by becoming more energy efficient. According to Dan Nolan, who oversees energy projects for the U.S. Army's Rapid Equipping Force, it started last year when a Marine major general in Anbar Province told the Pentagon he wanted better-insulated, more energy-efficient tents in the Iraqi desert. Why? His air-conditioners were being run off mobile generators, and the generators ran on diesel, and the diesel had to be trucked in, and the insurgents were blowing up the trucks.
 ''When we began the analysis of his request, it was really about the fact that his soldiers were being attacked on the roads bringing fuel and water,'' Nolan said. So eating their tail meant ''taking those things that are brought into the unit and trying to generate them on-site.'' To that end Nolan's team is now experimenting with everything from new kinds of tents that need 40 percent less air-conditioning to new kinds of fuel cells that produce water as a byproduct.
 Pay attention: When the U.S. Army desegregated, the country really desegregated; when the Army goes green, the country could really go green. 
 ''Energy independence is a national security issue,'' Nolan said. ''It's the right business for us to be in. ... We are not trying to change the whole Army. Our job is to focus on that battalion out there and give those commanders the technological innovations they need to deal with today's mission. But when they start coming home, they are going to bring those things with them.'' III.
 The second big reason green has gone Main Street is because global warming has. A decade ago, it was mostly experts who worried that climate change was real, largely brought about by humans and likely to lead to species loss and environmental crises. Now Main Street is starting to worry because people are seeing things they've never seen before in their own front yards and reading things they've never read before in their papers -- like the recent draft report by the United Nations's 2,000-expert Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that ''changes in climate are now affecting physical and biological systems on every continent.'' 
 I went to Montana in January and Gov. Brian Schweitzer told me: ''We don't get as much snow in the high country as we used to, and the runoff starts sooner in the spring. The river I've been fishing over the last 50 years is now warmer in July by five degrees than 50 years ago, and it is hard on our trout population.'' I went to Moscow in February, and my friends told me they just celebrated the first Moscow Christmas in their memory with no snow. I stopped in London on the way home, and I didn't need an overcoat. In 2006, the average temperature in central England was the highest ever recorded since the Central England Temperature (C.E.T.) series began in 1659.
 Yes, no one knows exactly what will happen. But ever fewer people want to do nothing. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California summed up the new climate around climate when he said to me recently: ''If 98 doctors say my son is ill and needs medication and two say 'No, he doesn't, he is fine,' I will go with the 98. It's common sense -- the same with global warming. We go with the majority, the large majority. ... The key thing now is that since we know this industrial age has created it, let's get our act together and do everything we can to roll it back.'' 
 But how? Now we arrive at the first big roadblock to green going down Main Street. Most people have no clue -- no clue -- how huge an industrial project is required to blunt climate change. Here are two people who do: Robert Socolow, an engineering professor, and Stephen Pacala, an ecology professor, who together lead the Carbon Mitigation Initiative at Princeton, a consortium designing scalable solutions for the climate issue. 
 They first argued in a paper published by the journal Science in August 2004 that human beings can emit only so much carbon into the atmosphere before the buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) reaches a level unknown in recent geologic history and the earth's climate system starts to go ''haywire.'' The scientific consensus, they note, is that the risk of things going haywire -- weather patterns getting violently unstable, glaciers melting, prolonged droughts -- grows rapidly as CO2 levels ''approach a doubling'' of the concentration of CO2 that was in the atmosphere before the Industrial Revolution.
 ''Think of the climate change issue as a closet, and behind the door are lurking all kinds of monsters -- and there's a long list of them,'' Pacala said. ''All of our scientific work says the most damaging monsters start to come out from behind that door when you hit the doubling of CO2 levels.'' As Bill Collins, who led the development of a model used worldwide for simulating climate change, put it to me: ''We're running an uncontrolled experiment on the only home we have.'' 
 So here is our challenge, according to Pacala: If we basically do nothing, and global CO2 emissions continue to grow at the pace of the last 30 years for the next 50 years, we will pass the doubling level -- an atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide of 560 parts per million -- around midcentury. To avoid that -- and still leave room for developed countries to grow, using less carbon, and for countries like India and China to grow, emitting double or triple their current carbon levels, until they climb out of poverty and are able to become more energy efficient -- will require a huge global industrial energy project.
 To convey the scale involved, Socolow and Pacala have created a pie chart with 15 different wedges. Some wedges represent carbon-free or carbon-diminishing power-generating technologies; other wedges represent efficiency programs that could conserve large amounts of energy and prevent CO2 emissions. They argue that the world needs to deploy any 7 of these 15 wedges, or sufficient amounts of all 15, to have enough conservation, and enough carbon-free energy, to increase the world economy and still avoid the doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere. Each wedge, when phased in over 50 years, would avoid the release of 25 billion tons of carbon, for a total of 175 billion tons of carbon avoided between now and 2056.
 Here are seven wedges we could chose from: ''Replace 1,400 large coal-fired plants with gas-fired plants; increase the fuel economy of two billion cars from 30 to 60 miles per gallon; add twice today's nuclear output to displace coal; drive two billion cars on ethanol, using one-sixth of the world's cropland; increase solar power 700-fold to displace coal; cut electricity use in homes, offices and stores by 25 percent; install carbon capture and sequestration capacity at 800 large coal-fired plants.'' And the other eight aren't any easier. They include halting all cutting and burning of forests, since deforestation causes about 20 percent of the world's annual CO2 emissions.
 ''There has never been a deliberate industrial project in history as big as this,'' Pacala said. Through a combination of clean power technology and conservation, ''we have to get rid of 175 billion tons of carbon over the next 50 years -- and still keep growing. It is possible to accomplish this if we start today. But every year that we delay, the job becomes more difficult -- and if we delay a decade or two, avoiding the doubling or more may well become impossible.'' IV.
 In November, I flew from Shanghai to Beijing on Air China. As we landed in Beijing and taxied to the terminal, the Chinese air hostess came on the P.A. and said: ''We've just landed in Beijing. The temperature is 8 degrees Celsius, 46 degrees Fahrenheit and the sky is clear.''
 I almost burst out laughing. Outside my window the smog was so thick you could not see the end of the terminal building. When I got into Beijing, though, friends told me the air was better than usual. Why? China had been host of a summit meeting of 48 African leaders. Time magazine reported that Beijing officials had ''ordered half a million official cars off the roads and said another 400,000 drivers had 'volunteered' to refrain from using their vehicles'' in order to clean up the air for their African guests. As soon as they left, the cars returned, and Beijing's air went back to ''unhealthy.'' 
 Green has also gone Main Street because the end of Communism, the rise of the personal computer and the diffusion of the Internet have opened the global economic playing field to so many more people, all coming with their own versions of the American dream -- a house, a car, a toaster, a microwave and a refrigerator. It is a blessing to see so many people growing out of poverty. But when three billion people move from ''low-impact'' to ''high-impact'' lifestyles, Jared Diamond wrote in ''Collapse,'' it makes it urgent that we find cleaner ways to fuel their dreams. According to Lester Brown, the founder of the Earth Policy Institute, if China keeps growing at 8 percent a year, by 2031 the per-capita income of 1.45 billion Chinese will be the same as America's in 2004. China currently has only one car for every 100 people, but Brown projects that as it reaches American income levels, if it copies American consumption, it will have three cars for every four people, or 1.1 billion vehicles. The total world fleet today is 800 million vehicles!
 That's why McKinsey Global Institute forecasts that developing countries will generate nearly 80 percent of the growth in world energy demand between now and 2020, with China representing 32 percent and the Middle East 10 percent. So if Red China doesn't become Green China there is no chance we will keep the climate monsters behind the door. On some days, says the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, almost 25 percent of the polluting matter in the air above Los Angeles comes from China's coal-fired power plants and factories, as well as fumes from China's cars and dust kicked up by droughts and deforestation around Asia.
 The good news is that China knows it has to grow green -- or it won't grow at all. On Sept. 8, 2006, a Chinese newspaper reported that China's E.P.A. and its National Bureau of Statistics had re-examined China's 2004 G.D.P. number. They concluded that the health problems, environmental degradation and lost workdays from pollution had actually cost China $64 billion, or 3.05 percent of its total economic output for 2004. Some experts believe the real number is closer to 10 percent.
 Thus China has a strong motivation to clean up the worst pollutants in its air. Those are the nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and mercury that produce acid rain, smog and haze -- much of which come from burning coal. But cleaning up is easier said than done. The Communist Party's legitimacy and the stability of the whole country depend heavily on Beijing's ability to provide rising living standards for more and more Chinese. 
 So, if you're a Chinese mayor and have to choose between growing jobs and cutting pollution, you will invariably choose jobs: coughing workers are much less politically dangerous than unemployed workers. That's a key reason why China's 10th five-year plan, which began in 2000, called for a 10 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide in China's air -- and when that plan concluded in 2005, sulfur dioxide pollution in China had increased by 27 percent. 
 But if China is having a hard time cleaning up its nitrogen and sulfur oxides -- which can be done relatively cheaply by adding scrubbers to the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants -- imagine what will happen when it comes to asking China to curb its CO2, of which China is now the world's second-largest emitter, after America. To build a coal-fired power plant that captures, separates and safely sequesters the CO2 into the ground before it goes up the smokestack requires either an expensive retrofit or a whole new system. That new system would cost about 40 percent more to build and operate -- and would produce 20 percent less electricity, according to a recent M.I.T. study, ''The Future of Coal.'' 
 China -- which is constructing the equivalent of two 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants every week -- is not going to pay that now. Remember: CO2 is an invisible, odorless, tasteless gas. Yes, it causes global warming -- but it doesn't hurt anyone in China today, and getting rid of it is costly and has no economic payoff. China's strategy right now is to say that CO2 is the West's problem. ''It must be pointed out that climate change has been caused by the long-term historic emissions of developed countries and their high per-capita emissions,'' Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry, declared in February. ''Developed countries bear an unshirkable responsibility.''
 So now we come to the nub of the issue: Green will not go down Main Street America unless it also goes down Main Street China, India and Brazil. And for green to go Main Street in these big developing countries, the prices of clean power alternatives -- wind, biofuels, nuclear, solar or coal sequestration -- have to fall to the ''China price.'' The China price is basically the price China pays for coal-fired electricity today because China is not prepared to pay a premium now, and sacrifice growth and stability, just to get rid of the CO2 that comes from burning coal. 
 ''The 'China price' is the fundamental benchmark that everyone is looking to satisfy,'' said Curtis Carlson, C.E.O. of SRI International, which is developing alternative energy technologies. ''Because if the Chinese have to pay 10 percent more for energy, when they have tens of millions of people living under $1,000 a year, it is not going to happen.'' Carlson went on to say: ''We have an enormous amount of new innovation we must put in place before we can get to a price that China and India will be able to pay. But this is also an opportunity.'' V.
 The only way we are going to get innovations that drive energy costs down to the China price -- innovations in energy-saving appliances, lights and building materials and in non-CO2-emitting power plants and fuels -- is by mobilizing free-market capitalism. The only thing as powerful as Mother Nature is Father Greed. To a degree, the market is already at work on this project -- because some venture capitalists and companies understand that clean-tech is going to be the next great global industry. Take Wal-Mart. The world's biggest retailer woke up several years ago, its C.E.O. Lee Scott told me, and realized that with regard to the environment its customers ''had higher expectations for us than we had for ourselves.'' So Scott hired a sustainability expert, Jib Ellison, to tutor the company. The first lesson Ellison preached was that going green was a whole new way for Wal-Mart to cut costs and drive its profits. As Scott recalled it, Ellison said to him, ''Lee, the thing you have to think of is all this stuff that people don't want you to put into the environment is waste -- and you're paying for it!''
 So Scott initiated a program to work with Wal-Mart's suppliers to reduce the sizes and materials used for all its packaging by five percent by 2013. The reductions they have made are already paying off in savings to the company. ''We created teams to work across the organization,'' Scott said. ''It was voluntary -- then you had the first person who eliminated some packaging, and someone else started showing how we could recycle more plastic, and all of a sudden it's $1 million a quarter.'' Wal-Mart operates 7,000 huge Class 8 trucks that get about 6 miles per gallon. It has told its truck makers that by 2015, it wants to double the efficiency of the fleet. Wal-Mart is the China of companies, so, explained Scott, ''if we place one order we can create a market'' for energy innovation.
 For instance, Wal-Mart has used its shelves to create a huge, low-cost market for compact fluorescent bulbs, which use about a quarter of the energy of incandescent bulbs to produce the same light and last 10 times as long. ''Just by doing what it does best -- saving customers money and cutting costs,'' said Glenn Prickett of Conservation International, a Wal-Mart adviser, ''Wal-Mart can have a revolutionary impact on the market for green technologies. If every one of their 100 million customers in the U.S. bought just one energy-saving compact fluorescent lamp, instead of a traditional incandescent bulb, they could cut CO2 emissions by 45 billion pounds and save more than $3 billion.''
 Those savings highlight something that often gets lost: The quickest way to get to the China price for clean power is by becoming more energy efficient. The cheapest, cleanest, nonemitting power plant in the world is the one you don't build. Helping China adopt some of the breakthrough efficiency programs that California has adopted, for instance -- like rewarding electrical utilities for how much energy they get their customers to save rather than to use -- could have a huge impact. Some experts estimate that China could cut its need for new power plants in half with aggressive investments in efficiency. 
 Yet another force driving us to the China price is Chinese entrepreneurs, who understand that while Beijing may not be ready to impose CO2 restraints, developed countries are, so this is going to be a global business -- and they want a slice. Let me introduce the man identified last year by Forbes Magazine as the seventh-richest man in China, with a fortune now estimated at $2.2 billion. His name is Shi Zhengrong and he is China's leading manufacturer of silicon solar panels, which convert sunlight into electricity.
 ''People at all levels in China have become more aware of this environment issue and alternative energy,'' said Shi, whose company, Suntech Power Holdings, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. ''Five years ago, when I started the company, people said: 'Why do we need solar? We have a surplus of coal-powered electricity.' Now it is different; now people realize that solar has a bright future. But it is still too expensive. ... We have to reduce the cost as quickly as possible -- our real competitors are coal and nuclear power.''
 Shi does most of his manufacturing in China, but sells roughly 90 percent of his products outside China, because today they are too expensive for his domestic market. But the more he can get the price down, and start to grow his business inside China, the more he can use that to become a dominant global player. Thanks to Suntech's success, in China ''there is a rush of business people entering this sector, even though we still don't have a market here,'' Shi added. ''Many government people now say, 'This is an industry!' '' And if it takes off, China could do for solar panels what it did for tennis shoes -- bring the price down so far that everyone can afford a pair. VI.
 All that sounds great -- but remember those seven wedges? To reach the necessary scale of emissions-free energy will require big clean coal or nuclear power stations, wind farms and solar farms, all connected to a national transmission grid, not to mention clean fuels for our cars and trucks. And the market alone, as presently constructed in the U.S., will not get us those alternatives at the scale we need -- at the China price -- fast enough.
 Prof. Nate Lewis, Caltech's noted chemist and energy expert, explained why with an analogy. ''Let's say you invented the first cellphone,'' he said. ''You could charge people $1,000 for each one because lots of people would be ready to pay lots of money to have a phone they could carry in their pocket.'' With those profits, you, the inventor, could pay back your shareholders and plow more into research, so you keep selling better and cheaper cellphones. 
 But energy is different, Lewis explained: ''If I come to you and say, 'Today your house lights are being powered by dirty coal, but tomorrow, if you pay me $100 more a month, I will power your house lights with solar,' you are most likely to say: 'Sorry, Nate, but I don't really care how my lights go on, I just care that they go on. I won't pay an extra $100 a month for sun power. A new cellphone improves my life. A different way to power my lights does nothing.'
 ''So building an emissions-free energy infrastructure is not like sending a man to the moon,'' Lewis went on. ''With the moon shot, money was no object -- and all we had to do was get there. But today, we already have cheap energy from coal, gas and oil. So getting people to pay more to shift to clean fuels is like trying to get funding for NASA to build a spaceship to the moon -- when Southwest Airlines already flies there and gives away free peanuts! I already have a cheap ride to the moon, and a ride is a ride. For most people, electricity is electricity, no matter how it is generated.''
 If we were running out of coal or oil, the market would steadily push the prices up, which would stimulate innovation in alternatives. Eventually there would be a crossover, and the alternatives would kick in, start to scale and come down in price. But what has happened in energy over the last 35 years is that the oil price goes up, stimulating government subsidies and some investments in alternatives, and then the price goes down, the government loses interest, the subsidies expire and the investors in alternatives get wiped out. 
 The only way to stimulate the scale of sustained investment in research and development of non-CO2 emitting power at the China price is if the developed countries, who can afford to do so, force their people to pay the full climate, economic and geopolitical costs of using gasoline and dirty coal. Those countries that have signed the Kyoto Protocol are starting to do that. But America is not.
 Up to now, said Lester Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute, we as a society ''have been behaving just like Enron the company at the height of its folly.'' We rack up stunning profits and G.D.P. numbers every year, and they look great on paper ''because we've been hiding some of the costs off the books.'' If we don't put a price on the CO2 we're building up or on our addiction to oil, we'll never nurture the innovation we need.
 Jeffrey Immelt, the chairman of General Electric, has worked for G.E. for 25 years. In that time, he told me, he has seen seven generations of innovation in G.E.'s medical equipment business -- in devices like M.R.I.s or CT scans -- because health care market incentives drove the innovation. In power, it's just the opposite. ''Today, on the power side,'' he said, ''we're still selling the same basic coal-fired power plants we had when I arrived. They're a little cleaner and more efficient now, but basically the same.'' 
 The one clean power area where G.E. is now into a third generation is wind turbines, ''thanks to the European Union,'' Immelt said. Countries like Denmark, Spain and Germany imposed standards for wind power on their utilities and offered sustained subsidies, creating a big market for wind-turbine manufacturers in Europe in the 1980s, when America abandoned wind because the price of oil fell. ''We grew our wind business in Europe,'' Immelt said.
 As things stand now in America, Immelt said, ''the market does not work in energy.'' The multibillion-dollar scale of investment that a company like G.E. is being asked to make in order to develop new clean-power technologies or that a utility is being asked to make in order to build coal sequestration facilities or nuclear plants is not going to happen at scale -- unless they know that coal and oil are going to be priced high enough for long enough that new investments will not be undercut in a few years by falling fossil fuel prices. ''Carbon has to have a value,'' Immelt emphasized. ''Today in the U.S. and China it has no value.''
 I recently visited the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear plant with Christopher Crane, president of Exelon Nuclear, which owns the facility. He said that if Exelon wanted to start a nuclear plant today, the licensing, design, planning and building requirements are so extensive it would not open until 2015 at the earliest. But even if Exelon got all the approvals, it could not start building ''because the cost of capital for a nuclear plant today is prohibitive.'' 
 That's because the interest rate that any commercial bank would charge on a loan for a nuclear facility would be so high -- because of all the risks of lawsuits or cost overruns -- that it would be impossible for Exelon to proceed. A standard nuclear plant today costs about $3 billion per unit. The only way to stimulate more nuclear power innovation, Crane said, would be federal loan guarantees that would lower the cost of capital for anyone willing to build a new nuclear plant.
 The 2005 energy bill created such loan guarantees, but the details still have not been worked out. ''We would need a robust loan guarantee program to jump-start the nuclear industry,'' Crane said -- an industry that has basically been frozen since the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. With cheaper money, added Crane, CO2-free nuclear power could be ''very competitive'' with CO2-emitting pulverized coal.
 Think about the implications. Three Mile Island had two reactors, TMI-2, which shut down because of the 1979 accident, and TMI-1, which is still operating today, providing clean electricity with virtually no CO2 emissions for 800,000 homes. Had the TMI-2 accident not happened, it too would have been providing clean electricity for 800,000 homes for the last 28 years. Instead, that energy came from CO2-emitting coal, which, by the way, still generates 50 percent of America's electricity.
 Similar calculations apply to ethanol production. ''We have about 100 scientists working on cellulosic ethanol,'' Chad Holliday, the C.E.O. of DuPont, told me. ''My guess is that we could double the number and add another 50 to start working on how to commercialize it. It would probably cost us less than $100 million to scale up. But I am not ready to do that. I can guess what it will cost me to make it and what the price will be, but is the market going to be there? What are the regulations going to be? Is the ethanol subsidy going to be reduced? Will we put a tax on oil to keep ethanol competitive? If I know that, it gives me a price target to go after. Without that, I don't know what the market is and my shareholders don't know how to value what I am doing. ... You need some certainty on the incentives side and on the market side, because we are talking about multiyear investments, billions of dollars, that will take a long time to take off, and we won't hit on everything.''
 Summing up the problem, Immelt of G.E. said the big energy players are being asked ''to take a 15-minute market signal and make a 40-year decision and that just doesn't work. ... The U.S. government should decide: What do we want to have happen? How much clean coal, how much nuclear and what is the most efficient way to incentivize people to get there?''
 He's dead right. The market alone won't work. Government's job is to set high standards, let the market reach them and then raise the standards more. That's how you get scale innovation at the China price. Government can do this by imposing steadily rising efficiency standards for buildings and appliances and by stipulating that utilities generate a certain amount of electricity from renewables -- like wind or solar. Or it can impose steadily rising mileage standards for cars or a steadily tightening cap-and-trade system for the amount of CO2 any factory or power plant can emit. Or it can offer loan guarantees and fast-track licensing for anyone who wants to build a nuclear plant. Or -- my preference and the simplest option -- it can impose a carbon tax that will stimulate the market to move away from fuels that emit high levels of CO2 and invest in those that don't. Ideally, it will do all of these things. But whichever options we choose, they will only work if they are transparent, simple and long-term -- with zero fudging allowed and with regulatory oversight and stiff financial penalties for violators.
 The politician who actually proved just how effective this can be was a guy named George W. Bush, when he was governor of Texas. He pushed for and signed a renewable energy portfolio mandate in 1999. The mandate stipulated that Texas power companies had to produce 2,000 new megawatts of electricity from renewables, mostly wind, by 2009. What happened? A dozen new companies jumped into the Texas market and built wind turbines to meet the mandate, so many that the 2,000-megawatt goal was reached in 2005. So the Texas Legislature has upped the mandate to 5,000 megawatts by 2015, and everyone knows they will beat that too because of how quickly wind in Texas is becoming competitive with coal. Today, thanks to Governor Bush's market intervention, Texas is the biggest wind state in America. 
 President Bush, though, is no Governor Bush. (The Dick Cheney effect?) President Bush claims he's protecting American companies by not imposing tough mileage, conservation or clean power standards, but he's actually helping them lose the race for the next great global industry. Japan has some of the world's highest gasoline taxes and stringent energy efficiency standards for vehicles -- and it has the world's most profitable and innovative car company, Toyota. That's no accident.
 The politicians who best understand this are America's governors, some of whom have started to just ignore Washington, set their own energy standards and reap the benefits for their states. As Schwarzenegger told me, ''We have seen in California so many companies that have been created that work just on things that have do with clean environment.'' California's state-imposed efficiency standards have resulted in per-capita energy consumption in California remaining almost flat for the last 30 years, while in the rest of the country it has gone up 50 percent. ''There are a lot of industries that are exploding right now because of setting these new standards,'' he said. VII.
 John Dineen runs G.E. Transportation, which makes locomotives. His factory is in Erie, Pa., and employs 4,500 people. When it comes to the challenges from cheap labor markets, Dineen likes to say, ''Our little town has trade surpluses with China and Mexico.''
 Now how could that be? China makes locomotives that are 30 percent cheaper than G.E.'s, but it turns out that G.E.'s are the most energy efficient in the world, with the lowest emissions and best mileage per ton pulled -- ''and they don't stop on the tracks,'' Dineen added. So China is also buying from Erie -- and so are Brazil, Mexico and Kazakhstan. What's the secret? The China price.
 ''We made it very easy for them,'' said Dineen. ''By producing engines with lower emissions in the classic sense (NOx [nitrogen oxides]) and lower emissions in the future sense (CO2) and then coupling it with better fuel efficiency and reliability, we lowered the total life-cycle cost.''
 The West can't impose its climate or pollution standards on China, Dineen explained, but when a company like G.E. makes an engine that gets great mileage, cuts pollution and, by the way, emits less CO2, China will be a buyer. ''If we were just trying to export lower-emission units, and they did not have the fuel benefits, we would lose,'' Dineen said. ''But when green is made green -- improved fuel economies coupled with emissions reductions -- we see very quick adoption rates.''
 One reason G.E. Transportation got so efficient was the old U.S. standard it had to meet on NOx pollution, Dineen said. It did that through technological innovation. And as oil prices went up, it leveraged more technology to get better mileage. The result was a cleaner, more efficient, more exportable locomotive. Dineen describes his factory as a ''technology campus'' because, he explains, ''it looks like a 100-year-old industrial site, but inside those 100-year-old buildings are world-class engineers working on the next generation's technologies.'' He also notes that workers in his factory make nearly twice the average in Erie -- by selling to China!
 The bottom line is this: Clean-tech plays to America's strength because making things like locomotives lighter and smarter takes a lot of knowledge -- not cheap labor. That's why embedding clean-tech into everything we design and manufacture is a way to revive America as a manufacturing power.
 ''Whatever you are making, if you can add a green dimension to it -- making it more efficient, healthier and more sustainable for future generations -- you have a product that can't just be made cheaper in India or China,'' said Andrew Shapiro, founder of GreenOrder, an environmental business-strategy group. ''If you just create a green ghetto in your company, you miss it. You have to figure out how to integrate green into the DNA of your whole business.''
 Ditto for our country, which is why we need a Green New Deal -- one in which government's role is not funding projects, as in the original New Deal, but seeding basic research, providing loan guarantees where needed and setting standards, taxes and incentives that will spawn 1,000 G.E. Transportations for all kinds of clean power.
 Bush won't lead a Green New Deal, but his successor must if America is going to maintain its leadership and living standard. Unfortunately, today's presidential hopefuls are largely full of hot air on the climate-energy issue. Not one of them is proposing anything hard, like a carbon or gasoline tax, and if you think we can deal with these huge problems without asking the American people to do anything hard, you're a fool or a fraud.
 Being serious starts with reframing the whole issue -- helping Americans understand, as the Carnegie Fellow David Rothkopf puts it, ''that we're not 'post-Cold War' anymore -- we're pre-something totally new.'' I'd say we're in the ''pre-climate war era.'' Unless we create a more carbon-free world, we will not preserve the free world. Intensifying climate change, energy wars and petroauthoritarianism will curtail our life choices and our children's opportunities every bit as much as Communism once did for half the planet. 
 Equally important, presidential candidates need to help Americans understand that green is not about cutting back. It's about creating a new cornucopia of abundance for the next generation by inventing a whole new industry. It's about getting our best brains out of hedge funds and into innovations that will not only give us the clean-power industrial assets to preserve our American dream but also give us the technologies that billions of others need to realize their own dreams without destroying the planet. It's about making America safer by breaking our addiction to a fuel that is powering regimes deeply hostile to our values. And, finally, it's about making America the global environmental leader, instead of laggard, which as Schwarzenegger argues would ''create a very powerful side product.'' Those who dislike America because of Iraq, he explained, would at least be able to say, ''Well, I don't like them for the war, but I do like them because they show such unbelievable leadership -- not just with their blue jeans and hamburgers but with the environment. People will love us for that. That's not existing right now.''
 In sum, as John Hennessy, the president of Stanford, taught me: Confronting this climate-energy issue is the epitome of what John Gardner, the founder of Common Cause, once described as ''a series of great opportunities disguised as insoluble problems.''
 Am I optimistic? I want to be. But I am also old-fashioned. I don't believe the world will effectively address the climate-energy challenge without America, its president, its government, its industry, its markets and its people all leading the parade. Green has to become part of America's DNA. We're getting there. Green has hit Main Street -- it's now more than a hobby -- but it's still less than a new way of life. 
 Why? Because big transformations -- women's suffrage, for instance -- usually happen when a lot of aggrieved people take to the streets, the politicians react and laws get changed. But the climate-energy debate is more muted and slow-moving. Why? Because the people who will be most harmed by the climate-energy crisis haven't been born yet. 
 ''This issue doesn't pit haves versus have-nots,'' notes the Johns Hopkins foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum, ''but the present versus the future -- today's generation versus its kids and unborn grandchildren.'' Once the Geo-Green interest group comes of age, especially if it is after another 9/11 or Katrina, Mandelbaum said, ''it will be the biggest interest group in history -- but by then it could be too late.'' 
 An unusual situation like this calls for the ethic of stewardship. Stewardship is what parents do for their kids: think about the long term, so they can have a better future. It is much easier to get families to do that than whole societies, but that is our challenge. In many ways, our parents rose to such a challenge in World War II -- when an entire generation mobilized to preserve our way of life. That is why they were called the Greatest Generation. Our kids will only call us the Greatest Generation if we rise to our challenge and become the Greenest Generation.

HEADLINE: Can Poor People Be Taught to Save?

 BODY:
I would not deny poor people the satisfaction that comes with effective money management and savings (Rachel Louise Snyder, April 1). But I see little to celebrate in America Saves, where the daily deprivation of what most Americans take for granted (sweets and bread, for example) is necessary for a minimum-wage earner to accumulate even a small savings account. What kind of security can those meager savings buy for such times of real need as unemployment, retirement and health crises? Let's address the frugality training to the privileged, whose excessive consumption withdraws money from the public good and deteriorates our environment. 
 Susan M. Hartmann 
 Professor of History, Ohio State University
 Fellow, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars
 Washington A few years ago, I took a group of college juniors and seniors from our church on a ''mission'' trip to Ashe County, N.C., to fix up houses of the poor people who lived there. One group spent most of the week working on a house that needed demolition more than repairs, except it was home to an elderly couple who had little else in the world. She had diabetes, and he was crippled by arthritis. The students repaired a rickety pair of front steps, patched holes in a rusted tin roof, replaced rotted floor boards, adjusted the front door so that it could be closed and replaced several windowpanes.
 When it was time to leave, the husband and wife gathered outside with the students and led the singing of a couple of hymns. ''We have a little something to thank you for helping us,'' she said, handing the students two oranges. ''We got them as a Christmas gift and were saving them for a special occasion. We want you to enjoy them.'' It's hard to believe that poor people don't know how to save. They save what is valuable and spend when it counts the most. Andrew Dobelstein

HEADLINE: Another Angle On the V-Twins

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
IN the revival of Italian motorcycle brands in recent years -- Ducati most notably, but Aprilia, Laverda and MV Agusta as well -- the make with the greatest reserve of emotional equity in the United States may be Moto Guzzi. American enthusiasts often regard Moto Guzzi as Italy's Harley-Davidson, with just as much character and attitude (though a much smaller product line). 
 Moto Guzzi has rightly been renowned for its V-twin engines, much as Harley has. Like Harley the company, Moto Guzzi has survived multiple financial crises. Aprilia, a maker of motorcycles and scooters, saved Moto Guzzi in 2000, announced development of new bikes, then collapsed itself. More recently, Moto Guzzi (and Aprilia) was rescued by the Piaggio Group, the scooter maker.
The immediate result has been the introduction of a new family of bikes that give Moto Guzzi an invigorated presence on the international stage. This line includes the Norge 1200 touring bike, the Breva 1100 unadorned version and the Griso 1100, called a techno-custom because of its many styling adornments. I test-rode the fashion-forward Griso, in blood-red paint worthy of a Ferrari.
 The lean 473-pound Griso features an exposed twin-spar frame that serves not just as a rock-solid platform for the mechanicals, but also as a wrap-around showcase for Italian design. 
 The Griso handles as precisely as an Aprilia sport bike, but the big differentiator is its 1,064 cc engine, with cylinders poking out left and right in Guzzi tradition, rather than the front-and-back layout of a Harley or Ducati twin. It makes a delightful whump-whump -- like a helicopter -- as it authoritatively delivers 88 rambunctious horses to the pavement.
 It's a sound that should stir the hearts of Guzzi lovers, at least those with $13,490 -- until the next financial crisis. JERRY GARRETT

HEADLINE: Sinking Your Money Into a Rental

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
PEOPLE buying a co-op or condo think nothing of putting in a new kitchen, adding a bathroom or moving a wall. They know that the work will only increase the property's value.
 Renters, on the other hand, will not spend a penny to improve an apartment because they know that someday they will leave it all behind. And unless they're rent-regulated -- and, these days, sometimes even if they are -- they have no idea how long they can stay in one place.
That, at least, is the conventional wisdom.
 But some renters have very clear ideas about how they want to live. And they will not let a lease or even market-rate rents get in the way. To them, sinking $5,000, $30,000, even $100,000 into their rental is money well spent. 
 When they signed the lease for a duplex they wanted in Greenwich Village three years ago, T. R. Pescod and Tim O'Brien knew that it would have to be gutted to suit them. It took four months and $100,000 to turn the apartment into the kind of home they wanted.
 ''The place was a mess, but the bones of the apartment were great,'' said Mr. O'Brien, a hedge fund manager. ''We looked at dozens of apartments to rent and buy, and we knew the value in this place, and if you amortize the cost of what we did over four years, it made sense economically.'' 
 They first signed a two-year lease at $7,000 a month and then took an option to renew for another two years at $7,700. Other apartments they looked at rented for as much as $20,000 a month. Although they didn't have an exact timetable, they figured their money would be better spent on renovating where they knew they could stay for at least four years. 
 ''We didn't sharpen our pencils to the month,'' Mr. O'Brien said. ''But looking at what else was out there, it was the choice between renovated space that wasn't done well or in a way we liked and the opportunity to put our own mark on this.''
 With vacancy rates for Manhattan rentals hovering around 1 percent, the scarcity may lead more renters to lease apartments that need work, make a deal with their landlords and then subsequently do the work themselves. 
 Mr. Pescod oversaw the work on the Greenwich Village duplex, which included putting in a new kitchen and two new bathrooms, building a closet in the second bedroom, installing new light fixtures throughout the apartment, putting a new awning on one of the terraces, building covers for all the radiators, replacing moldings, sanding the floors and painting the entire space. The result was a meticulously renovated apartment that gracefully maintains the character of the 19th-century brownstone. 
 Mr. Pescod, a model and actor, said that the decision to renovate was a very visceral one for him. ''For me, this was all about the upstairs,'' he said, referring to the top-floor master bedroom, which has a soaring ceiling, two terraces and a fireplace. ''It's an amazing space that's flooded with light.''
 It didn't hurt, of course, that both men are serial renovators who have redesigned other apartments in Manhattan and houses in Southampton. 
 ''Ultimately, you're creating your home,'' Mr. Pescod said. ''You have to put that into the opportunity cost, too, because we were able to make this into a warm space that we can call our own.''
 Friends thought they were crazy, he recalled, ''but once they saw it and the benefits of living here in this unique space, they understood.'' Mr. O'Brien said their landlady, Roberta Russell, was very open to their ideas and even agreed to chip in $10,000 for one of the bathrooms, which she had intended to fix for some time. They shared all their plans with her and showed her samples of materials along the way. The only thing that gave her pause, Mr. Pescod said, was the new closet, which she feared would take up too much space and might make the apartment harder to rent to new tenants.
 Ms. Russell said that she and her husband, Harold Krieger, were very happy with the renovations. They own several brownstones in the Village and Chelsea and other property in upstate New York. 
 ''We felt very lucky,'' she said. ''They had impeccable taste, and they had the discretionary income and the time to build it to suit, so it was worth it to them.''
 But not all renovations are so successful. ''We weren't always this lucky,'' Ms. Russell said. She said that she and her husband once had tenants who were months behind in their rent and went ahead with major renovations without permission. 
 ''It was beautiful for them, but not good for the landlord because the changes were very unique to their lifestyle,'' she recalled. ''So when they left, we had to pay to undo what they had done.'' The tenants had removed walls and created a sunken media room, among other things, she said.
 As landlords go, Ms. Russell is probably more flexible than most in allowing Mr. Pescod and Mr. O'Brien to do as much work as they did. 
 Landlords typically frown on tenants' doing their own renovations and generally require that apartments be returned to their original condition, with some allowances for wear and tear. Some building owners strongly advise against allowing renters to renovate. Frank Ricci, a spokesman for the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords' group, said: ''For a renter, it would be foolish unless they have an ironclad contract that they can stay there for a set period of time. And speaking as an owner, I would not want a tenant, who has no financial stake in a building, contracting to do major work. I just wouldn't recommend it."
 Ogden CAP Properties, which owns and manages several very large Manhattan apartment buildings, allows major changes only with written consent. 
 ''Some things could be considered an improvement that I could keep,'' said John McDermott, Ogden's senior manager for rental buildings. ''But not everybody's taste is the same, so in other cases, the tenant is responsible for putting things back the way they were.''
 Amanda Miller, who lives in an Upper West Side building owned by Ogden, said that when she eventually moves out of her $3,000-a-month one-bedroom apartment, she will have no problem returning it to its original state. ''Nothing I've done is permanent,'' she said. ''But everything I've done was designed to make this feel like a home. There's no point in having a place that feels like a hospital room.''
 Ms. Miller, a public relations executive, said she had spent about $4,500 to paint every room of her apartment, to replace the generic light fixtures with ones more to her liking, to retrofit three walk-in closets for her collection of vintage clothes and to build a closet for her 200-plus pairs of shoes.
 What she has done certainly makes her apartment distinctive in an otherwise standard postwar building. The living room is painted claret red, the kitchen is pumpkin orange, the bedroom is pink, and the bathroom is a bright turquoise. She has a crystal chandelier in the bedroom, a Moroccan lamp in the hall and, in the living room, sconces that look like hands holding up torches. 
 ''Just because I'm 28 and maybe not a real grown-up quite yet doesn't mean I can't create an environment for myself,'' she said. ''I go with this apartment, or maybe this apartment goes with me.''
 Ms. Miller's mother, Linda, said she was happy to help her daughter put her mark on the apartment and helped pay for some of the work. ''So many people live in rentals in a temporary state of suspension, thinking: 'Maybe I'll only be a here a year,' or 'Maybe I'll fall in love or get a job,' '' she said. ''But it should be about this being your moment and enjoying it rightnow.''
 Just as Ms. Miller's renovations largely revolved around her need to accommodate her passion for collecting vintage shoes and clothes, Ben Schechter and his partner, George Barimo, put about $30,000 into their East Side apartment to accommodate their art and antiques. 
 Mr. Schechter and Mr. Barimo have lived in their rent-stabilized apartment for 11 years and pay less than $2,000 a month, but they have been residents in the building since 1968 and put just as much work into their previous apartment. They both said they would have redone the apartments even if they had been paying market-rate rents.
 ''The world is so abrasive out there, I want to be able to leave the streets and be surrounded by things that are handcrafted and beautiful,'' Mr. Schechter said. ''This is an oasis for us.''
 The renovations included putting up Sheetrock over a wall of glass brick that they found unappealing, building walls to partly enclose the living room and to create more wall space for their art, installing a decorative fireplace and 19th-century columns, and adding a hall closet and a wall of built-in shelves in the bedroom. 
 ''A lot of the changes were made to accommodate our collecting,'' said Mr. Schechter, a retired theater designer. ''We had to personalize the space because an apartment should really be a backdrop for people, a place where they can feel comfortable.''
 Mr. Barimo said that over the years, they have had opportunities to buy other apartments but opted instead for a country house in upstate New York. Mr. Barimo is a television producer and said that when the ''Tonight'' show moved to Los Angeles in 1972, he could have bought Doc Severinsen's three-bedroom apartment on Riverside Drive for $38,000. And Mr. Schechter said there was a nine-room apartment that had been offered to them for $125,000 during the 1970s.
 ''We have no regrets because we never minded renting,'' Mr. Schechter said. ''In the end, what do you really own? We're all just custodians of what we have.''
 Finally, in a stratosphere all their own are buildings like the Waldorf Towers. There, rents range from $15,000 a month for a one-bedroom to $130,000 a month for a penthouse, and renovation requests are handled on a case-by-case basis, according to Margaret Bay, the broker from Brown Harris Stevens who handles all the building's rentals. Apartments there have been home to the likes of Cole Porter, Frank Sinatra and Mamie Eisenhower.
 In one $130,000-a-month apartment rented by a corporation, the tenant put an estimated $1 million into renovations, Ms. Bay said. The work included a new kitchen and the redesign of an entry rotunda with elaborate marble accents and murals of a Tuscan village. Nothing was done without the building's approval, and when the corporation recently moved out after 15 years there, the Waldorf Towers wound up buying most of the furnishings. 
 Ms. Bay said another resident, whom she described as a Park Avenue socialite, completely renovated her six-bedroom apartment and then asked if she could install a lap pool. 
 ''We worked on it for about a year to see if it could be done safely,'' she said. ''We tried to accommodate her, but it just couldn't be done.''

HEADLINE: Credit Unions: The Silent Source

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AS a result of the subprime lending crisis, even borrowers with good credit are struggling to find lenders willing to give them mortgages. Those with less-than-stellar credit scores face even more difficult times.
 But if borrowers look in unexpected places, their efforts can yield pleasant returns.
Take credit unions, for example. These institutions, which are run as nonprofit cooperatives, typically do not have enough money to market their mortgage offerings, and their mortgages are not offered through outside brokers. So consumers often overlook some highly useful alternatives that credit unions offer. 
 About 200 credit unions affiliated with the Credit Union National Association have offered a low-interest Home Loan Payment Relief mortgage since late 2005. The program is limited, with some exceptions, to borrowers with household incomes at or below their area's median income. 
 In specific high-cost areas like New York and northern New Jersey, credit unions will make loans to people whose incomes exceed the median. In the New York City area, for example, those earning 165 percent of the median household income of $70,900 can qualify, so the loans are available to households earning $116,985 or less.
 The loans, available at seven New York credit unions and one each in New Jersey and Connecticut, carry initial interest rates one percentage point below those of mainstream lenders. Only credit union members may apply; joining usually requires a minimum deposit of $25 or so.
 The payment-relief loans are available with both fixed and adjustable rates. The rate for the 30-year payment-relief mortgage earlier this month was 5.25 percent, with the rate increasing to 6.25 percent after three years, regardless of how high rates have climbed in the interim.
 The adjustable-rate payment-relief loan works in a similar fashion. The introductory rate earlier this month stood at 5.25 percent. Those who qualify for the mortgage will retain that rate for three years, when the rate can increase by one percentage point per year, depending on short-term interest rate fluctuations. 
 The adjustable-rate payment-relief loan has a lifetime interest rate cap five percentage points higher than the initial rate. More information, including a list of participating institutions, is at the Web site cuna.org/initiatives/hlpr/. 
 Bill Hampel, the chief economist at the Credit Union National Association, said credit unions could make such loans because they were forsaking the profit that mainstream institutions make. 
 ''Since credit unions are nonprofit cooperatives, they don't have to pay federal income taxes or pay dividends to stockholders, so they can offer better deals,'' Mr. Hampel said. ''That's also why they don't have any incentive to talk someone into taking out a shaky loan.''
 Gianni and Christine Trivigno financed the house they bought in December in Babylon, on Long Island, with a credit-union mortgage. Mr. Trivigno said the couple's credit score was ''in the 640-650 range.'' At that level, lenders often charge higher interest rates than for those with higher scores. 
 Through the Bethpage Federal Credit Union, Mr. Trivigno found an adjustable-rate payment-relief mortgage for a full percentage point lower than those offered by two banks and a mortgage broker. 
 Compared with those other mortgages, Mr. Trivigno said, the credit union loan for his two-bedroom $352,000 house saved him $900 to $1,200 in his monthly payments, and closing costs were also lower. 
 ''It was a really great experience all around, because it wasn't like they were trying to get us into a loan that might not be good for us,'' Mr. Trivigno said. ''I don't know if I'd have known about it if I wasn't a credit union member. How would you know? It's not like they're putting ads in the newspaper every day.''

HEADLINE: Me! Me! Me! All the Way Home

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
EVERYBODY has been telling me something I'm not too excited about. Namely, that to get a good deal on a new condo one has to commit to a space before the building has even been topped off. That explains why developers spend oodles of money not only on mock-ups of rooms but also on elaborate marketing plans that highlight future amenities -- even if there's not a corner deli in sight in the neighborhood. 
 Nowhere else does this seem to have been done with such elan as at the William Beaver House, Andre Balazs's 47-story, 319-unit tower at 15 William Street in the financial district.
The building is where William and Beaver Streets meet -- hence the name and the inspiration for the jaunty, cute, key-toting beaver that is the mascot of the project. 
 ''The fur trade is part of the original economy of the area, and there's some tongue-in-cheek going on here,'' explained Calvin Tsao, a partner in the Manhattan architectural firm of Tsao & McKown, which designed the interiors of the building, to be ready for occupancy in the spring of 2008. The architectural firm of record is SLCE Architects.
 Mr. Tsao was enthusiastic about showing off what he considers one of his most ambitious projects to date. 
 I had gotten out of a cab at the triangular site, where a huge crane reached up to the sky, but the building was nowhere to be seen. Down the street -- and across a windswept plaza where a striking Dubuffet sculpture made me feel as if I were in Chicago -- I entered the sales office at 6 Hanover Street. 
 Now that is one fabulous space. Cappuccinos are served during the day, drinks at night, in what was once a bank and now functions as the backdrop for a model of the building and full-size mock-ups of a kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. 
 I was getting excited, but at the same time I was distracted by a video over the bar that mixed images of the building and its amenities with scenes of rushing woodland streams (remember the beaver?). I tried to concentrate on Mr. Tsao's rather refreshing soft-sell approach and sober explanation of the project. 
 ''This property was not on most of our radar, but with the exception of China, New York is the only place where entire neighborhoods will be reimagined,'' Mr. Tsao said. The William Beaver, he added, is going up on a site ''where a building had been torn down years ago and had more recently been an empty parking lot -- the new building is positioned so you can look all the way down William Street and to the water.'' 
 Now water views are something I would give up lots of other things for, so I was sort of surprised when Mr. Tsao said without hesitation: ''This building is absolutely not for you. Its target is a younger, more mobile community.'' 
 He was right, I guess. But somehow, as soon as someone says that something is not for me, it just makes me all the more interested. 
 ''Most of the units are small,'' Mr. Tsao continued. ''They are for people who travel, maybe not for families, as there's nothing like Central Park near here, and the Battery is quite far. They are for a new generation that love living in hotel rooms.'' 
 Now just hold on, Calvin, I wanted to shout. You may not know me all that well, but Calvin, that's me! Me! Me! I love everything about hotels -- especially room service, or any kind of service. And I'm particularly partial to Mr. Balazs's hotels. 
 Mr. Tsao continued listing the building's future amenities -- and I was loving most of them: an upscale deli on the ground floor (that really caught my fancy); a spacious gym with an outdoor terrace; on-site parking and a garage; a screening room; an indoor pool; a covered dog run (with luck, our elderly cairn terrier will live long enough to enjoy it).
 I loved, loved, loved all those things -- and was not entirely immune to the handball court and half basketball court. 
 ''The building is a vertically integrated village, a very self-sufficient place to live,'' Mr. Tsao added, pointing out the comfy lounge area with its meandering sofas where I was enjoying my second espresso. 
 ''We're romancing the public areas -- where people can interact,'' he said, ''and trying to create a lobby that's a series of lounges you can use.'' I get that -- the large lobby where you can see the world come and go, as if you were a permanent guest in a grand hotel -- a hip, modern grand hotel.
 Maybe some of those mobile people who are on their way somewhere glamorous will be able to stop and interact with those of us who may be just over their age limit.
 Unaware of my geriatric thoughts, Mr. Tsao continued: ''Design is not only what you see -- it's planning with good DNA. The building is based on catching views and light. It's like a building in Hong Kong that is a sapling, a little tree, straining for light.'' 
 We walk over to the mock-up of a kitchen-dining area, past the seductive model with its apartments like ribbons encircling the tall structure. There are practically no apartments facing west; rather, most have been positioned to get the most light and views in a part of the city that is densely built.
 ''We wanted to create a tall building that did not look like an office building,'' Mr. Tsao said, pointing out the way the exterior was conceived as two giant vertical folds, or pleats. ''We're reviving early Modernist ideas,'' he said. ''This is our Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe moment -- modernity that has a civic heart.'' 
 I was moving toward the mock-up of the kitchen and dining area where neat sliding panels hide a home office and a chopping block slips smoothly over the sink. ''Not innovation for innovation's sake,'' Mr. Tsao said, ''but keeping things simple so you can do your own thing.'' 
 I appreciated the smoothness of the Corian counters, and in the adjacent bedroom area, the recessed blinds in the tall windows and the louvered doors that separated the bedroom from the spacious bathrooms. 
 ''The bed and bath are en suite,'' Mr. Tsao said. ''That's for the spa moments. You can get out of the tub and be right in the bedroom.'' 
 There's also a large glassed-in shower and a separate toilet, as well as a nice pullout drawer under the single sink. Now that's a surprise. As far as I knew, two sinks were de rigueur in all luxury condominium bathrooms.
 Mr. Tsao was ready. ''People don't brush their teeth side by side,'' he asserted. ''He brushes in the shower. It's a boy thing.'' 
 Well, it certainly isn't a girl thing.
 I glanced at the price list. Sales began in January. So far, 92 units have been sold. Apartments still available include 698-square-foot studios (39D is $1.115 million, 31D is $1.02 million, and the estimated common charge is $640 for each). At the top of the line, both in price and position, is the $4.25 million Penthouse 3, with 1,623 square feet, two bedrooms, two and a half baths and a terrace. The estimated common charge is about $1,500.
 Tax abatements for the apartments are alluring. Without them, the estimated yearly taxes would be about $1,200 for most one-bedrooms, but with the abatements, they would be under $75. For the penthouse, the taxes would be about $2,400 without the abatement but only $113 with it. 
 Sales seem to be brisk. Probably too brisk for me to take action quickly. All I can think now is, drat. I seem to be missing this particular real estate boat again, but this time in more ways than one. 
 Oh well. Maybe I just have to play with people my own age.

HEADLINE: Kimberly Young, Stefano Rivella

 BODY:
Kimberly Marie Young, the daughter of Ada Ortuzar-Young and Roger Young of Cedar Knolls, N.J., was married last evening to Stefano Rivella, the son of Liliana Perta Curtis of Cervaro, Italy, and Attilio Rivella of Turin, Italy. Mary Beaty, a chaplain of the American Humanist Association, officiated at the Angel Orensanz Foundation in New York. 
 Ms. Young, 26, is keeping her name. She is a member of a group that structures and underwrites leveraged loans in the New York investment banking unit of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. She graduated cum laude from George Washington University and received a master's degree in economics from Boston University. 
Her father retired as a senior member of the technical staff in Clifton, N.J., for ITT Avionics, the military aviation electronics division of ITT Industries; he designed software, mainly for Air Force radar jammers. Her mother is a Spanish literature professor at Drew University in Madison, N.J.
 Dr. Rivella, 40, is an assistant professor of genetic medicine at Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York, researching genetic cures for diseases of the blood. He graduated from University of Pavia in Italy, where he also received a Ph.D. in applied genetics. 
 His mother is a museum administrator providing clerical and office support to a variety of programs at the National Archaeological Museum of Cassino in Italy. His father is the owner of Abi, a firm that designs and renovates commercial properties in Turin.
 The couple's first contact came three years ago at DanceSport, a studio in New York: they exchanged meaningful glances at a tango dance called a milonga, where the stylized rituals of tango are observed. 
 ''In Argentina, you often go to the milonga by yourself and look for ladies to dance with there,'' Dr. Rivella said. ''You communicate by looking at each other. If the other person smiles back, you approach them and clarify that you want to dance with her.''
 That look -- officially called the cabaceo -- was successful and when she saw it, Ms. Young responded with an affirmative nod. 
 After that first dance, which included several numbers, they went on to other partners, but the bride said, ''When we were rotating partners, I noticed that he was trying to cut in line and maneuver his last partner closer to me. Then we started talking by the wine counter, and he walked me home.'' 
 They began going to more milongas, at first by themselves and then together. ''It was good that we were both beginners; we would practice together,'' said Ms. Young, who had been an exchange student in Argentina during high school and college, but had taken only one lesson there. 
 On Valentine's day two years ago, Dr. Rivella told Ms. Young to get her passport and suitcase for the weekend and meet him at the subway station from which they went to Kennedy Airport. 
 ''When we passed through customs, she realized we were going to Paris,'' he said. 
 ''After dinner at the Eiffel Tower, I proposed. The Italians don't have the tradition of diamond rings, so I proposed with a photocopy of a ring to be sure she liked it.'' 
 Her reaction: ''I thought, 'Great, now I can choose my own ring,' '' she said. 
 Last September, the couple began practicing a special tango that they planned to do at the wedding, despite slight shyness on Dr. Rivella's part. ''I am a professor who presents talks,'' he said, ''I am more comfortable with that than something artistic.''

HEADLINE: Alternative Tax Hits Home the Hardest

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
JOE GRECO lives with his wife, Karla, and their two children in a recently built four-bedroom home in a small hamlet in Suffolk County. Although he does not consider himself a wealthy man, Mr. Greco has joined a growing number of taxpayers across the region who find themselves paying the alternative minimum tax, which was created almost 40 years ago to make sure the nation's millionaires paid their fair share.
 ''So, I earn a decent salary,'' said Mr. Greco, 41, of St. James, who makes about $150,000 a year running a ready-mix concrete business with his father and brother. ''But my property taxes are astronomical, well into five figures. And my state income taxes are also five figures. But if you make enough to pay them, you can't deduct them.''
As a result, Mr. Greco was required to do a second calculation when filling out his 2006 federal returns, unable to claim either those deductions or the child tax credit. Since the tax owed under that formula was higher than the amount of tax that would be paid with the deductions, he had to pay the higher amount. 
 For Mr. Greco, that meant paying $5,000 to $6,000 more in taxes using the alternative minimum tax calculation. Households affected by it pay the equivalent of a flat tax of 26 or 28 percent. 
 And because the A.M.T. has never been adjusted for inflation, more and more people are finding themselves unable to use many deductions they have long relied on. 
 The alternative tax takes a disproportionate bite from the metropolitan area: One in every four of the households that pay it are in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, according to an analysis prepared by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group based in Washington.
 Starting early next year, the number of households paying the A.M.T. within the region, and around the country, will skyrocket if Congress does not change the tax code. Citizens for Tax Justice projects that number will climb to 3 million from 870,000 in the region early next year, and to 23 million nationwide, up from 3.4 million last year. 
 ''The dilemma for suburban New Yorkers is that you have to have two jobs to pay your high mortgage, to pay your high property tax, to pay your gas to go to work,'' said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of Huntington, N.Y. ''And then the federal government tells you, 'You're so rich, you have to give back your deductions.' ''
 The prospect of facing higher bills with the alternative minimum tax begins for most households when their adjusted gross income exceeds $125,000. But some making less can also get hit, based on the total amount of deductions. 
 By early next year, people earning substantially less would see their tax bills rise, including almost everyone earning more than $100,000 and about half of those making $75,000 to $100,000. The impact of the additional tax would vary from a few dollars to thousands more. 
 The average household reporting between $100,000 and $200,000 would pay $2,800 in additional federal taxes next year using the calculation for the alternative minimum tax, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. 
 The prospect of millions of their constituents suddenly seeing a sudden and substantial tax increase has members of Congress, especially those from the metropolitan region, focused on fixing the problem. 
 ''I'm going to have to answer to constituents in my own district if we don't do something,'' said Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., Democrat of Paterson, N.J., who is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 ''In 2005, there were 18,116 people eligible for the A.M.T.,'' he said, citing a study prepared for committee members on the impact of the tax in their districts. ''This year, there are 122,500-plus people in my district eligible. You don't have to be a mathematical wizard to figure this out.''
 Some members of Congress said it was unfair to consider income alone given the cost of living in the region. Can a taxpayer in the metropolitan area -- with its expensive housing, high energy costs, heavy state and local tax burden and long, costly commutes -- be regarded as wealthy because his or her income is in the five figures? 
 ''It is wrong that hard-working families in our community, who are struggling to keep up with large mortgages, increasing property taxes and the skyrocketing cost of sending children to college, must pay this exorbitant tax,'' said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester.
 Jim Isaacs, 60, who sells commercial carpet, said that he paid more under the alternative minimum tax but did not consider himself affluent. 
 ''I would be considered rich if I lived in Tuscaloosa, Ala.,'' said Mr. Isaacs, who lives in Maplewood, N.J., with his wife, Kerstin, a public relations manager for a New York City law firm.
 ''When your real estate taxes are $19,000, and when prices of homes, just because you live in the New York area, go up and up and up, you're not wealthy,'' he said.
 The New York Times examined 2004 data from the Internal Revenue Service that shows what households paid in federal tax and what was claimed in deductions, by ZIP code around the region. 
 The data showed that the households in ZIP codes whose residents had average adjusted gross income of between $140,000 and $160,000 in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut paid an average of $14,800 in state and local taxes. This compares with $8,000 in state and local taxes paid on average by households earning similar income in ZIP codes elsewhere in the country.
 Without being able to deduct those local and state taxes under the alternative minimum tax rules, the overall federal tax burden is higher for those living within ZIP codes in the metropolitan area where the average adjusted gross income was between $140,000 and $160,000. The average federal tax bill was $30,900 in those ZIP codes, compared with $29,600 for households in comparable neighborhoods elsewhere.
 ''Some of that is probably caused by the A.M.T.,'' said Gerald Prante, an analyst with the Tax Foundation, an organization based in Washington that favors lower taxes. 
 The alternative minimum tax was approved in 1969 to make sure the most affluent Americans were not using loopholes to lower their bills. It disallowed a list of deductions, including shelters like accelerated depreciation and stock options that were being used by people with very high incomes.
 ''It used to be that everyone was in these tax shelters, because the top tax rate was 70 percent,'' said Mitchell R. Zachary, head of the tax department for Grassi & Company, in Lake Success, N.Y., and Mr. Greco's accountant. ''But there were lots of loopholes.''
 Congress has put off changing the alternative minimum tax for the last several years, instead choosing temporary fixes that have kept millions from paying more when they do the second calculation. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said there was discussion about making the alternative minimum tax apply only to the highest income earners, especially, he said, those who have done well under the Bush administration's tax cuts. 
 ''We don't know whether we can do any of these, but we are talking about it,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''We can kick this can down the road another year, but it is my hope we can deal with the A.M.T. this year.''

HEADLINE: Listen Up, You Weeds and Twigs: It's April!

BYLINE: By AKIKO BUSCH

 BODY:
FOR a winter that took so long in coming, this one seems to have taken just as long to leave. Even after the snow and ice were gone, winter's residue could still be found spread across the grass in the powdery leaves and twigs, the dirt shoved by the snowplow up onto the lawn, and all the other bits of dust it left in its wake. 
 Our lawn is an uneven place to begin with. It is a combination of the broad, deep-green blades of Kentucky bluegrass and the thinner blades of fine fescue, a typical mix in this region. From time to time, we have also let the grass go to meadow, so add to that the timothy, ryegrass and patches of clover, along with the knotweed, crabgrass and dandelion, and you've got the rough texture of the common Northeastern lawn. 
At the beginning of April, though, you wouldn't know any of this. Then the lawn is a swath of brown and mottled dun, disrupted only by broad patches of a washed-out yellow. Even as the days grow longer and the lawn gets more light, it brightens in unpredictable and uneven spots. I am not much of a gardener and even less of a diagnostician. It could be snow mold that the grass suffers from, a deficiency of light, or assorted fungi, or mites and worms. I won't hazard a guess. Still, a glance out the window suggests that this is going to be one of those times when I try to take care of the problem without ever identifying exactly what it is. 
 It's not that I aspire to live on a putting green, or want to transform the lawn into a sheet of emerald velvet. Nor am I especially susceptible to the news that April is National Lawn Care Month -- or so says the Professional Lawn Care Association of America. 
 In his wide-reaching social and cultural analysis of our lawns and the industry they have spawned, ''American Green: The Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Lawn,'' Ted Steinberg attributes our lawn care mania to assorted factors like the economic imperatives of postwar consumerism, the cold war political climate, the needs of the American family, new understandings of outdoor and indoor space, and a new appreciation for bright colors. 
 That may all be true, but there is something else at work here, some innate sense that this little piece of earth that my house -- my life -- rests on should be healthy. And making it so generates an almost primal sense of accomplishment. Or in the words of Jonathan Swift, ''whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.'' 
 The first step toward that end is to rake the grass. This seems an act of faith more than anything else, as if it were possible to simply comb out all the mats and tangles of winter. But the raking sloughs off what is dead and aerates the grass as well, awakening it to the burgeoning light and warmth.
 Beyond that, though, putting the grass to rights is a complex enterprise. As so often in the garden, bringing something back to life necessarily demands a degree of brutality. The entire lawn care industry is there to assist, with its arsenal of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, all the granules, pellets and powders to kill the rodents and insects, the weeds, the moss and whatever other intrusive agents there are, all of which arrive with a strategic timing that has a near-military precision. Dandelions and other broadleaf greens that thrive in warmer temperatures come up in May, after the crabgrass that is already upon us; each plant of crabgrass has some 10,000 seeds. That has to be the first to go.
 When was the last time you got rid of 10,000 of anything? Such an extravagance of extermination is daunting, and the temptation, of course, is to let it go. There are times when indifference pays off, when neglect can be a virtue. 
 Like most people, I am prone to thinking too highly of my interventions. Rather than blanket the grass with a sea of chemicals, why not just recognize the hardy resilience of the grass? Can't it take care of itself? I've been told healthy grass can crowd out the weeds. Let the fine fescue, the knotweed, and the dandelions decide the matter in their own pastoral brawl. And who wouldn't welcome the occasional patch of clover interspersed with the bluegrass? Besides, wasn't it Emerson who asked: ''What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.'' 
 I know, too, that the grass can be renovated simply by overseeding -- that is, mowing the grass short and raking it clean, then scattering seed over what is already there in the hopes that the new seeding will germinate and fill out the sparse areas where the grass has thinned. My friend Jan Axel, who is a landscape designer in South Salem, N.Y., recommends this route, and it seems a gesture that offers greater hope than spreading a synthetic pesticide. ''Then mow high,'' she tells me. ''You're exposing less of the root system that way, so the grass needs less water.'' 
 In the end, though, I also acquiesce to something called Weed & Feed; even its simple name, brilliant in its reduction, affirms its bipolar character. And while there is something vaguely irritating about its excess of ambition, I can see it is a product that recognizes the full complexity of the task at hand; while its herbicide attacks both the crabgrass and broadleaf weeds, it nonetheless manages to replenish the grass with nitrogen. Its yellow and green bag cheerfully announces that nurturing and destroying can be simultaneous acts, with a label affirming the little riot of horticultural multitasking it is capable of: ''Kills, Thickens, Prevents,'' it reads.
 I am reminded then that April, as well as being National Lawn Care Month, also happens to be National Poetry Month. Makes sense to me. It's not just the simple rhyming in the name of this lawn care product; it's that even in its promotional language, Weed & Feed seems fully engaged with the inventive reach of imagination, the nuance of phrasing and all the subtle contradictions of thought and feeling that are expressed more routinely at the higher reaches of literature. It knows that our small patch of lawn, with its rough texture of the desired and the despised, asks at once for every part of your psyche -- generosity, indifference, ruthlessness. And that cultivating it is like taking care of anything or anyone else you love.

HEADLINE: New Phase for Decades-Old Shoreline Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER was president and global warming was unheard of in 1960 when Congress authorized a massive storm-protection project for an 83-mile stretch of Long Island's South Shore, from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point.
 Now, after decades of false starts and shelved plans, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has completed a study for the project and is discussing alternatives for proceeding with a long list of government agencies. 
 What may emerge would be the largest shoreline resculpturing project undertaken in this country, costing hundreds of millions of dollars yet still incapable of protecting barrier islands and the South Shore mainland from devastation should a monster hurricane strike, officials involved with the project say.
 The project would be designed to last for 50 years, and the Army Corps and others are grappling with how much they should factor in the rise in sea level projected by many experts because of global warming. Work would probably not begin until 2010, 50 years after it was first authorized. 
 The study now looks only at water levels over the past century. But that may change, the corps said, and the study could be expanded to consider the environmental and economic impacts of a storm in the class of Hurricane Katrina and what is now seen as the higher probability of such a storm's striking Long Island.
 While building a towering seawall the entire 83-mile length would be all that could help in severe storms, no shoreline armoring is on the table. At its most aggressive limits, the project would move mountains of sand, build dune lines, broaden beaches, jigger with inlets and set policy for what to do when breaches open in the barrier islands.
 The plan will also most likely call for reinforcing houses and other structures in flood-prone areas, removing them or moving them to safer ground. 
 All the efforts will be to reduce storm, erosion and flooding damage to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in a 71-square-mile area reaching as far inland as Montauk Highway and Sunrise Highway.
 Clifford S. Jones of the corps' New York district office, who is the reformulation project manager, said a yearlong process of reaching consensus on the best way forward had begun. He said the public would get its first inkling of what may be in store at meetings toward the end of this year or soon after. 
 ''We are winnowing down the alternatives to come up with something the corps, the state, the federal agencies, Suffolk County and the towns and villages can all agree on,'' Mr. Jones said. ''And that's going to be a huge effort.''
 The corps was accused of failing to build levees properly in New Orleans, where flooding and ruin after Katrina in 2005 have changed how the corps will proceed with future projects. 
 Corps officials will seek broad public support and scrutiny of a final plan for Long Island's South Shore. They will also submit that plan and the studies supporting it to an outside agency, which has yet to be selected, for an independent technical review.
 The study -- formally the Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study (the ''reformulation'' is from a plan rejected in 1978) -- calculates impacts from postulated storms and hurricanes and the protection that a variety of projects could provide.
 The project area, entirely in Suffolk County, encompasses ocean and bay shores and some 70 percent of Long Island's ocean beaches. It includes the 26-mile Fire Island National Seashore and its summer communities; parts of the Towns of Babylon, Islip, Brookhaven, Southampton and East Hampton; and incorporated villages.
 On Fire Island, no plan can be approved without the consent of the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the National Park Service and its Fire Island National Seashore. In the past, the corps, the Fire Island summer communities and the seashore have had very different views on what is best for the beaches.
 A ''vision statement'' that the seashore regards as a road map for any project calls for natural processes like shifting sand to be unimpeded as much as possible and for dune and long-term beach replenishment to be minimized. The seashore is also determined that no project be tailored to benefit property owners who want their houses protected. 
 Michael T. Reynolds, the seashore superintendent, said ''there will be a variety of trade-offs that will need to be made, with winners and losers both.''
 The Fire Island Association, a property owners' group, will want assurances that the project will protect the beaches fronting summer communities. Doing that, it argues, will be cheaper than paying to remove houses.
 Traditionally the federal government pays about 65 percent of the cost of shoreline projects. The state, Suffolk County and local governments would split the rest. 
 If agreement can be reached on what to do along the entire 83 miles of shore, another challenge will be financing, said Representative Timothy H. Bishop, a Democrat from Southampton. 
 ''That fight will be difficult,'' he said, ''and it's difficult to know what other fiscal realities we may be facing.'' Mr. Bishop said he did not expect an appropriation before 2010. ''If we're still in Iraq then, that may well have an impact,'' he said.
 Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat of Dix Hills, said he had assurances that the corps would release a preliminary draft by the end of 2007 and a proposed final action plan by the end of 2008. 
 ''We are beginning to see the light at the end of a 40-year tunnel,'' he said, ''but like all dark tunnels, you don't know what you have got until you come out.''

HEADLINE: Everybody Hates Don Imus

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
FAMILIAR as I am with the warp speed of media, I was still taken aback by the velocity of Don Imus's fall after he uttered an indefensible racist and sexist slur about the Rutgers women's basketball team. Even in that short span, there's been an astounding display of hypocrisy, sanctimony and self-congratulation from nearly every side of the debate, starting with Al Sharpton, who has yet to apologize for his leading role in the Tawana Brawley case, the 1980s racial melee prompted by unproven charges much like those that soiled the Duke lacrosse players. 
 It's possible that the only people in this whole sorry story who are not hypocrites are the Rutgers teammates and their coach, C. Vivian Stringer. And perhaps even Don Imus himself, who, while talking way too much about black people he has known and ill children he has helped, took full responsibility for his own catastrophic remarks and didn't try to blame the ensuing media lynching on the press, bloggers or YouTube. Unlike Mel Gibson, Michael Richards and Isaiah Washington, to take just three entertainers who have recently delivered loud religious, racial or sexual slurs, Imus didn't hire a P.R. crisis manager and ostentatiously enter rehab or undergo psychiatric counseling. ''I dished it out for a long time,'' he said on his show last week, ''and now it's my time to take it.''
Among the hypocrites surrounding Imus, I'll include myself. I've been a guest on his show many times since he first invited me in the early 1990s, when I was a theater critic. I've almost always considered him among the smarter and more authentic conversationalists I've encountered as an interviewee. As a book author, I could always use the publicity. 
 Of course I was aware of many of his obnoxious comments about minority groups, including my own, Jews. Sometimes he aimed invective at me personally. I wasn't seriously bothered by much of it, even when it was unfunny or made me wince, because I saw him as equally offensive to everyone. The show's crudest interludes struck me as burlesque. 
 I do not know Imus off the air and have no idea whether he is a good person, any more than I know whether Jerry Lewis, another entertainer who raises millions for sick children, is a good person. But as a listener and sometime guest, I didn't judge Imus to be a bigot. Perhaps I felt this way in part because Imus vehemently inveighed against racism in real life, most recently in decrying the political ads in last year's Senate campaign linking a black Tennessee congressman, Harold Ford, to white women. Perhaps I gave Imus a pass because the insults were almost always aimed at people in the public eye, whether politicians, celebrities or journalists -- targets with the forums to defend themselves.
 And perhaps I was kidding myself. What Imus said about the Rutgers team landed differently, not least because his slur was aimed at young women who had no standing in the world of celebrity, and who had done nothing in public except behave as exemplary student athletes. The spectacle of a media star verbally assaulting them, and with a creepy, dismissive laugh, as if the whole thing were merely a disposable joke, was ugly. You couldn't watch it without feeling that some kind of crime had been committed. That was true even before the world met his victims. So while I still don't know whether Imus is a bigot, there was an inhuman contempt in the moment that sounded like hate to me. You can see it and hear it in the video clip in a way that isn't conveyed by his words alone. 
 Does that mean he should be silenced? The Rutgers team pointedly never asked for that, and I don't think the punishment fits the crime. First, as a longtime Imus listener rather than someone who tuned in for the first time last week, I heard not only hate in his wisecrack but also honesty in his repeated vows to learn from it. Second, as a free-speech near-absolutist, I don't believe that even Mel Gibson, to me an unambiguous anti-Semite, should be deprived of his right to say whatever the hell he wants to say. The answer to his free speech is more free speech -- mine and yours. Let Bill O'Reilly talk about ''wetbacks'' or Rush Limbaugh accuse Michael J. Fox of exaggerating his Parkinson's symptoms, and let the rest of us answer back. 
 Liberals are kidding themselves if they think the Imus firing won't have a potentially chilling effect on comics who push the line. Let's not forget that Bill Maher, an Imus defender last week, was dropped by FedEx, Sears, ABC affiliates and eventually ABC itself after he broke the P.C. code of 9/11. Conservatives are kidding themselves if they think the Imus execution won't impede Ann Coulter's nasty invective on the public airwaves. As Al Franken pointed out to Larry King on Wednesday night, CNN harbors Glenn Beck, who has insinuated that the first Muslim congressman, Keith Ellison of Minnesota, is a terrorist (and who has also declared that ''faggot'' is nothing more than ''a naughty name''). Will Time Warner and its advertisers be called to account? Already in the Imus aftermath, the born-again blogger Tom DeLay has called for the firing of Rosie O'Donnell because of her ''hateful'' views on Chinese-Americans, conservative Christians and President Bush.
 That said, corporations, whether television or radio networks or movie studios or commercial sponsors, are free to edit or cancel any content. No one has an inalienable right to be broadcast or published or given a movie or music contract. Whether MSNBC and CBS acted out of genuine principle or economic necessity is a debate already raging. Just as Imus's show defied easy political definition -- he has both kissed up to Dick Cheney as a guest and called him a war criminal -- so does the chatter about what happened over the past week. MSNBC, forever unsure of its identity, seems to have found a new calling by turning that debate into a running series, and I say, go for it. 
 The biggest cliche of the debate so far is the constant reiteration that this will be a moment for a national ''conversation'' about race and sex and culture. Do people really want to have this conversation, or just talk about having it? If they really want to, it means we have to ask ourselves why this debacle has given permission to talking heads on television to repeat Imus's offensive words so insistently that cable news could hardly take time out to note the shocking bombing in the Baghdad Green Zone. Some even upped the ante: Donna Brazile managed to drag ''jigaboo'' into Wolf Blitzer's sedate ''Situation Room'' on CNN. 
 If we really want to have this conversation, it also means we have to have a nonposturing talk about hip-hop lyrics, ''Borat,'' ''South Park'' and maybe Larry David, too. As James Poniewozik pointed out in his smart cover article for Time last week, an important question emerged from an Imus on-air soliloquy as he tried to defend himself: ''This phrase that I use, it originated in the black community. That didn't give me a right to use it, but that's where it originated. Who calls who that and why? We need to know that. I need to know that.''
 My 22-year-old son, a humor writer who finds Imus an anachronistic and unfunny throwback to the racial-insult humor of the Frank Sinatra-Sammy Davis Jr. Rat Pack ilk, raises a complementary issue. He argues that when Sacha Baron Cohen makes fun of Jews and gays, he can do so because he's not doing it as himself but as a fictional character. But try telling that to the Anti-Defamation League, which criticized Mr. Baron Cohen, an observant Jew, for making sport of a real country (Kazakhstan) and worried that the ''Borat'' audience ''may not always be sophisticated enough to get the joke, and that some may even find it reinforcing their bigotry.''
 So if we really want to have this national ''conversation'' about race and culture and all the rest of it that everyone keeps telling us that this incident has prompted, let's get it on, no holds barred. And the fewer moralizing pundits and politicians, the better. Hillary Clinton, an Imus denouncer who has also called for federal regulation of violent television and video games, counts among her Hollywood fat cats Haim Saban, who made his fortune from ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.'' 
 Listening to Les Moonves of CBS speak with such apparent sincerity of how his network was helping to change the culture by firing Imus, I couldn't help but remember that one of CBS's own cultural gifts to America has been ''Big Brother,'' the reality game show that cloisters a dozen or so strangers in a house for weeks to see how they get along. Maybe Mr. Moonves could put his prime-time schedule where his mouth is and stop milking that format merely for the fun of humiliation, voyeurism and sexual high jinks. If locking Imus and his team in a house with Coach Stringer and her team 24/7 isn't must-see TV that moves this conversation forward, then I don't know what is.

HEADLINE: Alternative Tax Hits Home the Hardest

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
JOE GRECO lives with his wife, Karla, and their two children in a recently built four-bedroom home in a small hamlet in Suffolk County. Although he does not consider himself a wealthy man, Mr. Greco has joined a growing number of taxpayers across the region who find themselves paying the alternative minimum tax, which was created almost 40 years ago to make sure the nation's millionaires paid their fair share.
 ''So, I earn a decent salary,'' said Mr. Greco, 41, of St. James, who makes about $150,000 a year running a ready-mix concrete business with his father and brother. ''But my property taxes are astronomical, well into five figures. And my state income taxes are also five figures. But if you make enough to pay them, you can't deduct them.''
As a result, Mr. Greco was required to do a second calculation when filling out his 2006 federal returns, unable to claim either those deductions or the child tax credit. Since the tax owed under that formula was higher than the amount of tax that would be paid with the deductions, he had to pay the higher amount. 
 For Mr. Greco, that meant paying $5,000 to $6,000 more in taxes using the alternative minimum tax calculation. Households affected by it pay the equivalent of a flat tax of 26 or 28 percent. 
 And because the A.M.T. has never been adjusted for inflation, more and more people are finding themselves unable to use many deductions they have long relied on. 
 The alternative tax takes a disproportionate bite from the metropolitan area: One in every four of the households that pay it are in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, according to an analysis prepared by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group based in Washington.
 Starting early next year, the number of households paying the A.M.T. within the region, and around the country, will skyrocket if Congress does not change the tax code. Citizens for Tax Justice projects that number will climb to 3 million from 870,000 in the region early next year, and to 23 million nationwide, up from 3.4 million last year. 
 ''The dilemma for suburban New Yorkers is that you have to have two jobs to pay your high mortgage, to pay your high property tax, to pay your gas to go to work,'' said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of Huntington, N.Y. ''And then the federal government tells you, 'You're so rich, you have to give back your deductions.' ''
 The prospect of facing higher bills with the alternative minimum tax begins for most households when their adjusted gross income exceeds $125,000. But some making less can also get hit, based on the total amount of deductions. 
 By early next year, people earning substantially less would see their tax bills rise, including almost everyone earning more than $100,000 and about half of those making $75,000 to $100,000. The impact of the additional tax would vary from a few dollars to thousands more. 
 The average household reporting between $100,000 and $200,000 would pay $2,800 in additional federal taxes next year using the calculation for the alternative minimum tax, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. 
 The prospect of millions of their constituents suddenly seeing a sudden and substantial tax increase has members of Congress, especially those from the metropolitan region, focused on fixing the problem. 
 ''I'm going to have to answer to constituents in my own district if we don't do something,'' said Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., Democrat of Paterson, N.J., who is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 ''In 2005, there were 18,116 people eligible for the A.M.T.,'' he said, citing a study prepared for committee members on the impact of the tax in their districts. ''This year, there are 122,500-plus people in my district eligible. You don't have to be a mathematical wizard to figure this out.''
 Some members of Congress said it was unfair to consider income alone given the cost of living in the region. Can a taxpayer in the metropolitan area -- with its expensive housing, high energy costs, heavy state and local tax burden and long, costly commutes -- be regarded as wealthy because his or her income is in the five figures? 
 ''It is wrong that hard-working families in our community, who are struggling to keep up with large mortgages, increasing property taxes and the skyrocketing cost of sending children to college, must pay this exorbitant tax,'' said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester.
 Jim Isaacs, 60, who sells commercial carpet, said that he paid more under the alternative minimum tax but did not consider himself affluent. 
 ''I would be considered rich if I lived in Tuscaloosa, Ala.,'' said Mr. Isaacs, who lives in Maplewood, N.J., with his wife, Kerstin, a public relations manager for a New York City law firm.
 ''When your real estate taxes are $19,000, and when prices of homes, just because you live in the New York area, go up and up and up, you're not wealthy,'' he said.
 The New York Times examined 2004 data from the Internal Revenue Service that shows what households paid in federal tax and what was claimed in deductions, by ZIP code around the region. 
 The data showed that the households in ZIP codes whose residents had average adjusted gross income of between $140,000 and $160,000 in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut paid an average of $14,800 in state and local taxes. This compares with $8,000 in state and local taxes paid on average by households earning similar income in ZIP codes elsewhere in the country.
 Without being able to deduct those local and state taxes under the alternative minimum tax rules, the overall federal tax burden is higher for those living within ZIP codes in the metropolitan area where the average adjusted gross income was between $140,000 and $160,000. The average federal tax bill was $30,900 in those ZIP codes, compared with $29,600 for households in comparable neighborhoods elsewhere.
 ''Some of that is probably caused by the A.M.T.,'' said Gerald Prante, an analyst with the Tax Foundation, an organization based in Washington that favors lower taxes. 
 The alternative minimum tax was approved in 1969 to make sure the most affluent Americans were not using loopholes to lower their bills. It disallowed a list of deductions, including shelters like accelerated depreciation and stock options that were being used by people with very high incomes.
 ''It used to be that everyone was in these tax shelters, because the top tax rate was 70 percent,'' said Mitchell R. Zachary, head of the tax department for Grassi & Company, in Lake Success, N.Y., and Mr. Greco's accountant. ''But there were lots of loopholes.''
 Congress has put off changing the alternative minimum tax for the last several years, instead choosing temporary fixes that have kept millions from paying more when they do the second calculation. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said there was discussion about making the alternative minimum tax apply only to the highest income earners, especially, he said, those who have done well under the Bush administration's tax cuts. 
 ''We don't know whether we can do any of these, but we are talking about it,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''We can kick this can down the road another year, but it is my hope we can deal with the A.M.T. this year.''

HEADLINE: Listen Up, You Weeds and Twigs: It's April!

BYLINE: By AKIKO BUSCH

 BODY:
FOR a winter that took so long in coming, this one seems to have taken just as long to leave. Even after the snow and ice were gone, winter's residue could still be found spread across the grass in the powdery leaves and twigs, the dirt shoved by the snowplow up onto the lawn, and all the other bits of dust it left in its wake. 
 Our lawn is an uneven place to begin with. It is a combination of the broad, deep-green blades of Kentucky bluegrass and the thinner blades of fine fescue, a typical mix in this region. From time to time, we have also let the grass go to meadow, so add to that the timothy, ryegrass and patches of clover, along with the knotweed, crabgrass and dandelion, and you've got the rough texture of the common Northeastern lawn. 
At the beginning of April, though, you wouldn't know any of this. Then the lawn is a swath of brown and mottled dun, disrupted only by broad patches of a washed-out yellow. Even as the days grow longer and the lawn gets more light, it brightens in unpredictable and uneven spots. I am not much of a gardener and even less of a diagnostician. It could be snow mold that the grass suffers from, a deficiency of light, or assorted fungi, or mites and worms. I won't hazard a guess. Still, a glance out the window suggests that this is going to be one of those times when I try to take care of the problem without ever identifying exactly what it is. 
 It's not that I aspire to live on a putting green, or want to transform the lawn into a sheet of emerald velvet. Nor am I especially susceptible to the news that April is National Lawn Care Month -- or so says the Professional Lawn Care Association of America. 
 In his wide-reaching social and cultural analysis of our lawns and the industry they have spawned, ''American Green: The Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Lawn,'' Ted Steinberg attributes our lawn care mania to assorted factors like the economic imperatives of postwar consumerism, the cold war political climate, the needs of the American family, new understandings of outdoor and indoor space, and a new appreciation for bright colors. 
 That may all be true, but there is something else at work here, some innate sense that this little piece of earth that my house -- my life -- rests on should be healthy. And making it so generates an almost primal sense of accomplishment. Or in the words of Jonathan Swift, ''whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.'' 
 The first step toward that end is to rake the grass. This seems an act of faith more than anything else, as if it were possible to simply comb out all the mats and tangles of winter. But the raking sloughs off what is dead and aerates the grass as well, awakening it to the burgeoning light and warmth.
 Beyond that, though, putting the grass to rights is a complex enterprise. As so often in the garden, bringing something back to life necessarily demands a degree of brutality. The entire lawn care industry is there to assist, with its arsenal of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, all the granules, pellets and powders to kill the rodents and insects, the weeds, the moss and whatever other intrusive agents there are, all of which arrive with a strategic timing that has a near-military precision. Dandelions and other broadleaf greens that thrive in warmer temperatures come up in May, after the crabgrass that is already upon us; each plant of crabgrass has some 10,000 seeds. That has to be the first to go.
 When was the last time you got rid of 10,000 of anything? Such an extravagance of extermination is daunting, and the temptation, of course, is to let it go. There are times when indifference pays off, when neglect can be a virtue. 
 Like most people, I am prone to thinking too highly of my interventions. Rather than blanket the grass with a sea of chemicals, why not just recognize the hardy resilience of the grass? Can't it take care of itself? I've been told healthy grass can crowd out the weeds. Let the fine fescue, the knotweed, and the dandelions decide the matter in their own pastoral brawl. And who wouldn't welcome the occasional patch of clover interspersed with the bluegrass? Besides, wasn't it Emerson who asked: ''What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.'' 
 I know, too, that the grass can be renovated simply by overseeding -- that is, mowing the grass short and raking it clean, then scattering seed over what is already there in the hopes that the new seeding will germinate and fill out the sparse areas where the grass has thinned. My friend Jan Axel, who is a landscape designer in South Salem, N.Y., recommends this route, and it seems a gesture that offers greater hope than spreading a synthetic pesticide. ''Then mow high,'' she tells me. ''You're exposing less of the root system that way, so the grass needs less water.'' 
 In the end, though, I also acquiesce to something called Weed & Feed; even its simple name, brilliant in its reduction, affirms its bipolar character. And while there is something vaguely irritating about its excess of ambition, I can see it is a product that recognizes the full complexity of the task at hand; while its herbicide attacks both the crabgrass and broadleaf weeds, it nonetheless manages to replenish the grass with nitrogen. Its yellow and green bag cheerfully announces that nurturing and destroying can be simultaneous acts, with a label affirming the little riot of horticultural multitasking it is capable of: ''Kills, Thickens, Prevents,'' it reads.
 I am reminded then that April, as well as being National Lawn Care Month, also happens to be National Poetry Month. Makes sense to me. It's not just the simple rhyming in the name of this lawn care product; it's that even in its promotional language, Weed & Feed seems fully engaged with the inventive reach of imagination, the nuance of phrasing and all the subtle contradictions of thought and feeling that are expressed more routinely at the higher reaches of literature. It knows that our small patch of lawn, with its rough texture of the desired and the despised, asks at once for every part of your psyche -- generosity, indifference, ruthlessness. And that cultivating it is like taking care of anything or anyone else you love.

HEADLINE: High Hopes for an Ambitious Newark Arena

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
TWENTY-THREE floors above the busy sidewalks, just after 9 a.m. on a recent Monday, Jeffrey Vanderbeek stood in the lobby of his quiet office and examined a row of chairs as if he were judging a beauty pageant or giving them a consumer rating.
 He was, in fact, doing both. They were samples of plush, padded seats that Mr. Vanderbeek, the principal owner of the New Jersey Devils hockey team, might choose to install in the $365 million, 17,625-seat arena being built here downtown. 
Mr. Vanderbeek wants the Prudential Center, which is scheduled to open in October for the Devils' 2007-8 opener, to be an attractive, comfortable site for hockey, basketball and indoor soccer games, concerts and other events.
 ''The acoustics, the bells and whistles, it's going to be to die for,'' he said of the arena. ''When people actually see it, feel it, touch it, they'll be flabbergasted. They've never been to a place like this.''
 He also must meet a budget, which is why he wants durable seats. He scrutinizes details because so much is riding on this arena -- the future of his franchise and, to some extent, Newark itself.
 ''I thought I was going into semi-retirement, but think again,'' said Mr. Vanderbeek, 49, who was on the executive committee at Lehman Brothers in New York before taking on the Devils three years ago.
 The goal is to use the arena more than 200 nights a year, not just the 41 days (plus dates of the Stanley Cup playoffs) the Devils will play there each season. 
 City officials say they are confident that such activity will eventually lure businesses and development to downtown -- even Mayor Cory A. Booker, who was no fan of the project until Mr. Vanderbeek made some concessions.
 Mr. Vanderbeek agreed to involve the community, particularly minority-owned businesses and trade unions, more heavily. Now Mr. Booker says, ''I think it's going to be a great spiritual asset for the city as we turn this corner.''
 Later the mayor added: ''The idea that this is just a hockey arena is wrong. It is much more than that. It is going to be the premier entertainment venue in New Jersey, if not the region.''
 Other projects have been portrayed as important to downtown revitalization, like the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which opened in 1997, and the Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium, which opened in 1999.
 When asked to compare the Prudential Center with the stadium, the seldom-filled home of the minor-league Newark Bears baseball team, Mr. Vanderbeek said of the arena, ''It has a major-league team as a tenant that has won a world championship three times in the last 12 years.''
 Mr. Vanderbeek's stake in the project is civic as well as commercial. He grew up in New Jersey, first in Somerville, then Bridgewater, and lives in Warren. He, too, must drive construction-jumbled Interstate 78 to get to work.
 He was a Devils season-ticket holder for more than 10 years before buying a minority share in the team in 2000. He is a regular at Devils games at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, where the team has not sold out a game all season.
 The arena will represent not the completion of a project, but the beginning. It is planned as the hub of development that would include office and retail space, parking decks and a grassy park leading to the arena from Pennsylvania Station.
 ''Jeff has been a constant factor and a cheerleader for making things go,'' said Bo Kemp, the city's business administrator.
 There are skeptics.
 George Zoffinger, the departing head of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, was quoted in the Feb. 19 New York Post as saying he doubted the arena would be done on time. The headline read: ''NJSEA: Newark Arena Long Way Off.'' 
 When Mr. Vanderbeek and city officials held a ceremony late last month marking the placement of the highest piece of steel, he had gifts for the ironworkers: sweatshirts with that headline printed in bright red. ''On time'' plus ''and safe'' were printed on the sleeves. 
 ''There are skeptics in life, but that just makes the food taste all the sweeter when you do something that people say can't be done,'' Mr. Vanderbeek said later. 
 The arena has helped entice businesses to think about moving into Newark or returning to it, city officials said.
 ''It's a symbolic project as much as it is a real project, and this is a really, really, really big symbol,'' said William Crawley, head of the Newark Downtown Core Redevelopment Corporation, which is overseeing the arena construction. ''I've talked to people in the suburbs, and they're all excited about coming downtown.''
 Stefan Pryor, the deputy mayor for economic development, said the city, which is kicking in $210 million, had received inquiries from residential and commercial developers as well as hoteliers about building near the arena. Mr. Vanderbeek said activities at the arena could attract two to three million people a year, most after 5:30 p.m.
 ''They will become patrons of Newark establishments more broadly,'' Mr. Pryor said.
 Mr. Vanderbeek said he believes increased foot traffic downtown will override what has been perceived as the arena's biggest drawback -- that it is in an unsafe neighborhood in a city where murders are on the rise.
 Mr. Kemp said of the arena, ''We think this is a principal component of repositioning Newark.''
 Mr. Booker compared the strip of redevelopment in Newark with that in Times Square. ''They'll all resonate with each other,'' he said.
 Mr. Vanderbeek said he was focusing on trying to get the arena completed on time. His desk is piled with proposals from entertainment groups looking for a place for a gig. He has plenty to do besides selling the city. But he says there are a lot of cheerleaders.
 ''There are a lot of people who care about Newark,'' he said. ''There really are.''

HEADLINE: History's Painful Fallout

 BODY:
If anything good comes out of New Jersey's pension crisis, it will be a newfound awareness among politicians and voters alike of the dangers of overblown promises to cut taxes. Overpromising, together with the willingness of both Democrats and Republicans to use any gimmick conceivable to avoid a tax increase, is what put New Jersey in such deep trouble in the first place. 
 The essence of the problem, as The Times's Mary Williams Walsh revealed, is that there is nowhere near enough money in the bank to pay New Jersey's looming pension obligations. But the origin of the problem is traceable to September 1993, when Christie Whitman, then the Republican candidate for governor, promised to cut most income taxes 30 percent over three years in a last-minute effort to overcome the surprisingly resurgent incumbent, Jim Florio. 
 Mr. Florio had been lagging in the polls for weeks partly because he had raised taxes, but he had pulled even. At the urging of her advisers, Mrs. Whitman, a moderate by instinct, promised a huge tax cut and pledged to pay for it by making whatever spending cuts were necessary. Mrs. Whitman won, though narrowly, but upon taking office she found it difficult to make up for the lost revenue; big spending cuts were almost impossible since about half the money in New Jersey budgets is legally obligated and cannot be eliminated. 
 In 1997, facing deficits not only in the state budget but also in the pension fund -- a deficit caused by years of missed payments and other fiscal sleights of hand -- she and her advisers came up with an ingenious proposal to stave off the problem: borrow more than $2.7 billion against the pension fund and use the money to make up for the revenue gaps. With the economy flourishing, the interest the state would have to pay on the loan would be more than a percentage point below the rosy estimates of what the money could earn through investments. That would be enough to eliminate the need for immediate contributions to the pension fund and help out with the state's budget. 
 And for a while it worked, as the money earned far more than even the optimistic estimates had forecast. Then the stock market faltered, the investments turned sour and New Jersey's pension fund bled red ink. 
 Mrs. Whitman was not the first governor -- nor the last -- to use fiscal gimmickry. Stunned by the reaction to his tax increase, Mr. Florio came up with numerous tricks to avoid more tax hikes or severe budget cuts. And Donald DiFrancesco, who became acting governor in 2001 when Mrs. Whitman joined the Bush administration, delivered the coup de grace. With his eye on the coming campaign, he persuaded the Legislature to enhance pension benefits for teachers and state workers without financing the increases. James McGreevey, his Democratic successor, used fiscal trickery of his own. 
 The result is a fiscal crisis in Trenton like few have ever seen. Gov. Jon Corzine, who has promised to do whatever is necessary, will have no alternative but to propose higher taxes, a sell-off of state assets like the New Jersey Turnpike or whatever draconian budget cuts can be made. He may have to come up with a mix of all three.
 So here is the painful lesson. When politicians make promises that seem too good to be true, when they provide benefits without raising the money to cover them, the chickens will come home to roost and, just as surely, the taxpayers will pay the price.

HEADLINE: Alternative Tax Hits Home the Hardest

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
JOE GRECO lives with his wife, Karla, and their two children in a recently built four-bedroom home in a small hamlet in Suffolk County. Although he does not consider himself a wealthy man, Mr. Greco has joined a growing number of taxpayers across the region who find themselves paying the alternative minimum tax, which was created almost 40 years ago to make sure the nation's millionaires paid their fair share.
 ''So, I earn a decent salary,'' said Mr. Greco, 41, of St. James, who makes about $150,000 a year running a ready-mix concrete business with his father and brother. ''But my property taxes are astronomical, well into five figures. And my state income taxes are also five figures. But if you make enough to pay them, you can't deduct them.''
As a result, Mr. Greco was required to do a second calculation when filling out his 2006 federal returns, unable to claim either those deductions or the child tax credit. Since the tax owed under that formula was higher than the amount of tax that would be paid with the deductions, he had to pay the higher amount. 
 For Mr. Greco, that meant paying $5,000 to $6,000 more in taxes using the alternative minimum tax calculation. Households affected by it pay the equivalent of a flat tax of 26 or 28 percent. 
 And because the A.M.T. has never been adjusted for inflation, more and more people are finding themselves unable to use many deductions they have long relied on. 
 The alternative tax takes a disproportionate bite from the metropolitan area: One in every four of the households that pay it are in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, according to an analysis prepared by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group based in Washington.
 Starting early next year, the number of households paying the A.M.T. within the region, and around the country, will skyrocket if Congress does not change the tax code. Citizens for Tax Justice projects that number will climb to 3 million from 870,000 in the region early next year, and to 23 million nationwide, up from 3.4 million last year. 
 ''The dilemma for suburban New Yorkers is that you have to have two jobs to pay your high mortgage, to pay your high property tax, to pay your gas to go to work,'' said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of Huntington, N.Y. ''And then the federal government tells you, 'You're so rich, you have to give back your deductions.' ''
 The prospect of facing higher bills with the alternative minimum tax begins for most households when their adjusted gross income exceeds $125,000. But some making less can also get hit, based on the total amount of deductions. 
 By early next year, people earning substantially less would see their tax bills rise, including almost everyone earning more than $100,000 and about half of those making $75,000 to $100,000. The impact of the additional tax would vary from a few dollars to thousands more. 
 The average household reporting between $100,000 and $200,000 would pay $2,800 in additional federal taxes next year using the calculation for the alternative minimum tax, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. 
 The prospect of millions of their constituents suddenly seeing a sudden and substantial tax increase has members of Congress, especially those from the metropolitan region, focused on fixing the problem. 
 ''I'm going to have to answer to constituents in my own district if we don't do something,'' said Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., Democrat of Paterson, N.J., who is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 ''In 2005, there were 18,116 people eligible for the A.M.T.,'' he said, citing a study prepared for committee members on the impact of the tax in their districts. ''This year, there are 122,500-plus people in my district eligible. You don't have to be a mathematical wizard to figure this out.''
 Some members of Congress said it was unfair to consider income alone given the cost of living in the region. Can a taxpayer in the metropolitan area -- with its expensive housing, high energy costs, heavy state and local tax burden and long, costly commutes -- be regarded as wealthy because his or her income is in the five figures? 
 ''It is wrong that hard-working families in our community, who are struggling to keep up with large mortgages, increasing property taxes and the skyrocketing cost of sending children to college, must pay this exorbitant tax,'' said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester.
 Jim Isaacs, 60, who sells commercial carpet, said that he paid more under the alternative minimum tax but did not consider himself affluent. 
 ''I would be considered rich if I lived in Tuscaloosa, Ala.,'' said Mr. Isaacs, who lives in Maplewood, N.J., with his wife, Kerstin, a public relations manager for a New York City law firm.
 ''When your real estate taxes are $19,000, and when prices of homes, just because you live in the New York area, go up and up and up, you're not wealthy,'' he said.
 The New York Times examined 2004 data from the Internal Revenue Service that shows what households paid in federal tax and what was claimed in deductions, by ZIP code around the region. 
 The data showed that the households in ZIP codes whose residents had average adjusted gross income of between $140,000 and $160,000 in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut paid an average of $14,800 in state and local taxes. This compares with $8,000 in state and local taxes paid on average by households earning similar income in ZIP codes elsewhere in the country.
 Without being able to deduct those local and state taxes under the alternative minimum tax rules, the overall federal tax burden is higher for those living within ZIP codes in the metropolitan area where the average adjusted gross income was between $140,000 and $160,000. The average federal tax bill was $30,900 in those ZIP codes, compared with $29,600 for households in comparable neighborhoods elsewhere.
 ''Some of that is probably caused by the A.M.T.,'' said Gerald Prante, an analyst with the Tax Foundation, an organization based in Washington that favors lower taxes. 
 The alternative minimum tax was approved in 1969 to make sure the most affluent Americans were not using loopholes to lower their bills. It disallowed a list of deductions, including shelters like accelerated depreciation and stock options that were being used by people with very high incomes.
 ''It used to be that everyone was in these tax shelters, because the top tax rate was 70 percent,'' said Mitchell R. Zachary, head of the tax department for Grassi & Company, in Lake Success, N.Y., and Mr. Greco's accountant. ''But there were lots of loopholes.''
 Congress has put off changing the alternative minimum tax for the last several years, instead choosing temporary fixes that have kept millions from paying more when they do the second calculation. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said there was discussion about making the alternative minimum tax apply only to the highest income earners, especially, he said, those who have done well under the Bush administration's tax cuts. 
 ''We don't know whether we can do any of these, but we are talking about it,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''We can kick this can down the road another year, but it is my hope we can deal with the A.M.T. this year.''

HEADLINE: Listen Up, You Weeds and Twigs: It's April!

BYLINE: By AKIKO BUSCH

 BODY:
FOR a winter that took so long in coming, this one seems to have taken just as long to leave. Even after the snow and ice were gone, winter's residue could still be found spread across the grass in the powdery leaves and twigs, the dirt shoved by the snowplow up onto the lawn, and all the other bits of dust it left in its wake. 
 Our lawn is an uneven place to begin with. It is a combination of the broad, deep-green blades of Kentucky bluegrass and the thinner blades of fine fescue, a typical mix in this region. From time to time, we have also let the grass go to meadow, so add to that the timothy, ryegrass and patches of clover, along with the knotweed, crabgrass and dandelion, and you've got the rough texture of the common Northeastern lawn. 
At the beginning of April, though, you wouldn't know any of this. Then the lawn is a swath of brown and mottled dun, disrupted only by broad patches of a washed-out yellow. Even as the days grow longer and the lawn gets more light, it brightens in unpredictable and uneven spots. I am not much of a gardener and even less of a diagnostician. It could be snow mold that the grass suffers from, a deficiency of light, or assorted fungi, or mites and worms. I won't hazard a guess. Still, a glance out the window suggests that this is going to be one of those times when I try to take care of the problem without ever identifying exactly what it is. 
 It's not that I aspire to live on a putting green, or want to transform the lawn into a sheet of emerald velvet. Nor am I especially susceptible to the news that April is National Lawn Care Month -- or so says the Professional Lawn Care Association of America. 
 In his wide-reaching social and cultural analysis of our lawns and the industry they have spawned, ''American Green: The Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Lawn,'' Ted Steinberg attributes our lawn care mania to assorted factors like the economic imperatives of postwar consumerism, the cold war political climate, the needs of the American family, new understandings of outdoor and indoor space, and a new appreciation for bright colors. 
 That may all be true, but there is something else at work here, some innate sense that this little piece of earth that my house -- my life -- rests on should be healthy. And making it so generates an almost primal sense of accomplishment. Or in the words of Jonathan Swift, ''whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.'' 
 The first step toward that end is to rake the grass. This seems an act of faith more than anything else, as if it were possible to simply comb out all the mats and tangles of winter. But the raking sloughs off what is dead and aerates the grass as well, awakening it to the burgeoning light and warmth.
 Beyond that, though, putting the grass to rights is a complex enterprise. As so often in the garden, bringing something back to life necessarily demands a degree of brutality. The entire lawn care industry is there to assist, with its arsenal of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, all the granules, pellets and powders to kill the rodents and insects, the weeds, the moss and whatever other intrusive agents there are, all of which arrive with a strategic timing that has a near-military precision. Dandelions and other broadleaf greens that thrive in warmer temperatures come up in May, after the crabgrass that is already upon us; each plant of crabgrass has some 10,000 seeds. That has to be the first to go.
 When was the last time you got rid of 10,000 of anything? Such an extravagance of extermination is daunting, and the temptation, of course, is to let it go. There are times when indifference pays off, when neglect can be a virtue. 
 Like most people, I am prone to thinking too highly of my interventions. Rather than blanket the grass with a sea of chemicals, why not just recognize the hardy resilience of the grass? Can't it take care of itself? I've been told healthy grass can crowd out the weeds. Let the fine fescue, the knotweed, and the dandelions decide the matter in their own pastoral brawl. And who wouldn't welcome the occasional patch of clover interspersed with the bluegrass? Besides, wasn't it Emerson who asked: ''What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.'' 
 I know, too, that the grass can be renovated simply by overseeding -- that is, mowing the grass short and raking it clean, then scattering seed over what is already there in the hopes that the new seeding will germinate and fill out the sparse areas where the grass has thinned. My friend Jan Axel, who is a landscape designer in South Salem, N.Y., recommends this route, and it seems a gesture that offers greater hope than spreading a synthetic pesticide. ''Then mow high,'' she tells me. ''You're exposing less of the root system that way, so the grass needs less water.'' 
 In the end, though, I also acquiesce to something called Weed & Feed; even its simple name, brilliant in its reduction, affirms its bipolar character. And while there is something vaguely irritating about its excess of ambition, I can see it is a product that recognizes the full complexity of the task at hand; while its herbicide attacks both the crabgrass and broadleaf weeds, it nonetheless manages to replenish the grass with nitrogen. Its yellow and green bag cheerfully announces that nurturing and destroying can be simultaneous acts, with a label affirming the little riot of horticultural multitasking it is capable of: ''Kills, Thickens, Prevents,'' it reads.
 I am reminded then that April, as well as being National Lawn Care Month, also happens to be National Poetry Month. Makes sense to me. It's not just the simple rhyming in the name of this lawn care product; it's that even in its promotional language, Weed & Feed seems fully engaged with the inventive reach of imagination, the nuance of phrasing and all the subtle contradictions of thought and feeling that are expressed more routinely at the higher reaches of literature. It knows that our small patch of lawn, with its rough texture of the desired and the despised, asks at once for every part of your psyche -- generosity, indifference, ruthlessness. And that cultivating it is like taking care of anything or anyone else you love.

Citizens for Tax Justice projects that number will climb to 3 million from 870,000 in the region early next year, and to 23 million nationwide, up from 3.4 million last year. 
 ''The dilemma for suburban New Yorkers is that you have to have two jobs to pay your high mortgage, to pay your high property tax, to pay your gas to go to work,'' said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of Huntington, N.Y. ''And then the federal government tells you, 'You're so rich, you have to give back your deductions.' ''
 The prospect of facing higher bills with the alternative minimum tax begins for most households when their adjusted gross income exceeds $125,000. But some making less can also get hit, based on the total amount of deductions. 
 By early next year, people earning substantially less would see their tax bills rise, including almost everyone earning more than $100,000 and about half of those making $75,000 to $100,000. The impact of the additional tax would vary from a few dollars to thousands more. 
 The average household reporting between $100,000 and $200,000 would pay $2,800 in additional federal taxes next year using the calculation for the alternative minimum tax, according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. 
 The prospect of millions of their constituents suddenly seeing a sudden and substantial tax increase has members of Congress, especially those from the metropolitan region, focused on fixing the problem. 
 ''I'm going to have to answer to constituents in my own district if we don't do something,'' said Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., Democrat of Paterson, N.J., who is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 ''In 2005, there were 18,116 people eligible for the A.M.T.,'' he said, citing a study prepared for committee members on the impact of the tax in their districts. ''This year, there are 122,500-plus people in my district eligible. You don't have to be a mathematical wizard to figure this out.''
 Some members of Congress said it was unfair to consider income alone given the cost of living in the region. Can a taxpayer in the metropolitan area -- with its expensive housing, high energy costs, heavy state and local tax burden and long, costly commutes -- be regarded as wealthy because his or her income is in the five figures? 
 ''It is wrong that hard-working families in our community, who are struggling to keep up with large mortgages, increasing property taxes and the skyrocketing cost of sending children to college, must pay this exorbitant tax,'' said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester.
 Jim Isaacs, 60, who sells commercial carpet, said that he paid more under the alternative minimum tax but did not consider himself affluent. 
 ''I would be considered rich if I lived in Tuscaloosa, Ala.,'' said Mr. Isaacs, who lives in Maplewood, N.J., with his wife, Kerstin, a public relations manager for a New York City law firm.
 ''When your real estate taxes are $19,000, and when prices of homes, just because you live in the New York area, go up and up and up, you're not wealthy,'' he said.
 The New York Times examined 2004 data from the Internal Revenue Service that shows what households paid in federal tax and what was claimed in deductions, by ZIP code around the region. 
 The data showed that the households in ZIP codes whose residents had average adjusted gross income of between $140,000 and $160,000 in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut paid an average of $14,800 in state and local taxes. This compares with $8,000 in state and local taxes paid on average by households earning similar income in ZIP codes elsewhere in the country.
 Without being able to deduct those local and state taxes under the alternative minimum tax rules, the overall federal tax burden is higher for those living within ZIP codes in the metropolitan area where the average adjusted gross income was between $140,000 and $160,000. The average federal tax bill was $30,900 in those ZIP codes, compared with $29,600 for households in comparable neighborhoods elsewhere.
 ''Some of that is probably caused by the A.M.T.,'' said Gerald Prante, an analyst with the Tax Foundation, an organization based in Washington that favors lower taxes. 
 The alternative minimum tax was approved in 1969 to make sure the most affluent Americans were not using loopholes to lower their bills. It disallowed a list of deductions, including shelters like accelerated depreciation and stock options that were being used by people with very high incomes.
 ''It used to be that everyone was in these tax shelters, because the top tax rate was 70 percent,'' said Mitchell R. Zachary, head of the tax department for Grassi & Company, in Lake Success, N.Y., and Mr. Greco's accountant. ''But there were lots of loopholes.''
 Congress has put off changing the alternative minimum tax for the last several years, instead choosing temporary fixes that have kept millions from paying more when they do the second calculation. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said there was discussion about making the alternative minimum tax apply only to the highest income earners, especially, he said, those who have done well under the Bush administration's tax cuts. 
 ''We don't know whether we can do any of these, but we are talking about it,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''We can kick this can down the road another year, but it is my hope we can deal with the A.M.T. this year.''

HEADLINE: Listen Up, You Weeds and Twigs: It's April!

BYLINE: By AKIKO BUSCH

 BODY:
FOR a winter that took so long in coming, this one seems to have taken just as long to leave. Even after the snow and ice were gone, winter's residue could still be found spread across the grass in the powdery leaves and twigs, the dirt shoved by the snowplow up onto the lawn, and all the other bits of dust it left in its wake. 
 Our lawn is an uneven place to begin with. It is a combination of the broad, deep-green blades of Kentucky bluegrass and the thinner blades of fine fescue, a typical mix in this region. From time to time, we have also let the grass go to meadow, so add to that the timothy, ryegrass and patches of clover, along with the knotweed, crabgrass and dandelion, and you've got the rough texture of the common Northeastern lawn. 
At the beginning of April, though, you wouldn't know any of this. Then the lawn is a swath of brown and mottled dun, disrupted only by broad patches of a washed-out yellow. Even as the days grow longer and the lawn gets more light, it brightens in unpredictable and uneven spots. I am not much of a gardener and even less of a diagnostician. It could be snow mold that the grass suffers from, a deficiency of light, or assorted fungi, or mites and worms. I won't hazard a guess. Still, a glance out the window suggests that this is going to be one of those times when I try to take care of the problem without ever identifying exactly what it is. 
 It's not that I aspire to live on a putting green, or want to transform the lawn into a sheet of emerald velvet. Nor am I especially susceptible to the news that April is National Lawn Care Month -- or so says the Professional Lawn Care Association of America. 
 In his wide-reaching social and cultural analysis of our lawns and the industry they have spawned, ''American Green: The Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Lawn,'' Ted Steinberg attributes our lawn care mania to assorted factors like the economic imperatives of postwar consumerism, the cold war political climate, the needs of the American family, new understandings of outdoor and indoor space, and a new appreciation for bright colors. 
 That may all be true, but there is something else at work here, some innate sense that this little piece of earth that my house -- my life -- rests on should be healthy. And making it so generates an almost primal sense of accomplishment. Or in the words of Jonathan Swift, ''whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.'' 
 The first step toward that end is to rake the grass. This seems an act of faith more than anything else, as if it were possible to simply comb out all the mats and tangles of winter. But the raking sloughs off what is dead and aerates the grass as well, awakening it to the burgeoning light and warmth.
 Beyond that, though, putting the grass to rights is a complex enterprise. As so often in the garden, bringing something back to life necessarily demands a degree of brutality. The entire lawn care industry is there to assist, with its arsenal of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, all the granules, pellets and powders to kill the rodents and insects, the weeds, the moss and whatever other intrusive agents there are, all of which arrive with a strategic timing that has a near-military precision. Dandelions and other broadleaf greens that thrive in warmer temperatures come up in May, after the crabgrass that is already upon us; each plant of crabgrass has some 10,000 seeds. That has to be the first to go.
 When was the last time you got rid of 10,000 of anything? Such an extravagance of extermination is daunting, and the temptation, of course, is to let it go. There are times when indifference pays off, when neglect can be a virtue. 
 Like most people, I am prone to thinking too highly of my interventions. Rather than blanket the grass with a sea of chemicals, why not just recognize the hardy resilience of the grass? Can't it take care of itself? I've been told healthy grass can crowd out the weeds. Let the fine fescue, the knotweed, and the dandelions decide the matter in their own pastoral brawl. And who wouldn't welcome the occasional patch of clover interspersed with the bluegrass? Besides, wasn't it Emerson who asked: ''What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.'' 
 I know, too, that the grass can be renovated simply by overseeding -- that is, mowing the grass short and raking it clean, then scattering seed over what is already there in the hopes that the new seeding will germinate and fill out the sparse areas where the grass has thinned. My friend Jan Axel, who is a landscape designer in South Salem, N.Y., recommends this route, and it seems a gesture that offers greater hope than spreading a synthetic pesticide. ''Then mow high,'' she tells me. ''You're exposing less of the root system that way, so the grass needs less water.'' 
 In the end, though, I also acquiesce to something called Weed & Feed; even its simple name, brilliant in its reduction, affirms its bipolar character. And while there is something vaguely irritating about its excess of ambition, I can see it is a product that recognizes the full complexity of the task at hand; while its herbicide attacks both the crabgrass and broadleaf weeds, it nonetheless manages to replenish the grass with nitrogen. Its yellow and green bag cheerfully announces that nurturing and destroying can be simultaneous acts, with a label affirming the little riot of horticultural multitasking it is capable of: ''Kills, Thickens, Prevents,'' it reads.
 I am reminded then that April, as well as being National Lawn Care Month, also happens to be National Poetry Month. Makes sense to me. It's not just the simple rhyming in the name of this lawn care product; it's that even in its promotional language, Weed & Feed seems fully engaged with the inventive reach of imagination, the nuance of phrasing and all the subtle contradictions of thought and feeling that are expressed more routinely at the higher reaches of literature. It knows that our small patch of lawn, with its rough texture of the desired and the despised, asks at once for every part of your psyche -- generosity, indifference, ruthlessness. And that cultivating it is like taking care of anything or anyone else you love.

HEADLINE: Chance to Have Olympics Is a Balm for a Troubled City

BYLINE: By ERIC FERKENHOFF

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 14 

 BODY:
This city's image could use a little lift.
 Battered by scandal on many fronts, including the resignation this month of its top police official and the indictment of an aide close to Mayor Richard M. Daley, Chicago has needed some good news.
And that came, in large measure, on Saturday, when the United States Olympic Committee announced that Chicago had beat out Los Angeles in the United States bid to serve as host of the 2016 Summer Games. 
 In making its choice, the committee ended a yearlong tug-of-war of money and ego that started with five cities, including Philadelphia, San Francisco and Houston, and granted Chicago a world stage perhaps bigger than any since the Columbian Exposition of 1893. 
 ''It's certainly as historic as that to be in the running,'' said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, which promotes Chicago to the world. 
 ''We hit a low point in 2000, when The Wall Street Journal said we -- not even Illinois -- was on the map of tech hot-spots in the country,'' Msall said. ''We've come a long way since then, and this reinforces that and says we're not only on the map, but a big point on it.''
 The Olympic committee selected Chicago for its ability to ''re-create a certain magic,'' according to Bob Ctvrtlik, chairman of the U.S.O.C.'s city evaluation committee, with its miles of lakefront, its record of guiding a rusty city through vast environmental initiatives and its economic success. 
 Even if Chicago does not win the international competition, which is expected to be decided in October 2009, a huge push is already under way to polish Washington Park in the South Side. The neighborhood and its vast park would be the site of the main stadium for the Games, but it is largely distressed despite its proximity to the well-to-do Hyde Park neighborhood and the University of Chicago.
 Michael Dunbar, 47, who was at the park on Saturday, sounded almost ecstatic at the news of the committee's choice. Having just finished walking his dog through the park -- whose tennis courts are tattered and signs are marred by graffiti -- he voiced hope that the development of Washington Park would not push out too many residents as businesses move into empty lots and the wealthy make it home.
 ''I'm not going anywhere,'' said Dunbar, who has been a driver for Pepsi for 30 years. ''This will be my space, and maybe the riffraff will go away.''
 He added: ''Sure the rent will go up, the condos are already coming. But me, hopefully I can retire early and maybe take in some of these Games.''
 Not everyone was rooting. On WGN radio, the host of ''Sports Central'' said Chicago did not need the Summer Games -- and the ''congestion'' and ''headache'' they would bring -- to prove the city was world class. But for others, the Games would be an important step for the city. ''We might get to represent the United States, and I'm happy that we were chosen,'' said David Wildman, a 10-year-old from the South Side who was walking with his mother on Saturday. ''My dad says -- I don't know if he's right -- the world hates us, and we probably won't be chosen. But I think we will. We're a nice city.''

HEADLINE: First Woman's Strides in Boston Still Echoing

BYLINE: By KATHRINE SWITZER. 
Kathrine Switzer recently published her memoir, ''Marathon Woman.''

 BODY:
Two miles into the 1967 Boston Marathon, an official tried to eject me from the race simply because I was a woman. That event changed my life and, as a consequence, the lives of millions of women around the world.
 The marathon was a man's race in those days; women were considered too fragile to run it. But I had trained hard and was confident of my strength. Still, it took a body block from my boyfriend to knock the official off the course and allow me to complete the 26 miles 385 yards. 
In 1967, few would have believed that marathon running would someday attract millions of women, become a glamour event in the Olympics and on the streets of major cities, help transform views of women's physical ability and help redefine their economic roles in traditional cultures.
 It happened because on a basic level, running empowers women and raises their self-esteem while promoting physical fitness easily and inexpensively. 
 In the final 24 miles of my first Boston Marathon, I knew that women needed only opportunities. I have since devoted my life to opening doors, primarily by creating a series of women's races in 27 countries. That helped pave the way to the inclusion of the women's marathon as an official Olympic event in 1984. Joan Benoit Samuelson of Maine crossed the finish line first in that race, an important moment for women watching around the world.
 We learned that women are not deficient in endurance and stamina, and that running requires no fancy facilities or equipment. Women's marathoning has created a global legacy.
 I have seen women in Brazil and the Philippines race without shoes but with their hearts full of pride. These runners have helped change much of the social and cultural fabric in their countries.
 In Kenya, successful female runners are breaking the cycle of second-class status. They go back to their villages and use their prize money to build schools, purify water and start training camps for other women. 
 In Japan, companies aim to gain prestige by recruiting female marathoners to run at the highest level. In Britain, many thousands line the streets to see Paula Radcliffe race. In Russia, Mexico and Ethiopia, a few thousand American dollars go a long way to making a better life. The winsome Jelena Prokopcuka has lifted the spirits of Latvians.
 In tomorrow's Boston Marathon, women will make up 40 percent of the field. The percentage is higher in many other marathons. According to Runner's World magazine, women account for an average of 51 percent of the fields in all road races in the United States.
 At the same time, the quality of women's performances has soared. When Radcliffe set the women's world record, 2 hours 15 minutes 25 seconds, in the 2003 London Marathon, she was also the first British finisher, male or female. The depth of talent has increased to the point that women will be the headliners tomorrow in Boston. 
 With all due respect to the outstanding international men's field, including Robert Cheruiyot of Kenya, who won the Boston and Chicago Marathons last year, the real buzz is about the competition among Deena Kastor of the United States, Rita Jeptoo of Kenya and Prokopcuka. 
 An American woman has not won the Boston race since 1985, so Kastor is under pressure. She has the right stuff. Kastor was the first American woman to break the 2:20 barrier when she won the London Marathon last year in 2:19:36. In 2004, she ran a thrilling come-from-behind race to take the bronze medal in the Athens Olympics.
 You can be sure that many lining the route tomorrow from Hopkinton, Mass., to Boston will be screaming encouragement to Kastor to win for the United States, which has struggled to regain dominance in the marathon.
 Kastor, who has never run the Boston Marathon, finished sixth in the New York City Marathon last year; Prokopcuka won that race and is making her third Boston appearance. Jeptoo won in Boston last year, even though she arrived only hours before the start because of passport problems. Another contender is Madai Perez of Mexico, an up-and-comer who may be ready for a breakthrough. 
 The women's race should be riveting, and it will be front and center. The Boston race, like several other major marathons, now starts the elite women before the men. The women's races have become so popular and intriguing that the public and the news media wish to see the race unfold without male runners obstructing the view. 
 The drama is considerable because the marathon is a long and unpredictable race. Women won the right to run it, and they do so powerfully, inspiring others. 
 In 40 years, female marathoners have gone from being labeled as intruders to being hailed as stars of the sport.

HEADLINE: In Challenge to Survey Low-Wage Workers, Researchers Pursue 'Snowball Sample'

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Imagine a more challenging group to identify and quantify than jazz musicians. They tend to be itinerant. Also, poor. Go to the clubs, and those likely to be performing are the more successful ones. Ask the musicians' union, and chances are those enrolled will be disproportionately older and account for only a fraction of the total.
 Still, a Cornell University sociologist says he has figured out that there are 30,000 jazz musicians in metropolitan New York. And as it celebrates its centennial this week, the Russell Sage Foundation has recruited the sociologist and three other experts to use the same sampling technique and mathematical formula to identify another hard-to-count population: low-wage and often exploited workers. 
 ''What the methodology allows us to do is get at a representative population that is often hidden from policy researchers,'' said Annette Bernhardt, deputy director of the poverty program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. ''This has the potential to revolutionize how we identify, measure and respond to critical social and economic problems.''
 The Russell Sage Foundation, which is based in Manhattan, was created in 1907 by Margaret Olivia Sage, who named it for her late husband, a successful and notoriously parsimonious Wall Street financier. The mission of the foundation, which will mark its centennial on Thursday with a daylong social science symposium in Manhattan, is to use ''any means'' to effect ''the improvement of social and living conditions'' in the United States.
 ''We have a very long history of looking at quality-of-work issues,'' said Eric Wanner, the foundation's president. 
 Some of its latest research, he said, is focusing on the effects of income inequality and how economic forces are reshaping the labor market, including the impact of labor law violations on unregulated workers, especially immigrants, at the low end of the pay scale.
 ''The workers are hard to find and often vulnerable,'' the foundation said in a statement announcing the $515,277 research grant to study workplace violations in New York City, ''the employers are reluctant to disclose sensitive information, and government compliance surveys shy away from the difficult task of measuring workplace practices beyond the standard wage, benefits and hours questions.''
 In a written explanation of their goals, the researchers said, ''In industries ranging from construction and food manufacturing to restaurants and janitorial services, workers are enduring minimum wage and overtime violations, hazardous working conditions, discrimination and retaliation for speaking up or trying to organize.''
 They contend that ''unregulated work'' is proliferating, but that ''advocates and policy makers have no solid data on the magnitude of the problem, on the industries that are the biggest culprits or on the workers who are most affected.''
 Their research, which is in its early stage, relies heavily on a technique developed by Douglas Heckathorn, the Cornell sociologist and a former Russell Sage visiting scholar. He said in an interview that its goal was to ''address the inherent difficulties in trying to reach a largely invisible and often vulnerable population'' -- whether jazz musicians (for the Research Center for Arts and Culture at Columbia University) or immigrant workers, ex-convicts, former welfare recipients and low-wage workers (whose invisibility potentially distorts statistics on issues ranging from unemployment to health insurance).
 Researchers pursue what is called a ''snowball sample,'' seeking out workers who then recruit their friends in a process they liken to a chain letter, or to the ''six degrees of separation'' theory of connectedness. A mathematical formula is applied to the sample like a ''corrective lens,'' Professor Heckathorn explained, to obtain a sample that is ''theoretically independent of its nonrandom starting points.''
 Dr. Bernhardt said of the method, ''If you keep doing more and more chains of referrals, after you're done it 10 times your sample has reached all parts of the population and is drawing on the trust that social networks have to bring people into the study.'' 
 Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, ''This method is ideal for hard-to-reach populations.'' Dr. Milkman, who is conducting the three-city study with Dr. Bernhardt and Nik Theodore, a urban planning scholar at the University of Illinois, added, ''What we can do is measure something that heretofore has been extremely difficult to measure.''
 The sampling technique has been adopted by various research projects, including one by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify intravenous drug users susceptible to AIDS. Professor Heckathorn is applying the method to a study of artists and sculptors who have reached retirement age. He said not every group can be sampled using this method.
 ''There are certain requirements: The people have to have a connection,'' he said. ''It wouldn't work to find tax cheats.''

HEADLINE: After Duke Prosecution Began to Collapse, Demonizing Continued

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ESSEX FELLS, N.J. 

 BODY:
The rape case that cost three Duke University lacrosse players a year of their lives and much more of their youth finally ended on Wednesday, when North Carolina Attorney General Roy A. Cooper said what many people have long known: all three were totally innocent of the charges against them.
 But since last week was one for pondering language and apology, here's what those who know Reade Seligmann of Essex Fells, N.J., Collin Finnerty of Garden City, on Long Island, and David Evans of Bethesda, Md., are wondering. How did college kids with no shortage of character witnesses become such a free-fire zone for the correct thinkers in academia, the news media and the socially conscious left? Like l'affaire Imus in reverse, why did denouncing them remain fair game long after it was clear that the charges against them could not be true, and that even most of the misbehavior originally alleged about the team party was distorted or false? 
''That's what I keep asking,'' said Ed Abbot, the mayor of this village where the Seligmanns live, and a longtime friend of the family. ''People had racial agendas, economic agendas, media-driven agendas, and who these boys were got totally lost. You feel like you're in the middle of the forest screaming and no one can hear.''
 I went to Duke and have a son there, so maybe I was predisposed to hear the scream. But by now only those who get a delicious, angry jolt just from hearing the words ''white male privilege'' are not feeling a bit ill. 
 The initial reaction was not inexplicable. After all, the prosecutor, Michael B. Nifong, had repeatedly said that the students were guilty of the gang rape of a black woman.
 But Tricia Dowd, a teacher from East Northport, N.Y., whose son Kyle was a senior on the team, watched in stunned horror as the case and its attendant demonizing of bad white boys kept going, even after DNA evidence that Mr. Nifong promised would convict the guilty and free the innocent matched no one on the team. 
 (Only later was it revealed that he had also failed to release information showing evidence of DNA from other men.)
 Mrs. Dowd went to an angry meeting at North Carolina Central University, the predominantly black institution the accuser attended, where Mr. Nifong, who was running for office, promised to keep the case alive, and where one student said he wanted to see the Duke students prosecuted ''whether it happened or not,'' to atone for past sins.
 ''Maybe I'm naive,'' Mrs. Dowd said. ''I didn't know there was so much hate in the world.''
 Nona Farahnik, who lived in the same dormitory as Mr. Finnerty and Mr. Seligmann, said, ''When they said it was Reade and Collin, everyone knew it didn't happen.'' 
 But a year later, it was still alive. 
 ''I guess the ruptures in our society are so deep this was an easy thing for people to cling to,'' she said. ''They became a perfect example of all the injustices in society, except in their case, justice went out the door. And the same people usually championing basic human rights were so intent on denying it to them.''
 Which brings us to the confluence out of Tom Wolfe of Rutgers women's basketball and Duke men's lacrosse. 
 You could argue -- correctly -- that an ugly racist remark, joke or not, about black women has far more potential to harm than one about white men. 
 You could argue -- correctly -- that the injustice from one hideous remark by Don Imus that was defended by no one, including the man who uttered it, paled before that meted out to the lacrosse players over a year. 
 You could observe -- correctly -- that under the spotlight both teams behaved with much more class and maturity than did many of their elders. 
 But while Mr. Imus groveled (unsuccessfully) for his professional life, don't count on many forced apologies from those in academia (particularly at Duke), the news media, and civil rights and women's rights organizations who were so intoxicated by the story of bad white boys that they missed the real outrage: how prosecutors can railroad innocent people, nearly all of them without the students' resources or abilities to fight back. 
 And it's worth noting that many of the heroes of the Duke tale were black: James Coleman, a law professor who was the one Duke faculty member willing to take on Mr. Nifong; Moezeldin Elmostafa, a cabdriver who provided a crucial part of Mr. Seligmann's alibi; Ed Bradley of ''60 Minutes,'' who worked tirelessly to get the story right, despite suffering from fatal leukemia. 
 Mrs. Dowd, after the rape charges were dropped in December, sent an e-mail message to Houston Baker, a celebrated English professor at Duke who, when the story first broke, condemned rapacious athletes ''safe under the cover of silent whiteness'' given ''license to rape, maraud, deploy hate speech and feel proud of themselves in the bargain.'' She asked him if he would reconsider his early statements. 
 ''LIES!'' responded Dr. Baker, now a distinguished university professor of English at Vanderbilt. He said she was a ''provacateur'' who was ''trying to get credit for a scummy bunch of white males!'' He accused the players of living like ''farm animals'' and concluded that she should forgive him if she really is ''quite sadly, mother of a 'farm animal.' '' 
 We like simple tales in this country, and, for some, the ritual stoning of Mr. Imus played out that way. But the world is a lot more complicated than that. Just ask Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty or David Evans.

HEADLINE: Wolfowitz Seeks African Leaders' Backing

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz, seeking support for his beleaguered leadership as president of the World Bank, is turning for help to the one group at the bank that aides say he has focused on the most, the leaders of sub-Saharan Africa, bank officials say.
 At a news conference on Saturday, as hundreds of delegates circulated in Washington and speculated about Mr. Wolfowitz's future, several finance ministers of African countries said he had done an outstanding job in increasing aid to Africa and demanding an end to corruption. 
''He has been a visionary,'' said Antoinette Sayeh, finance minister of Liberia, which has received considerable bank assistance following its conflicts of a couple years ago. ''We're very grateful for his leadership in getting where we are today. We look forward to that continuing.''
 Rama Sithanen, a deputy prime minister of Mauritius, said Mr. Wolfowitz had been ''supportive of the reforms in our country.'' He said Mr. Wolfowitz ''has apologized for what has happened'' regarding the favoritism shown to his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, who is employed at the bank, and should be dealt with in a way that was ''commensurate'' with his mistakes.
 Mr. Sithanen and two others at the news conference said, however, that they would accept whatever the bank's 24-member board decided about Mr. Wolfowitz's future and assumed that the bank's pro-Africa policies would continue no matter who is leading the institution.
 At issue is Mr. Wolfowitz's handling of the transfer, promotion and raise of Ms. Riza at the bank when he arrived in 2005. She was detailed to the State Department and given a raise of nearly 50 percent in a manner that the bank's staff association said violated bank rules. The association has called for him to resign.
 Late Saturday night, in a new effort to appeal to the staff for understanding, Mr. Wolfowitz sent out e-mail messages to all bank employees calling their attention to documents released Friday. The documents show that he made efforts in 2005 to avoid conflicts of interest at the bank over his relationship with Ms. Riza. 
 The bank's board has been considering the matter but members were more involved this weekend in marathon meetings with delegates from 180 countries than with Mr. Wolfowitz's personal problems.
 Bank officials critical of Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledge that he has concentrated considerable energy on Africa and received praise from African leaders, but they also accuse him of cynically trying to rally Africans dependent on his good will in recent weeks, as criticism of his leadership has mounted.
 Several bank officials, asking not to be identified in order to avoid reprisals, charged that Mr. Wolfowitz was seeking backing from Africa as a kind of political base to counter the growing resentment among European leaders over his policies, particularly his anticorruption campaign.
 The bank's board acts as a kind of legislature setting policies as an equal weight with the president, and in some ways Mr. Wolfowitz's time in office has resembled a tug of war between two branches of government. 
 The board usually decides matters by consensus, but its power centers are the United States, Japan and Europe, the largest donors to its $20 billion annual lending and assistance programs. The board is considering Mr. Wolfowitz's future but getting guidance from more than 180 finance ministries around the world.
 The comments of top officials here indicated most were willing to wait for the board's judgment, but also seemed to accept Mr. Wolfowitz's apology on Thursday. 
 ''I have total confidence in the institution of the bank to handle this issue,'' said Rodrigo de Rato, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noting that Mr. Wolfowitz had acknowledged his error.
 Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, echoed that view, noting that Mr. Wolfowitz had apologized. ''I think we've got to respect the board's process,'' he said.
 Mr. Wolfowitz held meetings behind the scenes with these ministers and others in town for the annual session sponsored by the bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
 In a reflection of wariness among Europeans, Germany's minister in charge of the World Bank, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, spoke to Reuters and Bloomberg news services of the importance of preserving the bank's ''moral authority'' and suggested that even though Mr. Wolfowitz has apologized, he might need to leave for the good of the bank.
 ''He has to decide for himself whether he can continue to fulfill his duties credibly under these circumstances,'' Ms. Wieczorek-Zeul said, according to Bloomberg. 
 These comments reflected a sense among many bank officials that the world's finance ministers would be unlikely to force him out, but that a reprimand of some kind might persuade him that his leadership was untenable. On the other hand, Mr. Wolfowitz has churned through meetings this weekend like a man with a mission.
 Mr. Wolfowitz met Friday with the African members of the bank's board of governors, an aide said, adding that as bank president he has met virtually every day with at least someone involved in African development.
 Mr. Wolfowitz was instrumental in pushing for a huge debt cancellation plan for poor countries, most of them in Africa, announced by President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and other Western leaders at a 2005 summit meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland, attended by the singer Bono and other celebrities.
 Although he has also imposed temporary aid cutoffs to Africa on grounds of corruption, angering European aid officials who felt they were not consulted, he has also won friends among many African countries for preaching accountability in government.
 At a meeting on Thursday at which he was booed by bank employees, Mr. Wolfowitz appealed to the hostile crowd to work with him on the bank's real priorities, singling out Africa.
 A few weeks ago, Mr. Wolfowitz held a ''town hall'' session in the bank's atrium wearing a shirt he had obtained on the most recent of his four trips to Africa as bank president. A slogan on the shirt read, in French, ''No to impunity for violence against women, yes to justice.'' 
 The session was to introduce a new vice president for Africa, Oby Ezekwesili, a former minister in Nigeria, who praised Mr. Wolfowitz and drew applause from the crowd.

HEADLINE: Off-the-Book Construction Jobs Soar in City, Study Shows

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
An economic study set to be released today found widespread illegal practices in New York City's residential construction industry, estimating that one-fifth of the 82,000 workers who build housing in the city work off the books.
 The study by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit organization financed in part by unions, noted that while the volume of residential construction in New York City more than doubled from 2000 to 2005, official employment among residential construction companies rose just 16 percent over that period. An increasing amount of the additional construction work is being done by off-the-book workers. 
The report said the underground use of workers was greatest in the construction of low- and moderate-income housing, and estimated that two-thirds of such construction took place in the underground economy.
 ''Clearly a huge number of workers go to work every day but don't show up in the Labor Department statistics,'' said James Parrott, the chief economist for the institute, a liberal research group.
 The study lauded Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plans to create or preserve 165,000 low- and moderate-income housing units over 10 years. But the report said it was unfortunate that many of the construction workers building those units were paid off the books and received low wages and few fringe benefits.
 The report urged the city to make sure that companies that receive city subsidies to build low- and moderate-income housing pay their employees properly and provide safe conditions. 
 The Fiscal Policy report found that construction workers employed off the books in New York City average $10 an hour, or $18,400 a year in wages, without overtime. Unionized workers in residential construction average $24.70 an hour, or about $45,448 a year, and receive good health and pension benefits. Nonunionized laborers who work on the books make $14 an hour, or about $25,760 a year, the report says.
 Industry experts say the number of residential construction workers employed off the books has soared because the industry needs so many workers, because so many illegal immigrants are eager to take construction jobs and because unions have made few inroads in organizing workers in residential construction.
 The report said that employers that hire people off the books also often cut corners on safety, contributing to the increase in construction deaths. According to federal officials, 28 workers died on New York City construction sites in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, compared with an annual average of 20 for the last four years. Most of those killed were nonunionized workers for small companies.
 ''There's tremendous volume of construction activity in the city, and I think there are a lot of firms, contractors and sometimes owners who are looking to increase their margins and are willing to do it by jeopardizing safety, skirting the city's building code, and taking many shortcuts,'' said Louis Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers' Association, a group of unionized companies in New York.
 Many unionized employers say unionization leads to faster, safer and more efficient construction practices, although some economists say union wages are so high it is hard to build low- and moderate-income housing while using union labor.
 The report asserted that one of the most common illegal practices was for construction companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than as employees. In that way, many companies seek to avoid paying Social Security taxes, unemployment insurance taxes and workers' compensation premiums.
 The report says that 13,350 workers, nearly one-sixth of the city's residential building workers, were misclassified as independent contractors. Such misclassification, the report argued, foists costs, such as workers' compensation costs, onto other employers.
 ''As close as we can tell, $85 million to $126 million of costs are evaded by employers that pay people off the books and misclassify some employees as so-called independent contractors,'' Mr. Parrott said.

HEADLINE: In the South Bronx, Unlikely Allies Fight a Proposed Jail

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Residents of the South Bronx have long made the point that the area needs banks, restaurants, parkland and, most critically, jobs. The last thing the South Bronx needs, some of them say, is a new 2,040-inmate jail.
 A proposal by the city's Correction Department to build a $375 million jail in the Hunts Point section has aroused opposition from an unlikely coalition of neighbors, environmentalists, advocates for prison reform and members of the union that represents jail guards. 
''They're essentially trying to establish a penal colony in the South Bronx,'' said Elena Conte, the solid waste and energy coordinator for Sustainable South Bronx, an environmental group opposed to the jail plan.
 On Friday, opponents earned more time to continue their fight after Steven E. Smith, the owner of the proposed jail site, won a temporary restraining order in Federal Bankruptcy Court that delays the plan's first public hearing, which had been scheduled for tomorrow. (The court proceedings were held in bankruptcy court because Mr. Smith's company, Britestarr Homes, is in bankruptcy protection.)
 Mr. Smith, who had cooperated with the city when the Department of Correction had planned a smaller jail on the property, now maintains that the effort to condemn the entire 27-acre parcel is preventing him from developing or selling the land.
 ''I have everything I own invested in this property,'' said Mr. Smith, who added that he believes he could sell the land for as much as $80 million. 
 The tract is among the largest pieces of vacant land in the city that is controlled by a single owner. For years, the property had been used as an illegal dump for construction and demolition material, and it is still filled with debris. Mr. Smith originally sought to build a power plant there.
 The Department of Correction first proposed the jail -- which would be known as the Oak Point Detention Center -- last April. 
 Martin F. Horn, commissioner of the Department of Correction, said during an interview last week that the city needed the 2,000-bed jail to relieve pressure on the dilapidated Rikers Island jail complex. The department has also proposed reopening and expanding capacity at the Brooklyn House of Detention, which is now closed, from 700 to 1,400 inmates within five years. 
 In January, the Bronx House of Detention, which housed about 400 inmates, was demolished to make room for a $500 million mall. The city also operates a barge with 800 prisoners anchored off Hunts Point, not far from the proposed jail.
 ''This is a citywide plan to overall reduce the size of the city's jail system and reduce the dependence on Rikers Island and its aging facilities,'' said Mr. Horn. ''Jails have to go somewhere.''
 Mr. Horn said that keeping so many inmates -- an average of about 14,000 each day -- on Rikers Island presented security problems, was a chore for family members and attorneys seeking to visit inmates and was a psychological burden for the prisoners.
 ''Keeping all the city's inmates on Rikers Island is downright dangerous,'' he said. ''It stigmatizes and demonizes inmates. It is New York's version of Devil's Island.''
 But critics say the proposed Bronx jail, which would be the city's largest outside of Rikers Island, makes little sense. 
 The union representing corrections officers has said the $375 million needed to build the jail would be better spent on improving conditions at Rikers. 
 Environmentalists say they are concerned about possible toxic chemicals at the Bronx site, including mercury, barium and lead. And politicians and residents say the South Bronx has been the dumping ground for the city for too long, and that a new jail might interrupt the area's resurgence.
 The South Bronx has one of the city's highest concentrations of waste transfer stations and sewage treatment plants. There is also a sprawling rail yard and a fertilizer pellet factory that residents say emits a foul odor.
 ''I've heard every possible excuse to do something bad in the Bronx,'' said U.S. Rep. Jose E. Serrano, who represents the South Bronx and has been one of the jail's most outspoken opponents. ''The whole situation is people forgetting how far the South Bronx has come.''
 Mr. Horn bristles at the suggestion that a jail would taint the area.
 ''These are the sons and daughters of the city,'' Mr. Horn said, referring to inmates. ''We are not noxious. We do not spew noxious fumes. It demeans the humanity of us.''
 In addition to housing 2,040 inmates, the proposed jail would have 600 parking spaces and a kitchen where meals for all of the city's jails would be prepared. Construction would start in 2009 and be finished in 2013.
 Mr. Horn said the jail would not hurt economic development in the South Bronx, and might even aid it by encouraging new restaurants and other businesses that would serve corrections officers and visitors. And no one, he said, lives within at least half a mile of the site.
 ''There is no evidence that the location of a jail diminishes a community,'' he said.
 Faced with intense opposition, Mr. Horn has been like a man waging a political campaign. 
 Before Monday's hearing was canceled, he had been scheduled to give reporters a bus tour of Rikers Island to point out the complex's dilapidated condition. (Some of the buildings on the island have been closed after a federal judge found them to be inadequate for holding inmates.) A spokesman said the tour would be rescheduled.
 Opponents may be united against the jail, but they are split about what they would like to have built at the site, which includes a stretch of East River waterfront.
 Mr. Smith would still like to build a power plant, although that plan has failed to win either neighborhood or political support. Mr. Serrano said he would like to see at least part of the tract reserved for a park.
 Sustainable South Bronx has proposed building a recycling center that would create 300 to 500 jobs. 
 Mr. Horn said, however, that the jail plan ''is the last best chance for the city to be able to do the right thing.''

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Struggles to Quell An Epidemic of Gun Violence

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE; Dan Barry's column, ''This Land,'' will resume next week.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 14 

 BODY:
In a hospital emergency room, a young man winces as doctors try to determine how badly he has been injured.
 His name is Karim Williams, he is 27, and he is this city's latest shooting victim. He says he was hit around 12:30 a.m. by a shot fired while he was walking from his girlfriend's car into a bar.
Mr. Williams was fortunate. The bullet went through his leg without hitting bone or major blood vessels, and after a shot of morphine and a few hours' observation, he will be discharged from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania back into the West Philadelphia night. 
 In some ways, Mr. Williams is a typical patient at the trauma unit: young, mildly intoxicated and apparently with no idea why he was shot. What makes his case less common, doctors here say, is that he is neither seriously injured nor dead, since Philadelphia is in the midst of an epidemic of gun violence that has left the police struggling to preserve public safety and government officials renewing efforts to tighten the state's gun control laws.
 Last year, there were 406 homicides in Philadelphia, most of them by gunshot, the highest number in nine years, according to the Police Department. From 2004 to 2006, the number of homicides in the city rose 22 percent, more than twice as much as the aggregate increase recorded by 56 cities surveyed by the Police Executive Research Forum, a national law enforcement group.
 This year, the pace of the killings has worsened; as of Friday the death toll stood at 110, or 16 percent higher than at the same time last year. By comparison, in New York City, with six times the population, there were 102 homicides from Jan. 1 to April 8, a drop of almost 24.4 percent from the same period a year ago. The rise in violence is evident at the University of Pennsylvania hospital, whose trauma unit treated 479 gunshot victims last year, a 15 percent increase over 2005. Some 18 percent of the attacks were fatal, and 16 percent of the victims will suffer permanent disabilities, like paralysis from head or spinal injuries, amputations, or long-term damage to internal organs. 
 Gun violence is becoming so common in some parts of the city that many people are no longer shocked by it, said Dr. Bill Schwab, chief of trauma and surgical critical care at the hospital.
 ''Are people becoming numb to violence? The answer is yes,'' Dr. Schwab said. ''It's very common for them to be sitting on their porch and to hear gunshots in the night.''
 What sets Philadelphia apart from other cities, say the police, politicians and academic experts, is the combination of high poverty -- with 25 percent of the population living below the poverty line, the city has the highest rate among the 10 biggest cities, according to census data -- a youth culture that increasingly settles minor disputes through violence and the easy availability of guns.
 Pennsylvania's cities are forbidden by state law from making their own gun laws, and so must conform to the political will of a largely rural state that, according to the National Rifle Association, has around a quarter of a million gun owners.
 With about 85 percent of Philadelphia's homicides involving guns, gun control advocates are urging state lawmakers to limit handgun purchases to one per person per month. The goal is to choke off supply to so-called straw purchasers, who buy multiple guns on behalf of those who cannot legally acquire the guns themselves because they have criminal records.
 Supporters -- including Gov. Edward G. Rendell and Philadelphia's police chief, Sylvester Johnson -- say it would not curtail the right of gun owners to bear arms but would significantly reduce the number of illegal guns on the street.
 But many state lawmakers oppose the plan, which was introduced in February as part of a package of gun control measures, as an attempt to curb the Second Amendment right to bear arms. ''It's a constitutional infringement,'' said State Representative Bryan Cutler, a Republican from Lancaster County, at a recent seminar at Temple University Hospital here on the effects of gun violence. 
 A similar measure was defeated in the Legislature last October, the day after a Lancaster County gunman carrying a mostly legal arsenal shot 10 Amish schoolgirls in their classroom, killing five of them.
 For Karim Williams, the explanation for Philadelphia's carnage is a lack of jobs.
 ''You've got to have jobs for the people that need them,'' he said from his gurney. ''You have to keep people occupied. Without jobs, all you can do is resort to violence.''
 Mr. Williams said he recently became a licensed electrician and was looking for work after a past in which he served jail time for crimes including car theft and drug dealing.
 While Mr. Williams hopes to escape the violence of his West Philadelphia neighborhood, it is too late for Richard Johnson. He was killed in a South Philadelphia convenience store in July 2005 when he was 17.
 His mother, Catherine Young, said Richard -- who had won a full academic scholarship to a local university -- and his cousin were shot by a 16-year-old boy who claimed they were blocking the doorway in the store, and came back a short time later with a gun.
 ''It's so easy for them to have a gun,'' Ms. Young said. ''Nobody should own a gun except the police.''

 BODY:
LET us now praise the unsung heroes of the effervescent Manhattan real estate market, where prices are pushing upward as they teeter or fall in much of the rest of the country: the buyers.
 In the last week or two, city property records recorded the names of people -- or in some cases of the trusts and limited liability corporations -- mainly from the worlds of technology, law and finance, who have been willing to step up and buy increasingly expensive real estate, despite these uncertain times.
There was Gerard Guillemot, a co-founder of Ubisoft, the French interactive-game company, who spent $7.75 million for an eighth-floor apartment at 151 East 79th Street, at Lexington Avenue. There are just 16 units in the 15-story building. In 2003, Mr. Guillemot founded Longtail Studios, which designs games and entertainment for mobile phones. 
 Then there was the trader at Millennium Partners, a hedge fund. He paid $6.55 million for an apartment, the last unsold unit at 50 Bond Street, a turn-of-the-last-century loft building with Greek Revival details in NoHo that was converted to condominiums a few years ago. The trader asked that his name not be used because the building has only six apartments and no doorman. The apartment is a duplex that includes 2,600 square feet on the seventh floor, a 770-square-foot eighth-floor penthouse and 2,000 square feet of terraces, according to property records.
 Meanwhile, Maria Bartiromo, a CNBC business correspondent, and her husband, Jonathan Steinberg, a hedge fund executive and a son of the financier Saul P. Steinberg, bought an 18.5-foot-wide town house on East 62nd Street. Ms. Bartiromo has been buffeted by questions in the business media lately over her relationship with sources. So what could be more comforting than the ritual of closing and getting the keys to a new house? The price was $6.5 million, according to property records, and the seller was Michael Slocum, a banker with Wachovia Bank, who was transferred out of the city.
 But unfortunately, not all New Yorkers can contribute to this high end of the real estate market. A study released last week by New York University's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy found that at recent sale prices, almost all apartments in Manhattan and most apartments across the city are beyond the means of typical New York households.
 The study estimated that fewer than 5 percent of New York City homes sold in 2005 were affordable to New Yorkers earning the city's median household income ($43,000 in 2005), down from 11 percent in 2000.
 In Manhattan, only 2.1 percent of all apartments sold were affordable to such households and 4.6 percent affordable to households earning 160 percent of the median income, or $64,500 in 2005. This number was down from 10.1 percent in 2000. A Hollywood Agent's Oscar-Worthy Deal 
 BRYAN LOURD, the co-director of the Creative Artists Agency and one of the most powerful agents in Hollywood, knows how to do a deal. In 2004, Mr. Lourd, who holds one of the more celebrated pre-Oscar parties at his house in Los Angeles, bought an apartment in Greenwich Village, one of the two duplex penthouses atop 59 West 12th Street, a prewar apartment building developed by Bing & Bing, whose apartments are known for their spaciousness. 
 Mr. Lourd's condo has south-facing views, a fireplace, two landscaped terraces and a living room with arched windows and 14-foot ceilings, according to the listing at the time by John Venekamp, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens. 
 It has 2,760 square feet, not including the 840 square feet of terrace space, the condo documents show. Mr. Lourd paid $4.9 million for it. But it seems it was not quite big enough.
 Outside Hollywood, Mr. Lourd may be best known for his relationship with the actress and authorfor his relationship with Carrie Fisher. Mr. Lourd and Ms. Fisher have a daughter.
 In the Village, Mr. Lourd began negotiations over the last several months to buy the condo of his next-door neighbor, Hall Cannon, who owned a much smaller one-bedroom, at 1,082 square feet, facing north and without a terrace. Mr. Cannon paid $1.3 million for the apartment in November 2001, according to city records. 
 Mr. Cannon, who worked for several years in real estate development in Manhattan, decided on an abrupt change in direction, and with his partner, Miles Refo, who worked in publishing, moved to New Zealand, where they bought and began renovating the historic Otahuna Lodge, which had fallen into receivership. 
 The lodge, which has a spa and seven guest suites, caters to British and American guests. But it is also a working farm with chickens, sheep and pigs, a huge change from West 12th Street. They no longer needed the New York apartment and decided to sell, Mr. Cannon said.
 Mr. Lourd's final offer was so high that it was accepted before a broker was hired and the apartment was listed. City records show a price of $4.25 million for the one-bedroom, which works out to $3,900 a square foot, more than double the average price per square foot in Greenwich Village. 
 But several brokers said that Mr. Lourd may have nonetheless made a wise deal since, in this strong luxury market, the combined apartments will probably command a much higher price per square foot as a single unit than they would if resold separately.

HEADLINE: Airstream: The Concept Travels Well

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
AS if abandoned by a misdirected camper who parked in the dark, a silver Airstream trailer sits these days in the lobby of the Museum of Modern Art. A model called the Bambi, designed in 1960 with Airstream's distinctive streamlined riveted skin, has been acquired for the museum's design collection. 
 The first Airstream, the Clipper, arrived in 1936 amid a national craze for streamlining -- in cars, in buildings, in toasters -- as the brainchild of an inventor and travel promoter named Wally Byam. After World War II, as the highway system expanded, the economy boomed and Airstreams gained starring roles in Hollywood films, the trailer came to symbolize American-style travel.
Airstream's appeal seems to have few limits, and indeed a powerful world traveler recently provided proof of its persistent appeal. On a trip to Asia in February, Vice President Dick Cheney traveled in an Airstream -- inside an airplane. 
 Mark Silva, chief of the Washington bureau of The Chicago Tribune, accompanied the vice president as the press corps' pool print reporter. The group flew on a huge gray C-17 cargo plane that the Air Force calls the Spirit of Strom Thurmond, in honor of the late senator. Mr. Silva said that when he boarded he noted the familiar outline of the Airstream roof inside the vast fuselage.
 ''I crawled on the floor to look at the nameplate,'' Mr. Silva said, confirming that it read ''Airstream, Jackson Center, Ohio.'' Inside, Mr. Silva said in an interview, ''there were plush leather chairs, blue-gray carpet, wood paneling, recessed lighting and a TV and DVD player.'' He said the Airstream reminded him of one of the first he had seen, on the cover of a Ry Cooder record album from 1970. ''The Airstream is the symbol of taking it on the road with style,'' he added. 
 A home for the road, the Airstream has long intrigued Americans as an ideal combination of their twin loves, vehicle and home. Its functionalism also let it be read as a symbol of the ideals of modern architecture. Christian Larsen, a curatorial assistant in MoMA's department of architecture and design, said, ''The Bambi is a machine for living and traveling, the sort of industrialized, rationalized vessel that had long been the dream object of modernist architects, from Le Corbusier to Buckminster Fuller.'' 
 Mr. Larsen also related the Airstream to the work of artists like Andrea Zittel, who builds trailerlike works, installed in galleries or outdoor installations. 
 In recent years, the Airstream has attracted the attention of automakers, too. 
 Nissan Design America, the California studio of the Japanese automaker, produced an Airstream trailer concept displayed at auto shows after its introduction at the New York International Contemporary Furniture Fair in 2003. Bryan Thompson, one of the designers, said Nissan's work with Airstream led to the BaseCamp, a $20,000 trailer with a pop-up Kelty tent. The BaseCamp, which is now sold by Airstream, is light enough to be towed by the average car.
 ''Airstream is one of those companies that is part of the heart and soul of American design,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''The shape is timeless, the materials are modern and the fabrication is hands-on traditional. They have the ability to combine Old World handmade craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology.'' 
 More recently, Airstream, which is based in Jackson Center, Ohio, and now owned by Thor Industries, has collaborated with Ford. The automaker's Airstream design study, a crossover wagon theoretically powered by hydrogen fuel cells, was unveiled in Detroit in January and has been on display at the New York auto show, which closes today. 
 The alliance grew out of a high-concept future study ordered by J Mays, the group vice president for design at Ford, to explore the American journey. The result was a concept vehicle of gleaming aluminum and orange window frames aimed at the growing number of baby boomers who are 55 and older -- a group that has historically accounted for a large percentage of trailer buyers. 
 ''The Ford Airstream concept captures the sense of optimism and adventure conveyed in American aircraft, spacecraft and the streamlined shape of Airstream trailers,'' Mr. Mays said. 
 The Ford concept realizes Wally Byam's dream of eventually making the Airstream a self-propelled land yacht. (He foresaw a motorized portion that would detach from the mothership, like a dinghy.) It recalls the VW Microbus, and for that matter the Stout Scarab, a 1935 precursor to the minivan.
 Inside, the Ford concept car shifts its frame of reference to more distant travel. The materials and colors -- called ''cosmic red and white'' -- were inspired by the spacecraft in the 1968 film ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'' 
 Space buffs will recall another connection between space travel and Airstream. In 1969, upon their return from the moon, the Apollo 11 astronauts were quartered inside a modified Airstream called the mobile quarantine facility. They remained in the silver pod for three weeks; President Richard M. Nixon visited and waved at the astronauts through the window. 
 More recently, the silver bullet Airstreams have attracted the attention of those who appreciate other aspects of 1950s modernism. Allison Arieff, the former editor of Dwell magazine, which celebrates prefab housing and modernist ideals, is an Airstream owner and fan. She and her husband, Bryan Burkhart, along with David Hunt, produced a book ''Airstream: The History of the Land Yacht'' (Chronicle Books, 2000). Other titles ministering to the faithful include ''Airstream Living'' by Bruce Littlefield and Simon Brown (Collins Design, 2005), a celebration of the many ways the trailers have been customized. 
 If Airstreams are perceived as cool among 30-somethings, it is surely because mobile living is an idea with lingering appeal. In fact, the trailers have experienced a revival after suffering a slow decline from their peak of popularity in the '50s. Byam's monocoque aircraft torpedo trailer designs proved more expensive to build than trailers that were less durable and less visually exciting. Airstream was on the ropes when its creator died in 1962. 
 The rediscovery took time. In 2000, Christopher C. Deam, an architect and designer, was hired to rebuild the inside of an Airstream to show off Wilsonart's plastic laminate. The trailer was so well received that Airstream began producing a line of similar products.
 There was more to Byam's vision than the trailer itself. In the 1950s he organized the Wally Byam Caravan Club International and led Airstream trips across America -- some 4,000 gathered in Jackson Center for homecomings -- and then around the world. The Airstreamers wore dark blue berets and loaded their land yachts into the holds of ships for dispatch across the seas, painted with proud owner labels like ''Don and Leta Hill, Corning, Iowa, USA.'' 
 Byam's caravaning creed was a stark statement of one American vision of travel. The goal of trailering, he declared, was ''to place the great wide world at your doorstep for you who yearn to travel with all the comforts of home.'' 
 Byam pledged in his book ''Trailer Travel Here and Abroad,'' to ''lead caravans wherever the four winds blowto the traveled and untraveled corners of the earth.''
 With his wife, Stella, and their dogs Penny and Chica, Byam led caravans that traversed the Oregon Trail, South America and Europe. The most ambitious trip went from Cape Town to Cairo. Along the way, he met a witch doctor in Uganda and Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.
 The journey culminated in the encampment in the famed wagon wheel circle of a vast fleet of Airstreams in the shadow of the Great Pyramid of Giza, like a congregation of silvery metal worshippers. 
 Byam began by selling plans for building trailers. Soon he moved to offering kits, then finished trailers in aluminum. In 1936 he offered the Airstream Clipper, which borrowed its name and look from Pan Am Clipper seaplanes and Chrysler's Airflow and Airstream cars.
 But travel by Airstream can be limiting. The vastness of the globe can be confused with the compactness of the silver pod; one's view of the world can be restricted to the one out the trailer window. ''There are just too many Italians in Italy,'' Byam concluded after driving his Airstream through Europe.
 ''None of us had ever met a red Russian before,'' he noted. ''We were surprised to discover that they were good looking and interesting, if a trifle serious people.'' 
 In Cuba in 1958, Fulgencio Batista greeted Byam and his caravan. The dictator arrived with armed guards and an entourage of mysterious black cars. But after all, Byam recalled in his book, ''that might have been expected considering the fact that he has a revolution in his backyard.''
 Byam saw the Airstream as a neutral vessel wherever it sailed. ''We never get involved in the internal politics of any country,'' he said. ''We concentrate on learning as much as we can, making friends on an unofficial, nonpolitical people-to-people basis.''
 The Airstream, like the covered wagon, suggested membership in a group of pioneers. Mr. Larsen of MoMA said, ''In California, having one in your backyard became a symbol for a lifestyle.'' 
 The iconic successor of the Conestoga wagon and the prairie schooner, the yacht and the private Pullman car, the Airstream can be seen as a symbol of the best and worst qualities of traveling Americans: the willingness to go anywhere tempered by the simultaneous wish never to leave home.

HEADLINE: Accusations, Words in Defense: The Mounting Storm over Wolfowitz

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz finds himself under heavy fire once again. As a deputy secretary of defense in the Bush administration, he was an architect of the war in Iraq. Now, as president of the World Bank, he has become embroiled in a dispute over his role in giving his companion, a World Bank employee, a raise and transfer. Mr. Wolfowitz, who was nominated to the job by President Bush in 2005, issued an apology late last week, and the bank's executive board promised quick action to decide his fate. One of his signature campaigns has been cracking down on corruption in poor countries that the bank assists. Now his critics are calling him a hypocrite. 
 Here's a sampling of commentary on the issue: Lost Credibility 
 The president of the World Bank has one asset: his credibility Recent revelations have, however, demonstrated such serious failures that the bank's moral authority is endangered. If the president stays, it risks becoming an object not of respect, but of scorn, and its campaign in favor of good governance not a believable struggle, but blatant hypocrisy. 
In a world where curtailing corruption and improving governance have become central to the practice of development, the world's premier development institution must, like Caesar's wife, stand above suspicion. The Financial Times Keeping It in Perspective 
 One of Wolfowitz's priorities at the bank has been to attack corruption and corrupt practices -- and this drive has triggered intense resentment among bank staff. Corruption is not a small problem for the bank: it's generally accepted that somewhere between 10 percent and 25 percent of the bank's resources have been improperly diverted -- so we are talking about sums in the billions of dollars, possibly in the tens of billions. 
 The thought may have occurred to some discomfited officials: If only we could find some way to hoist these meddlesome president with his own petard, life around here would resume its pleasant ways. Under the circumstances, it was Wolfowitz's duty to set the most stringent example. But even if he erred, let's not lose sight of the larger issues -- and the grosser scandal.
 David Frum, National Review Online Presidential Backing 
 The president has full confidence in Paul Wolfowitz. He's done a remarkable job at the World Bank, where they are working to lift people up out of poverty from around the world. He's apologized for the matter, and his board is undergoing an internal review. And we expect him to remain as World Bank president -- he has the president's support. 
 Dana Perino, White House spokeswoman A Trivial Dispute 
 The forces of the World Bank status quo are now making their power play, demanding that the bank's board ask him to resign over an ethics flap involving his girlfriend. The dispute is so trivial that it betrays that this fracas has little to do with Mr. Wolfowitz's ethics. The real fight here is over his attempt to make the bank and its borrowers more accountable for results, especially by exposing and punishing corruption. 
 Mr. Wolfowitz has tried to institute more accountability, especially on corruption. Who could be against fighting corruption? Well, for starters, a global poverty industry that thinks ''governance'' is a distraction from the only real measure of development, which is how much money ''rich'' nations choose to redistribute to poor ones. Never mind that many of these countries stay poor year after year precisely because they squander or steal foreign aid.
 The Wall Street Journal Hyping Intelligence 
 You can make a misleading case for war, support a secret internal Pentagon effort to manipulate and hype intelligence that supports the case for war, invade another country without preparing for what comes after the invasion. And nothing happens. In fact, you are subsequently awarded with a medal and a plum job. But if you use your influence to get a pay raise for your girlfriend, well, then, you're in big, big trouble. It's sort of like nabbing Al Capone on tax evasion. 
 David Corn, Washington editor,
 The Nation, at DavidCorn.com Dubious Assertions 
 Wolfowitz, the neo-con's neo-con, has now made a total shambles of the development goals of the World Bank through even more displays of arrogance and dubious assertions. He has alienated his staff, and led poor nations from around the world to rebuke him for his attempts to link all debt relief and loans to unrealistic, ideologically driven, and phony ''anti-corruption'' measures. Wolfowitz's tenure at the World Bank has been as disastrous as his record at the Pentagon. The man is incompetent and a liar. He even hooked up his longtime paramour, Shaha Riza, with a financially lucrative post under his command. It is time for Wolfowitz to be relieved of his post at the World Bank before he can do even more damage

HEADLINE: LENDERS SOUGHT EDGE AGAINST U.S. IN STUDENT LOANS

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER and KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
In a fierce contest to control the student loan market, the nation's banks and lenders have for years waged a successful campaign to limit a federal program that was intended to make borrowing less costly by having the government provide loans directly to students.
 The companies have offered money to universities to pull out of the federal direct loan program, which was championed by the Clinton administration. They went to court to keep the direct program from becoming more competitive. And they benefited from oversight so lax that the Education Department's assistant inspector general in 2003 called for tightened regulation of lender dealings with universities.
 At Indiana University in 2004, for example, Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, offered $3 million that the university could use for ''opportunity loans'' to some students if it left the direct loan program. Indiana left the direct loan program but said the $3 million was not the reason; Sallie Mae currently administers their loan program. 
 Bank of America, which won the University of Virginia's student loan business, said in its 2002 proposal that certain possible incentives had ''the potential to violate'' federal law. The bank, which said such a discussion was normal in the bidding process, suggested that it discuss the issues with university officials ''during the oral presentation phase of the process.''
 All of this has helped give private lenders clear dominance of the $69 billion federal student loan industry. The lenders, who defend these practices, say they are winning business primarily because they offer lower interest rates than the government and often lower fees.
 Advocates of the direct loan program say that it has been held back from offering more competitive rates and benefits, and that a very small percentage of students can take advantage of the private rivals' advertised rates and incentives. They argue that private lenders cost the government vast amounts of money because they are subsidized and guaranteed against default. 
 President Bush's budget reports that in 2006 for every $100 lent by private lenders, the cost to the government of subsidies, defaults and other items was $13.81, while the same amount lent through the direct loan program cost the government $3.85. The battle for dominance in the loan market has escalated as tuitions have soared and students have borrowed more. This is the context for many of the payments to universities and financial aid officials that have come to light as a result of recent investigations into student loan practices. 
 ''What has happened is unbridled competition meets lack of oversight,'' said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education. 
 Part of what is generating the competition is that the government runs two loan programs -- and universities usually choose to participate in one or the other. 
 Until the 1990s, the primary program was the federal guaranteed loan program under which private lenders like Citibank, Sallie Mae or Bank of America made the loans to students. They were given a helping hand from the government, which paid subsidies to the lenders and guaranteed them against default. 
 Bill Clinton campaigned for president on the notion of expanding the federal government's role as student loan guarantor into a more central position as the direct lender. The idea was that this would prove cheaper and simpler for students and be less costly for taxpayers because borrowers would pay interest to the federal government instead of to the lenders. 
 The program went into effect in 1994. The Democrats expected it to become dominant. But unwilling to be muscled aside, private lenders began offering schools and students a variety of benefits like scholarship money and lower interest rates and fees. 
 Tom Joyce, a spokesman for Sallie Mae, said, ''The private sector program has better prices, better product selection, better service and better technology.''
 For a few years after direct lending went into effect, it grew quickly. But as student loan volume has risen, climbing above $85 billion in 2005-6 from just over $30 billion 10 years earlier, the government's share as a direct lender has declined, and now amounts to less than a quarter of the total. 
 ''When direct lending was created, the initial assumption was that the bank-based program would be quickly overwhelmed by the government program,'' Mr. Hartle said. No one counted on the strength of the reaction from the lending industry, he and others said.
 The Education Department fought back. Richard W. Riley, then the secretary of education, tried to make the direct lending program more competitive in 1999 and 2000 by reducing origination fees and interest rates. The private lenders sued, saying Mr. Riley had no authority to do this because these rates were set by Congress under the loan legislation. (Last year, lawmakers set the interest rate on new Stafford loans, one of the most popular federally guaranteed loans, at 6.8 percent; many private lenders offer to reduce that rate for borrowers who make payments on time or meet other goals.)
 In response to the lawsuit, the Education Department argued that the public and private loan programs had the power to offer the same terms and conditions, and added that better loan terms would make loans more affordable and thus reduce defaults, benefiting taxpayers.
 With the Bush administration more sympathetic to the private market, the lenders withdrew the lawsuit last year, and the direct loan program has offered some of the incentives used by its private rivals.
 Katherine McLane, a spokeswoman for Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, said both federal loan programs were ''a vital source of funds for student aid.'' Ms. McLane said that ''through these two programs we have improved students' and families' choices by increasing competition, upgrading customer service and lowering costs.''
 The Bush administration took virtually no action as lenders offered special pools of money if universities would leave the direct loan program. Lenders, by law, are barred from offering inducements to gain loan applications. But what is an inducement is not entirely clear.
 A review by the Education Department's office of the inspector general in 2003 -- prompted by an accusation that Sallie Mae was offering illegal inducements -- found that the department had brought only one public action, a case involving Sallie Mae and a college of podiatric medicine in 1995, which an administrative law judge later struck down.
 The assistant inspector general, Cathy H. Lewis, who conducted the examination, also noted that the Education Department had not given any updated opinions about what kind of inducements were barred since 1995, even though the competition for loan business had escalated sharply since then. Ms. Lewis expressed concern about ''bargaining practices between schools and lenders.'' She referred to both the guaranteed loan program and private loans, which like any consumer loan lack government backing. Students increasingly rely on private loans because of limits on borrowing through the federal program. 
 She wrote that the practices ''should be addressed through statutory and regulatory changes or further department guidance.''
 Ms. McLane said in an e-mail message that the department had offered no guidance to lenders because it believed it had ''no authority over the private loan instruments and market and therefore no guidance could be provided.''
 She said the department had begun examining whether there should be new regulations in December.
 Republicans in Congress have issued a continuing stream of criticisms about the direct lending program and tried to restrict it in a variety of ways. 
 Just last year, they voted to give lawmakers the power to cut the budget of the Education Department office that oversees the student loan program -- a looming if indirect threat to direct lending. They also made it more difficult for many borrowers with multiple loans to combine them into a single, larger direct loan, effectively making it harder for students to refinance their debts.
 ''The federal government should be in the business of student loans as the lender of last resort when private lenders can't offer competitive opportunities,'' said Senator Michael B. Enzi, a Wyoming Republican who is the former chairman of the Education Committee.
 In the absence of any crackdown on inducements, banks and other lenders showered universities with incentives to leave the direct lending program.
 Sallie Mae, for example, offered Pace University in New York City $4 million in loans for students who would not have otherwise qualified if it left the direct loan program, the university said. Pace turned the offer down, a spokesman said. But it did eventually leave the program.
 Colleges in the direct lending program were increasingly concerned about its future in the face of growing Republican opposition.
 Yvonne Hubbard, director of Student Financial Services at the University of Virginia, said that was one factor that prompted the school to leave the program, along with the better deals being offered by the private lenders.
 The university invited lender proposals in 2002 and chose Bank of America for a five-year term. It was in this process that the bank warned that some services under discussion had ''the potential to violate'' regulations against inducements.
 Ms. Hubbard said she had no memory of what that language might have referred to, and a Bank of America spokesman, Joe Miller, said that it was not unusual to use this language in responding to a request to bid for a contract.
 Bank of America is the only lender the University of Virginia recommends. The bank handles about 95 percent of the federal student loans at the university. Under the agreement, students who take out subsidized loans through the bank pay no origination or guarantor fees. 
 Ms. Hubbard said that the university tried to make clear to families that they were free to borrow from anyone but that it also offered this advice: ''Take the terms we have negotiated with Bank of America and use this as your baseline, and try get your vendor to at least match it. It's a good deal.''
 Along with the partisan battle over the lending programs has come a fierce argument over their relative costs to taxpayers. Lenders vehemently argue that the direct loan program is in fact more expensive. 
 With Democrats now in control of Congress, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, with some bipartisan support, is pushing legislation intended to bolster the direct loan program. 
 Many Republicans are determined to defend private lenders. ''I don't want a few problems to be the excuse for the Democrats to put the federal government in charge of all student lending in the United States,'' said Representative Ric Keller of Florida, the ranking Republican on the higher education subcommittee.

HEADLINE: Ecuador, Ever Unstable, Prepares for New Leader's Plans

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Carla D'nan Bass contributed reporting.

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, April 14 

 BODY:
The past few weeks have been unkind to Ecuador's Congress. A court fired 57 of the legislators. Mobs beat some of the expelled lawmakers in the street. When Congress finally convened this week, someone lobbed a tear gas canister near its chamber, forcing lawmakers to flee. 
 The future looks dimmer still for Congress, one of the most reviled institutions in chronically unstable Ecuador. If President Rafael Correa gets his way in a referendum on Sunday, his supporters will soon start rewriting the constitution to weaken congressional power and enhance state control of the economy. 
 Critics of Mr. Correa, who has been emboldened by a 70 percent approval rating and his alliance with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, call the move a power grab. But Mr. Correa is a political newcomer lacking Mr. Chavez's control over abundant oil revenues, and he faces an array of challenges that make amassing much greater authority daunting.
 ''Correa is trying to fix a mistake with another mistake,'' said Ramiro Crespo, president of Analytica Securities, an investment bank based here. ''His lack of respect for political institutions is troubling, but Ecuador's internal conditions may prevent him from getting too far.''
 Unlike other oil-exporting countries, Ecuador is not benefiting greatly from high oil prices. Economic growth in the last quarter of 2006 slowed to 2.2 percent, well below the 4 percent growth in the previous quarter, after output declined in oil fields seized by the government last year from Occidental Petroleum of Los Angeles, which was Ecuador's largest foreign investor.
 Confusion over Mr. Correa's economic policies has also unsettled investors, with banks lending less to builders and other companies. Mr. Correa, 44, an economist educated in the United States and Belgium, has criticized Ecuador's use of the dollar as its currency, a policy adopted in 2000 to halt a plunge in the value of the previous currency, the sucre. And he signaled a desire to restructure the country's foreign debt.
 Such talk, however, looks more like bluster since Ecuador recently met its obligations with foreign creditors. Mr. Correa said a new constitution would not reverse current monetary policy. And while Mr. Correa opposes a far-reaching trade agreement with Washington, he favors preferential treatment for exports to the United States like flowers and tuna.
 ''Correa has shown flashes of moderation and pragmatism,'' said Michael Shifter, vice president for policy at the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy center in Washington. ''He's also been adept at appealing to a widely felt grievance against corrupt politics and disgust with the political class.''
 Such sentiment existed, of course, in Venezuela and Bolivia, other Andean countries that convened assemblies to rewrite their constitutions after populist presidents were elected. Analysts contrast Mr. Chavez's success at consolidating power in Venezuela with the troubles faced by President Evo Morales in Bolivia, where a constitution-writing assembly has been stalled by fractious delegates and regional power struggles.
 Mr. Correa, hampered by slowing economic growth and entrenched business interests in Guayaquil, a city on the coast, could face similar challenges if the vote to rewrite the constitution is approved. But just three months into power and lacking a solid base in Congress, Mr. Correa has little choice but to move forward with the plan while support among voters is high.
 Polls this month put support for a ''yes'' vote on convening a constitution-writing assembly well above the majority needed for approval. But heavy spending on advertising by business groups opposed to the measure created doubts on the eve of the referendum on whether it would pass with a wide margin.
 Small right-wing parties tried linking Mr. Correa to Mr. Chavez with the slogan ''No to 21st-Century Socialism,'' an allusion to Venezuela's experiment with nationalizations, state cooperatives and efforts to curb American influence in the developing world.
 Indeed, Ecuador is an important front in Mr. Chavez's ambitions to lift Venezuela's regional influence. Venezuela has offered help to refine some of Ecuador's crude oil and has supported Ecuador's plan to return to OPEC, which it left in the early 1990s after it fell behind in paying dues.
 And Ecuador has loudly supported a plan to create a regional development bank called Bank of the South, which would be backed mainly by Venezuela and used to blunt the influence of the World Bank in Latin America. Resistance from Brazil, by far the region's largest country, has slowed the bank's creation.
 Echoes of Mr. Chavez's policies here, like a vague proposal by Mr. Correa to ''regulate'' news organizations, have raised concern in some quarters. Still, Mr. Correa, while opposing the renewal of an agreement allowing the United States to maintain a military base in Manta, a coastal city, has also adroitly resisted the Venezuelan largess offered to countries like Bolivia and Nicaragua.
 ''There is a disproportionate image of Chavez's influence on him,'' said Adrian Bonilla, director here of the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences. ''He is more autonomous.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Takes No Apparent Action as Deadline Passes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Thom Shanker contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14 

 BODY:
The first deadline for North Korea to shut down and seal its main facility for manufacturing nuclear weapons fuel expired Saturday, with no apparent move by the North to fulfill its commitments, while China asked angry officials in the Bush administration to show patience.
 The inaction leaves President Bush vulnerable to attacks from hawks in his own party, who have argued that it was a mistake to return $25 million in frozen funds to the North Koreans -- much of it believed to be from illicit sales of missiles and counterfeit currency -- and who doubt that the North Koreans will stop producing bomb fuel and give up their existing weapons. 
Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, called on North Korea in a statement on Saturday ''to realize fully its commitments under the Feb. 13 agreement'' by inviting back inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and beginning to close down its Yongbyon nuclear facility. And the chief American negotiator dealing with the North, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters in Beijing: ''We don't have a lot of momentum right now. That is for sure.'' 
 Mr. Hill has traveled over the past week to Japan, South Korea and China, where officials urged him to allow the North Koreans a little time. But in Washington, officials said they did not know if the Chinese had any indications that compliance was forthcoming. 
 A senior State Department official said in a telephone interview that it was ''prudent to give this thing a few more days.''
 North Korean officials told a visiting American delegation earlier in the week that they would begin shutting down the reactor at Yongbyon, where for years they have produced plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, as soon as the $25 million frozen at a bank in Macao was returned. The process has taken far longer than American officials expected, in part because the legal mechanisms for returning the money turned out to be enormously complicated, leading the Bush administration to give up its demand that all illicit funds had to be used for humanitarian purposes.
 But the agreement that Mr. Hill signed with North Korea on Feb. 13 -- in talks that also included China, Russia, Japan and South Korea -- gave the North 60 days to deactivate and seal its main plant at Yongbyon, invite back international inspectors and provide a preliminary accounting of how much plutonium it had produced. As of Saturday, the country had apparently taken none of those steps.
 The visiting delegation was led by Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Officials in Pyongyang told the Americans that they would fulfill their obligations within 30 days of receiving the funds.
 Investigators from the United States Treasury and American intelligence agencies had spent months poring through records of the frozen accounts, and mapped the banking activities of state-owned companies, arms traders and the leaders surrounding President Kim Jong-il.
 ''This was the first thing we ever did that got the North Koreans' attention,'' a senior White House official said in an interview this week.
 Some administration officials acknowledge that they have few good options to enforce the deadline. With the money cleared for return, the Macao accounts no longer provide diplomatic leverage. That leaves the administration more dependent than ever on pressure from China, the North's main supplier of energy and aid, to force North Korea to live up to the agreement.
 Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that turning over the money ''complicates the logic of the Proliferation Security Initiative,'' the administration's plan to stop countries from illicit shipments of weapons, because it allows the North to retrieve profits from those activities. 
 ''It also goes contrary to the Security Council resolution'' passed at Washington's urging after North Korea's nuclear test on Oct. 9, he said. The test was something of a fizzle, a subkiloton explosion, but it was enough to win unanimous passage of a resolution that imposed new economic sanctions.
 Now, Mr. Eberstadt said, ''the North Koreans can force the Bush administration into continuing, humiliating reversals of its policy.'' 
 But administration officials argue that Mr. Bush never reversed policy. They contend that he simply waited for the right moment to strike the deal, after the nuclear test angered China's leaders enough to move them from a neutral arbiter to a source of pressure on the North. North Korea reached the deal, they argue, because China and South Korea had cut aid. 
 In public statements, both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, have defended the accord as far more effective than an agreement signed between North Korea and President Bill Clinton in 1994 to freeze the Yongbyon plant.
 ''What you are hearing,'' one senior official said, ''are the complaints of a lot of people who simply don't think we should be dealing with the North Koreans at all.''
 Among those who have objected are former Bush administration officials who believe that the president has been so eager for a diplomatic coup that he has given up his principles -- and is perpetuating Mr. Kim's rule. Mr. Bush's former ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, recently expressed the hope that the North would violate the Feb. 13 agreement because it would give Mr. Bush an excuse to renounce the deal.
 Anticipating that the North would miss the deadline, Mr. Bolton said recently, ''One sign of whether we are in trouble is whether the administration will call this a 'violation' or use words like 'noncompliance.' '' Assuming that the North admits international inspectors and seals the Yongbyon plant and the nearby nuclear reprocessing facility, it would have to move on to ''disable'' the nuclear facilities, a term that the agreement does not define. 
 Ultimately, it would have to account for and surrender all its nuclear weapons, an arsenal that American intelligence agencies believe has grown from enough fuel for one or two weapons when Mr. Bush took office, to fuel for somewhere between a half-dozen and a dozen weapons.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Candidates Lay Into Democrats, Not One Another

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Marc Santora contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DES MOINES, April 14 

 BODY:
A parade of Republican White House candidates appealed for support from over 1,000 Iowa Republicans on Saturday, with two of their leading candidates -- Senator John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani -- assailing Democrats in Washington for pressing legislation that would set a timetable for bringing American troops back from Iraq.
 It was the first time that the major Republican candidates had appeared at the same event -- the annual Lincoln Day dinner, held in the sprawling ballroom of a downtown convention center here. For more than three hours, an audience of the state's most active Republicans listened attentively as candidates proclaimed their strong opposition to abortion rights, called for a crackdown against illegal immigrants and warned that a Democratic return to the White House would result in higher taxes.
Although the event was called a ''Unity Dinner,'' the speeches reflected divisions among the Republicans on various issues, in particular abortion. Several candidates, including Mr. McCain of Arizona and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, presented themselves as lifelong opponents of abortion rights, drawing clear if unspoken contrasts with Mr. Giuliani, who supports abortion rights, and Mr. Romney, who once supported abortion rights but now opposes them. 
 But the strongest divisions emerged between the parties, as Mr. Giuliani and Mr. McCain offered attacks on Democrats for their efforts to bring an end to the war in Iraq. Apart from his remark about abortions -- and a warm-up joke that involved Zsa Zsa Gabor -- Mr. McCain devoted almost his entire nine-minute speech to arguing in support of the war, and attacking Democrats for opposing it. 
 ''The Democrats want to set a date for withdrawal, which should be named a date certain for surrender,'' Mr. McCain said. ''There is no way we can prevail if we announce a date for withdrawal.''
 ''There is only one commander-in-chief of the United States and that is George W. Bush,'' he continued, drawing some of the loudest applause of the night in response to one of the few times Mr. Bush was even mentioned. ''I support him, and I believe in him.''
 Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said the debate on the war had ''intensified to me the difference between us and the Democrats.'' He criticized Democrats whom he said opposed expanding domestic surveillance programs and wanted to weaken some provisions of the so-called Patriot Act, saying such moves were a retreat from the offensive on terrorism.
 ''If we back off that, then we are going back on the defense,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''and we are no longer on the offense.''
 Mr. Giuliani said he did not fault people who failed to grasp the threat of terrorism after the first attack on the World Trade Center or after the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole. ''But after Sept. 11, it's clear what we need to do to protect ourselves,'' he said. 
 Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who is also a leading candidate for his party's nomination, called for expanded spending on the military in order to toughen the United States against threats and warned about the threat of what he called Jihadists.
 ''They want to create the collapse of the United States of America and our retreat militarily,'' he said.
 ''The Republican Party -- and conservatism generally -- are a philosophy of strength,'' he said. ''Military strength, economic strength, personal strength and family strength.''
 The attendance at the event, both by the candidates and the state's Republicans, reflected the importance Iowa has assumed in the presidential nominating process, and the intense interest voters here have in the race. 
 Several candidates said Republicans should avoid attacking one another and be prepared to band together around a nominee next year. ''I would like you to select me,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''But if you don't, every single person who comes up after me -- every single one of them -- is better than Hillary, Senator Obama and Senator Edwards,'' referring to Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as former Senator John Edwards. It was his only remark that drew loud applause from the crowd.
 And one candidate, Jim Gilmore, the former governor of Virginia, drew soft boos when he mentioned candidates' names in a not-so-subtle way of suggesting that three of the leading candidates had records of shifting positions on some issues that are crucial to conservatives.
 ''Don't be fooled by people who come to you now and say they are conservative,'' Mr. Gilmore said. ''I can assure you that Rudy McRomney is not conservative, and he knows he is not a conservative.''
 But the undercurrent was unmistakable, even when names were not used. Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, pointedly noted that he had always been an opponent of abortion rights and gun-control measures, and that he had supported President Bush's tax cuts from the beginning.
 ''I'm not late in declaring that life begins at conception and we ought to protect human life,'' he said. ''I am not late in believing that the Bush tax cuts were good when they were first proposed, and they are still good today.''
 Mr. Romney recently joined the National Rifle Association, as he sought to argue that he was a lifelong opponent of gun control measures. And Mr. McCain voted against many of Mr. Bush's tax cuts, a position that has contributed to conservative unease with his candidacy.
 Mr. Romney appeared on stage with his wife, Ann, and one of his sons, Josh, paying a long and warm tribute to his family. The tableau came immediately after Mr. Giuliani finished and served -- by design or not -- to remind Republicans of what has troubled some here about Mr. Giuliani: his three marriages and his estranged relationship with his son, Andrew. 
 The candidates were each given six minutes to talk, though that was one rule that none of the candidates, after spending hours flying here, seemed prepared to follow. Mr. Giuliani spoke for 17 minutes, though he left immediately after he was done, passing up the glad-handing of dinner attendees to leave Iowa for a fund-raiser in Missouri.
 In a reflection of the potency of the immigration issue here, Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado drew some of the loudest applause of the night when he questioned his opponent's commitment to cracking down on illegal immigrants and said he would never support a measure allowing them to stay in this country.
 ''I will never grant amnesty to illegal immigrants,'' Mr. Tancredo said.

HEADLINE: Parsing the Truths About Visas for Tech Workers

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; Anand Giridharadas contributed reporting from Mumbai, India.

 BODY:
THE United States has benefited immensely from its role as a magnet for the best and brightest workers from around the world, especially in innovative fields like high technology. Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, sounded precisely that theme in Senate testimony last month when asked about the visa program for skilled workers, the H-1B.
 Mr. Gates said that these workers are ''uniquely talented'' and highly paid -- ''taking jobs that pay over $100,000 a year'' -- and that America should ''welcome as many of those people as we can get.''
But that is not how the H-1B visa program as a whole is working these days, according to an analysis by Ronil Hira, an assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The median salary for new H-1B holders in the information technology industry is actually about $50,000, based on the most recent data filed by companies with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services agency. That wage level, Mr. Hira says, is the same as starting salaries for graduating computer science majors with bachelor's degrees. 
 Yet salaries, according to Mr. Hira, are only part of the story. He says that while Microsoft may be paying its H-1B visa holders well and recruiting people with hard-to-find talents, other companies have a different agenda. The H-1B visa program, Mr. Hira asserts, has become a vehicle for accelerating the pace of offshore outsourcing of computing work, sending more jobs abroad. Holders of H-1B visas, he says, do the on-site work of understanding a client's needs and specifications -- and then most of the software coding is done back in India.
 ''Information technology offshore outsourcing has just swamped the H-1B program in recent years,'' he said. The list of the top 10 companies requesting H-1B visas in fiscal 2006, the most recent government data available, was dominated by Indian-based technology outsourcing companies like Infosys Technologies, Wipro Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services, and a few other companies that offer outsourced services and have sizable operations in India like Cognizant Technology Solutions, Accenture and Deloitte & Touche, according to a paper last month by Mr. Hira, which was published by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. 
 Over the years, the H-1B visa, which allows a person to work in the United States for three years and can be renewed for an additional three, has been used by many people as a steppingstone to becoming a permanent resident. Traditionally, about half of all H-1B holders eventually get green cards, immigration experts say.
 Yet the major outsourcing companies, while seeking thousands of H-1B visas, are asking for relative handfuls of green cards, according to government figures.
 The statistics marshaled by Mr. Hira are not absolutely conclusive. The reported company-by-company numbers are for H-1B visas requested, not granted, but that is because the government does not publish visa counts by company. Since the visas are granted on a first-come-first-served basis, it seems reasonable that the companies seeking the most visas would, proportionately, get the most.
 It is not just critics like Mr. Hira who point to the crucial role that the H-1B visa program plays in the fast-growing global outsourcing industry. ''It has become the outsourcing visa,'' said Kamal Nath, the commerce minister of India.
 But is that a bad thing? Many economists say that paving the way for more efficient global trade in technology services should be a policy goal, and that the American economy will be more competitive and create more jobs as a result. Technology services like software programming and maintenance, they say, are an ''input,'' in economic terms, in industries from banking to manufacturing.
 It used to be that all the parts in a car or a computer were made in a single country; now they are manufactured wherever it is most efficient. The same thing is happening in technology services. ''We're seeing this growing international division of labor in services just as we saw in manufacturing decades ago,'' said Aaditya Mattoo, an economist at the World Bank.
 Still, the issue behind the H-1B controversy is how a nation devises a policy to benefit from global trade in technology services while treating its own workers fairly. The proposals before Congress range from significantly expanding the visa quota to tightening rules to protect American workers. 
 This month, the government announced that it had received more petitions for H-1B visas in one day than it could grant in the entire fiscal year that begins in October. It received 150,000 petitions; the current visa cap is 65,000. Technology lobbying groups declared that the immediate overflow demand for H-1B visas was proof of the skills shortage in the United States and the need for a sharply higher visa limit. But some immigration policy experts and economists say that this argument fails a simple test of economics. It is not surprising, they say, that global companies -- including I.B.M., Microsoft and Oracle -- that benefit from the H-1B program would like to see it enlarged. ''There is no labor market test, using technically sound criteria, to determine whether or not there is a shortage,'' said David M. Hart, an associate professor of public policy at George Mason University. The measures, Mr. Hart suggests, would include recent wage trends and unemployment rates in specific professions.
 Other suggested changes include phasing out caps but holding auctions for H-1B visas in, say, lots of 30,000. After the first auction, the bidding for the next batch would begin at the high end of the initial sale's prices. In 1994, a commission appointed by Congress recommended letting companies hire skilled foreign workers easily if the employers paid a $10,000-a-person fee that would go into a fund to train domestic workers. And there might be a limit on the number of visas that any one company can get.
 ''How to match policies to people in this emerging global labor market is something we really haven't thought through yet,'' said B. Lindsay Lowell, director of policy studies at the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University. The current system, he said, tends to depend too much on the companies and how they use the complicated work-visa program. 
 Microsoft, it seems, is paying its H-1B holders quite well -- a median salary of $82,500 for new visa applicants, whose wages over the subsequent three to six years could well rise to about the $100,000 Mr. Gates mentioned. And in fiscal 2006, Microsoft applied for 1,181 green cards and 4,471 H-1B's, a ratio of more than 26 percent. For the leading Indian outsourcing companies, the ratio was less than 1 percent.
 ''Microsoft may well be using the program to bring in the best and the brightest,'' Mr. Hira said. ''But it's definitely not representative of how the H-1B program is being used today.''

HEADLINE: Stung by a Fraud Indictment, A Power Broker Punches Back

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: ASPEN, Colo. 

 BODY:
David A. Stockman is trying to unwind at his second home here after another long day spent scouring legal documents. Dinner at a restaurant with his wife, Jennifer, has been a balm, to say nothing of the big glass of scotch he has nursed throughout the evening.
 He has much to brood over. Mr. Stockman, President Ronald Reagan's budget director, is facing a trial next year on fraud charges after his attempt to save an auto parts maker from bankruptcy had failed.
''How can you end up losing $13 million of your own money and $350 million of your fund's and still end up with 30 years in jail?'' he asks. 
 His anger builds. ''It's wrong. It's sick. I had an honorable career in public and private life and now this prosecutor goes after me as if I were a -- '' 
 ''Criminal,'' his wife breaks in, saying what Mr. Stockman could not.
 Since his days as a Marxist firebrand in the 1960s, Mr. Stockman, now 60, has pursued ideas that fired his ambitions. As budget chief in 1981, he advocated tax cuts and blamed congressmen, lobbyists and Pentagon bureaucrats for his failure to manage the Reagan budget.
 Now having been ousted as chief executive of the auto parts maker Collins & Aikman by his handpicked board over financial disclosure irregularities, he is casting his fraud indictment as a similarly wrongheaded action by regulators, prosecutors and lawyers. In an earlier time, Mr. Stockman had mere scorn for such people. Now it is anger as he copes with the blow to his reputation, the loss of the fund company he founded and the looming prospect of spending his retirement years in a federal prison. A pretrial hearing is set for tomorrow.
 ''The idea that there was this conspiracy does not connect in the remotest to the facts of life,'' he said. ''I had no motive. This is crazy. This case is a dangerous criminalization of a business failure fueled by Sarbanes-Oxley vendors.''
 This suffer-no-fools disposition harks back to an early embrace of the writings of Theodore J. Lowi, the political scientist who argued that the art of making policy should be the preserve of sophisticated practitioners like Mr. Stockman. It now shapes Mr. Stockman's attitude toward his current tormentors.
 ''It's amateur hour,'' Mr. Stockman said, speaking of Helen V. Cantwell, the lead prosecutor on the case. ''The prosecutors don't seem to understand bank covenants, accounting and even basic business operations.'' 
 A spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan said that Ms. Cantwell would have no comment. But the government intends to make the case that Mr. Stockman engaged in a conspiracy of deceptions and sham transactions to save not just the company but the significant investment he had in it.
 Being dismissive of bureaucrats, lawyers and regulators may make for good politics in Washington, but in today's world, with heightened levels of regulatory and legal scrutiny brought on by Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, such an approach can have dangerous repercussions. In March, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Mr. Stockman on charges including bank fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
 There is a frantic aspect to Mr. Stockman these days. The big-framed glasses that defined his brash, whiz-kid demeanor in the 1980s have been traded for a tortoise-shell look. But his searing, unblinking stare remains the same and the prospect of a life spent in prison has brought fear and a bit of panic to his notorious workaholic ways. 
 His hands shake as he leafs through piles of Collins & Aikman spreadsheets, rattling off reams of arcane data and ratios to support his claim that he never booked an inappropriate rebate, fudged liquidity levels or exaggerated cash flow forecasts, as the prosecution maintains.
 A day's growth of stubble gives him an air of distraction. His wife is concerned about his health.
 ''This could destroy your life,'' he said. ''I have to think how I keep my life and family going.''
 The life of an indicted former chief executive can be a lonely one. There is no more office to go to, no around-the-world trips on corporate jets, and aside from calls from lawyers -- Mr. Stockman has two law firms working for him -- the phone rings less often. With one daughter away at college and another beginning a new job, the big rambling house in Greenwich, Conn., can seem empty.
 Mr. and Ms. Stockman, who is co-chairwoman of the Republican Majority for Choice, an abortion-rights group, say that friends have reached out to them. And while he has friends on Wall Street, in the current glare, just a few have spoken up.
 He is a ''very good boy scout,'' said James S. Tisch, the chief executive of the Loews Corporation. Warren B. Rudman, the former New Hampshire senator who is a longtime director of Collins & Aikman and has known Mr. Stockman since his Washington days, said: ''You feel badly when someone gets into that kind of trouble.''
 Mr. Stockman does make brief stabs at black humor. He chuckles that he has a brother who is a corrections officer and notes the odd fate of spending his first day in court at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse, named for the late New York senator who gave him his entree into politics.
 Some who have worked with Mr. Stockman on Wall Street, where he was an early partner of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, say that he was known for having a devotion to his own numbers and analysis that could blind his judgment.
 ''David is often messianic,'' said Roger C. Altman, a former partner at Blackstone. ''But the David I know is not one I would associate with criminal intent.'' 
 Many remember his rapid rise in Washington from an aide to a House member to the youngest cabinet officer of the last century.
 ''He is truly, truly ambitious in the non-flattering sense,'' said Arthur B. Laffer, the supply-side economist and adviser to President Reagan who still fumes over the critical comments Mr. Stockman made about the president's tax cuts in an article in The Atlantic Monthly in 1981. ''I don't wish him evil or pain; all I know is what I saw gave me a window into his character.'' 
 Mr. Stockman's involvement with Collins & Aikman dates to 1988, when he first invested in the company while at Blackstone. In 2001, having started his own buyout firm, Heartland Industrial Partners, he snapped up a majority share.
 Collins & Aikman, once a flagging 1970s-era conglomerate, was a mish-mash of business from which Mr. Stockman, in the 1990s, carved out one that supplied interior parts to the major automobile manufacturers. Cheap oil would prompt continuing demand for S.U.V.'s and trucks made by the Big Three automakers in Detroit. Like his other grand notions, this one was bold, contrarian and, this time, disastrously wrong. 
 Aiming to make Collins & Aikman the dominant supplier, Mr. Stockman went on an acquisition spree, buying up competitors and saddling the company with additional debt. 
 After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the automobile industry came under increased pressure. With Collins & Aikman's stock plummeting and investors becoming antsy, Mr. Stockman assumed leadership of the company in summer 2003, moving to Troy, Mich., from Greenwich.
 But business got worse. It was during this period that prosecutors say Mr. Stockman conspired to inflate the firm's cash flow by aggressively booking rebates from his suppliers and lying to his banks about his cash position.
 Mr. Stockman and his lawyers argue that there was no conspiracy. According to their account, meetings were held in the open and his bankers were also his investors and well aware of his cash reserves. More important, they say, Mr. Stockman never sold any stock during this time. From 2002 to 2004, he and Heartland invested $25 million more. The government says Mr. Stockman's fund collected $45 million in fees, half of which went to Mr. Stockman.
 ''No crime was committed,'' said Elkan Abramowitz, the lead lawyer for Mr. Stockman. ''He has nothing to hide and we think the government will have a very hard time cross-examining him.''
 It is not clear that Mr. Stockman's public defense will pay off. ''The problem is that the court of public opinion is not the court that will hear the case,'' said Mark F. Pomerantz, a senior white-collar defense lawyer and former prosecutor. ''The notion that you can help persuade a jury now is sheer fancy and you certainly will not persuade the government.''
 In March 2005, the board's auditor, KPMG, raised questions about the accounting of rebates; KPMG then hired the law firm Davis Polk. 
 Rumors had begun to spread that Collins & Aikman was experiencing a liquidity crisis. On March 17, Mr. Stockman presented preliminary year-end results to investors. Badgered on the call by analysts about the firm's cash position, Mr. Stockman did his best to stay upbeat, while also laying out the challenges ahead.
 On May 9, Mr. Stockman made a last bid to save his company, securing, he says, a promise from Chrysler, Collins & Aikman's largest customer, to give the company better pricing. Mr. Stockman was ecstatic.
 However, on that very afternoon, Mr. Stockman got a call from Dennis E. Glazer, a partner at Davis Polk. The law firm was now questioning whether Mr. Stockman gave overly optimistic forecasts during the March conference call. 
 Mr. Stockman defended himself, saying that he had provided sufficient caveats. But Mr. Glazer was not convinced. In its indictment, the government would charge that Mr. Stockman drafted the materials and made ''at least three material misstatements or omissions.''
 Late the next night, Mr. Stockman received a call in his Troy, Mich., hotel room from Daniel P. Tredwell, his partner at Heartland. The board would ask for his resignation the next day. Mr. Stockman could not believe it. ''The audit committee had taken over the company and delegated authority to a lawyer from New York wearing suspenders,'' he says now. That night, he would add a third Klonopin anti-anxiety pill to the two he was taking each night to bring on sleep quickly.
 Mr. Glazer declined to comment on the case, citing confidentiality. 
 The next day the board demanded his resignation. 
 ''Leave your office now and don't take anything with you,'' Mr. Stockman recalled Mr. Glazer as saying.
 It had happened so quickly that he could not even call a lawyer.
 ''I was in shock,'' he said. ''I had been with the company for 14 years -- I mean I had put this whole thing together. I had put these guys on the board, invested the money, owned the shares and they stabbed me in the back. It was like a Stalinist show trial.''
 A week later, on May 17, Collins & Aikman filed for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Discount Carriers Where You Least Expect Them

BYLINE: By DAVID KAUFMAN

 BODY:
ON a business trip to India last year, Josef Woodman, an author and publisher from Chapel Hill, N.C., unexpectedly found himself crisscrossing the subcontinent while researching a book on the booming medical tourism industry. What was intended to be a brief visit to New Delhi evolved into a weeklong trek to cities like Hyderabad, Chennai and Mumbai to track an elusive source.
 ''I suddenly had to move fast, even though I knew nothing about internal flights in India,'' said Mr. Woodman, whose book, ''Patients Beyond Borders: Everybody's Guide to Affordable, World-Class Medical Tourism,'' has just been released. So he got online and started searching for flights.
Amid the costly options offered by full-service leaders like Air India and Indian Airlines, Mr. Woodman stumbled upon SpiceJet, India's popular low-cost carrier. Started in May 2005, privately owned SpiceJet (spicejet.com) flies a single-class 737 fleet to 13 domestic destinations from its New Delhi base, including business centers like Mumbai and Bangalore. 
 With its easy-to-follow Web site and flexible policies, ''SpiceJet looked and felt like Southwest,'' said Mr. Woodman, a longtime fan of domestic discount carriers. ''There may have been no frills, but there were also no hassles.'' And those unexpected flights ended up being unexpectedly affordable.
 Once common only in Europe, low-cost carriers like SpiceJet are rapidly emerging in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. While most at first concentrated on leisure travelers -- like the estimated 99 percent of Indians who have never flown -- the airlines are now luring business travelers as well, including more Westerners. They are travelers who may fly long-haul at the front of the cabin, but they are willing to forsake creature comforts on short-haul flights to cushion the bottom line.
 ''These airlines can represent great value for business travelers,'' said Henry Harteveldt, a vice president and principal travel analyst at Forrester Research in San Francisco. ''And because they often fly the newest planes, the in-flight experience can exceed what you get in economy on regular U.S. carriers.''
 Mostly privately owned, many of these airlines are already competing on the same routes for the same market share, while simultaneously waging aggressive price wars with state-run carriers. Besides SpiceJet, India is served by discount airlines like GoAir (goair.in), Air-India Express (airindiaexpress.in) and IndiGo (www.indigo.com); the Persian Gulf region by both Sharjah-based Air Arabia (airarabia.com) and Kuwait's Jazeera Airways (jazeeraairways.com); Brazil by Gol (voegol.com.br); and Southeast Asia and Oceania by Malaysia-based AirAsia (airasia.com), Singapore-based Tiger Airways (tigerairways.com) and Australia's Jetstar (jetstar.com) and Virgin Blue (virginblue.com.au). 
 While business travelers typically make up no more than 25 percent of all passengers, on more established low-cost carriers like Gol Airlines they fill more than half the seats. 
 ''We've seen our passenger mix shift from 60 percent leisure and 40 percent business to the exact opposite in six years,'' said Wilson Maciel Ramos, Gol's executive vice president for planning and information technology. 
 Air Arabia's commercial director, Kyle Haywood, said that flights between its Sharjah hub (part of the United Arab Emirates) and Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman are also more than half filled by business travelers. ''They're a real microcosm of the gulf today,'' Mr. Haywood said of the passenger mix, ''from locals wearing traditional dress to expat Westerners in suits to numerous Indian traders.''
 Although some carriers, like Jetstar (a Qantas subsidiary), offer loyalty programs, a lack of frequent-flier points is one of many amenities business travelers appear willing to sacrifice. Like their American counterparts, global discount carriers typically serve second-tier airports and charge for meals, luggage weighing more than 55 pounds and entertainment.
 ''But on such short flights, it's just as easy to bring your lunch on board,'' said Victoria Baldock, a managing director of Verve Entertainment in Sydney, who flies Jetstar to her satellite office in Byron Bay, a resort town about 550 miles from Sydney served only by Jetstar.
 Nonetheless, both Jetstar and Jazeera Airways, which both offer leather seats cabinwide, have introduced premium classes for travelers who want full-service comforts, but still at a cost below major carriers. Introduced in November, Jetstar's StarClass includes hot meals, video-on-demand systems, laptop power outlets and wider seats -- at roughly a 50 percent premium. StarClass passengers can also earn frequent-flier points with Qantas, as well as use Qantas lounges before departures and make reservation changes free.
 On Jazeera Airways' Jazeera Plus, now 18 months old, ''we've replaced the middle seat with a workstation in each row,'' said Marwan Boodai, the chairman and chief executive. The carrier recently opened a second hub in Dubai. The move there brings low-cost air travel to the Middle East's busiest airport for the first time, with new links to seven cities in India and the Persian Gulf. It also places Jazeera in the backyard of the regional low-cost incumbent Air Arabia, which flies to more than 30 similar destinations from the emirate of Sharjah, about 45 minutes from Dubai. 
 While the ease of the Dubai airport, connected to the United States via nonstops from New York and Houston on Emirates (and Delta plans to add service from Atlanta starting in May), will appeal to many travelers, the small size of Air Arabia's Sharjah base has advantages. 
 ''Dubai airport may theoretically be just 15 minutes from my office, but traffic can turn this journey into an hour,'' said Alasdair Evans, the area publishing manager for Arabian Trader magazine in Dubai, who flies Air Arabia to meetings in Bahrain. ''Then once in Sharjah, it takes just 10 minutes to get from check-in to the gate, much shorter than in Dubai.''
 For the moment, the new global discount carriers are mostly limited in use -- and appeal -- for short-haul passengers with reasonably definitive travel plans. Still, for those demanding flexibility, the carriers' pricing policies are far more forgiving than those of their full-service counterparts. ''While most of the discounters will charge to make changes, the fees will usually not be too onerous,'' Mr. Harteveldt of Forrester said.
 Indeed, change-fees on Jazeera Airways are roughly $10; on Air Arabia, approximately $14. Jetstar's range from $23 to $60, while they are free on SpiceJet and Gol. Like Jazeera, many of the international low-cost upstarts are either establishing additional hubs or upgrading their fleets to extend internationally. Late last year, Jetstar started flights to both Southeast Asia and as far away as Honolulu on Airbus A330s. In Latin America, Gol hopes to reach Mexico (via Peru) soon, while Air Arabia is exploring a second hub in Istanbul to better link the carrier to Europe's elaborate discount aviation network. 
 Although Mr. Woodman, who also flew through Asia on AirAsia and Jetstar during a subsequent business trip this year, concedes that the airlines ''lacked the elegance and graciousness of Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific,'' he says the discounters make up in spirit what they miss in service. 
 ''These smaller airlines just seemed to have more hustle,'' he said. ''On the larger carriers there is this discouraging 'who cares' attitude, but on these smaller airlines you felt like the staff was really making an effort.''

HEADLINE: In a Troubled Time, a New Business Magazine

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Joanne Lipman, the editor of Portfolio, the new business magazine from Conde Nast, tapped gently last Monday on the door of David Carey, the publisher, and then burst into his bright Midtown corner office.
 ''It's here!'' she said, grinning and handing him a copy of the much-anticipated debut issue of Portfolio. Lush, photo-rich and thick with ads (185 ad pages in a 332-page issue), it's an unmistakable stablemate of Conde Nast's Vogue and Vanity Fair.
The cover photograph isn't of John F. Welch Jr. or Bill Gates but a rooftop view of Manhattan, golden lights glowing in anonymous office cubicles -- a homage to Berenice Abbott, who documented New York's changing cityscape in the 1930s. 
 Mr. Carey beamed back. He then reached over to a side table and picked up a recent issue of Fortune, one of Portfolio's chief competitors. The Fortune cover was particularly busy, with a crowd of anonymous Google workers in casual dress and a cover line announcing ''The 100 Best Companies to Work For.'' He held them side by side. His glow said no contest. 
 ''We're not giving you peas and carrots,'' he said. ''We want to capture the glamour.''
 Between all those ad pages, readers will find business executives treated like celebrities and the kind of matching of writer and subject they might find in Vanity Fair: Tom Wolfe on hedge funds (with photographs by Annie Leibovitz); Betsey Morris on the Ford family; and Michael Lewis on ''jock exchanges,'' which trade in athletes. 
 Sheelah Kolhatkar writes about the handful of women who actually do private equity deals. Gabriel Sherman interviews Bruce Sherman, the reclusive Florida money manager who has invested heavily in newspapers.
 ''Business is about power,'' Ms. Lipman writes in her first editor's letter. ''And guts. And passion. Business coverage should be too.''
 Business is also about brains, and Conde Nast's were certainly questioned when the company announced in September 2005 that it was putting out a business magazine -- its biggest single investment in a start-up -- at a time when many others were foundering. 
 Readers were still reeling from the bursting of the Internet bubble and corporate scandals, and investors were looking at constantly updated Web sites -- not biweekly glossies -- for an edge. And some sizable advertisers, like the Detroit automakers, were mired in slumps of their own.
 Some of the big magazines remain troubled: ad pages for the first three months of this year were down for BusinessWeek (3 percent), Forbes (9 percent) and Fortune (13 percent), compared with the same period a year ago, according to Publishers Information Bureau. Circulation at the big three has been flat or falling for the last few years, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. 
 But Portfolio would not be the first business magazine introduced during trying times. Henry Luce founded Fortune just months after the Wall Street crash of 1929, for example. 
 S. I. Newhouse, chairman of Conde Nast, said in an interview that he had no patience with Portfolio skeptics.
 ''Damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead,'' he said. ''I don't think we're going to trample on Forbes or Fortune. I think we're going to help the whole field. We're going to bring excitement to it, and we're going to bring luxury and fashion advertisers into it.''
 Mr. Newhouse said that Portfolio had been inspired by a positive response to business articles in Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, although he could not recall precisely which ones. He also said he had not made the final decision to proceed until Ms. Lipman agreed in August 2005 to leave The Wall Street Journal, where she had overseen its Weekend Journal and Personal Journal sections and its Saturday paper.
 Mr. Newhouse said that his reported commitment to the magazine of more than $100 million over the next five years was ''something of a myth'' because ''we're going to stay with Portfolio.'' 
 Portfolio has hired more than 75 editorial people for the magazine, 40 for its Web site, www.portfolio.com, and more than 45 on the business side.
 The business side, under Mr. Carey, the former publisher of The New Yorker, has been working Madison Avenue hard. After all, he has a reputation to uphold. During his tenure at The New Yorker, between 1998 and 2005, advertising revenue almost doubled and the magazine broke the 1 million mark in circulation. In 1996, Mr. Carey brought 210 ad pages to the first issue of the restarted House and Garden, one of the highest levels ever for a new magazine. 
 Portfolio's first issue has drawn 53 business advertisers, 30 of which had rarely if ever advertised in a Conde Nast publication. The newcomers include Barclays and Pitney Bowes. 
 ''Job No. 1 was to deepen the company's penetration in the business advertising category, which the May issue achieved,'' Mr. Carey said. Bringing more business advertisers in the door could get them interested in advertising in some of the company's other magazines; at the same time, Portfolio provides a new outlet, and another affluent readership, for advertisers who already appear in those other magazines. 
 Portfolio was nearly two years in the making, a long time for journalists to go without ink. At least one who was hired has already left, sowing rumors of sagging morale. During the start-up period, competing publications have written articles that were rumored to be appearing in Portfolio, trying to steal its thunder, and articles at Portfolio were commissioned and killed. 
 Mr. Wolfe added some drama of his own, sweeping through Portfolio's hushed glassy offices with a black cape over his white suit. His narrative was supposed to run 2,500 words but he submitted 11,000, since honed to 7,500 words. His is the longest piece in the magazine. 
 One of Portfolio's most celebrated hires, Kurt Eichenwald, a former reporter for The New York Times, was to have been featured in the premiere issue. But his article, on terrorism, was held, according to people involved with the magazine, because Mr. Eichenwald deluged the magazine's fact-checking department with thousands of pages of documents just before the article was to go to press last month. It is expected to appear in a later issue. 
 Holding it, these people said, was unrelated to a controversy involving Mr. Eichenwald that emerged earlier in March: the revelation that in 2005, while at The Times, he had sent $2,000 to someone who later became the subject of an article. (Mr. Eichenwald, who has said the money was repaid long before the article appeared, declined to comment for this article.)
 Ms. Lipman declined to discuss the article but called Mr. Eichenwald ''one of the finest investigative reporters there is.'' 
 James Impoco, deputy editor at the magazine and a former Sunday Business editor at The New York Times, said that Ms. Lipman had ''exacting standards.''
 He said that ''she knows what she wants and is pretty strong-willed.''
 Mr. Impoco added: ''I have to admit that I was a little worried after she saw 'The Devil Wears Prada' and told me she sympathized with the Meryl Streep character. But she turned out to be a pretty thoughtful boss.''
 Ms. Lipman was almost giddy last week as she showed off a display of the magazine's pages on the walls of a secured room. Portfolio's goal, she said, was to ''connect the dots'' between life inside the boardroom and out.
 ''I love this kind of story,'' she said, gesturing to a profile of Boone Pickens, the Texas oil tycoon whose son pleaded guilty last year to securities fraud. ''It's a great 'KingLear' tale,'' she said. ''He's in his second act and his family's disintegrating.''
 The magazine is priced at $4.99 on the newsstand and is testing subscription prices from $12 to $22 for 12 issues. Its next issue is scheduled for late August, and it will appear monthly after that.
 The magazine's Web site, which will be free, will contain all the articles in the magazine and report breaking news, much of it by Portfolio writers. Chris Jones, the site's managing editor, said its bloggers would post three and five times a day. The site has elaborately produced videos and various interactive features. 
 In conjunction with Conde Nast Traveler, the Web site will also tell readers things like the best place to make a deal in various cities, and which company's employees like to stay in which hotels (in San Francisco, Yahoo likes the Clift, Mr. Jones said). For those readers headed to jail, portfolio.com offers prison advice: get dental work done in advance and don't talk to the press.
 Still, the magazine is at the heart of the Portfolio enterprise and while some skeptics remain, they acknowledge that Portfolio is well positioned.
 ''I don't think they would make the same decision to launch a business magazine now because the climate has changed since they announced,'' said Martin Walker, a magazine consultant.
 But, he added, ''you're talking about a powerhouse publishing company, and they have a terrific database to get subscribers, they have all kinds of ad connections and they are spending enormous amounts of money.'' 
 And there are signs of life elsewhere in business magazines. Fortune is putting out a redesign of its venerable Fortune 500 issue today with heavier paper stock (not as heavy as Portfolio's) and may redesign the whole magazine. Forbes is planning a new business magazine, geared toward women. Portfolio has been raiding business publications for writers and editors, setting off an intense competition for marquee names.
 Robert Safian, former executive editor of Fortune and now editor and managing director of Fast Company (circulation 755,000), said the entire business category was undergoing a reinvention.
 ''Business remains at the heart of our culture, nationally and globally,'' he said. ''The traditional business magazines have had trouble capturing and expressing that excitement in recent years, and the ad market has reflected that, but I think the tide is turning.''

HEADLINE: The Kindness of Strangers

BYLINE: By MATT VILLANO

 BODY:
Considering that he's on the road at least one week a month, Eran Steinberg relies pretty heavily on local car service companies to take him from his New York City office to area airports. So when he caught one of the usual limo drivers padding the bill on a recent trip, Mr. Steinberg was desperate for another service he could trust.
 He took his search online, focusing efforts on a social networking site called LinkedIn (linkedin.com). There, Mr. Steinberg posted a simple question for other business travelers: ''What is the best airport car/limo service in N.Y.C.?'' 
The query brought eight replies in a matter of days, each suggesting a different company. A week later, Mr. Steinberg had selected a new transportation provider.
 ''If I had done it the old-fashioned way and just asked my friends, who knows how long it would have taken?'' said Mr. Steinberg, senior vice president of Capital IQ, a division of Standard & Poor's.
 With the preponderance of social networking Web sites designed to spark interaction among users, a growing number of business travelers are logging on for specific answers before they ever pack a bag.
 These sites are like Facebook or MySpace for the business-travel crowd. Users interact with other frequent travelers to swap secrets about where to stay, where to eat and where to take clients.
 Travelers also use the sites to facilitate face-to-face connections in the air and on the ground.
 Gina Bianchini, chief executive of Ning (ning.com), a fledgling social networking company in Palo Alto, Calif., said: ''Business travelers are time-poor. Any site that helps them make connections and unearth valuable information quickly and painlessly is going to be something they use again and again.''
 Many business travelers frequent common travel-oriented social networking sites, scouring general hotel and restaurant reviews to get an idea of what a destination is really like. For Brian Kaplan, co-founder of Parent Play, an event planning company in New York, this means a regular dose of pre-trip research on VirtualTourist (virtualtourist.com).
 Mr. Kaplan said he had recently used this site to research a ''European-style'' hotel in Atlanta. One reviewer, ''sulu88,'' said the hotel was not ''exactly a wonderful property.'' The second reviewer, ''kenadams,'' noted that ''there is nothing 'European' about this place.''
 Ultimately, Mr. Kaplan made reservations elsewhere.
 ''I had no idea who those people were, but their input helped me avoid a bad decision,'' he said.
 While there is no site like VirtualTourist for business travel yet, many general social networking sites have dedicated sections to the subject. LinkedIn, for instance, has developed a message board for members to ask and answer travel-specific questions about everything from securing exit rows to connecting wirelessly from Starbucks.
 Internationally, other sites have taken the same approach. For example, LivingInPeru (livinginperu.com) offers a number of areas for visiting English-speakers to find details about the local business environment.
 For some travelers, this material can be invaluable. Kenneth Bengtsson, a private investor who lives in London, said that on a recent trip to Lima, he consulted site directories for recommendations on an overnight shipping firm and a ceviche restaurant.
 ''When doing business in parts of the world where language is a barrier, it can be difficult to get around and to make the most of your stay,'' he wrote in a recent e-mail message. ''When I am in Peru I use the site on a daily basis.''
 Hotel chains are getting in on social networking for their business customers, too. Both Sheraton and Extended Stay Hotels recently started blogs where visitors can share experiences and exchange ideas.
 The InterContinental Hotels Group has taken this concept one step further, starting a service called eConcierge. Tom Conophy, the company's executive vice president and chief information officer, said work travelers who book online can use the service before they arrive to consult with hotel employees about dinner reservations and show tickets.
 Other companies use social networking sites to help set up face-to-face connections. PairUp (pairup.com) lets members share travel plans and schedule meetings with those whose itineraries overlap.
 AirTroductions (airtroductions.com) takes a different spin on the same idea, connecting business travelers before they ever touch the ground. Members enter their flight information for upcoming trips and check to see which other members are scheduled to be onboard. If they wish, the parties can arrange to meet, sit together and talk shop.
 Airlines themselves have been slow to embrace social networking. As of last month, KLM was the only major company to do so.
 KLM's sites connect passengers with certain interests. In June 2006, the carrier started Club China for travelers to the Far East and has added clubs for travelers to Africa (Club Africa) and for golfers (Flying Blue Golf Club). Participation in these groups is by invitation.
 Of course, no social networking site is flawless. Adam Rugel, founder of 71miles (71miles.com), an online travel guide in San Francisco, said that travelers should always visit more than one site, and should approach every recommendation with a healthy dose of skepticism.
 ''Inevitably there will be reviews from folks with an ax to grind or reviews written by hotels and restaurants themselves,'' he said. ''It's always up to the reader to sort the good from the bad.''

HEADLINE: C.E.O. Treatment: Conferences Turn Into Cosseting

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Fred Bierman contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
FIRST there were boutique hotels -- small, private, luxurious and impressive. They were expensive, but that was not an issue for the people frequenting them. 
 Now they are settings for boutique business meetings, where executives are cosseted, achievers are rewarded and group identity encouraged. These hotels are also meant for no more than a few dozen people, often those doing the most important work.
In such exclusive settings, these people are likely to feel appreciated and worthy of more than a PowerPoint presentation, a lunch of chicken and cheesecake, a nondescript room and the anonymity of a large hotel. 
 The day might start with a multicourse breakfast of fresh fruit and omelets at the Mill House Inn in East Hampton, N.Y., where guests can brainstorm in a living room with a fireplace, do some quiet thinking nearby while gazing at the Atlantic Ocean, relax in a whirlpool bath and sleep on feather beds. 
 Guests have ''the feeling that they're important, they're valuable and that we splurged on you,'' said Christina Wilkes, who oversees business-travel consulting at American Express Business Travel Advisory Services. 
 A small hotel or inn is ideal for a group of 50 to 60 people when their host ''wants to leave the attendee with a great impact, make it memorable, make it different, make it stand out,'' she said.
 At a big hotel, that size group might rattle around in a room far too big or sterile. Even more worrisome, a competitor could get wind of the meeting, eavesdrop outside the door or buttonhole a participant in a corridor.
 ''When you start looking at a boutique hotel, you're purposely doing it to avoid the big-hotel feeling,'' said Kurt Paben, vice president for business development at Carlson Marketing, an international conference planner.
 At boutique hotels, meetings can be almost as much of an adventure as a vacation. 
 To get to the Harrison House Suites, in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington, guests can take a ferry or a seaplane. At Porches, a small hotel in North Adams, Mass., tours are set up for corporate guests to visit the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art across the street. Elsewhere, guests wind up a day's work with a trip to a vineyard followed by a gourmet dinner, cooked by the guests themselves. 
 Companies choose boutique properties because of their reputations for attracting the rich and famous. That is especially true in vacation spots like the Hamptons or New England. 
 The idea that their site has been mentioned in gossip columns and celebrity Web pages can help excite employees about having a meeting there, Mr. Paben said. ''They get to stay at a hotel that X Y Z celebrity stayed at,'' he said, adding that such excitement leads to ''buzz, pride, bragging rights, that kind of thing.''
 Boutique hotels are marketing themselves as ideal for small meetings within big companies, like board meetings, Mr. Paben said; they are also courting entrepreneurs who need alternatives if their companies have outgrown the office conference room. 
 When a company is planning a meeting that might draw attention from the news media, elegance and an air of exclusivity can be helpful, say, for introducing a new car. 
 In that case, Mr. Paben said, his clients are looking for a place that ''supports the lifestyle of the owner and ties it all together.''
 But sometimes the goal is not to be seen by competitors or the public. That is attractive for remote spots like the Harrison House Suites on San Juan Island.
 ''A more intimate setting is a bit more desirable than milling around hundreds of other people,'' said Sallyan Zenko, global head of marketing for UBS, the investment firm. UBS likes to take over all the rooms in a hotel to ensure that managers do not encounter other guests, especially those that might be interested in UBS business. 
 ''It makes everyone feel like they are getting V.I.P. treatment,'' Ms. Zenko said. 
 Small hotels, inns and bed-and-breakfasts don't have the space for the hundreds of people who might have to attend conferences and other big business meetings. 
 As a result, the small lodgings offer little direct competition for chains like Marriott and Ritz-Carlton, which can provide large meeting spaces and serve meals in a short time to big groups. 
 But when it comes to smaller gatherings, boutique hotels are eager to take customers away from their big counterparts, and meeting planners are taking heed, forming alliances with small hotels, said Anna Maria de Freitas, general manager of the Harrison House Suites. The planners want something special for their clients, and the small properties want to fill their rooms during the week and the off-season. Business events ''keep us going and keep my staff employed during the winter,'' Ms. de Freitas said of her inn, where Microsoft, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Kellogg Graduate School of Business at Northwestern University have held events. 
 Meeting planners say such mutual needs give companies a chance to try places they might consider too costly in high season -- and which might not want their business when they can attract vacation guests.
 ''That's the perception that these properties leave you with, the sense that it's ritzy and it's expensive,'' Ms. Wilkes of American Express said. 
 But in the off-season, she said, inns are willing to make deals to win corporate guests. For example, the Inn at Union Pier, in southwestern Michigan east of Chicago, offers a deeply discounted rate, just $95 a night a person, for company groups. 
 ''The rates can be quite good, because they are looking to bring in this type of business,'' Ms. Wilkes said.
 But boutique hotels do not have a monopoly on the small-meeting business. Big hotels are pitching themselves for smaller gatherings, especially in areas where the economy is weak, Ms. Wilkes said.
 ''Some of the chains are starting to try and cash in, and see this as a successful area of hotel growth and management,'' she said.
 In some cases, the large hotels have the advantage of location for companies that do not want a hard-to-reach resort. 
 Ms. Zenko of UBS said that her company preferred to hold meetings within 20 minutes of an international airport, which can rule out hotels in farther-flung areas like the Hamptons or the Berkshires.
 ''So, if there's a really exclusive, wonderful property at a location,'' but it requires changing planes and driving for an hour, Ms. Zenko said, ''it might be tough for us to consider that in the final running.'' 
 Still, far-flung and unusual places are appealing, and have become the norm for meetings at Mentice, a company based in Sweden that develops computer software for virtual reality surgery.
 Carleen Theisen, the United States financial manager for Mentice in Evanston, Ill., said she went to a meeting last year for 60 managers from around the world at a spa in northern Sweden.
 Since then, Ms. Theisen arranged a management meeting in the United States at the Inn at Union Pier, which is on Lake Michigan. It features Scandinavian decor, and most guest rooms have vintage wood-burning fireplaces, called kakelugns, which were imported from homes in Sweden. 
 ''Going to the Marriott within the city is normal,'' Ms. Theisen said. ''To go outside and experience a new type of environment and enhance your team building, that's something that our company does. You see your employees in an entirely different way.''
 At the Michigan event, meetings with Jonas Ohlsson, the chief executive of Mentice, and managers were enhanced with fresh-baked cookies and lemonade, as well as a go-kart race. 
 Ms. Theisen, who arranged the race, admitted that she had been a little intimidated. 
 ''I was the only female, and I basically had to leave the track,'' she said. ''The go-karts go about 65 miles per hour, and it was a very intense competition.'' 
 Afterward, Mr. Ohlsson had to catch a train from nearby New Buffalo, Mich., to Chicago for his flight home.
 He missed the train -- by minutes -- so an inn employee drove him to O'Hare International Airport, about two hours away, Ms. Theisen recalled. ''I thought to myself, What other hotel would do that?''

HEADLINE: What's Cooking in First Class?

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to food, airlines seem to be going all out for the well-paid business traveler.
 Charlie Trotter, the Chicago chef, will soon introduce dishes created for premier United Airlines passengers. (Mr. Trotter's personal tip? Try the short ribs spiced with Thai-style barbecue sauce.)
And on Emirates, chefs from nine luxury Jumeirah hotels recently began cooking airline meals, adding to a menu that included roasted lobster and veal with pumpkin bathed in coconut cream.
 While the masses packed into economy continue to suffer through meals that seem to taste worse, cost extra or don't exist at all, a resurgence in the excesses of airline dining is swirling through first- and some business-class cabins. But is a parade of caviar, foie-gras-stuffed chicken breast and molten chocolate cake really what the elite business traveler wants? 
 Hardly.
 ''I can always tell when I'm traveling who is a frequent flier and who isn't by the amount of food they eat,'' said Niki Leondakis, chief operating officer of Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants. ''The newbies are trying everything, from the Champagne to the ice cream with Baileys. I always think, 'My God, do you know what you are going to feel like tomorrow?' ''
 Ms. Leondakis, who is on and off planes more than two dozen times a year for Kimpton's San Francisco-based chain of 42 boutique hotels and 43 restaurants, has noticed the increased attention to food. She's not thrilled.
 ''You don't want a five-course meal on an airplane,'' she said. ''It's almost an intrusion, the amount of courses that are being served.'' When she travels, she wants to step off the plane ready for a meeting, not a nap. So she agrees only to courses that are light and prepared without frills or heavy sauces.
 That means she might go for the shrimp cocktail and the salad course. She says no to the offerings of cocktails and wine, and yes to water. For dessert, she takes her own citrus-chamomile tea so she doesn't feel deprived when the chocolate tray and cordials come by.
 The best innovation she has seen lately is simple: United keeps a bowl of fresh fruit out at all times.
 ''I get off the plane feeling infinitely better than the people who decided to act like they were at a restaurant,'' she said.
 But some airlines say elite travelers are demanding better food than ever, and they feel the pressure to keep up. Among certain carriers, the game is to outdo one another, with flavors from different countries, innovative dishes, richer desserts and better cocktails and wines.
 Still, airlines also say they try to balance the food race in the air with demands of frequent business travelers like Ms. Leondakis. On many airlines, first- and business-class meals are now served whenever travelers want them. And snacking is being given more thought. 
 On Emirates, which runs 500 different menus a month, diners can browse through a selection of snacks that features a cheese souffle created to puff up nicely in the airplane oven, grilled vegetable sandwiches or roast salmon with linguine, ginger relish and asparagus. Fresh espresso can be ordered at any time.
 ''Passengers are becoming more in control when they fly,'' said Bob Ferguson, who has been with Emirates for 15 years. ''They want to have maximum flexibility. They prefer something more like a grazing meal, so they can get off feeling more refreshed than they would if they had more of a banquet-style meal.''
 To determine what travelers want, the airline collects food after some flights to see what hasn't been eaten. It is taken back to the office to be weighed and studied. Was there too much served? Was it the wrong sort of food? Did it simply not taste right? 
 ''We're still quite big on portions, though, because our view is if they don't want to eat it, fine,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''But you still want to give the passenger the choice.'' 
 Mr. Trotter, who was part of the United celebrity chef program, which was discontinued after 9/11, has also noticed a change in how passengers want to eat. He and a team of his cooks have designed 35 dishes for passengers in business and first class, as well as United's premium transcontinental service. Although elaborate, the new menus, which make their debut this summer, are lighter than the food he was preparing for passengers six years ago.
 ''The key to airline foods is to come up with things that are very forgiving,'' he said. ''People want to eat healthfully, but they want something interesting.''
 His food is also prepared so that travelers can eat when they want to eat, whether it's soon after takeoff or three hours into the flight.
 ''Things are much more customized,'' Mr. Trotter said. Instead of creating entrees that have to be cooked six at a time, the chef has developed a series of one-offs -- meals that can be cooked in a shorter period of time, then sauced and put on a plate individually.
 Food experts at Eos Airlines, a New York-based airline specializing in trans-Atlantic business travel, have a different point of view. Although they offer lighter, healthier choices like seasonal greens topped with grilled beef or a British-style afternoon tea, they have found that their customers actually want to indulge. Travelers increasingly treat themselves with food because travel in general has become so difficult, said Hector Adler, senior vice president for customer experience.
 ''There is a lot of hype and literature and articles about people wanting healthier and lighter food,'' he added. ''It is an absolute lie.''
 On Eos, planes designed for 220 people have been reconfigured to hold only 48, and tickets start at just over $3,000. Dinner might start with a chilled Bellini cocktail, then segue into beef filet with potato puree studded with truffles -- a dish that works well with the airline's favorite Bordeaux. And naturally, a cheese course follows.
 The menus rotate every six weeks to keep frequent travelers happy. Flight attendants are given a one-day course on presentation at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and have a meal at a top-shelf restaurant to study service. 
 Private jets take a similar approach, said Jack Gentile, who started New York Aviation 30 years ago. His company has made a name flying corporate executives, celebrities, politicians and members of the British royal family. In each case, the menu is dictated by the customer.
 ''We'll go into the city and get dinner at Le Cirque if people want it,'' Mr. Adler said.
 Although corporate travelers might be eating a little healthier, he doesn't see that much has changed.
 ''As long as there's booze on board, they're happy,'' he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 10, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on April 16 about airline food in the special Business Travel section incorrectly attributed comments about a private-jet company, New York Aviation, and about business travelers in general. The comments, ''We'll go into the city and get dinner at Le Cirque if people want it,'' about the services New York Aviation provides, and ''As long as there's booze on board, they're happy,'' referring to business travelers, were by Jack Gentile, founder of New York Aviation -- not by Hector Adler, senior vice president for customer experience at Eos Airlines.

HEADLINE: Requiem for a Club: Saxophone and Sighs

BYLINE: By NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
There was plenty of exuberant noise at Tonic on Friday night: shrieking horns, fuzzed-out guitars, the jackhammer thump of a bass drum. It could almost have passed for a typical night at the club: two sets of improvisation organized by the saxophonist John Zorn and an installment of the Bunker, a techno party hosted by Bryan Kasenic, a k a DJ Spinoza. 
 But Friday was the final night at Tonic, a hub and hangout for avant-garde musicians, a constituency with few reliable resources. For them the club's eviction, because of rent arrears, has hit hard. ''It's a disaster,'' said Stephanie Stone, a concertgoer who has frequented Tonic since Mr. Zorn's first event there nine years ago, a few months after the club opened.
Back then Tonic was an outpost, situated on a stretch of Norfolk Street on the Lower East Side that might charitably have been described as rugged and obscure. Formerly a kosher winery, the space had attracted the attention of Melissa Caruso and John Scott, proprietors of Alt Coffee, a cyber cafe on Avenue A. Together with the accordionist Ted Reichman they had been presenting experimental music at Alt Coffee regularly. Tonic was an entrepreneurial expansion, with costs cheap enough to support the risk. 
 Now high-rise condominiums tower over the space on either side, an apt illustration of the squeeze of gentrification. In some respects it is surprising that Tonic survived as long as it did. Facing similar rent pressures, numerous clubs have shut down in recent months, notably CBGB and Sin-e. (Alt Coffee closed last week too.) 
 ''Our rent has doubled since we opened, and business has not doubled,'' said Ms. Caruso, who is now married to Mr. Scott. ''We've always struggled in that building,'' she said. ''Whether it's flooding or a complete disaster with our plumbing system, it just seems that we're hit with something every couple of years that's a huge expense.'' In the most recent setback Subtonic, the club's basement lounge, was shut down by the city for permit violations. 
 It was fitting that Mr. Zorn presided over Tonic's swan song: his initial two-month stretch of programming in 1998 was what put the club on the map. His two sets on Friday night were a succession of ad hoc instrumental lineups. Some -- like a trio consisting of the saxophonist Marty Ehrlich, the pianist Anthony Coleman and the drummer Gerry Hemingway -- delivered the glorious dissonance of top-grade free jazz.
 Other performances were less idiomatic, but had a common denominator of tonal friction and dynamic variation. Among the dozens of artists in rotation were the keyboardist Annie Gosfield, the pianists Sylvie Courvoisier and Vijay Iyer, the clarinetists Ned Rothenberg and Chris Speed, and the guitarists Elliot Sharp and Marc Ribot. All of them found a home in Tonic, to one degree or another, over the years.
 Of course so have many artists outside the orbit of improvised music. ''You would be able to go to three different shows in a week and have three completely different musical experiences,'' said Daniel Blumin, the former host of a popular WNYC radio show, who was standing outside the club with Drew Daniel of the experimental electronic duo Matmos. 
 Mr. Daniel, who has performed at Tonic, agreed. ''There would be pin-drop-silent things that were very sparse, and then raucous hellish stuff,'' he said. ''The only thing they really had in common was a commitment to a kind of integrity.'' 
 Along with Mr. Blumin, Mr. Daniel was waiting for DJ Spinoza's shift, which stretched well into the morning hours. (On Friday the Bunker will set up shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, at the Luna Lounge, a club that was priced out of the Lower East Side two years ago.)
 The club's increasing proportion of indie-rock and pop shows had alienated some musicians in recent years. ''For the immediate community of players that I work with,'' Mr. Reichman said on Friday afternoon, ''this loss is reflecting a change that happened a while ago.'' Yet Mr. Reichman was quick to credit Tonic with being the only centralized haven for the avant-garde jazz and improvised-music crowd.
 ''When the Knitting Factory went corporate rock, Tonic filled the void,'' Mr. Speed said between Friday's two sets. There are other sympathetic places in the city, he added, like Barbes and Issue Project Room in Brooklyn and the Stone in Manhattan, a nonprofit space opened by Mr. Zorn in 2005. But none have Tonic's size (capacity 180) or the sociable environment sustained by Mr. Scott and Ms. Caruso, who took in Friday's festivities with their one-month-old baby, Addison, in tow. 
 The indignation surrounding the club's closure was best illustrated by the demonstration held on Saturday at Tonic by an activist group called Take It to the Bridge, led in part by Mr. Ribot, the guitarist. Lasting from 11 a.m. till shortly before 5 p.m., it culminated in two brief arrests.
 In an interview that morning Mr. Ribot said the purpose of the demonstration was not to save Tonic, but to expose the need for city financing for experimental music. ''New music serves as research and development for a much larger music scene,'' he said. ''It has a cultural and economic weight beyond its immediate audience.'' 
 Moments later Mr. Ribot was playing a solo acoustic rendition of ''Cold, Cold Heart,'' as a worker on a ladder beside him wrestled with one of the club's hanging speakers. During the afternoon a number of musicians took the stage, including Mr. Rothenberg, the pianist Matthew Shipp and the conductor Butch Morris. Patricia Nicholson, the founder of the Vision Festival, which will present several of Tonic's previously scheduled shows this week in a neighborhood gallery (information at visionfestival.org), served as a de facto stage manager.
 By 4:30 most of the club's equipment had been carted out, and the room was empty of patrons. A smattering of police officers stood watch as Mr. Ribot played ''The Nearness of You'' (a wry dedication to the officers, perhaps). 
 Then there was an announcement that any lingerers would be guilty of trespassing. ''I wouldn't say that we want to get arrested, but we will not leave,'' Mr. Ribot replied. Along with Rebecca Moore, another Take It to the Bridge organizer, he was handcuffed and led outside to a squad car. Across the street a gathering of supporters let out a cheer.

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts on Monday about the final night of the Lower East Side club Tonic misidentified the radio station where Daniel Blumin, who spoke about his experiences at the club, was once host of a show. It was WNYU, not WNYC.

HEADLINE: China Plants Seed To Contend for Cup

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
China's emergence as an economic power has shaken up industry after industry. But the nation is in no shape to shake up the America's Cup, at least not yet.
 There is a Chinese challenger this time -- a first for the 156-year-old event -- but it is a late-starting one-boat campaign with a secondhand keel and the Cup's smallest budget. It finished last over all in the pre-Cup regattas and will struggle to win a race when the real thing begins with round-robin competition today in Valencia, Spain.
But that does not mean that the multilingual men who created this project consider it a failure. In their minds, they are simply laying the foundation for something grander. As with so much involving China, the future generates much more excitement than the present.
 ''There are three tiers of teams in the Cup,'' said Wang Chao Yong, the Chinese financier who leads China Team. ''Now we are in the third tier, the bottom tier. By the next Cup, I would hope we'd be in the second tier, and then the next Cup after that, tier one.'' 
 That is the sort of rapid progress that Chinese businessmen have come to expect in this go-go era. Like many Chinese entrepreneurs, Wang is using a joint venture to accelerate the process of becoming globally competitive.
 With China bereft of America's Cup expertise, Wang found a willing partner in the former French America's Cup syndicate Le Defi, which had already challenged unsuccessfully in 2000 and 2003 and was weary of chasing meager financing at home.
 ''What interested us was to do something new,'' said Xavier de Lesquen, Le Defi's former executive manager, who now has the same rule with China Team. ''But the other motivation was for us to go toward a country where if we made the right choices and worked well and developed the right projects with the right people, there was a potential to put together a powerful team.''
 Mission unaccomplished for now. The team's budget of 14 million euros, or nearly $19 million, makes it a weakling and essentially more of a marketing exercise than a truly competitive endeavor.
 But for the moment, there is symbiosis. De Lesquen and his compatriots are still in the game, and they have broader horizons. Wang, a former Wall Street banker turned Beijing venture capitalist, is getting the chance to reconnect with something he first experienced off the shores of Manhattan and to venture into a sport that could grow into something big in China.
 ''With our Chinese-French joint venture, we are promoting the international team idea,'' Wang said. ''But the impact behind the team is to promote more awareness of sailing in China, especially for the renaissance of China's long-lost sailing tradition.''
 China was a seagoing power in the 15th century before the Ming emperors decided to look inward and inland, making it a crime to build an oceangoing vessel. But the Chinese leaders feel quite differently now and have rebuilt the nation's blue-water navy into a force.
 Recreational yachting could be next, considering China's new wealth and lengthy coastline. China's first major marina outside of Hong Kong has been completed in grandiose fashion in Qingdao, site of the sailing competition at next year's Olympic Games.
 China Team has trained there, but with Cup rules stipulating that a challenger must represent an official yacht club, Wang and the French had to scramble in early 2005 when they realized that Qingdao did not actually have an official yacht club. 
 ''We rushed into Qingdao and asked them to form and register the club A.S.A.P.,'' Wang said. ''Which they did.''
 The America's Cup organizers, eager to spread the word, would have had it no other way. China Team exists in large part because of Michel Bonnefous, the chief executive of America's Cup Management, who was the first one to suggest to Wang that he form a Chinese team and also provided plenty of counsel along the way.
 He and Wang discussed the idea in September 2004 at the first of the pre-Cup regattas in Marseilles, France. Wang had gone there as a director of a media company to discuss promoting the Cup in Asia. But as Wang soaked up the sea air and flashed back to his sailing and salad days on the Hudson, as part of a team-building exercise at Chase, he realized that he wanted to get more involved. He inquired about trying to stage a pre-Cup regatta in Qingdao.
 ''Michel told me that in order to win the hosting right, you have to have a team, otherwise it's very difficult to apply,'' said Wang, who immediately set course for Valencia and returned to China to assemble financing.
 Wang eventually returned to Bonnefous and told him, ''Money is not a problem now; the team is a problem.''
 Enter Le Defi, whose leaders had already been considering China as a potential source of sponsorship. They ended up completing their application to challenge for the Cup just two hours before the deadline in March 2005.
 In truth, L'Equipe Chinoise would have been a more appropriate moniker for this enterprise, which, despite the presence of five Chinese and two Singaporean sailors, remains essentially a Gallic team with a Chinese investor.
 A majority of the race crew is French, and despite all that is being made in China at the moment, the only part of the team's race boat made in China was the hull, the bare minimum required by the Cup rules.
 Communication on board is a problem, particularly in the prestart when reaction time is at a premium. ''There are misunderstandings, but that's where I come in,'' said Tan Wearn Haw, a 28-year-old navigator from Singapore and the only regular crew member who speaks Mandarin, English and French. ''It's been quite funny sometimes with the French guys who only speak French and the Chinese guys who only speak Chinese, so I'm the one stuck in the middle.''
 Tan, a former Olympian in the small-boat 470 class, was recruited in Singapore by a Frenchman working for China Team. ''I thought he was a con man,'' said Tan, who traveled to Shenzhen, China, for the tryout only after soothing his suspicions with a thorough Internet search.
 The Chinese sailors were identified through their national sailing federation, which then let the French sailors pick the best of them. None of the Chinese had big-boat experience, and many of the best Chinese sailing talent is still tied up in preparing for the 2008 Olympics. Zhang Wenpei, a 22-year-old trimmer, said he had never heard of the America's Cup until 2005, when he saw a documentary on the event on Chinese television. 
 ''I remember thinking it would be very difficult to watch it in person one day, because it was so far away,'' he said through a translator at the team's base in Valencia.
 Unlike the bases of their competitors, which are behind solid walls and tinted windows, the China base is welcoming, with glass windows all around and a new bar, El Dragon, on its roof. Even before the official unveiling of the appendages earlier this month, there was no skirt on their boat's keel. ''We've got nothing to hide,'' Tan said with a laugh.
 That may change in the years and Cups ahead. Wang is already signing up sponsors at home for the next edition, and the team is planning a promotional tour of China after this Cup. But for now, Chinese industry generates a lot more restless nights for its competitors than Chinese sailing.
 Noting that it took Europe about 150 years to win a Cup, Wang said: ''The challenge is interesting, because it's so difficult to win, almost mission impossible. It's worth a try.''

HEADLINE: TAX FILINGS RISE FOR IMMIGRANTS IN U.S. ILLEGALLY

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
With the tax deadline approaching, illegal immigrants are sending in federal returns in what appear to be record numbers despite fears heightened by recent immigration raids around the country.
 The increase in filings comes amid talk of an immigration overhaul, with some proposals introduced in Congress linking amnesty to the payment of taxes. Many illegal immigrants showing up at tax preparation offices around the country say they hope that filing a return will create a paper trail that could lead to citizenship one day.
In Raleigh, N.C., a tax preparer found 350 immigrants waiting outside his office at 7 a.m., including one dragging a suitcase that held $14,000 in cash for back taxes. In Baltimore, a community agency offering free tax help that was deserted the day after 69 people were rounded up in immigration raids elsewhere in the city was crowded again within 24 hours. 
 And a help center in Queens did record business among illegal immigrants like Dionicio Quinde Lima, who has worked in construction strictly off the books since he arrived from Ecuador three years ago, but was eager to join the fold of United States taxpayers last week. 
 ''I feel it's my responsibility to pay,'' said Mr. Lima, 39, clutching a $202 money order for the Internal Revenue Service. ''And if it helps me get papers, fine. The most important would be a permit to travel back and forth to see my family.''
 Illegal immigrants do not have Social Security numbers, but the Internal Revenue Service allows them to file taxes by assigning applicants individual taxpayer identification numbers. The numbers were introduced in 1996 to encourage noncitizens with United States income, including foreign investors, to file returns. It is generally accepted that most of the 11 million numbers issued since then have gone to illegal immigrants. 
 The I.R.S., which does not ask about immigration status, is barred from divulging taxpayer information, with very limited exceptions, to other agencies, like the Department of Homeland Security. 
 In the 2005 tax year, the last for which such data is available, 1.9 million returns were filed with the primary taxpayer's using an individual taxpayer number, known as an ITIN, up 30 percent from 2004.
 Applications for the numbers spiked last year, with 1.5 million new ITINs issued through the beginning of November, more than any full year since the program started.
 Nancy Mathis, a spokeswoman for the I.R.S., said the agency did not know the reason for the increase, but added, ''It is likely due to more effective outreach by community organizations and proposed legislation last year linking payment of taxes to eventual citizenship.''
 In 2005 alone, more than $5 billion in tax liability -- the total owed, including money withheld from paychecks during the year -- was reported in the 2.9 million returns that listed at least one person with an ITIN, she said. And between 1996 and 2003, such filers reported nearly $50 billion of tax liability. 
 Organizations pushing for stricter immigration enforcement have criticized the use of the individual numbers by illegal immigrants, saying that allowing them to file returns, pay taxes and receive refund checks legitimizes their illegal presence. But the I.R.S. says it is just doing its job as a tax collector, and is not an immigration enforcement agency. 
 ''Clearly, we maintain a separation between the two systems,'' Mark W. Everson, the commissioner of the I.R.S., said recently. ''We want your money whether you are here legally or not and whether you earned it legally or not.''
 And because most immigration bills make the payment of back taxes a prerequisite for legal status, that message seems to be getting through more clearly than ever.
 ''Right now there's quite a stampede going on in many areas, including mine,'' said Blaire Borthayre, a consultant in Hispanic marketing based in Raleigh who described early-morning crowds gathering outside Family Tax Service, her husband's tax preparation business. ''It's word of mouth.''
 One client, she said, was a Mexican man who lugged in a suitcase holding $14,000, cash he had set aside to pay his taxes over six years of work as a landscaper. Like many, he had only recently learned that he could file a legitimate tax return, said Ms. Borthayre, who is the author of several books on tax preparation with ITINs. 
 Like Social Security numbers, individual taxpayer numbers have nine digits, but all begin with a ''9.'' The appeal of the numbers grew as they were accepted in some places as alternative identification to open a bank account, qualify for credit or even obtain a driver's license -- all uses that the I.R.S. opposed and has tried to curb, Ms. Mathis said.
 Since 2003, applications for an ITIN must be accompanied by a tax return, with few exceptions. And to avoid confusion with a Social Security card, the I.R.S. now sends a letter assigning a number, instead of a card. 
 Those changes did not mollify critics like Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which opposes bills that would let some longtime illegal residents achieve legal status. 
 ''First of all, almost all the people filing tax returns are doing it because they're going to get tax refunds,'' Mr. Krikorian said. ''It's a bad thing, because they're not obeying the law -- they're deciding which laws they prefer to obey. If they were interested in demonstrating their law-abiding nature, they would pack up and go home.''
 At a senior center in Jackson Heights, Queens, where Mr. Lima waited with an envelope decorated with an American flag and the label ''Important Tax Records,'' organizers of the free tax-help program said that ITIN refunds were much less common there than tax bills. 
 Of 1,700 ITIN returns prepared there between mid-January and early April, two-thirds of the filers owed money, said P. J. Kim, director of income policy at Food Change, a nonprofit agency in New York City that uses laptops and software lent by the I.R.S. The average income was $9,400 a year, the average tax bill was $623 and the highest was $7,275.
 Mr. Lima said that he had been a police officer for 16 years in Ecuador, before the country's economic crisis left him unable to support his wife and three daughters on his wages. He sent them about half the $12,000 he made last year, he said. ''I'm not afraid,'' he added. ''I really don't feel I'm doing anything wrong. I'm working and I'm paying taxes.''
 Others are afraid, but file anyway, said Lourdes Montes-Greenan, Latino services manager for the nonprofit East Harbor Community Development Corporation in Baltimore, where a day of immigration raids around that city disrupted tax preparation, even though the group's office was not raided. 
 ''The day after the raid, nobody showed up in the office,'' Ms. Montes-Greenan said. ''People were scared.'' Yet by the end of the week, she added, the flow of taxpayers was as high as ever.
 ''They say they want to be compliant,'' she said. ''In case immigration reform comes, they want to be ready.''
 Another reason for a surge in ITIN filers, Ms. Borthayre suggested, is that tax preparation chains like Liberty Tax Service and H & R Block are waking up to the market, and are learning to navigate the complications. Under tax treaties with Mexico and Canada, for example, ITIN filers can even claim deductions for dependents who live in those countries, reducing their taxable gross income by about $3,300 per child, she said. But children must have their own ITINs to be listed, fueling demand that has pushed the price per application as high as $200 at some unscrupulous mom-and-pop operations.
 ''People are desperate,'' she said. ''They believe immigration reform is either here or on its way.''
 In the Queens center, Ana Andrade, 32, from Mexico, had other incentives. She presented a W-2 form that showed withholding of more than $3,000 from the $24,000 she had earned as a cook in a Manhattan restaurant, at $10 an hour. Like more than seven million such W-2 forms nationwide, hers bore a false Social Security number.
 No problem, the senior tax specialist explained. Her return would be filed under her ITIN, with the problematic W-2 form, and the I.R.S. would simply credit her wages to her ITIN. The result: a $2,000 refund, based mainly on child credits for her two American-born children, 9 and 10. 
 Ms. Mathis of the Internal Revenue Service said that if the name on the W-2 matched the name on the ITIN, the return would be processed. 
 At the next table, Elsa Forero, 35, from Colombia, knew no refund was possible. She watched anxiously as a tax specialist and a volunteer parsed her cash wages as a baby sitter and her deductions for two children, including a 4-year-old son born in New York. The bottom line: She had to pay the federal government $579, but could expect a state tax credit for $115.
 ''I want to pay taxes because I live in this country and I like to follow the rules,'' she said.
 And how would she pay? 
 ''Little by little,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Iran Says It Wants Bidders for 2 More Nuclear Plants

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, April 15 

 BODY:
Iran said Sunday that it was seeking international bids for building two more nuclear power plants despite international pressure over its nuclear program. 
 ''Iran is launching two international tenders for the construction of two nuclear power stations of between 1,000 and 1,600 megawatts capacity in Bushehr,'' said Ahmad Fayazbakhsh, the deputy head of the nation's Atomic Energy Organization, who was quoted by the ISNA news agency. 
 He said that contacts had already been made with Russian and European firms, but that with Iran under United Nations sanctions because of its nuclear program, it was unclear if companies would want the risk of taking on the projects. 
 Russia helped Iran build its first, nearly completed, nuclear reactor in the southern city of Bushehr. But Russia has since informed Iran that it will withhold nuclear fuel for the plant unless Iran suspends its uranium enrichment as demanded by the United Nations Security Council, according to European, American and Iranian officials.
 Uranium enriched to low levels can fuel reactors; if enriched to high levels, it can fuel nuclear weapons. 
 The United States and some European governments have accused Iran of having a clandestine weapons program, but Iran contends that its program is peaceful, for energy purposes, and that it wants to produce fuel for reactors.
 Iran also announced this month that it had started industrial-scale production of enriched uranium at Natanz. The announcement was greeted with skepticism by Western diplomats and nuclear experts.
 The Security Council has passed two resolutions since December that impose sanctions and press Iran to suspend its enrichment program.
 The newly announced projects would be expected to take between 9 and 11 years and cost more than $1 billion, according to Mr. Fayazbakhsh. It is unclear if Iran is serious about pursuing the projects or if it is trying to build a better case for why it needs to produce its own enriched uranium.
 The nearly completed Bushehr plant has a 1,000-megawatt capacity. The Iranian government has neither confirmed nor denied a report that Russia has asked Iran to suspend uranium enrichment.

HEADLINE: As Talks Stall on S.I. Port, a Wider Debate

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Negotiations between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and one of its largest tenants stalled on Friday, raising the likelihood that a deal to hand over control of a Staten Island terminal might fall through. And if the tug-of-war escalates, development in the area could be at risk, the tenant's officials said. 
 Last month, the Port Authority asked Orient Overseas International Limited, which operates the Howland Hook terminal on Staten Island, to pay $37 million before the authority would approve the sale of its lease to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board for roughly $470 million. The authority also wants Ontario Teachers to agree to invest $17 million in the terminal.
 Orient Overseas said the authority did not respond to its counteroffer of $5 million and does not want to work against itself by making another one. 
 The authority said the company's $5 million offer was not in good faith and that even the $37 million fee would cover only about one-third of the money the authority has spent improving the terminal while the company has been there. In February, the authority successfully negotiated for $50 million in fees and commitments from A.I.G. Global Investment Group, which bought the rights to run Port Newark terminal from DP World, a Dubai-based operator. That was well below the $84 million the authority initially sought.
 Like executives at A.I.G., representatives of Orient Overseas called the authority's demands very shortsighted and a potential deal breaker. If Orient Overseas' lease deal falls through, development might stall at one of the fastest growing ports in the region, and Staten Island's economy, which has benefited from Howland Hook's revival, could be dealt a blow, company officials said.
 ''The terminal is not going to close,'' said Jim Devine, chief executive of New York Container Terminal, which runs the port on behalf of Orient Overseas. ''But we're not going to dramatically grow and the economic engine will not grow. The capacity of the harbor is going to be challenged.''
 While Howland Hook is smaller than ports in Newark and Elizabeth, New York Container Terminal has opened a rail link to New Jersey and is planning a new shipping berth that would double the capacity of the terminal. The company has also agreed to handle some waste as part of New York City's garbage disposal plan.
 The authority said it was only trying to protect public money. Part of the money Orient Overseas will get from selling its lease is based on the agency's investment in the terminal, authority officials said. And unlike Orient Overseas, a shipping conglomerate, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board has never run ports. The authority wants the $17 million commitment as a hedge against the possibility that the lease was simply resold for a quick profit.
 ''We are just looking for some level of commitment that there will be a priority to this investment,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Up the Alternative Tax

 BODY:
This page normally has little patience for people who gripe about paying taxes. But most of the four million taxpayers who owed the alternative minimum tax this filing season have cause to complain. 
 The alternative tax is supposed to apply to multimillionaires whose high-end tax shelters would otherwise reduce their tax bills to a pittance. The aim is a good one. But in the last decade, lawmakers have willfully undermined the tax's intent, mainly with overly generous tax breaks for investment income that enable many of the richest Americans to escape the alternative tax.
As a result, only an estimated 3 percent of alternative-tax payers for 2006 are tax-sheltering multimillionaires. Most people who owe the tax make between $200,000 and $500,000; nearly a fourth make $75,000 to $200,000. In those groups, the most common breaks are write-offs for children and for state and local taxes -- hardly aggressive tax shelters. Yet, on average, the alternative tax has boosted those filers' 2006 tax bills by an estimated $4,200.
 So, there are really two problems with the alternative tax: it fails to catch tax avoidance among the richest taxpayers while ensnaring people it was never intended for. In recent hearings, Congress has focused mainly on the wrongly afflicted taxpayers. But that is the easier part of the problem to solve. Simply making inflation adjustments to the levels at which the tax kicks in -- which hasn't been done since 1993 -- would shield most taxpayers. Letting the Bush tax cuts expire as scheduled would also help. Because of the way tax provisions interact, those cuts cause many filers' tax bills to drop initially only to shoot back up when the alternative tax is assessed. 
 Which brings us to the real hot-button issue. The alternative tax should be reformed so that it does what it is supposed to do: make wealthy taxpayers with excessive tax shelters pay up. The wealthier one is, the more of one's income is from capital gains on the sale of investments rather than wages and salaries. Capital gains come with a huge advantage: they're taxed at 15 percent versus a top rate of 35 percent for ordinary income. The lower rate for capital gains is one of the biggest breaks in the code. But under the law, capital gains are not classified as sheltered income subject to the alternative tax. 
 The result is that the richest taxpayers get a windfall while the burden shifts to others. That huge -- and hugely unfair -- tax shift will soon get worse. In 2007, the alternative tax will affect 23 million filers. By 2010, it will hit 32 million taxpayers, including nearly all upper-middle-class families with children. Shielding those taxpayers from the alternative tax would mean the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. But much of that would be recouped if tax breaks on capital gains were treated the same as other tax breaks under the alternative tax. Lawmakers have their work cut out for them.

HEADLINE: Public Rebuke For Wolfowitz, But He Digs In

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz's struggle to remain as president of the World Bank was dealt a crippling setback on Sunday when its most powerful oversight committee delivered an unusually public rebuke of his leadership, expressing ''great concern'' about the institution's future and the need to preserve its credibility and staff morale.
 Mr. Wolfowitz, responding at a news conference, vowed to stay on at the bank, however, saying that he too cared about the bank's ethical standards. ''Look, I believe in the mission of this organization, and I believe I can carry it out,'' he said with a pained smile and a measure of frustration.
The extraordinary exchange between Mr. Wolfowitz and the oversight committee, which consists of 47 of the world's finance ministers and leaders of other international organizations, deepened the uncertainty over Mr. Wolfowitz. His future had earlier been thrown into doubt by the disclosure that he played a direct role in granting a pay raise and promotion to a female companion when she was transferred in 2005. 
 Bank and finance officials said they could not recall any time in the history of the bank when there was such an open and rancorous rift between its president and the people who are supposed to run the institution in cooperation with him.
 The events of the day, in which top officials took time out from discussing issues like poverty and development strategies, set up a clear impasse between Mr. Wolfowitz and the leadership of the bank, as represented by what seemed to be most of the world's finance ministers and most of the members of a separate 24-member executive board that governs its day-to-day affairs.
 The rebuke of Mr. Wolfowitz came in the form of bureaucratic language in a series of sentences in the board's communique that asserted ''the current situation is of great concern to all of us,'' an unusually blunt statement for a circumspect institution.
 ''We have to ensure that the bank can effectively carry out its mandate and maintain its credibility and reputation as well as the motivation of its staff,'' the committee said. ''We expect the bank to adhere to a high standard of internal governance.''
 Though the language was indirect, the message it sent was unmistakable, according to officials who have been meeting in Washington the last few days. ''Words like 'concerned,' 'credibility' and 'reputation' are pretty unprecedented for a communique from a place like the World Bank,'' said an official involved in the drafting of the statement.
 At issue in these statements was a crisis arising from Mr. Wolfowitz's involvement in decisions to transfer his companion, Shaha Ali Riza, to a new job and give her a raise.
 Officially, Mr. Wolfowitz and the bank are now to wait for a full report by the bank's board on his leadership and charges of favoritism in dealing with Ms. Riza, who was employed at the bank until 2005. But bank officials said that in delaying a finding, the board seemed to be buying time for Mr. Wolfowitz to consider resigning.
 European officials close to the bank said that if anything, Mr. Wolfowitz's apparent dismissal of the criticism on Sunday would increase the determination of the wealthy European donor nations of the bank -- especially Britain, France and Germany -- that he needed to step aside for the good of the bank.
 Although the storm over Mr. Wolfowitz has flared in the last few weeks because of his handling of Ms. Riza's case, unhappiness with his leadership began almost from the day he was appointed two years ago. Staff and high-ranking officials, uneasy over being led by an architect of the Iraq war, grew increasingly rebellious over many of his policies, particularly those cracking down on corruption in the granting of loans to poor countries. Staff members angrily accused him of seeing them as accessories to corruption.
 Several European officials said their concern now was that Mr. Wolfowitz would not be able to carry out the job of raising $30 billion over the next three years for the International Development Agency, the arm of the bank that provides low-cost loans and assistance to the poorest countries.
 Mr. Wolfowitz signaled that raising the $30 billion was already a major challenge over the last year, not because of recent events. ''The donors are now unfortunately in a position of not fulfilling their promises,'' he said. Concerns about the future of this money were conveyed during the weekend to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., European officials said.
 ''This was a point conveyed in several meetings,'' said a bank official. ''I think Paulson knows this.''
 Late Sunday, a Treasury spokeswoman, Brookly McLaughlin, said Mr. Paulson ''is counseling all parties to allow the process to proceed in a fair and respectful manner.''
 Bank officials and others close to the executive board said they hoped that Mr. Paulson, who they said mostly listened to complaints about Mr. Wolfowitz over the past three days and counseled patience on his future, would play a crucial role in persuading him to step down.
 A senior European official in the meetings said this was possible because Mr. Paulson went along with a communique that criticized Mr. Wolfowitz. 
 By all accounts, Mr. Wolfowitz spent the weekend churning through meetings with a determination to project confidence that he could weather the crisis.
 ''I think he has just wanted to tough it out,'' said a bank official who watched him. ''He's clearly hoping that once everyone leaves town, he can go on and that all this will fade away. That has not happened and it is not going to happen.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz made his public comments about intending to stay on at a news conference with Rodrigo de Rato, the head of the International Monetary Fund, and the chairman of the steering committee, Agustin Carstens, the finance minister of Mexico. 
 Each time he tried to steer the discussion into the importance of eradicating poverty in Africa and elsewhere, he was brought back to questions about whether he could lead an institution that, fairly or not, was in virtual revolt against him.
 In response, Mr. Wolfowitz said that he agreed with the communique's conclusion that the integrity of the bank was important and that he, like the bank's policy supervisors, would await the conclusions of the bank board.
 ''The board is looking into the matter, and we'll let them complete their work,'' he said.
 An earlier indication of Mr. Wolfowitz's defiant approach came Saturday night, when he sent an e-mail message to World Bank employees with a link to selected documents that came to light on Friday relating to his handling of the case of Ms. Riza.
 The documents he referred to showed that Mr. Wolfowitz had wanted to remove himself from handling Ms. Riza's transfer and raise but was forced to make the arrangements himself because top lawyers and ethics officials at the bank said they did not want to get involved.
 The e-mail seemed to increase the anger on the bank board and staff. A top official involved in the board meetings, which occurred on and off throughout the weekend, said, ''It has backfired.''
 That was also the view of others who more bluntly have called for Mr. Wolfowitz's dismissal.
 ''We have not heard anything that will change our minds,'' said April Cave, chairwoman of the association that represents most of the bank's 7,000 employees in Washington. ''He has apologized, but he hasn't shown how he can restore trust at the bank.''
 Some bank officials said that as a practical matter, Mr. Wolfowitz's future may be decided by a complicated interplay of Bush administration and European politics.
 The antipathy to his leadership is especially high in Britain, France and Germany, they said. The British chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, who is expected to succeed Tony Blair as prime minister as early as this summer, is under pressure from his own political base to stand up to the United States more than Mr. Blair has done.
 Europeans are already channeling their aid for poor countries away from the bank and toward agencies based in Europe, a trend that many say will accelerate rapidly if Mr. Wolfowitz remains. 
 It has always been customary for the United States to choose the president of the World Bank, but there are certain to be demands for that tradition to be scrapped if Mr. Wolfowitz leaves.
 Meanwhile, the Bush administration, facing calls for the ouster of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and anger among conservatives for not fighting hard enough to save John R. Bolton as United Nations ambassador, is seen by many in Washington as having little appetite to shove Mr. Wolfowitz over the side.
 That is why some administration officials say that Mr. Paulson, a respected global financial figure as a former Goldman Sachs executive, but a political neophyte in Washington, may have to the reconcile those competing pressures in deciding what to recommend to the White House about Mr. Wolfowitz.
 Mr. Wolfowitz is very close to Vice President Dick Cheney but has inspired negative feelings at the State Department among the people around Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Treasury officials under Mr. Paulson have also made little secret of their concerns about Mr. Wolfowitz's performance at the bank.

HEADLINE: Book Fair Unites Anarchists. In Spirit, Anyway.

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
So what, exactly, is an anarchist? 
 There are almost as many definitions and interpretations as there are adherents. There are, for example, anarcho-syndicalists, anarcho-communists, and eco-anarchists. Then there are the anarcho-primitivists in Oregon, who deplore technology and therefore have at least one glaring difference with a group of New York anarchists, who run a volunteer computer lab at ABC No Rio, a community center on the Lower East Side.
But anarchists have never hidden their disagreements, and some of those competing ideas were proudly displayed as the Anarchist Book Fair got under way Saturday at the Judson Memorial Church, on Washington Square South. 
 A composition by John Cage was playing. A black and red flag hung from a wall facing rows of card tables covered with books, pamphlets, zines and T-shirts. Issues of The Catholic Worker were stacked near copies of a London newspaper called Class War, and the Institute for Anarchist Studies in Washington shared a table with Black Sheep Books of Montpelier, Vt., which describes itself as a ''workers collective'' that specializes in used books.
 About a thousand people showed up, including visitors from Berkeley, Calif., Baltimore, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Quebec. 
 One of the organizers, Jenna Freedman, 40, a librarian from the East Village, said that she and others began planning the fair, which they said was the first of its kind in New York, motivated partly by a desire to bring together strands of anarchism.
 ''It's invigorating to bounce ideas off of people and form new alliances,'' she said. ''People are hungry for extended family and extended community,'' Ms. Freedman said, glancing at the steps leading into the church, where crowds were eating plates of vegetarian food and gathering to smoke cigarettes. 
 ''For us,'' she added. ''This is like Thanksgiving.''
 Among the events were tactical protest lessons gleaned from an Italian anarchist group (known for demonstrating dressed all in white and wearing body armor made of foam padding or inflated inner tubes) and a feminist round table called ''What Would Emma Do?'' -- a reference to Emma Goldman, who, among many other things, published the journal Mother Earth and led opposition to the draft during World War I.
 During a forum called ''Remembering Spain, Remembering Heroes,'' an 88-year-old man named George Sossenko described how he had left his home in France at 16 to join anarchists in Spain battling fascist forces led by Francisco Franco.
 On a wide balcony overlooking the book tables, volunteers watched small children. And in an old basement basketball court filled with folding chairs, a few dozen people took part in the panel discussion ''Anarchism and its Aspirations.''
 Some of the many conversations that took place inside the church on Saturday had an element of soul-searching: What does it mean to be an anarchist today? And how can anarchists achieve their aims?
 Critics, from the late 19th century to the early 21st century, have condemned them as a disorganized mob of nihilists bent on creating chaos. But many anarchists see themselves more as revolutionary idealists seeking to make society more humane by replacing authority with autonomy.
 Despite the diversity, there are a few main tenets shared by nearly all anarchists, including opposition to the sort of authority embodied by the state, capitalism and organized religion. Rather than looking to leaders for direction, they say, communities should make decisions based on the common good.
 That vision is not likely to be implemented on a wide scale soon, so for now many anarchists must find other ways to act on their beliefs.
 Take, for instance, Chuck Reinhardt, 64, whose business card lists him as ''Teacher, Balkan Volunteer, Smoke Jumper, Deadhead, Legal Observer, World Traveler & Last of the Big-Time Spenders,'' and who was hanging out at a table that displayed an array of antiwar buttons. 
 Mr. Reinhardt, who taught history in New Jersey public schools before retiring, now teaches part time in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where nationalism and ethnic and religious divisions led to war in the 1990's.
 ''I teach that all groups can coexist,'' he said. ''What I'm teaching is anarchism.''
 If there is one subject that haunts all anarchists, it is the view of them as dangerous criminals. That perception has strengthened since 1999, when they started clashing regularly with police during economic summits in cities including Seattle and Genoa, sometimes breaking windows and committing other acts of vandalism.
 Eric Laursen, 46, a freelance writer from Harlem who organized protests during the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York, said that the majority of anarchists do not skirmish with police or damage property. But he said he would not criticize anyone who did so while standing up for a just cause. 
 ''Anarchists don't believe property is, or should be, the ultimate value of society,'' he said. ''Private property is not more important than human life, and it is not more important than individual freedom.''

HEADLINE: Ecuador Appears Likely to Rewrite Constitution

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, April 15 

 BODY:
President Rafael Correa's proposal to rewrite Ecuador's Constitution seemed on its way to a landslide victory in a referendum on Sunday, even as the nationwide vote was shadowed by a disclosure that Mr. Correa's father had been imprisoned decades ago in the United States on drug smuggling charges.
 Illustrating the heightening tension between Mr. Correa and Congress, a legislator, Luis Almeida, leaked details of the imprisonment to local news outlets on Saturday. The disclosure of the incident, which occurred about 40 years ago, drew a quick and impassioned rebuke from Mr. Correa. 
 ''My mother never told us the truth,'' Mr. Correa, 44, said on his national radio program. ''I found out about this when I was 18. What blame do I have for something my father did 40 years ago, when I was 5 years old? My father has been dead for 13 years.''
 While details of the incident remain vague, it adds to the political agitation in Ecuador, with Mr. Correa, just three months into his presidency, pitted against the entrenched political elites that have dominated the country's legislature and its bureaucracy for decades.
 The disclosure also adds another facet to the complex public persona of one of Latin America's newest leaders in a growing movement to counter American political influence in the region. Mr. Correa, a polished economist with postgraduate degrees from American and European universities, has allied himself with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. 
 But he has also pushed to maintain strong economic ties with the United States while vociferously opposing renewal of an agreement that allows the United States to conduct drug surveillance flights from a base in the coastal city of Manta. And in a spat with President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, the Bush administration's closest ally in South America, Mr. Correa has been critical of Colombia's policy of fumigating coca crops near its border with Ecuador, which is carried out with aid from the United States.
 Mr. Correa said his father, who was apparently unemployed at the time, was imprisoned for three and a half years in the United States after his arrest there in the late 1960s. Other details about Mr. Correa's upbringing are sparse, apart from statements that his family endured economic hardship while he was growing up.
 ''I had a very hard childhood,'' Mr. Correa said on his radio program.
 Political analysts here said the news about Mr. Correa's father could actually work to the president's advantage if he was perceived as someone who overcame obstacles to rise to a position of such influence. About 70 percent of those polled approve of Mr. Correa's job performance as he presses forward with a campaign to fundamentally restructure Ecuador's political system.
 According to surveys of voters leaving the polls released late Sunday, the referendum on whether to hold a new constitutional convention was approved by almost 80 percent of voters, easily surpassing expectations. If final results show a victory for Mr. Correa, Ecuador will soon start choosing delegates to the convention for a process that has been similarly carried out in Bolivia and Venezuela.
 Indeed, Mr. Chavez said Sunday that he wished Mr. Correa the ''best of luck'' from Venezuela, where he appeared on television with President Evo Morales of Bolivia to commemorate the opening of a milk processing plant built in western Venezuela with financing from Iran.
 Constitutional conventions are a common feature of Ecuador's political system. Ecuador's most recent Constitution took effect in 1998.
 Since then, however, the country has been among the most politically unstable in Latin America, with eight presidents in a decade. One priority of Mr. Correa's supporters in writing a new constitution will be limiting the power of Congress, which many Ecuadoreans see as corrupt and adept only at toppling presidents.
 ''We need an abrupt change that repositions the presidency in relation to Congress, while also strengthening the state's capacity for regulation,'' said Juan Paz y Mino, a historian who supports Mr. Correa. ''This doesn't mean abolishing private enterprise, but rather making the private sector more socially responsible.''

HEADLINE: E-Mail Innovator Plans to Enlist in the Wireless Campaign of the Patent Wars

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., April 15 

 BODY:
Nicholas Fodor is about to dive into the patent wars that have tangled up the business of wireless e-mail. But his weapon of choice is not a lawsuit. It is a new e-mail service he is developing using the knowledge gained from years of experience with e-mail software.
 Mr. Fodor, 43, a French computer programmer, said that in the early 1990s he worked on ''push'' e-mail services that predated the filing of important patents in this area.
He intends to test his claims as soon as next month by introducing Freedom Mail, a simple free service that he says will make it possible to view and respond to messages sent to almost any e-mail account on a cellphone or other mobile device. 
 ''Freedom Mail will liberate wireless e-mail from expensive and spurious litigation driven by very few patent owners for the sole purpose of dominating global wireless e-mail communications,'' Mr. Fodor said in an e-mail message.
 The service, which he said would work with almost all cellphones that can connect to the Internet, will be supported by small advertisements appended to messages. Mr. Fodor said that in advanced phones, the service would match the capabilities of push e-mail services like that available on the BlackBerry from Research in Motion, where messages on the phone and on a personal computer are automatically synchronized. 
 He acknowledged that he is an underdog in the wireless e-mail world, where heavyweights like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft are battling for market share. But he said that he would soon announce partnerships and was hoping to take advantage of grass-roots marketing online.
 And though he is not well known in the industry, an earlier version of his software has been used by SFR in France, owned by Vodafone and Vivendi, through a partnership of Mr. Fodor's company, SetNet, with Hewlett-Packard. 
 If it works as promised, Freedom Mail will compete with highly profitable services like those provided by Research in Motion, and could also undermine the lucrative patent portfolios of NTP and Visto, two firms that have won hundreds of millions of dollars in court with claims that they invented the idea of wireless electronic mail and mail synchronization.
 ''Visto could have some real problems,'' said Gregory Aharonian, publisher of Internet Patent News Service, an industry newsletter, and an intellectual property consultant who has worked with Visto in the past. He said that once the service became widely available, ''everyone they are suing is going to slap them with discovery requests to find out how much they knew about Mr. Fodor's software.''
 Mr. Fodor, who founded SetNet in Florida in 1993, said he was the first to offer a commercial product that could synchronize e-mail between machines. 
 He demonstrated e-mail synchronization in 1996 at an industry conference, three years before Visto received its first patent for the idea of synchronizing ''work spaces'' over a network in 1999. 
 SetNet's software, which was sold in partnership with Hewlett-Packard beginning in 2002, could be viewed as important ''prior art'' in the intellectual-property wars that have pitted Visto and its investment partner, NTP, against Seven Networks and Motorola's Good Technology Group, as well as Microsoft and Research in Motion. 
 The protracted patent battles are cited by many legal scholars and industry executives as a principal example of the failings of the United States patent system, which they say has limited technology innovation more than fostering it.
 ''The fact is that ideas spring up simultaneously all the time,'' said Mark A. Lemley, a Stanford University professor who specializes in patent law. He said there was a growing movement among legal scholars and economists to back changes in patent law to protect the concept of independent invention. 
 NTP won a $612.5 million judgment against Research in Motion last year, even though the patent office had largely invalidated its claim that its founder, Thomas J. Campana Jr., who died in 2004, was the inventor of wireless e-mail. 
 Before that judgment, NTP invested in Visto, which has successfully sued Seven Networks and in the last decade has raised more than $300 million from about a dozen investors.
 But further legal claims by Visto could be undermined by SetNet -- a risk that Brian Bogosian, Visto's chief executive, appeared to acknowledge in 2003.
 Mr. Fodor has a short e-mail message that he says Mr. Bogosian sent him on Aug. 14, 2003, saying only: ''O.K., I need you but, you really need us. Next step?'' 
 A venture capitalist had told Mr. Bogosian that SetNet needed funds, Mr. Fodor said, which was not the case. He spurned Mr. Bogosian's overtures. 
 Through a spokesman, Visto executives declined to comment.
 Although Mr. Fodor grew up in France and studied law in Paris, some aspects of his background parallel those of many American computer entrepreneurs. He said he was diverted from a legal career in the 1970s when he discovered VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet software. ''VisiCalc changed everything for me,'' he said. ''I was seduced by the fun of programming.''
 He went on to form a small business developing database software for the real estate industry. In 1992, he decided to move to the United States when a bank said it was prepared to invest in his business, but only if he was willing to convert his software for a French computer company. 
 Settled in Coral Gables, Fla., he stumbled on the idea of e-mail synchronization because he had one computer that was connected to the Internet and multiple computers around his home, plus multiple e-mail accounts on services like CompuServe and MCI Mail. Synchronizing them in one universal mailbox on all his computers seemed an obvious step, he said.
 ''I was tired of having to swap between multiple clients all the time,'' Mr. Fodor said. He began selling his synchronization software through CompuServe in 1993. In 1999 he sold a robust version of the original program to SFR, which is the second-largest mobile operator in France. 
 In 2002, SetNet reached a distribution deal with Hewlett-Packard. This made it possible for a cellular carrier to offer push e-mail to consumers with ordinary e-mail accounts, without the need for Microsoft Exchange or BlackBerry software. From 2003 to 2006, the service was available to several million subscribers on the Vodafone Live service in Europe, Mr. Fodor said.
 Now, he thinks he has found a way to extend his software. In addition to synchronizing accounts on services like Yahoo Mail, Hotmail and Gmail, Freedom Mail will offer spam filtering and privacy protection and, in the future, additional features that may be sold by subscription, Mr. Fodor said.
 The service is being developed by a team of 11, including legal and business staff members, and backed by $6 million in financing from family and friends. Mr. Fodor said he might file for patents on some aspects of the service to give it a clear path for future development, but would consider allowing others to make use of them without paying royalties. 
 Despite the hurdles his service will face, Mr. Fodor has supporters who think he is in a good position. 
 ''I'm confident that he was there first,'' said Bill Race, an independent technology consultant, who as worldwide manager of telecommunications for Hewlett-Packard helped strike a deal with SetNet. ''Nick is probably holding all the cards.''

HEADLINE: Israeli and Palestinian Leaders Open Regular Peace Talks

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER; Jennifer Medina contributed reporting.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 15 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, met here on Sunday, resulting in some mixed messages regarding a resumption of their long-dormant peace efforts.
 The meeting was the first of a series of biweekly sessions, agreed to by Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas during the last visit to the region by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Israeli officials, in describing the meeting, emphasized the aspects that dealt with immediate, practical issues, while the Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, highlighted the part that he said focused on finding a far-reaching political solution to the conflict.
The first half of the two-hour meeting dealt with security, the easing of restrictions on the movement of Palestinian people and goods, and macroeconomic issues, Israeli and Palestinian officials said. Israel's foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, and defense minister, Amir Peretz, also attended those talks. The Palestinian delegation included Mr. Erekat; Rafik al-Husseini, a senior aide to Mr. Abbas; and his economic adviser, Muhammad Mustafa. During the second hour, Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas met in private. 
 Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Olmert, said Israel had agreed to keep the Karni commercial crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel open until 11 every night, instead of 7 p.m., and to keep the Rafah passenger crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which has been closed for long periods, open ''for several days every week.'' She added that the mandate of the European monitors at the border was renewed.
 Mr. Abbas presented a plan for reconstructing the Palestinian security forces and for building up his office's elite Presidential Guard, which the Israelis said was based on the recommendations by Gen. Keith Dayton, the American security coordinator to the Palestinians. Ms. Eisin also said that the sides discussed ways to contend with the continuing rocket fire from Gaza into Israel, and weapons smuggling across the Egyptian border into Gaza.
 Israeli officials had stated before the meeting that core ''final status'' issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, like borders, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees, would not be on the agenda. Ms. Eisin specified that no final status issues had been addressed in the first hour, and gave no details about the second hour.
 But Mr. Erekat said in a telephone interview that the second hour was the ''most significant,'' and focused on ''the political horizon -- how to probe the possibility of implementing President Bush's vision for a two-state solution, and how to get there.'' It was the first time since January 2001, he said, that an Israeli prime minister and a Palestinian president had addressed fundamental issues. 
 The two sides have agreed to meet in two weeks in the West Bank city of Jericho.
 Earlier on Sunday, Mr. Olmert told the Israeli cabinet that Israel would make ''every effort to find a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.'' Israeli officials have also indicated that Israel would be willing to discuss an Arab peace initiative with a working committee of the Arab League, if invited. 
 ''Israel has never blacklisted the Arab League -- it was the other way around,'' said Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
 Israel rejected the Arab peace initiative when it was first raised in 2002. Based on a Saudi proposal, it calls for a full Israeli withdrawal to its pre-1967 boundaries in return for full relations with the Arab world. Mr. Olmert has said there are positive elements in the initiative and others that Israel finds unacceptable. In particular, Israel objects to a clause about the refugees, which it interprets as demanding the right of return for the refugees of 1948 and their descendants to their original homes in what is now Israel.
 Despite the positive signals, Israeli commentators remained skeptical about the potential for real, imminent progress. Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas are both in weak positions at home. Mr. Olmert is also said to be nervously awaiting the interim conclusions of a committee headed by a retired judge, Eliyahu Winograd, on the government's performance during last summer's war in Lebanon. The report is due at the end of April.
 ''Nothing significant will happen before Winograd, and I think the Palestinians understand that,'' said Shlomo Brom, a retired general and senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. But he noted a ''positive change'' in Israel's approach to the Arab initiative and said that if Mr. Olmert ''survives Winograd,'' everything could change.
 Also on Sunday, the Vatican's ambassador to Israel, Archbishop Antonio France, attended the Remembrance Day ceremony at the Holocaust Museum, reversing his earlier decision to skip the event in protest over the museum's depiction of Pope Pius XII as not doing enough to help stop the killings of Jews during World War II. The archbishop's office did not respond to a telephone call seeking comment.

HEADLINE: China's Signals on Warming

 BODY:
Two factors are crucial to the success of any global system to reduce greenhouse gases. One is American leadership; the other is China's full participation. Despite President Bush's diffidence, there has been mounting pressure for the United States to assume a more aggressive role from mayors, governors, some in Congress and, lately, even the Supreme Court. And now there are some modestly encouraging signs from China. 
 During a visit to Tokyo last week, China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, announced that his country was prepared to take part in negotiations on a new agreement limiting global warming emissions, to replace Kyoto Protocol provisions that expire in 2012. China is not subject to the accord's binding emissions targets, but its commitment to talk raises real hope that it may be open to the idea.
 Japan and China also agreed to work together to reduce emissions. Both sides have strong economic motives for doing so. Japan, already one of the world's most energy-efficient countries, is having a hard time further reducing its emissions as required under the Kyoto agreement. It can earn credits to help meet its obligations by investing in clean-energy projects in developing countries like China, which in turn would help China's economy and give it access to new technologies. 
 China may be beginning to grasp that climate change poses a danger to itself as well as everyone else. But experts agree that China -- which should soon surpass the United States as the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide -- will never come to grips with the problem until it imposes mandatory limits on greenhouse gases as called for by Kyoto and accepted by most industrialized nations, with the United States a glaring exception. 
 Such caps would be costly medicine, which China is unlikely to swallow as long as the United States doesn't do so as well -- thus using America as a cover for inaction just as Mr. Bush is using China to excuse his own. The Democrats in Congress could help break that stalemate, and further encourage China to engage the issue, by establishing strong and credible emissions limits for this country.

HEADLINE: Sallie Mae, Mired in Controversy Over Loans, Is Under Siege

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Peter Edmonston contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Standing before a group of student lending executives in late 2005, Representative John A. Boehner, then chairman of the House Education Committee, vowed he would keep their interests in mind as legislation made its way though Congress. 
 ''Know that I have all of you in my two trusted hands,'' Mr. Boehner, now the House minority leader, said in a widely reported speech.
Today, the student loan industry needs all the trusted hands it can find. And no lender needs them more than one of Mr. Boehner's biggest political supporters: the SLM Corporation, known as Sallie Mae.
 Sallie Mae, the nation's largest provider of student loans, is under siege on several fronts. Democratic lawmakers and President Bush are threatening to cut the federal subsidies and guarantees that have allowed its core loan business to thrive for years. 
 Investigations and media scrutiny over deceptive sales practices are casting a harsh light on its newest and most lucrative business -- high-interest private loans that bridge the gap between tuition costs and federal aid. And a deteriorating credit environment for all financial institutions could soon put pressure on the company's bottom line.
 All the while, the political and economic uncertainty caused Sallie Mae's stock to plunge more than 20 percent over the last year, and made it a takeover target. At least two private equity buyers -- the Blackstone Group and a group consisting of J. C. Flowers and JPMorgan Chase -- are in talks to acquire the company, which is based in Reston, Va., according to people close to the situation. It could fetch $20 billion or more. 
 ''This is in some ways a perfect storm,'' said Kevin Bruns, the executive director of America's Student Loan Providers, an industry lobbying group. ''Sallie Mae's interests in what is going on in Congress and with the investigations is really what is going on in the overall student loan industry: the economics are changing, and they are concerned.''
 Sallie Mae has long known that its fortunes follow the course of Washington politics, even though it no longer has a quasi-government status, as many people still believe. 
 ''Much as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac use their role in home ownership as a political asset for leverage, Sallie uses its historical role in providing student loans as a political asset,'' notes Jonathan G. S. Koppell, a Yale University professor who studies the politics of government-sponsored enterprises. 
 The company, for example, has its own foundation, the Sallie Mae Fund, which offers money for education projects. Several of its former executives now hold top posts in the Education Department. 
 Sallie Mae has also been a major political contributor, more often to Republicans than Democrats. And while it has not gotten much public attention until recently, its lobbyists have long been active on Capitol Hill.
 Even in the face of intense legislative and regulatory pressure, the company said that its growth as student lender remained compelling. ''We are providing better prices, better service and better technology,'' said Tom Joyce, a Sallie Mae spokesman. ''I think the facts will win out.''
 When the government established the company in 1972, a special charter allowed Sallie Mae to use low-cost debt, backed by the federal government, to buy existing student loans from banks. It pocketed the difference between the cost of the funds and the interest payments the students made. But as a government-sponsored enterprise, it was barred from directly lending to students. 
 By the mid-1990s, however, Sallie Mae was struggling. As more students consolidated their debts at lower rates and a new government program cut private lenders out of the process, making student loans became far more profitable than packaging them. In 1997, Sallie Mae's new management team severed its government ties, allowing it to lend directly to students for the first time. 
 Student lending had long been a little-noticed but lucrative niche. To encourage banks to lend to college students, who typically had little credit history and no collateral or predictable income, Congress has since the mid-1960s provided subsidies to banks and other private lenders. 
 First, the government provided insurance to reimburse lenders in the event a student defaulted. Second, it agreed to guarantee the lenders a certain level of profit so long they adhered to an interest rate cap. 
 While these terms were aimed at helping student borrowers, critics say the incentives are no longer necessary as the student loan business has matured, and have become little more than corporate handouts. 
 As it snapped up smaller rivals, Sallie Mae quickly became the industry's biggest player. Today, it originates nearly 23 percent of all student loans, and carries about $142 billion, or 27 percent of all student loans, on its books. 
 Sallie Mae also entered the debt collection business, which now contributes about 20 percent of its earnings. But so-called private loans ignited the company's growth. 
 With tuition costs soaring and financial aid budgets remaining flat, students increasingly turned to banks and other lenders to bridge the gap. Because these loans did not receive government subsidies, Sallie Mae and other private lenders could issue them at a higher interest rate. At an average rate of 10.5 percent, more one and half times the guaranteed loan cap, they were far more profitable, even if the potential losses could be larger. 
 A decade ago, Sallie Mae had no private loans. Today, it is the industry's largest player with as much as 40 percent of the market. While private loans make up about 15 percent of the company's portfolio, analysts say they generate 25 to 40 percent of its profits. 
 As a result, Sallie Mae's stock price surged. Since 1997, Sallie Mae shares have delivered a 435 percent total return, nearly three and a half times the 126 percent growth of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during the same period. 
 But recently, Sallie Mae's lending success has become a major liability. With the federal budget stretched, both Congress and the White House are looking to cut back the subsidies of guaranteed loan programs. Proposed legislation would probably reduce costs for student borrowers but would also chip away at lenders' profits. 
 In the House, Democratic lawmakers, led by Representative George Miller of California, voted to cut the federal loan interest rates in half over the next five years and force lenders to cover more of their losses. 
 In the Senate, Edward M. Kennedy, the influential Education Committee chairman, is expected to introduce similar legislation as part of a broader plan to steer more students to direct federal loans, which avoid private lenders altogether.
 Even Republican support is fading. In February, President Bush sided with the Democrats when he called for a sharp reduction of federal loan subsidies. The news sent Sallie Mae's shares down from $46.46 to as low as $40.75 until they rebounded last Friday on reports of a possible buyout. 
 And Senator Michael Enzi, the ranking Republican on the Education Committee, openly criticized Albert L. Lord, Sallie Mae's chairman, for selling more than $18.3 million of company stock just days before the president called for subsidy cuts. ''While the timing looked unfortunate, it was completely coincidental,'' said Mr. Joyce, the Sallie Mae spokesman. 
 The recent investigation by the New York State attorney general into Sallie Mae's financial relationships with colleges and universities has been a rallying call for the company's critics. 
 Last week, Sallie Mae agreed to pay $2 million and adopt a series of new practices, including barring gifts to university financial aid administrators and shutting down call centers that it runs for 19 colleges, to end the inquiry. A similar inquiry by the Education Department's inspector general in 2003 found that Sallie Mae made questionable inducements to get on a list of preferred lenders at one university. 
 Although the inquiries were limited to Sallie Mae's private loan business, it is ''creating momentum for reform of the entire system,'' said Luke Swarthout, a student aid advocate for the Public Interest Research Group, a watchdog organization.
 Sallie Mae, meanwhile, is battling back. While it has long supported Republicans, there are signs that its allegiances are changing. 
 During the 2006 election cycle, donations of $589,500 were split evenly between the two major parties, according to PoliticalMoneyLine. Now Sallie Mae's political spending is weighted heavily toward Democrats. 
 Given the financial and political uncertainty, several analysts suggest that Sallie Mae could ultimately win by losing the government's assistance. 
 If the government takes away part of its subsidies, Sallie Mae's lower operating costs still give it an advantage over smaller rivals. It also could move even further into the lucrative private loan market, which does not depend on federal support. These factors may be what the buyout groups are banking on with their bids. 
 ''Whatever Congress ends up passing will reduce profitability for lenders, but Sallie Mae will end up taking market share from smaller competitors,'' said Sameer Gokhale, an analyst for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

HEADLINE: Embattled Sallie Mae to Be Sold For $25 Billion, Negotiators Say

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
Sallie Mae agreed late last night to be sold to JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and two private equity firms for $25 billion, people involved in the negotiations said.
 The deal would move the nation's largest education lender, officially known as the SLM Corporation, into private control amid increasing turmoil for the company. The deal is expected to be announced today, these people said.
The other two private buyers are New York-based firms which have until now have kept a relatively low profile: J.C. Flowers & Company and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe. Together, the two firms will control 50.2 percent of the company, while the banks will own the rest. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, the two banks are going to provide Sallie Mae with up to $200 billion of backup financing to guarantee that the company can continue to make low-cost loans in the event that its access to capital, whether through the federal government or through private markets, becomes limited. 
 Under the terms of the deal, they said, the buyers will pay $60 a share in cash, which represents almost a 50 percent premium over Sallie Mae's battered share price before news of a potential buyout was reported in The New York Times last week. The share price has surged nearly 15 percent on the prospect that the company could be bought out.
 For Sallie Mae, which originates nearly 23 percent of student loans, this deal may be a salvation at a time when its business model has been under attack from several directions. All the uncertainty has caused Sallie Mae's stock to plunge more than 20 percent over the last year, making it a takeover target.
 The purchase of Sallie Mae represents the increasing willingness of private equity firms to step into highly regulated and scrutinized industries as they clamor for larger deals. Earlier this year, TXU, the largest power producer in Texas, agreed to be sold to a group of private equity firms in a deal valued at $45 billion. That deal, which faces significant government hurdles in Texas, is seen a test for how traditionally free-wheeling private equity firms are able to maneuver the tight corners of government regulation. The purchase of Sallie Mae is likely to raise similar scrutiny from legislators and consumer advocacy groups. 
 Sallie Mae is both a lender and a debt collector, making profits on both sides of its loans. Last year, the company earned $1.2 billion and generated a lot of cash that makes it attractive to private equity buyers. Even so, some Wall Street analysts believe that it is a poor candidate to be saddled with debt because its business relies on razor-thin interest margins and the use of derivatives to manage its exposure to interest-rate swings.
 The private equity firms are essentially placing a bet that the legislative debates will ultimately fall in Sallie Mae's favor, even if the outcome is likely to mean reduced federal subsidies. The theory is that Sallie Mae's larger scale and lower operating costs will still give it an advantage over its competitors. Currently, the company is carrying $142 billion in private and guaranteed loans on its books, about 27 percent of American student loans in the United States. 
 While 85 percent of its business is currently federally guaranteed, the company could also shift into the higher-interest and faster-growing market for private loans, which unlike guaranteed loans, is not subsidized by the government.

PERSON: Mollie Orshansky 

HEADLINE: Mollie Orshansky, Statistician, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Mollie Orshansky, a statistician and economist who in the 1960s developed the federal poverty line, a measurement that shaped decades of social policy and welfare programs, died Dec. 18 at her home in Manhattan, a family member said yesterday. She was 91. 
 The cause was cardiopulmonary arrest, said a niece, Eda F. Shapiro. She said the family had not immediately announced the death because of concerns over a long-running legal dispute in Washington over Miss Orshansky's estate. Miss Orshansky was buried a day after her death in Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Glendale, Queens, Ms. Shapiro said. 
Miss Orshansky, whose parents had known poverty in Ukraine, worked for the Social Security Administration from 1958 until she retired in 1982. She was ''one of a respected but mostly invisible cadre of women research professionals based at S.S.A. and other government agencies during the postwar years,'' the historian Alice O'Connor wrote in ''Poverty Knowledge,'' a 2001 history of poverty research.
 ''These women,'' Ms. O'Connor wrote, ''found job opportunities in federal government and other 'applied' endeavors when university jobs were largely closed off to them, although within government they were often clustered in research bureaus focusing on such traditional 'women's' concerns as social welfare, female labor force participation, families and children, and home economics. That experience as a career government statistician, a far cry from systems analysis, was what gave Orshansky the wholly unexpected designation as author of the government's official poverty line.''
 In 1963 and 1964, Miss Orshansky conducted the research that would become the basis of the poverty thresholds. She used the economy food plan -- the cheapest of four ''nutritionally adequate'' food plans developed by the Department of Agriculture -- and multiplied the dollar costs by roughly three to come up with a minimum cost-of-living estimate. (A household food consumption survey by the Agriculture Department had shown that, in 1955, families of three or more people spent about one-third of their after-tax cash income on food.) 
 Miss Orshansky devised more than 120 poverty thresholds, adjusting her calculations for family size and composition and rural-urban differences. She published her research in a seminal 1965 article in The Social Security Bulletin.
 President Lyndon B. Johnson had declared a War on Poverty, but there was no official definition of the problem at the time. In May 1965, the Office of Economic Opportunity, the federal agency charged with carrying out the antipoverty effort, adopted the ''Orshansky index'' as the yardstick to measure poverty.
 It was a use that Miss Orshansky herself had never intended. ''Orshansky developed the index as a research tool, not an instrument of policy of a criterion for determining eligibility for anti-poverty programs,'' the historian Michael B. Katz wrote in ''The Undeserving Poor,'' a 1989 history of antipoverty efforts.
 The federal poverty guideline -- $9,800 for a single person and $20,000 for a family of four in 2006 -- has long been criticized as understating the true extent of poverty. It also seems outdated. Food today makes up a much smaller proportion of household expenses than it did in the 1960s; the costs of housing, transportation, child care and health care have risen far more sharply.
 In 1995, a panel of the National Academy of Sciences urged several changes in calculating poverty, but no major changes have occurred, in part because they would have the politically unpopular effect of increasing the poverty rate, probably by a couple of percentage points, which would require an expansion of benefits.
 Miss Orshansky, a lifelong liberal Democrat, expressed sympathy with the criticisms of the poverty line. ''The best that can be said of the measure,'' she once wrote, ''is that at a time when it seemed useful, it was there.''
 Miss Orshansky was born Jan. 9, 1915, the third of six daughters of Samuel and Fannie Orshansky, Jewish immigrants who settled in the Bronx after leaving Ukraine. She graduated from Hunter College High School in Manhattan in 1931 and from Hunter College in 1935, with a degree in mathematics and statistics.
 Miss Orshansky did graduate work in economics and statistics in Washington. In 1939, she became a research clerk with the federal Children's Bureau, doing statistical analyses of child health, growth and nutrition. In 1942, as a statistician for the New York City Department of Health, she helped develop a survey on the incidence and treatment of pneumonia. Beginning in 1945, she spent 13 years at the Agriculture Department, collecting and analyzing records on household spending and food consumption.
 In the 1960s, at the request of the Justice Department, she testified at hearings that led to the elimination of poll taxes, which had been used to keep black Americans from voting. She said that a poll tax of $2, for example, would be enough to cost many poor families an entire day's meals. 
 Miss Orshansky received honors from the Social Security Administration, the American Statistical Association and the American Political Science Association. For most of her career, she lived in an apartment on the waterfront in Washington. She traveled extensively and loved to cook.
 In 2002, The Washington Post reported on a legal struggle over Miss Orshansky's care, which had begun after she was hospitalized in the fall of 2001. A niece, Jane M. Pollack, had taken Miss Orshansky to New York, but a judge in Washington, who had named a legal guardian for Miss Orshansky, tried to compel her to return to Washington, arguing that her family had not demonstrated that they could adequately care for her. 
 On Aug. 15, 2002, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the judge had abused her authority and ignored Miss Orshansky's wishes to live with her family in New York. The appeals court also canceled the appointment of the guardian. Other legal issues remain unresolved, said her niece Ms. Shapiro of Manhattan. 
 In addition to several nieces, Miss Orshansky is survived by a sister, Sarah Pollack of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Chasing a Dream Made of Waste

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Matthew L. Wald reported from Jennings, La., and Alexei Barrionuevo from Chicago.

DATELINE: JENNINGS, La. 

 BODY:
The sun shone brightly on the crowd gathered at the rusting old oil refinery here, as company officials showed off diagrams explaining how they planned to turn weeds and agricultural wastes into car fuel. 
 Government officials gave optimistic speeches. In the background, workers prepared a new network of pipes, tanks and conveyor belts.
That was in October 1998, when ethanol from crop wastes seemed to be just around the corner.
 It still is. Last February, company officials gathered here once again, to break ground on a plant designed to make ethanol by yet another method. 
 At the time of the first ceremony, the Energy Department was predicting that ethanol produced from cellulosic waste would be in the market by about 2009 in the same volume as ethanol from the conventional source, corn.
 But no company has yet been able to produce ethanol from cellulose in mass quantities that are priced competitively with corn-based ethanol. And without the cellulosic ethanol, the national goal for ethanol production will be impossible to reach.
 ''Producing cellulosic ethanol is clearly more difficult than we thought in the 1990s,'' said Dan W. Reicher, who was assistant secretary of energy efficiency and renewable energy at the time of the first ceremony and who spoke here then. 
 To be sure, swarms of innovators, venture capitalists and government officials are optimistic. Over the last year, money has begun to pour in from all corners -- government, private foundations, venture capitalists and Wall Street -- to sort out the myriad production problems preventing cellulosic ethanol from becoming a reality. And recent advances in gene sequencing have raised hopes for a breakthrough in mass producing the enzymes needed to do the work. 
 If making the technology work to produce ethanol from cellulose was important in the 1990s, it is even more critical now. Because of growing concerns about oil imports and climate change, Mr. Reicher said, ''it is essential that we figure this out, and fast.'' 
 Mounting concerns over excessive demands for corn as both food and fuel only add to the urgency. In January, President Bush set a goal of producing 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels, probably mostly ethanol, by 2017.
 But the more than six billion gallons of ethanol that will be produced this year have already helped push corn to its highest price in years, raising the cost of everything from tortillas to chicken feed. Poor people in Mexico have protested against the higher prices, and now China and India are starting to suffer from food inflation. 
 So why has no one figured out a way to make ethanol from materials like the sugar cane wastes engineers are working with here?
 In fact, engineers at several companies have done that -- but only at the lab level. One company, Iogen, has a pilot plant running in Ottawa and hopes to build a larger operation soon. 
 Abengoa, a Spanish company, says it plans to open a plant in northern Spain late this year, and wants to build a factory in Kansas. Broin Companies, of Sioux Falls, S.D., is planning to expand a corn ethanol plant in Emmetsburg, Iowa, to use cellulose as well. 
 But everyone is still struggling to develop a method that is cost competitive with corn ethanol -- not to mention competing with gasoline and other fuels from oil without subsidies. 
 The pilot plant that opened here in 1998, after the first ceremony, ''worked like a charm,'' said Russell Heissner, a biofuels expert at Celunol, the company building the Jennings plant. But Celunol, then called BC International, shut it after a few months because of a lack of money and because it could not figure out how to turn the process into a commercial-scale project.
 Now the company is building a much larger plant to tackle another part of the cellulosic puzzle.
 The broad concept is the same everywhere. Yeast is used to turn sugar into alcohol, a process learned thousands of years ago. The easiest way to get sugar is from sugar cane. Corn provides carbohydrates, long chains of starch that are easily broken into sugars.
 Mr. Heissner is hopeful that stems, stalks, wood chips and other materials will replace the corn. The founding brew master at Harpoon, a Boston beer brand, Mr. Heissner later designed and built microbreweries and pubs.
 That experience is relevant. Beer is made from barley, a seed, or cereal grain, like corn. It is exposed to warmth and moisture that resemble the conditions for germination, and the barley begins to produce an enzyme that converts its starch into sugar. The brew master roasts the barley to kill the plant, but the enzyme continues to convert the starch to sugar. Hops are added for flavor, and then yeast is added to convert the sugar to alcohol. 
 Cellulose is also made up partly of sugars, but they are linked tightly in a more complicated chain. Breaking them up requires several enzymes. Most processes start with using steam and sulfuric acid on the feedstock, which can be corn stems and leaves, switch grass, wood chips -- or bagasse, the material left when sugar cane is processed and which is being used here in Jennings.
 Manufacturers rely on a variety of organisms to make the necessary enzymes. They are the product of gene splicing, turning out enzymes in quantities far greater than any natural organism would.
 Unlocking the sugar represents a gold mine. Mark Emalfarb, the president and chief executive of another competitor, Dyadic, said corn now makes up about half the price of corn ethanol, while some cellulosic materials are free, beyond the cost to haul them to a factory.
 But the enzymes needed to break corn starch into sugar are cheap, costing 3 to 5 cents a gallon of ethanol. His goal for the enzymes that work on cellulose is 10 cents a gallon, but it does not appear that anyone has gotten the cost anywhere near that low yet.
 ''Some people are still underestimating how difficult it is going to be,'' Mr. Emalfarb said.
 The Energy Department has set a goal of bringing down the overall cost to produce cellulosic ethanol to $1.07 a gallon by 2012. That is less than half the cost of producing it now and lower than the current cost of about $1.50 a gallon for corn-based ethanol. 
 ''Anybody's number is just basically a guess,'' said Brent Erickson, executive vice president at the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington. ''Until we get these plants built, we aren't going to know what the cost is.''
 The race to commercialize cellulosic ethanol has been helped by the recent flood of investment from public and private sources.
 The Energy Department has devoted $726 million for renewable energy projects this year, including wind and solar energy. It recently awarded grants totaling $385 million over four years to six companies working on cellulosic ethanol plants. The Agriculture Department is seeking to increase its bio-energy financing to $161 million from $122 million, which would include $21 million in loan guarantees for cellulosic plants. 
 Venture capital firms, Wall Street banks and even oil companies have invested about $200 million in the last six months alone.''There is nothing in the last several decades that has generated such private sector enthusiasm and investment,'' said Keith Collins, the Agriculture Department's chief economist.
 The investment is risky but the potential benefits are enormous. A cellulosic ethanol process would raise the ethanol yields from sugar cane by about one-third an acre by using parts of the sugar plant that are now thrown away as waste. For corn wastes, the number is similar.
 The cellulosic process also promises to use less energy than corn-based ethanol. And it can work on material that is not currently considered a crop, like switch grass or wood chips left over from paper making.
 In Louisiana, Celunol is experimenting with an aboriginal sugar cane that grew 200 years ago, before farmers started selectively breeding for the varieties with more sugar. Native to the local environment, ''it doesn't need fertilizer and it grows everywhere, like weeds,'' said Matthew Gray, a research engineer with the company.
 Mr. Heissner, who studied viniculture and enology at the University of California, Davis, said he was happy to move from microbreweries to vehicle fuel, which would be a much bigger business, he predicted.
 Andrew Karsner, the current assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable fuels, said that he agreed. The original Jennings project, despite its earlier failures, was simply ''well ahead of the killer wave that is here with us now.'' The Energy Challenge

HEADLINE: Computer Science Takes Steps To Bring Women to the Fold

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
For decades, undergraduate women have been moving in ever greater numbers into science and engineering departments at American universities. Yet even as they approach or exceed enrollment parity in mathematics, biology and other fields, there is one area in which their presence relative to men is static or even shrinking: computer science. 
 Women received about 38 percent of the computer science bachelor's degrees awarded in the United States in 1985, the peak year, but in 2003, the figure was only about 28 percent, according to the National Science Foundation.
 At universities that also offer graduate degrees in computer science, only 17 percent of the field's bachelor's degrees in the 2003-4 academic year went to women, according to the Taulbee Survey, conducted annually by an organization for computer science research. 
 Since then, many in the field say, the situation has worsened. They say computing is the only realm of science or technology in which women are consistently giving ground. They also worry that the number of women is dropping in graduate programs and in industry.
 They are concerned about this trend, they say, not just because they want to see young women share the field's challenges and rewards, but also because they regard the relative absence of women as a troubling indicator for American computer science generally -- and for the economic competitiveness that depends on it.
 ''Women are the canaries in the coal mine,'' Lenore Blum, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, told an audience at Harvard University in March, in a talk on this ''crisis'' in computer science. Factors driving women away will eventually drive men away as well, she and others say. 
 These experts play down the two explanations most often offered for flagging enrollment: the dot-com bust and the movement of high-tech jobs offshore.
 ''People think there are no jobs, but that is not true,'' said Jan Cuny, a computer scientist at the University of Oregon who directs a National Science Foundation program to broaden participation in computer science. ''There are more people involved in computer science now than at the height of the dot-com boom.'' 
 And there is widespread misunderstanding about jobs moving abroad, said Ed Lazowska, a computer scientist at the University of Washington. Companies may establish installations overseas to meet local licensing requirements or in hopes of influencing regulations, he said, ''but the truth is when companies offshore they are more or less doing it for access to talent.''
 ''Cheap labor is not high on the list,'' Dr. Lazowska said. ''It is access to talent.''
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for computer scientists in the United States will only increase in coming years, Dr. Cuny said. ''If you look at the demographics of the country, if we are not going to get our new professionals from women and minorities and persons with disabilities, we are not going to have enough.'' 
 The big problems, these and other experts say, are prevailing images of what computer science is and who can do it.
 ''The nerd factor is huge,'' Dr. Cuny said. According to a 2005 report by the National Center for Women and Information Technology, an academic-industry collaborative formed to address the issue, when high school girls think of computer scientists they think of geeks, pocket protectors, isolated cubicles and a lifetime of staring into a screen writing computer code. 
 This image discourages members of both sexes, but the problem seems to be more prevalent among women. ''They think of it as programming,'' Dr. Cuny said. ''They don't think of it as revolutionizing the way we are going to do medicine or create synthetic molecules or study our impact on the climate of the earth.''
 Like others in the field, Dr. Cuny speaks almost lyrically about the intellectual challenge of applying the study of cognition and the tools of computation to medicine, ecology, law, chemistry -- virtually any kind of human endeavor. 
 ''The use of computers in modern life is totally ubiquitous,'' said Barbara G. Ryder, a professor of computer science at Rutgers University. ''So there are niches all over for people who understand what the technology can do and also for people who want to advance the technology. 
 ''But students don't see that,'' Dr. Ryder said. ''And it seems to be happening more with the women than with the men.''
 The Advanced Placement high school course in computer science may be part of the problem, according to Dr. Cuny. ''The AP computer course is a disaster,'' she said. ''It teaches Java programming, which is very appealing to a lot of people, but not to others. It doesn't teach what you can do with computers.'' 
 She and others think the course needs to be redesigned. 
 But Dr. Lazowska said the criticism was somewhat unfair, given that introductory college computer courses, which the AP course is designed to replace, typically emphasize programming as well.
 At one time, said Barbara Grosz, a computer scientist and dean of sciences at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies at Harvard, students entered college with little idea of what computer science involved, ''so they would try it and find out how much fun and how interesting it was, women included.'' 
 Now, though, she said in an e-mail message, ''they get the wrong idea in high school and we never see them to correct the misperception.''
 Moving emphasis away from programming proficiency was a key to the success of programs Dr. Blum and her colleagues at Carnegie Mellon instituted to draw more women into computer science. At one time, she said, admission to the program depended on high overall achievement and programming experience. The criteria now, she said, are high overall achievement and broad interests, diverse perspectives and whether applicants seem to have potential to be future leaders.
 ''In this more balanced environment, the men and women were more alike than different,'' she said. ''Some women are hackers and some men are hackers, and some women love applications and some men love applications.''
 With the changes at Carnegie Mellon, women now make up almost 40 percent of computer science enrollees, up from 8 percent, Dr. Blum said. 
 There has been backlash, she said, including ''calls from outraged parents saying, 'My son has three patents, how come he did not get into Carnegie Mellon?' '' 
 Others accuse her and her colleagues of lowering standards. ''Well, we would not have success if we did,'' she said.
 Dr. Lazowska and Dr. Blum, with colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Google, are working on materials that high school teachers can use to tell students about the challenges and opportunities of computer science. They are developing them for teachers of math, science and English because, as Dr. Lazowska put it, ''many young women have opted out of the field before they even get to computer science'' in high school.
 He and his colleagues at the University of Washington (which never had a programming requirement, he said) have produced a Web page for prospective students with an explicit goal of breaking stereotypes about computer science and demonstrating that computer scientists ''work in a broad range of interesting fields'' -- everything from designing prosthetics to devising new ways to fight forest fires. 
 The people on the page's ''day in the life'' feature are Erin, Kiera, Crystal, Tessaand Siobhan -- all women. ''That was deliberate,'' he said, adding that women will make up 23 percent of the prospective computer science majors next year.
 Other efforts are under way elsewhere. At Brown University, for example, an organization called Women in Computer Science @Brown runs the Artemis Project, which brings ninth-grade girls from schools in Providence, R.I., to the university campus for five weeks each summer. Its goal is to help the girls learn both concrete computer skills and abstract computer science concepts ''in a positive and encouraging environment.'' 
 Dr. Ryder of Rutgers, with colleagues at other universities, has a grant from the science foundation to develop Web materials and give workshops for teachers on different ways to teach computer science. ''There is a place for different kinds of learning,'' she said.
 There are some who argue that it does not matter if computer science, as a discipline, withers a bit. They say fields that rely on computer science -- which is to say, virtually all fields -- will develop their own expertise in-house, so to speak, as scientists and engineers accumulate the skills they need, almost ad hoc, as they do their research.
 But that is not the way for computer science as a whole to advance, Dr. Blum told her Harvard audience. 
 Though there needs to be ''synergy between theory and application domains,'' Dr. Blum said, computer science needs ''talent at the core looking for innovation at the core.'' 
 Others worry that the field cannot grow to its potential if it lacks women's perspective. ''Does it matter that women's outlook is missing? I think it does,'' Dr. Cuny said. ''Technology is pervasive in society, and its impact is only going to increase. Shouldn't everyone have a voice in shaping the technology?''
 For her part, Dr. Ryder said that after working for decades as computer scientists, she and other women in the field were sad not to see more young women joining them. ''We're senior now, and we don't see who is coming along,'' Dr. Ryder said. ''For me, this is a professional and a personal frustration.''

HEADLINE: AARP Says It Will Become Major Medicare Insurer While Remaining a Consumer Lobby

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16 

 BODY:
AARP, the lobby for older Americans, announced Monday that it would become a major participant in the nation's health insurance market, offering a health maintenance organization to Medicare recipients and several other products to people 50 to 64 years old. 
 The products for people under 65 include a managed care plan, known as a preferred provider organization, and a high-deductible insurance policy that could be used with a health savings account. 
When the new coverage becomes available next year, AARP will be the largest provider of private insurance to Medicare recipients. In addition to the new H.M.O., AARP will continue providing prescription drug coverage and policies to supplement Medicare, known as Medigap coverage.
 William D. Novelli, the chief executive of AARP, said, ''In launching these initiatives, we are driven by our mission to create a healthier America.'' 
 The group also said it would use its leverage to reshape the health insurance market. The organization has 38 million members, and Mr. Novelli said it hoped to have 50 million by 2011. 
 The new Medicare product will be marketed with UnitedHealth Group. Policies for people under 65 will carry the AARP name and will be marketed with Aetna.
 Revenues and royalties from the sale of goods and services have, for many years, accounted for a substantial part of AARP's income. AARP officials insisted that its financial interests do not affect the positions it takes on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and dozens of other issues on which it lobbies and litigates. 
 Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health, welcomed AARP executives to the Medicare managed care market. ''If they provide quality care at a fair price,'' Mr. Stark said in an interview, ''they could be a wonderful addition.''
 But Judith A. Stein, director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group that counsels people on Medicare, said, ''The new arrangements with insurance companies create a tremendous number of potential conflicts for AARP, which is a powerhouse, perceived as the most important voice for older people.''
 The role of private insurers in Medicare is one of the most hotly debated issues in American health policy. In general, Republicans want to expand the role of private insurers like UnitedHealth and Aetna, while Democrats want to limit the role of private entities.
 Ms. Stein and her organization work closely with AARP.
 ''AARP will not be perceived as a truly independent advocate on Medicare if it's making hefty profits by selling insurance products that provide Medicare coverage,'' Ms. Stein said. ''AARP's role in this market could give a big boost to the privatization of Medicare.'' 
 AARP has opposed efforts to privatize Medicare or Social Security.
 Dawn M. Sweeney, president of AARP Services Inc., the tax-paying business unit of AARP, said, ''We will use our collective market power to negotiate'' competitive prices for the new health insurance products. 
 AARP also said it would use $500 million of insurance sales revenue over the next decade to help people navigate the health care system, with a new counseling service. 
 Payments to UnitedHealth and Aetna will be linked to their performance in improving the health of subscribers, including members of minorities, Mr. Novelli said. The new plans will coordinate care for people with chronic conditions and will develop special programs to treat people with depression. AARP will measure how frequently the companies deliver recommended treatments to people with diabetes, hip fractures and other conditions.
 Insurers typically sign one-year contracts with Medicare. Ms. Sweeney said AARP's H.M.O. was ''guaranteed to be in the Medicare marketplace for two years,'' though premiums and co-payments could change after the first year.
 People ages 50 to 64 often find that health insurance is unavailable or unaffordable when they try to buy it on their own. AARP said its underwriting practices would be less stringent than those of many commercial insurers, but it reserved the right to deny coverage to some sick people ages 50 to 64.
 To guarantee issuance of a policy to every applicant in that age group is ''just not economically feasible,'' Ms. Sweeney said.
 About seven million people currently have health insurance of various types, mainly drug coverage or Medigap policies, carrying the AARP brand name. With the new products, Ms. Sweeney estimated, the number will double to 14 million by 2014.

HEADLINE: The Biggest Little-Noticed Hazard

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
On his travels to almost 100 countries, Barry Goldsmith, a creator of tours for General Tours, says he has worried about risks like terrorism, crime and infectious disease. But one trumps all the others.
 ''It's traffic accidents,'' Mr. Goldsmith said.
Road accidents are ''the largest cause of nonnatural death among U.S. citizens overseas,'' said Betsy L. Anderson, a senior consular official at the State Department. 
 Bella Dinh-Zarr, the North American director of Make Roads Safe, a nonprofit organization that promotes global road safety, said that road crashes were ''the most unrecognized and one of the biggest threats'' to business travelers. It is a growing public health problem as more people travel to developing nations, she said. Preventive measures like vaccines, careful eating and drinking bottled water are common, but similar tactics for road safety are usually ignored.
 Mr. Goldsmith credits his good road safety record to a few simple steps: becoming familiar with rental cars by driving around the lot; checking that seat belts are functioning and that a car is equipped with air bags; and making sure that the brakes, lights and windshield wipers work, ''especially in monsoon India.'' He plans his route ahead of time, gets the latest maps and knows the metric system.
 He was once stopped by a policeman on a French highway for going too slowly, a potentially dangerous mistake. He said he was thinking in miles, not kilometers. 
 Road crashes are a worldwide problem, and are expected to rise. ''Each year 1.2 million people die in road accidents, and 20 to 50 million are injured and survive, often with disabilities for the rest of their lives,'' said Dr. Etienne Krug, the director of the department of injuries and violence prevention at the World Health Organization. The figures are believed to be underreported. 
 Ninety percent of the fatalities are in low- to middle-income countries, Dr. Krug said, in large part because more vehicles are on the road, vehicles and roads are poorly maintained and regulation, enforcement and driver's education are weak. Travelers from outside a country are particularly vulnerable because they lack familiarity with roads, local laws and customs.
 Next week, the United Nations will observe its first Global Road Safety Week.
 William Halliday, director of global security at the Marsh & McLennan Companies, said road safety had traditionally been overlooked. ''People take it for granted because they are familiar with driving and taking taxis,'' he said. ''But things are radically different, country to country. It's important not to make assumptions.''
 Mr. Halliday said the company began using Road Travel Reports several years ago. The reports, produced by the Association for Safe International Road Travel, detail road conditions, dangerous highways to avoid, driver behavior and police enforcement for more than 120 countries. 
 Rochelle Sobel, founder of the nonprofit organization that produces the reports, said, ''It is important to not only know the laws, but the road culture before you go.'' She started the association, based in Potomac, Md., after her son Aron died in a bus crash in Turkey where he was working in a local hospital, two weeks before he was to graduate from medical school. 
 ''A stop sign is meaningless, or speed limits are meaningless in some countries,'' Ms. Sobel said. ''If you assume it is safe for people to cross certain streets in some areas of Egypt and Kenya, you are making a potentially fatal mistake.'' 
 Ms. Sobel and others advise against driving at night. They also note that headlights are often turned off to save batteries -- a false economy since the battery would not drain with the engine running properly -- in many countries, particularly in rural areas. 
 Lack of enforcement and bribery are common in many countries. 
 ''People don't pay much attention to the rules,'' said Mitchell Silk, a partner in the New York office of Allen & Overy, an international legal practice. For more than 20 years, he worked off and on in China, where road accident fatalities are among the highest in the world. Mr. Silk recalled one instance when a driver taking him to the airport was speeding. They were pulled over by the police, and the driver, Mr. Silk recounted, said, ''Look, I'm a retired army officer and my boss is the provincial power bureau chief.'' The driver was not ticketed. 
 Mr. Goldsmith, the tour creator, said he had forgotten his license on a business trip to Myanmar several years ago, but the hotel staff helped him rent a car anyway. ''Twenty bucks cleared it up,'' he said. 
 Some driving problems are imported. 
 ''Americans are among the most polite drivers in the world,'' but it gets them in trouble, said Eddie Wren, who spent 14 years as a police officer in Britain, mostly serving as a traffic patrol officer, before coming to the United States. Mr. Wren is the co-founder and president of Advanced Drivers of America, a company that teaches safe driving, and he works with many corporations. 
 Americans are reluctant to use horns, but horns can be effective in reducing crashes, Mr. Wren said. 
 Americans also typically turn at red lights, which many countries do not allow, and they maneuver poorly in traffic circles, which are common overseas, Mr. Wren said. 
 The State Department has a road safety page (http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/safety/safety--1179.html) that includes links to consular information sheets for specific countries, advice on contacting foreign embassies and consulates for driving requirements, how to get an international driving permit, and the importance of checking insurance coverage before departure. In general, American auto insurance does not extend abroad.
 Paula Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Hertz Corporation, said Americans commonly assumed ''that their credit card covers their insurance, which often isn't the case.'' 
 Medical and emergency evacuation insurance are frequently overlooked. ''In some countries, injured victims never reach a hospital,'' said David A. Sleet, a behavioral scientist at the injury center of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 But no matter how many preventive measures individuals take, global road safety will require greater efforts, experts say.
 ''Safety costs money,'' said Mary Pat McKay, an emergency physician at the George Washington University Medical Center. In many countries with a high rate of traffic collisions, she said, issues like H.I.V. and malaria compete for scarce funds. 
 ''If you want people to stop at a red light,'' she said, ''you have to have a red light.''

HEADLINE: Counting the Poor

 BODY:
It's not official, but it's virtually indisputable. Poverty in America is much more widespread than has been previously acknowledged. 
 According to the Census Bureau, nearly 37 million Americans -- 12.6 percent of the population -- were living in poverty in 2005. That means that four years into an economic expansion, the percentage of Americans defined as poor was higher than at the bottom of the last recession in late 2001, when it was 11.7 percent. But that's not the worst of it. Recently, the bureau released 12 alternative measures of poverty, and all but one are higher than the official rate. 
The alternative that hews most closely to the measurement criteria recommended by the National Academy of Sciences yields a 2005 poverty rate of 14.1 percent. That works out to 41.3 million poor Americans, 4.4 million more than were officially counted. Those higher figures indicate that millions of needy Americans are not getting government services linked to official poverty levels. 
 The census's official measure basically looks only at whether a family has enough pretax income, plus cash benefits from the government, to pay for bare necessities. The academy's criteria called for adding in the value of noncash government benefits like food stamps, and for subtracting expenses like out-of-pocket medical costs and work-related outlays, including child care expenses. 
 They also take into account geographical differences in the cost of living and the fact that poverty is relative. To be accurate, a poverty gauge cannot simply measure a family's ability (or lack thereof) to subsist. It must also capture the extent to which the poor cannot afford the requisites of modern life. 
 All told, under the official measure, the poverty line for a family with two parents and two children is $19,806. Under the alternative it's $22,841. 
 Lawmakers must listen to what the new numbers are telling them and, as a first step, instruct the Census Bureau to adopt the academy's more realistic criteria. They must also realize that improvements in antipoverty programs -- such as expanding the earned income tax credit for the working poor and providing better early education -- are some of the best investments the nation can make.

HEADLINE: Hopes for a Renaissance After Exodus in St. Louis

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
Cities, like most living things, have sensitive spots. Here in the old ''Gateway to the West,'' the subject of population loss is one of the touchiest.
 From a peak of nearly 860,000 residents in 1950, St. Louis had lost more than half a million people by 2000, a depopulation not unlike the devastating postwar exodus from Detroit. Since the 2000 census, St. Louis has kept shrinking, the Census Bureau estimates, while most old cities have added people.
Population is a critical indicator of any city's health, but the sinking numbers here are particularly unwelcome as the city has spiraled from one woe to the next.
 In the past few months, the public schools were stripped of accreditation and taken over by the state; the city was designated the most dangerous in the country in a national crime survey; and 15 police officers and supervisors were disciplined for giving World Series tickets seized from scalpers to friends and family. 
 ''These things are absolutely not helpful,'' said John Haul, an assistant professor of architecture at Washington University who has been involved in numerous municipal planning projects. ''We have to redevelop the city regardless; this just makes it harder.''
 City officials question the accuracy of the census calculations and suggest the city has turned the corner. Their optimism is based on a flurry of downtown development since 2000, including hundreds of loft condominiums, boutiques and restaurants.
 ''We're actually doing very well,'' said Rollin B. Stanley, director of the city's planning and urban design agency, which puts the population at 354,000, about 6,000 higher than the Census Bureau.
 But the effort to put a positive spin on the population debate -- and with it, the hope for a long-awaited renaissance -- comes against a difficult backdrop.
 In March, the Missouri State Board of Education took over the public schools for consistently poor performance. Teachers and parents, who largely opposed the takeover, said the district had been starved for resources to care for some of the neediest students in the country.
 ''Without financial and human resources, we're set up to fail,'' said Chip Clatto, an assistant principal at a school on the north side. ''I'm wondering if people on the outside realize that not only are we trying to educate these kids, we're trying to turn them into citizens when their society has failed them.''
 Signs of a looming disaster for the district of 35,000 students, mostly poor and black, had been clear for years. In 2004, a national education advocacy group found that only 5 percent of 11th graders in city schools were proficient in reading.
 ''They've had a revolving door in and out of the superintendent's office for some time,'' said Michael Casserly, the executive director of the group, Great City Schools. ''They've had a lot of turmoil, and it's made it almost impossible for the system to gain any momentum.''
 In October, St. Louis was identified as ''America's most dangerous city'' by a private research firm that publishes an annual crime ranking. Though city officials and some experts criticized the ranking as simplistic, aggravated assaults with guns, considered one of the best gauges of a city's level of violence, were up more than 30 percent over the past two years, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.
 ''A few people are responsible for most of the crime, and we're targeting those people,'' said Barbara A. Geisman, the city's director of development. ''The vast majority of St. Louis is as safe as any place in the suburbs.''
 But recently there was more bad news from law enforcement in the case of the World Series tickets. One of the best moments of civic pride in recent years -- the Cardinals' victory last fall -- was tainted. Chief Joe Mokwa recommended that 8 of the 15 officers be suspended for two weeks and be reduced in rank for a minimum of one year.
 ''They're not thieves,'' Mr. Mokwa said when announcing the punishment. ''They made a mistake.''
 Even the weather got the better of the city last summer, when a storm knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of customers for more than a week. Tempers flared as the power company was unable to restore service quickly, with utility workers from as far away as Arizona ultimately enlisted to help.
 Rebuilding, and rebranding, St. Louis when some basic quality of life indicators point in the wrong direction has not been easy. And while the city's population has shrunk, its sprawling suburbs have grown. The metropolitan area's population is more than 2.6 million. 
 ''This is a city that at one point was the fourth largest in the United States,'' said Richard B. Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. ''The distance we've fallen from the status of being a major national city does affect St. Louisans.''
 The city has retained attractions like Forest Park, excellent universities and a vibrant arts scene. But vast sections of North St. Louis show what happens when people leave town in big numbers: What is left is a shell of a city, boarded up, rotting, populated by the most impoverished. Residents, mostly black, are still fleeing these parts of town. 
 For years, experts said, as the population dwindled, there was no sense of urgency about how the city could come back. Now there is. Last year, for instance, the city developed a new land use plan for the first time since 1947. And a state tax credit program has been spurring investment in some forgotten parts of the city.
 Some neighborhoods, like Lafayette Park, are even thriving.
 Since 1999, according to the Downtown St. Louis Partnership, a civic group, 62 historic buildings have been redeveloped for residences and businesses, 12 are currently being remodeled and about 20 conversions are in the planning stages. And according to the city, the two-square-mile downtown area has over 9,000 residents -- 6,300 more than in 2000.
 ''There's a young middle-class movement beginning,'' said James Neal Primm, a retired professor and author of ''Lion of the Valley,'' an extensive history of St. Louis. ''My overall reaction is that there should be a lot more. But there is something going on.''
 Dr. Primm's grandson, Chris Termini, 29, lives in one of the new downtown lofts, in an area that was unfit for comfortable living just 10 years ago. At night, the sidewalk cafes are full. Joggers pass; dog walkers idle.
 ''We walk everywhere for food and entertainment,'' Mr. Termini said. ''It's great.''
 Mr. Stanley, the city planner, had all this in mind when he challenged the Census Bureau's 2003 population estimate. St. Louis won that dispute, successfully arguing that it did not lose 17,000 people between 2000 and 2003 -- rather 50. ''That's five-zero,'' said Mr. Stanley, a Canadian by birth with great love for St. Louis.
 This year, he said he had a feeling that the bureau would say St. Louis was down again. And it did, giving the city an estimated population of 347,180 -- slightly less than the 2000 population count of 348,200.
 That is just plain wrong, Mr. Stanley said, adding that his challenge of the estimate is ready to go. 
 Win or lose, officials will probably not know with any certainty who lives in St. Louis until the next national count, in 2010, because interim figures are based on less accurate estimates.
 ''We have to wait,'' Professor Rosenfeld said. ''I think it's clear that the rate of decline we've seen through the last decades is not going to continue. The questionis whether we'll see a net increase.'' 
 He added, ''Sensitive subject.''

HEADLINE: Managers Use Hedge Funds As Big I.R.A.'s

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Many Americans squirrel away as much as they can into retirement investment accounts like 401(k)s and I.R.A.'s that allow them to compound their earnings tax free. The accounts also reduce what they owe when tax day rolls around. For the average person, however, the government strictly limits the contributions to about $20,000 a year. 
 And then there are people who work at hedge funds.
A lot of the hedge fund managers earning the astronomical paychecks making headlines these days are able to postpone paying taxes on much of that income for 10 years or more. 
 The key to the hedge fund tax boon is that many managers of these lightly regulated private pools of capital have the ability to earn the bulk of their compensation offshore and invest it in their funds, where it grows tax-free. 
 ''If you could compound your compensation tax-free, why wouldn't you?'' asked Stewart Massey, founding partner of Massey & Quick, a consulting firm. 
 Few people know the power of compounding better than hedge fund managers. Consider the following calculation done by Financial Engines, a financial advisory and portfolio management firm: A hedge fund manager makes $10 million in fees and defers it for five years, earning a return of 10 percent a year. When he pays taxes at the end, he walks away with $10.5 million. Another manager who makes the same $10 million pays his taxes immediately. He still earns 10 percent on what's left, but over the same period he accumulates just $8.9 million. 
 Elevate the comparison to $130 million, the minimum take-home pay needed to make it on Alpha magazine's list of the 25 highest-paid hedge fund managers: the first manager receives $136.1 million; the second $115.8 million. 
 This closely guarded arrangement is completely legal; similar, but less generous deferrals have been commonly used by corporate executives for years. But thanks to the peculiarities of the structure of hedge funds and their enormous growth, the tax-deferred sums that hedge fund managers earn may be far outpacing even the compensation of the most well-paid corporate chieftains.
 One of the flagship funds at Citadel, a $13.5 billion hedge fund, for example, has deferred at least $1.7 billion since it was founded at the end of 1990. And that does not count what might have been taken out already. Citadel declined to comment.
 ''We pile advantage on advantage for these managers and there doesn't seem to be any economically logical basis for it,'' said John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group. ''It's a very well-gilded lily to allow these tax deferrals.''
 This tax advantage is now coming under scrutiny in Washington, where Congress is looking for ways to reduce the budget deficit, to pay for the Iraq war and to help cover the exploding retirement and health care costs of aging baby boomers. 
 For now, many hedge fund managers are enjoying not only extraordinary profits but the extra benefit of a system almost encouraging them to set up offshore accounts.
 Most hedge funds are private partnerships; managers are usually paid 2 percent of the money they manage plus 20 percent of the profits the partnership earns. If the fund operates in the United States, any deferral of the pay of the managers means investors lose the tax deduction associated with the compensation expense. As a result, deferred compensation in domestic funds is very uncommon.
 By setting up an offshore fund, though, hedge fund managers avoid socking their investors with extra taxes. At the same time, it serves to attract tax-exempt investors like pension funds and endowments, as well as foreign investors, two of the most active groups investing in hedge funds today.
 Once the offshore fund is established, managers can elect to have much of their compensation earned from the offshore fund deferred back into the fund, allowing it to grow tax-free until it is taken out. Managers have to decide ahead of time how much they will defer and they are required to follow a set formula for receiving the money. At the end of the deferral period, they pay ordinary income taxes. 
 There are downsides to this arrangement. For one, the money cannot be spent right away, which can be unfortunate for those looking to add to, say, their antique car collection. Moreover, the money is at risk.
 Unlike 401(k)s and other so-called qualified plans, deferred compensation is not set aside for the individual but becomes a corporate liability. If the fund goes belly up, the deferred compensation is subject to claims from creditors. 
 ''When someone defers money, the reason it's not taxable to them is it's not their money,'' said Michael G. Tannenbaum, a lawyer with Tannenbaum Helpern Syracuse & Hirschtritt. ''It represents a debt in favor of that employee by the company.'' 
 Many forces have worked to make hedge funds, as well as private equity funds -- both called alternative investments -- the darlings of the investment world. Pension funds are drawn to the promise of greater returns with supposedly fewer risks. Low interest rates and widely available financing have fueled a buyout boom largely run on demand from hedge funds for the debt issued to make the buyouts work. 
 But perhaps most notable about the spectacular growth is the huge compensation successful managers receive. Consider a relatively modest fund with $500 million in assets that posts a 16 percent return -- on par with the market in 2006. The typical handful or fewer of professionals running the fund would share a management fee of $10 million, plus $16 million in ''incentive compensation.''
 A result is a new class of financial giants. The vast sums of money flowing to a relatively small number of individuals have inspired a vast interest in minimizing taxes. 
 ''As long as you stay on the right side of the bright line, all forms of tax avoidance are very smart,'' said Mark Yusko, president of Morgan Creek Capital Management, an investment advisory firm. ''People pay good money for that.'' 
 Offshore deferral arrangements have been around for decades. But in 2004, Congress passed the American Jobs Creation Act, and while a provision known as 409(a) restricted some practices, it also served to highlight their advantages.
 ''I don't think 409(a) increased the number of deferrals, but it probably made more comfortable the arrangement because it codified what was going on,'' Mr. Tannenbaum said. 
 Indeed, deferred-compensation agreements have continued to thrive under the new regulations. Mr. Massey, the consultant, estimates that 100 percent of managers do it; other investors err on the side of ''most.'' 
 The rationale for doing so is evident, especially as the funds and the compensation get bigger. An increase in the use of leverage -- borrowed money to increase bets -- has translated to outsize returns, and whopping pay packages, much of them comfortably multiplying in value offshore. 
 ''These plans are used more and more in this market, especially with leveraged hedge funds because the more leveraged the fund, the bigger the profit component and the more valuable the deferral of the compensation,'' said Mark J. Weinstein, a partner at Hogan & Hartson. 
 Now, Congress is taking a closer look. An amendment limiting deferred compensation to no more than $1 million or the average of the previous five years' income was added to the Senate version of the minimum wage bill. Lawmakers from both the House and Senate are meeting to work out the differences. 
 Other tax advantages are under the microscope. For example, incentive income at private equity funds, called ''the carry,'' is taxedat a lower capital gains rate, which is often less than half the rates on ordinary income -- a benefit being discussed. 
 To be sure, those who defer taxes face the risk that Congress will raise tax rates on the rich at some future date. But that does not seem to worry most hedge fund managers.
 ''My clients who have quantified the value of the deferral have never factored in the risk of a tax rate increase,'' said Mr. Weinstein from Hogan & Hartson. The advantage of tax-free compounding is so strong, he said that ''it doesn't matter because the after-tax yield is still that much better.''

HEADLINE: No-Fishing Zones in Tropics Yield Fast Payoffs for Reefs

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER PALA

DATELINE: NGIWAL, Palau 

 BODY:
Sitting on a bench in a thatched hut in this village on Palau's main island of Babeldaob, Islias Yano, 57, looked over the bay he has fished professionally since he was 15 and recalled the fishing practices of his boyhood.
 ''We fished certain fish in certain seasons,'' he recalled. ''Each reef could only be fished by people from a certain village.'' Village elders would rotate fishing on reefs, he recounted, to husband their slow-growing main source of food.
Starting in the 1980s, population growth, new seafood markets in Asia and modern ways of thinking washed away the elders' authority and rules.
 ''Outsiders started coming into our reefs, they used scuba gear and dynamite, and the fish got smaller and fewer,'' Mr. Yano said, shaking his head. 
 In the world's tropical seas, full-grown snappers and groupers became as rare as full-grown tuna or cod elsewhere. In Ngiwal, the reaction was not long in coming. Once again, the elders ruled.
 In 1994, they banned fishing in a small area of reef that was partly accessible on foot. The village women, who traditionally gather shellfish at low tide, noticed how the fish became more plentiful there in a few years. The reef became locally famous, and other villages started to do the same.
 Today, Palau, a tiny island state 600 miles east of the Philippines that is internationally known as a site for recreational diving, is at the forefront of a worldwide movement to ban fishing in key reefs to allow the return of prized species. It now protects a patchwork of reefs and lagoon waters amounting to 460 square miles. 
 At a November 2005 meeting of the United States Coral Reef Task force in Koror (the Republic of Palau, independent since 1994, still qualifies for certain domestic financing from the United States), President Tommy Remengesau Jr., probably the world's most conservation-minded head of state, caused a splash with his so-called Micronesian Challenge: a call to the rest of the region to set aside for conservation 30 percent of coastal waters and 20 percent of the land area by 2020. Palau already has that amount, though not all of it is policed, but the rest of the region has far less.
 ''I realized you couldn't have development on one side and conservation on the other, and see which would outwit the other,'' he said an in interview in Koror, the commercial capital. ''If you cared for the future of the country, you had to bring them together,'' so the nongovernmental organizations became ''an integral part of our planning.''
 Palau's challenge has come at a time when reef-fishing communities around the world are discovering that setting aside no-fishing areas yields dividends in a few years because the resurgent fish populations spill over into areas where fishing is allowed. 
 Without as much support from their national government as Palauans enjoy, local authorities in Fiji have raised the number of no-take zones to 189 from 2 in 10 years. 
 Two years after Ratu Aisea Katonivere, a traditional chief, imposed a no-take zone, ''The fish are closer and bigger,'' he said. ''They are coming back; it's a miracle.'' Mr. Katonivere, who rules over 7,000 people in the Great Sea Reef, the world's third-largest barrier reef, spoke in an interview during a conservation conference in Honolulu. 
 Other participants said that in the Solomon Islands, the protected areas have gone to 30 from 2 in just five years, and in Vanuatu, they exceed 100.
 ''The old system of controlling fishing with the taboo system is being adapted and improved because people still respect their traditional chiefs,'' said Alifereti Tawake of the University of the South Pacific in Fiji. ''They're used to fishing where they want, but when they see the decline of the fish and the results of the no-take areas, they see it's the way to go.'' 
 The Micronesia Challenge has resonated far beyond Micronesia. Five months after Mr. Remengesau issued it, President Susilo Bangbang Yudhoyono of Indonesia pledged to increase marine protected areas to 24.7 million acres from 18 million acres by 2010. In the Antilles, the states of Grenada, the Bahamas, Belize and the Grenadines, which have already protected some reef areas, have committed themselves to a Caribbean Challenge and are trying to persuade the other nations to make similar pledges, according to Bill Raynor, the Nature Conservancy's director for Micronesia. 
 But in the United States, marine protected areas are less than 1 percent of near-shore waters. In Hawaii, where the reefs are largely depleted of fish, a ''right to fish'' bill recently approved by the state house of representatives would make it almost impossible to create any protected areas by requiring unattainable scientific data. 
 That Palau has taken the lead in ocean conservation is no accident. Even among Pacific peoples, Palauans have been known for prizing fish and seafood over meat and farmed vegetables, and its fishermen have stood out for their keen understanding of the reefs. A Canadian marine biologist, Robert E. Johannes, was the first to tap the Palauans' knowledge of marine biology by interviewing them and fishing with them in the 1970s. 
 Palauans, he wrote, showed him that in their archipelago, 55 species of edible fish followed the lunar calendar to gather in enormous groups called spawning aggregations and release sperm and eggs in the water -- ''more than twice as many species as biologists had described for the whole world.''
 When diving became popular, in the 1990s, Palauan fishermen were able to take foreigners to sites with extraordinary numbers and varieties of fishes and corals, and the island became one of the world's top diving destinations. This brought a measure of prosperity to the 14,000 Palauans (unemployment is 2.9 percent), and it reinforced the views of fishermen like Mr. Yano that plundering reefs is a bad idea. In 1997, 330 square miles in the Rock Islands lagoon favored by divers were closed to commercial fishing and the killing of sharks anywhere in Palau's waters was banned. 
 Also protected are the Napoleon wrasses, fish that can reach five feet and are worth up to $10,000 alive in Hong Kong. They have been decimated almost everywhere else, but Palau now boasts one of the world's largest densities of them, a major attraction for divers. 
 In 1998, a so-called El Nino event involving major sea current changes sent unusually warm water to several countries around the world, causing the corals there to turn white and die. In Palau, the bleaching event killed off a third of its corals on average, but the proportion was much larger in the outer reefs whose dense fish populations, clear water and dramatic drop-offs are the main attractions to divers.
 At the time, Noah Idechong, the country's leading environmentalist and founder of the Palau Conservation Society, had recently been elected to the lower house of Parliament.
 ''We realized that our no-fishing areas could not protect us from global warming and reef bleaching,'' he said.
 With the support of the Nature Conservancy, Mr. Idechong (pronounced idda-ONG) introduced legislation to integrate the patchwork of existing protected areas-- some imposed by the government for tourism, others established by villages along the coast -- and add another 30 percent from those that best resisted bleaching, or recovered fastest from it, he said.
 Today, the network design is close to being completed, and by the end of the decade -- 10 years before the president's 2020 pledge -- it should be fully in place, Mr. Idechong said.
 Although Palau's reefs are the envy of the region, poaching remains a problem. ''There are boats on my reef every night; they are fishing illegally with scuba tanks and spear guns,'' fumed Brownie Salvador, the governor of Ngarchelong State. ''I have no money to hire rangers to stop them.''
 To monitor the health of the reefs and curb poaching, Palau needs $2.1 million a year, officials say. Foreign donors are expected to create a $12 million trust fund, and the rest will come from an added tax on divers, said Mr. Raynor of the Nature Conservancy, in an interview in Pohnpei, in the Federated States of Micronesia. 
 Because Palau is far ahead of the others, ''It's really important we succeed, because the whole world is looking at us,'' Mr. Raynor added.
 At Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Boris Worm, author of a seminal paper predicting that there will be little wild fish left to eat by midcentury, is keeping a close eye on the rapid spread of marine-protected areas in the Pacific. ''Those bottom-up ones work a lot better than top-down ones; they have better compliance and work well long-term,'' Dr. Worm said. ''Now that we are reaching a global limit, people are asking how can we fix the problem, and they are rediscovering that the old methods really work. It's very significant.''

 MORE TRANS-ATLANTIC COMPETITION Zoom Airlines, based in Ottawa, plans to begin service between Kennedy International Airport and London Gatwick Airport on June 21, with round-trip coach fares starting at about $510, including taxes and fees. Zoom says it will offer both economy and premium- economy cabins with meals. EOS ADDS SERVICE Eos Airlines, the discount all- business-class carrier, expanded its schedule to add a third flight between Kennedy International Airport and Stansted Airport in London. 
The additional flight will leave from Kennedy on Sundays, Mondays and Fridays and from Gatwick on Sundays, Mondays and Fridays. AMERICAN AIRLINES PROTEST Flight attendants for American Airlines will be picketing at domestic airports today to protest $180 million in bonuses the carrier is preparing to pay to about 1,000 top managers, according to the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents nearly 20,000 flight attendants at American. In 2003, the flight attendants at American agreed to significant cuts in pay as the airline and others in the industry faced serious financial strain. RENT PARTY United Airlines is charging customers at Los Angeles International Airport an extra $10 a ticket, citing the ''sharp increase in costs to operate at LAX'' after the airport imposed a rent increase on all airlines. Last year, United had 4.9 million passengers at the airport. Assuming the same number of passengers this year, the approximately $49 million in extra revenue to United ''wildly exceeds'' the airline's $10 million rent increase, said Los Angeles World Airports, the parent agency of the airport. Other carriers have officially protested the rent increases, but only United had so far added a surcharge to fares. MOVING CARS As the so-called snowbird people population migrates from Arizona back north, Budget Rent a Car is offering discounts to customers heading to California. Through June 23, rates for those traveling one way from Tucson International Airport or Sky Harbor Airport of Phoenix to select airports in California range from $17.95 a day for an economy car to $21.95 for a full-size vehicle, though with limited availability. Among the California drop-off locations are airports in Burbank, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco. HOW LOW? Ryanair, the popular low-fare, no-frills European carrier, hopes to start a new airline with service by 2010 to the United States from its 23 European bases with one-way coach fares as low as $12, according to the chief executive, Michael O'Leary, in an interview with Flight International. Mr. O'Leary, who has previously proposed in-flight casino-type gambling as a revenue source to keep fares low, told the trade magazine that he expected the low-fare international airline would depend on sales of food, drink, duty-free goods and in-flight entertainment for extra revenue. NEW HYATT BRAND Hyatt is starting a new luxury brand, Andaz, emphasizing boutique environments with local identity, but without the ''attitude'' that characterizes some urban boutique hotels, said Mark S. Hoplamazian, the chief executive of Global Hyatt. The first hotel under the Andaz brand will be in London's financial district, where the Hyatt-operated Great Eastern Hotel is being refurbished.

HEADLINE: For Illegal Immigrant Workers, Housing Slump Takes a Big Toll

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

DATELINE: HURON, Calif. 

 BODY:
Some of the casualties of America's housing bust are easy to spot up and down California's Central Valley. 
 From Fresno to Sacramento, big tangles of wire and PVC pipes clutter vacant lots in silent subdivisions, waiting for houses to be built -- some day. Dozens of ''For Sale'' signs already dot the lawns across new residential communities. And right next to the ubiquitous billboards from builders are fresh signs offering homeowners help to avoid foreclosure.
But another set of losers is less visible: the immigrant workers, mostly illegal, who rode the construction boom while it lasted and now find jobs on building sites few and far between.
 Offering more than $10 an hour as well as new skills and a shot at upward mobility, construction provided many illegal immigrants the best job they ever had, a step up from the backbreaking work reserved for those toiling without legal authorization, which in the Central Valley mostly meant pruning and picking in fruit and vegetable fields. 
 The growing presence of illegal immigrants in home building, mostly working for small labor contractors, might help explain why government statistics have recorded only a small decline in construction employment, despite the collapse in residential investment.
 ''Technically they don't fire them,'' said Myrna Martinez, coordinator for the Fresno office of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit organization working on social assistance projects for immigrant workers. ''They just tell them that there is no more work.''
 As building jobs have grown scarce, many of the workers who left farm labor a few years ago are returning to where they came from. They can be seen once again hunched in clusters under the unremitting sun, cutting heads of lettuce or slicing off spears of asparagus for minimum wage, clinging to the hope that home building will resume again. 
 ''If another construction job comes up, I'll go there,'' said Cresencio B., a former Mexico City policeman who arrived illegally in the United States in 1991. 
 Cresencio B. toiled on farms up and down the West Coast until he got a job cutting wood segments on a construction crew two years ago, making about $11 an hour. But building jobs dried up in October. In early April, he was in a tomato field nearby, brandishing his hoe for $7.50 an hour, clearing out the weeds and the leftover garlic sprouts from last year's crop. 
 (The Times is using only the first name and last initial of the workers.)
 ''There are quite a few in this situation,'' Ms. Martinez said. ''This construction boom that started five or six years ago just suddenly started to fall apart.''
 Illegal immigrants played a big if quiet part on the supply side of America's housing boom. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, a research organization in Washington, immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries account for about one in five construction workers. Those who arrived since 2000 -- who are likely to be unlawfully in the United States because they had virtually no way of immigrating legally -- account for an estimated 7 percent of the construction work force.
 They were mostly pulled in by the building frenzy of the first half of the decade. According to the analysis by the Pew Hispanic Center, based on census data, Hispanic immigrants took 60 percent of the million new construction jobs created from 2004 to 2006. Those recently arrived took nearly half.
 While there are no equivalent statistics at the state or local level, a glance at a construction crew anywhere in the valley confirms the overwhelming immigrant share. ''There are only Mexicans,'' said Adrian L., an illegal immigrant from Oaxaca who does interior work on homes here. ''Now not even the supervisors are American.'' 
 Like no other job, construction allowed many immigrants a shot at the American dream. After more than five years in construction, Adrian L. was making $25 to $35 an hour leading a 15-strong team for a company building new tract homes in the Central Valley.
 Farther north, construction work also allowed Jose Manuel J. to aspire to a better life. An illegal immigrant from Guanajuato State in Mexico, he left the fields to sweep construction sites eight years ago. By last year he was making $25 an hour running a small crew laying roofs. He got a mortgage and bought a home in the United States. He bought land and built a house in Mexico. 
 For Cresencio B. a construction job meant his wife, Marta M., could afford to stay home and care for their 2-year-old son, Angel. 
 But when home builders stopped building, they stopped calling. Hoe in hand, Marta M. is back at work these days, hacking alongside her husband at the weeds in a tomato field from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. Angel is left in the care of his 18-year-old sister.
 Adrian L. and Jose Manuel J. have resisted going back into the fields, making do with piecemeal work: putting up a roof here, re-tiling a bathroom there. But they are near the end of the line. ''If work doesn't pick up,'' Jose Manuel J. said, ''in May I am going to have to go to pick in the cherry crop.''
 The nation's great housing bust has not shown up so far in official employment data. According to the Labor Department, employment in residential construction has declined by only 28,000 jobs -- or some 3 percent -- since its peak last fall.
 ''It is sort of surprising that construction employment numbers haven't gone down more already,'' said David F. Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. ''I'm not sure about the quality of the data.''
 The statistics seem to belie the debacle that has overwhelmed home building. In February, there were 15 percent fewer homes under construction and 27 percent fewer homes started than in the corresponding month of 2006. In California, 42 percent fewer building permits for new residential units were issued in February than a year earlier. 
 ''Because we have fewer homes sold, we have slowed down the building of various phases in some communities,'' said Joel H. Rassman, chief financial officer for the home builder Toll Brothers, which expects to deliver 6,000 to 7,000 homes in 2007, down from 8,600 in 2006. ''We have delayed the start of some communities, and we are letting less work out to our contractors.''
 Mr. Seiders suggested that reported employment might not be falling as starkly as other statistics because builders do not employ construction workers directly. Instead, they use subcontractors to build different parts of a development. These often use labor contractors, who may also turn to subcontractors to fill their crews. 
 Jose Carlos J., Jose Manuel's nephew, has not formally lost his job as a roofer. But the contractor he works for has hardly called him in recent months. ''Since November I've laid only four roofs,'' he said. 
 Most of the workers disgorged back into the fields are in a similar situation. Milling about in a park near downtown Stockton after work on a recent afternoon, Jose Manuel's brother, Raymundo J., who is the foreman of a crew picking asparagus near Stockton, pointed to several former construction workers from his hometown in Mexico who are now in the field. 
 There was his other nephew, Roberto, who used to tear roofs down for $15 an hour, and Manuel S., who used to spray stucco on houses in the San Francisco Bay Area. Antonio R. lost a $14-an-hour job cutting wood last October. Chuy R., who got a job wiring homes immediately after arriving in the United States in May 2006, lost it at the end of the year.
 They all hang on to the hope that construction will rebound. Most fear, however, that times will never again be as good. Said Jose Manuel J., ''I don't think building houses will pick up for several years.''
 The growing season is barely starting in the Central Valley. Demand for farm workers will peak in the summer, at around 450,000. But many growers are concerned that tight border controls will continue to cut deeply into their labor force and that, as happened last year, crops will be left to rot in the fields.
 Still, as farm workers once lured into construction are returned to the fields, there are signs that the labor supply on some California farms is increasing.
 Luawanna Hallstrom, chairwoman of the California Farm Bureau's labor committee and general manager of Harry Singh & Sons, a large tomato grower north of San Diego, noted that more workers were showing up at greenhouse nurseries than last year. 
 She pointed out that the lull in construction, combined with the frosts this year that devastated the state's citrus crop and part of the nut crop, are freeing workers for other farms.
 ''There's an opportunity for some areas in agriculture to attract labor who would have been doing other agricultural jobs or tied up in construction,'' Ms. Hallstrom said.
 The immigrants agree. ''There are too many people for too little field work,'' Jose Manuel J. complained. ''People are scattering up to Oregon and further north because there is little work here.''

HEADLINE: Tax Credit Seen as Helping More Parents

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
More than one in six taxpayers in 2004 received the Earned Income Tax Credit, highlighting its growing role in bolstering the incomes of struggling low-income parents, according to a new report.
 The federal credit, which offers tax refunds this year of up to $4,716 for a parent with two children who makes $12,000 to $15,000, has emerged as one of the largest aid programs for the working poor. The amount of the credit for such parents gradually declines, reaching zero as their incomes hit $38,000.
Annual federal payments under the program total nearly $40 billion, compared with $25 billion for the revamped welfare program, and all tax-credit money goes directly to the recipients. 
 But childless adults and noncustodial fathers receive little from the earned income credit; their maximum benefit this year will be $428 and begins phasing out at an annual income of $7,000. Many economists and poverty experts are calling for more generous tax treatment of these groups, too, in part to increase the financial rewards of work for single black men, who have high rates of unemployment and incarceration. 
 Covering 2000 to 2004, the study shows the importance of the tax credit as a buffer for families in periods of economic downturn and stagnating wages, said Elizabeth Kneebone, the author of the report, which was released yesterday by the Brookings Institution. 
 ''For workers who faced job losses or reduced hours, it played an important role in bridging the gap until the next rise in the economic cycle,'' Ms. Kneebone, a researcher at the institute, said in a telephone interview.
 The number of people receiving the credit rose to 21.7 million in 2004 from 18.8 million in 2000, a period of economic sluggishness, Ms. Kneebone said. Payments averaged $1,834 in 2004, the last year for which data are complete. 
 At least 19 states and three local governments, including New York City, San Francisco and Montgomery County, Md., offer similar credits against state and local taxes.
 The number of recipients was especially high in economically distressed cities, with payments going to 41 percent of taxpayers in Jackson, Miss.; 37 percent in El Paso; and 34 percent in Hartford. But over all, the report found, more people in suburbs than cities filed for the credit, reflecting the geographic sprawl of the working poor. 
 For those whose incomes are too low to require payment of taxes, the earned income credit is paid as a cash refund. Since a change in the law in 2001, many of these same parents have also benefited from refunds of the standard child deduction of $1,000. 
 First adopted in the 1970s, the earned income credit was expanded significantly in the 1990s and has played a crucial supporting role in welfare overhaul, helping to make work more profitable for mothers who were pushed into low-paying jobs from cash welfare. 
 According to a report in March 2006 by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the tax credit last year, added to recipient earnings, lifted more than four million people above the official poverty line and was ''the nation's most effective antipoverty program for working families.'' 
 Reflecting a growing consensus among poverty experts, who say the changes in welfare together with the tax credit increased employment among single women but did little for struggling single men, the United States Conference of Mayors in a report in January called for a major increase in the tax credit for single, childless low-wage workers. 
 Millions of adults, the report said, ''are working hard and 'playing by the rules' but not getting ahead.''

HEADLINE: The Start Has Been Tough, And the Owner Hasn't

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Here is another sign that George Steinbrenner is no longer the tempestuous owner he once was: Marty Miller and Dana Cavalea have yet to be booted out the door at Yankee Stadium and dispatched to an unemployment line in the Bronx.
 Miller and Cavalea are in charge of the strength and conditioning program for the highly paid Yankees players. On the job for less than a month of the regular season, the two men have watched the Yankees accumulate more injuries than some teams do in, say, half a season. 
Miller and Cavalea remain on the job if for no other reason than Brian Cashman appointed them. He is the general manager who has been handed greater control over the Yankees' operation than any of the multitude of his predecessors in the Steinbrenner regime. Cashman wanted it that way, and he understood the perils of being in such a position of authority.
 The question is whether Steinbrenner can still summon enough anger to jettison Cashman if he feels his trust is misguided and misplaced. Had a general manager in the first 30 years or so of Steinbrenner's reign made the move that Cashman did, and had similar results, he might already be gone, along with the offending new strength coaches. 
 It is possible, of course, that Steinbrenner does not know the full extent of the early-season injuries, that three-fifths of his starting pitching rotation (four-sixths if you count the first replacement) are on the disabled list. And the season is only two weeks old. Two-thirds of the outfield has also been afflicted, with Johnny Damon missing a few games with a strained calf muscle and Hideki Matsui taking an early turn on the D.L. with a strained hamstring.
 Now, none of these injuries -- which also include Chien-Ming Wang's bad hamstring, Mike Mussina's bad hamstring, Carl Pavano's forearm stiffness and Jeff Karstens's elbow stiffness -- may be the result of the team's new strength and conditioning program. But years ago, that never stopped the old Steinbrenner from acting like the old Steinbrenner.
 In 1984, for example, Dave Righetti, the Yankees' left-handed closer, cut his left index finger on the bullpen water cooler and went on the disabled list for 15 days. The day after the mishap, Jerry McNertney, the bullpen coach, was banished to the minor leagues. 
 The Yankees have new strength and conditioning coaches because Cashman fired Jeff Mangold, who had held the job since 1998. This act has become tiresome for the 52-year-old Mangold. He had previously held the job for five seasons, from 1984 through 1988, was let go because the Yankees felt they had endured too many injuries, then was brought back. Now he's gone again.
 Mangold learned shortly after last season that he wouldn't be back this season, but he has not talked about the reason and declined to do so yesterday.
 ''They just felt it was time for a change,'' Mangold said in a telephone interview from his home in Oakland, N.J. 
 ''I just wasn't rehired. I don't want to get into it. It doesn't make sense for me to. It was their decision to make, and I have to move on from there.''
 Cashman didn't want to talk about the change, either. 
 ''I made the decision,'' he said, ''but I don't want to speak to the reason in fairness to everyone involved, the people who are here and those who aren't.''
 Cashman didn't say it, but he and his aides apparently felt that the Yankees had encountered a lot of injuries in recent seasons and they didn't feel that Mangold had been as focused on his job as much as he should have been. 
 As for Miller, a 34-year-old native of Niagara Falls, N.Y., he was not allowed to address his new job yesterday because, the Yankees said, Cashman doesn't permit him to speak to reporters. 
 Miller does have a title, director of performance enhancement, that is appropriate for his new-wave type of conditioning, but not all of the players have adapted to his approach. 
 Some players, in fact, have their own trainers and follow the methods those trainers employ. Considering the salaries that players are paid these days, the teams would seem to have reason to expect that their conditioning regimen would be adhered to by the players. But that's a matter for the clubs and the union to debate. 
 Mangold wouldn't talk about Miller and his methods. When the conversation turned to the recent rash of injuries, Mangold said, ''I don't want to express my thoughts publicly on what has happened.''
 Given the spate of injuries, especially to the four starting pitchers, Mangold could have said a lot but didn't. But here's what he could have noted: The major leagues, according to records compiled by the commissioner's office, have 20 starting pitchers on the disabled list. 
 The Yankees represent 20 percent of that number. No other team has more than two starting pitchers disabled.
 But Mangold didn't say any of that. Those are my words and my research. Cashman said yesterday that injuries were up this year and that on opening day, the disabled list had a population 30 percent greater than a year ago and 30 percent greater than the average number over the past four years.
 But only the Yankees have four starting pitchers on the disabled list.

HEADLINE: March Retail Sales Up 0.7%; February Data Revised Higher

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16 

 BODY:
Retail sales rose slightly more than expected in March, but February sales were much higher than first estimated.
 Retail sales were up 0.7 percent as warmer weather and an earlier-than-usual Easter holiday encouraged shoppers in March. Excluding automobiles and parts, sales were up 0.8 percent, somewhat less than expected, according to the Commerce Department report. 
Another Commerce Department report showed business inventories were up an expected 0.3 percent in February. But if autos were excluded, they advanced by 0.8 percent, the biggest increase in 11 months.
 Manufacturing inventories were flat in February, while retailers increased their stockpiles by 0.3 percent. That reflected a 0.7 percent decrease in auto and parts inventories, the biggest decline since November.
 Sales for February were revised sharply upward, and economists took this as a sign that consumer buying, which fuels two-thirds of economic growth, was still strong.
 ''The consumer in the first quarter appears to have been by far the strongest component of aggregate demand,'' Bear Stearns economists wrote in a report after the release of the data, ''and this strength supports our view that gains in jobs and income are far more important to consumer spending than asset valuations, housing or mortgage equity withdrawal.''
 The latest retail sales figure left economists thinking that first-quarter economic growth might be stronger than first thought, particularly after the strong upward revisions to the February sales numbers.
 Economists polled ahead of the report were expecting retail sales to advance 0.6 percent over all and 0.9 percent excluding automobiles. Figures for the previous month were revised up, to a 0.5 percent rise in overall sales from the scant 0.1 percent reported initially. Excluding autos, sales were revised to a 0.4 percent gain in February from a 0.1 percent fall.
 A separate report released Monday by the New York Federal Reserve showed manufacturing activity in New York State factories rose only slightly in April after hitting a nearly two-year low in March. 
 The New York Fed's index of general business conditions for the factory sector edged up to 3.80 in April, from 1.85 in March. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an April reading of 7.5.
 The survey of manufacturing plants in the state is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to factory conditions.

HEADLINE: Deal to Make Sallie Mae A Big Debtor

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Sallie Mae has long profited from making loans to college students. Now, the company will be saddling itself with debt in an effort to generate even more lucrative returns.
 Yesterday, Sallie Mae, as the SLM Corporation is known, agreed to be taken private for $25 billion amid a private equity wave that has swept Wall Street and as calls are heard in Washington to reduce federal subsidies for student loans.
As the largest buyout of a financial services company, the deal has the potential to not only transform Sallie Mae but shake up the entire lending industry.
 The buyout will put the company in the hands of two private equity investors, J. C. Flowers and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, and two banking giants, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. 
 Although the buyers are investing a total of $8.8 billion of their own money, the remaining $16.2 billion will be financed with debt. Together, the two buyout firms will control 50.2 percent of the company, while the banks will provide Sallie Mae with up to $200 million in backup financing and own the remaining stake.
 The complex transaction is expected to close late this year, but is bound to face intense scrutiny. The deal comes as debate is renewed on Capitol Hill over how heavily the government should subsidize and guarantee student loans made by Sallie Mae and smaller rivals.
 ''The student loan business is transforming,'' said Charles A. Gabriel Jr., an analyst with the Prudential Equity Group. ''This gives the industry's critics ammunition to say there are outsize profits and excess subsidies.'' 
 Yet shares of Sallie Mae surged nearly 18 percent yesterday. The stock closed up $8.29, to $55.05 -- still shy of the $60 a share the four buyers are offering, which is a nearly 50 percent premium over Sallie Mae's battered share price before news of a potential buyout was reported in The New York Times last week.
 ''Some of the savviest minds on Wall Street believe that even in the face of a Congressional debate over subsidies, there is room for a 50 percent premium,'' Mr. Gabriel said.
 Shares of other lenders soared on the belief that that more private equity deals could be coming. Shares of Nelnet, a smaller student loan company, jumped nearly 15 percent, while shares of the Student Loan Corporation rose 5 percent. 
 The deal for Sallie Mae also appeared to prompt investors to reconsider whether other financial companies -- once thought too big and too debt-averse for private equity -- could become targets. Shares of CIT rose 5 percent and shares of Countrywide Financial were up 7 percent. 
 For Sallie Mae, whose $142 billion portfolio makes it the nation's largest provider of student loans, the deal represents a chance to escape the public limelight at a time when its business model is under attack.
 Democratic lawmakers and President Bush are threatening to cut the federal subsidies that guarantee lenders a certain level of profit and help insure them against default. Regulatory investigations and media scrutiny of suspected deceptive sales practices are casting a harsh light on Sallie Mae's fastest-growing and most lucrative business: high-interest private loans to bridge the gap between tuition costs and federal aid.
 Some analysts say that the deal represents a bet by private investors that Sallie Mae can survive, and even thrive, in spite of the intense legislative pressure.
 If Congress were to take away part of the lender subsidies, Sallie Mae's low operating costs would still give it an advantage over smaller rivals. That could help expand its 36 percent share of the $197 billion in outstanding federally guaranteed loans, according to Citigroup analysts.
 Sallie Mae could also become a bigger player in the origination of private loans, a lucrative market ranging from $17 billion to $25 billion, where it already has as much as a 40 percent share. That business does not depend on the government and is currently fueling the company's growth.
 ''The underlying business is very strong from a growth perspective since education costs are growing at twice the rate of inflation,'' said Richard Hoffmann, a financial analyst for CreditSights in New York. ''You can simply look at the enrollment of high school students and see what the growth rate is.''
 It is also a chance for Sallie Mae executives to cash out. Albert L. Lord, Sallie Mae's chairman, took home pay worth more than $228 million before stepping down in 2005, according to an Equilar analysis. Its current chief executive, Thomas J. Fitzpatrick, has accumulated nearly $180 million in total compensation. On top of that, the deal could prompt a change-of-control payout, accelerating more than $31.6 million in stock and options. Mr. Fitzpatrick and the rest of the Sallie Mae management team are expected stay on as part of the deal.
 Of course, the deal also poses the same risks that have prevented other financial firms from being taken over by private equity investors. 
 Piling on billions of dollars in debt at a company like Sallie Mae is a tricky endeavor, especially when interest margins are tight. But Sallie Mae appears ready to walk away from issuing high-grade bonds and into the edge of junk-bond territory.
 Yesterday, all three major credit rating agencies -- Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's -- either lowered Sallie Mae's ratings or put the company on watch.
 Analysts say that Sallie Mae will try to offset that risk in two ways. First, it can rely on the steady stream of cash that is thrown off by the guaranteed federal student loans in its portfolio. And in the event that its access to capital becomes limited, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have arranged to provide as much as $200 million in backup financing to guarantee that the company can make low-cost loans.
 While all four investors are lured by the lucrative returns, Bank of America and JPMorgan may expect additional strategic benefits. For one, it also gives them access to college students, with whom they seek lifelong relationships. Moreover, they can expect to make income and fees from the deal. And analysts say teaming up with a buyout firm allows the banks to expand their student loan business without making a deal that could reduce earnings.
 The banks' close relationship with Sallie Mae could now give them a cost advantage. Both big banks have existing student- lending businesses, which they insist will remain independent. But Sallie Mae said the agreement allows the two banks to let it package their private loans, their faster-growing and more profitable business, at potentially lower rates. 
 Several analysts expect Bank of America and JPMorgan to begin moving away from existing loan packagers, like First Marblehead, and to Sallie Mae. Even though both banks are locked into their contracts until they expire, First Marblehead shares lost more than a fifth of their value yesterday.
 On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers used the Sallie Mae buyout to criticize the use of government funds to support private student lenders.
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the education committee, said it was ''more urgent than ever to enact reforms to our student loan system to ensure that students, not profits, are our top priority.''

HEADLINE: McCain Says Fellow Republicans Spent Too Much While Running Congress

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, April 16 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Monday that his fellow Republicans ''forgot who we were'' in recent years by spending too much, and said that as president he would rely on low taxes, greater fiscal restraint and free trade to lift the nation's economy. 
 Mr. McCain, whose presidential campaign has been viewed with suspicion by some conservatives because of his initial opposition to the Bush administration's tax cuts, used the first major economic address of his campaign to reaffirm his commitment to the free market but said he would move to overhaul the nation's unemployment programs to help people find jobs in the new economy. And he had some strong words for the way his fellow Republicans governed when they controlled Congress.
''Worst of all, we forgot who we were: tight-fisted stewards of the federal treasury who keep our priorities straight,'' Mr. McCain said in a speech to the Economic Club of Memphis. ''We asked Americans to make us the governing party, and we rewarded them by becoming the party of government.''
 After complaining that Congress had spent money on an indoor rain forest and studying the DNA of bears in Montana (''without knowing whether we needed to solve a criminal case or a paternity suit''), Mr. McCain restated his support for giving the president a line-item veto. Even without it, though, he pledged vetoes of pork-laden bills that drive up government spending without improving government services.
 ''My goodness, when disaster strikes, the government isn't even ready to deliver drinking water to dehydrated babies or rescue the aged and infirm trapped in a hospital with no electricity,'' he said, in an apparent allusion to the government's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
 Mr. McCain spoke strongly in favor of free trade but said the government needed to adjust to help workers who had lost their jobs in a changing economy. ''We have an unemployment insurance program straight out of the 1950s,'' he said.
 He proposed combining government programs for the unemployed and new emphasis on training, education and relocation assistance.
 Turning to a subject that has been politically sensitive for him, Mr. McCain said he would continue to support the Bush tax cuts. 
 ''I won't balance the budget by allowing the president's income and investment tax cuts to expire,'' he said. The problem, he explained, was that ''when we passed those tax cuts, we increased spending as well.''
 Still, some conservatives continued to express skepticism.
 Pat Toomey, the president of the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group, said: ''While Senator McCain deserves credit for his support for free trade, limited spending and extending the Bush tax cuts, his record of opposing tax cuts speaks louder than his words today.''

HEADLINE: Manhattan School Challenges U.S. Rules and Sends Students on a Spring Break Trip to Cuba

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
When the city's Education Department said it would not let students from the Beacon School on the Upper West Side take a spring break trip to Cuba this year, the school turned to a powerful friend for help: Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson, whose stepdaughter went on the trip as a Beacon student in 2005. His call did not make a difference; city officials would not budge.
 But the students went anyway, chaperoned by one teacher and two parents. And yesterday, city officials, including Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein and even Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, were left struggling to explain why the trip went forward, and how Beacon students had managed to get to Havana again this year in defiance of the government's ban on travel to the Communist nation. 
Mr. Klein, at a news conference yesterday, said that the trip had not been approved by the Education Department and that the matter was now under investigation. ''It should not have happened,'' Mr. Klein said. ''We expressly said no.'' 
 Officials said yesterday that they had been unaware of the school's previous trips to Cuba, in 2004 and 2005, prompting questions from Mr. Paterson. 
 ''As a parent,'' Mr. Paterson said by telephone, ''I was a little concerned that a group of schoolchildren went to Cuba and the Department of Education didn't know about it.'' 
 He said that the school had clearly approved the trip when his stepdaughter, Ashley Dennis, went and that it had been highly educational. 
 The controversial trip was first reported yesterday in The New York Post. As in past years, the trip was led by Nathan Turner, a history teacher who accompanied the students along with one set of parents. Ruth Lacey, the principal of Beacon, declined to comment. 
 This year's trip included interviews of a 15-year-old prostitute and of a homeless man in Havana, and also a visit to La Zorra y El Cuervo -- the Fox and the Crow -- an Afro-Cuban jazz club in the Vedado section of Havana, where two of the students jammed with the musicians. 
 The students and chaperones said that the trip was organized by Pastors for Peace/Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization, a nonprofit group in Manhattan. The federal government permits educational trips to Cuba, but only for college or graduate students, said Molly Millerwise, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department. Violators can receive a warning letter or a fine of up to $65,000. 
 Ms. Millerwise declined to comment on the Beacon case. 
 Mayor Bloomberg, at his daily news conference, said that the ban on travel to Cuba should be obeyed. 
 ''My understanding from what I've read and from a couple of conversations I've had is that the school did not approve the trip,'' he said. ''I think we should be a law-abiding society.'' 
 Former Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz said she had tried to help parents after rumors that the trip would not be allowed. ''I can't imagine why this is a bad thing,'' she said. ''I think you would want kids to travel, even to leftist countries, and have them understand their social and economic systems, their human rights violations.'' 
 Mr. Paterson said that it never struck him as odd that his stepdaughter and her classmates were traveling to Cuba, despite the federal travel ban. 
 ''All the elected officials from my neighborhood have taken this trip to Cuba,'' he said. ''I figured they would be going as part of one of these missions.'' He added that his stepdaughter's trip was educational for him, too. ''I probably learned more, hearing about her experiences, then I have been able to read in books or watch in films about the Communist dictatorship.''

HEADLINE: Briton Criticizes U.S.'s Use of 'War on Terror'

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: LONDON, April 16 

 BODY:
A senior politician in the Labor Party of Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday that the Bush administration's commonly used phrase ''war on terror'' strengthens extremists. 
 ''In the U.K. we do not use the phrase 'war on terror' because we can't win by military means alone and because this isn't one organized enemy with a clear identity and a coherent set of objectives,'' the politician, Hilary Benn, said at Center on International Cooperation of New York University. The speech was released in London by Mr. Benn's parliamentary office.
 Mr. Benn, who is the international development secretary in the Blair government, said it would be more beneficial for the United States to use the ''soft power'' of values and ideas as well as military prowess to defeat extremists. 
 The remarks by Mr. Benn, an aspiring deputy leader of the Labor Party who is sometimes mentioned as a possible foreign secretary once Mr. Blair leaves office, were seen here as a way to create distance from Mr. Blair's unpopular support for President Bush. 
 ''The support of Bush has cost Blair his legacy,'' said Khalid Mahmood, one of four Muslim members of Parliament in Britain. ''Hilary Benn is in the contest for the deputy leadership and this is a way to make clear water between himself and Blair.''
 Mr. Mahmood added that Mr. Benn was playing with semantics, and that no matter what language the government used, the problem of extremism would persist as long as the war in Iraq continued. 
 Generally, the British government has used more reserved language to describe the threat from Islamic extremists at home and abroad. This is, in part, because the Blair government has been concerned about alienating the Pakistani-British population in Britain which has opposed Mr. Blair's Iraq war policies. 
 Official British government policy is to talk about ''law enforcement'' rather than the ''war on terror,'' Prof. Frank Gregory of the University of Southampton, and an expert in British security policies, said in a recent speech. He said the government had a policy of speaking in public about a ''contest'' with extremists and using what have been known as the ''four p's'' -- prevent, pursue, protect and prepare -- to deal with them. 
 In his speech, Mr. Benn said extremists wanted to ''force their individual and narrow values on others, without dialogue, without debate, through violence.''
 ''And by letting them feel part of something bigger,'' he added, ''we give them strength.''
 Mr. Benn has also been a critic of the World Bank president, Paul D. Wolfowitz. Mr. Wolfowitz is struggling to keep his job after the disclosure that he played a role in granting a pay raise and promotion to a companion.

HEADLINE: New Cultural Commissioner For Los Angeles

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 17 

 BODY:
Olga Garay, former director of the arts program for the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and currently a consultant to New York arts institutions, has been nominated as general manager of the Los Angeles department of cultural affairs, the city's top public arts post. 
 Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who announced the appointment on Monday, said Ms. Garay would oversee the development of a new cultural master plan for the city. Her appointment is subject to confirmation by the Los Angeles City Council.
Ms. Garay (pronounced gah-RYE) will succeed Margie Reese, who stepped down last summer. 
 In an interview, Ms. Garay, 54, said that the mayor told her that the city needed to spend more on the department and the arts, while also promoting a diverse array of activities and organizations. 
 ''Not enough attention is being paid to how to connect the city's vital and flourishing hubs of art and culture,'' she said. ''We have to figure out how to connect the dots, to create a picture for Angelenos of what the city can be.'' 
 Though Mr. Villaraigosa made increased arts spending part of his campaign, he has been criticized for not moving quickly enough to fill the position or to promote the city's artistic communities. Calling Ms. Garay ''an internationally recognized dynamo,'' he said her task ''is to nurture and develop a healthy arts ecosystem, an inclusive community that recognizes and supports an array of cultures, artists, communities and opportunities in the city.'' 
 Ms. Garay has never lived on the West Coast. Her family immigrated from Cuba in 1961, when she was a child; she graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in psychology and from Florida International University with a master's in community psychology. 
 She has spent more than 20 years working in the arts, including 8 years, from 1997 to 2005, as manager of the arts program for the Duke Foundation, one of the country's largest arts donors. Before that, Ms. Garay worked as director of cultural affairs at Miami Dade College from 1990 to 1997. She has been a consultant for both the Lincoln Center Festival and El Museo del Barrio, in New York.

HEADLINE: Weak Dollar Encourages Emphasis on Exports to Other Nations

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China, April 16 

 BODY:
At booth after booth at China's main trade fair this week, the refrain from Chinese business executives is the same: the American market is not as crucial as it used to be. 
 Instead, Chinese producers of everything from socket wrenches to sport utility vehicles say, their fastest growth these days lies in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South America and elsewhere in Asia -- in other words, practically anywhere other than the United States.
So it is throughout China. With ample support from the Beijing government -- including a flurry of trade missions to Africa and assistance with trade fairs in Germany, Australia or someplace in between -- Chinese companies are poised to expand into the markets of many of the world's rapidly growing economies. In some cases, they are running directly into American competitors. 
 Chinese business representatives at what is still known as the Canton Fair, after this city's old name, say they are discouraged by weaker growth in the American economy, rising protectionist sentiment in Washington and the decline of the dollar against China's currency, which makes it more expensive for Americans to buy Chinese products. 
 While the European Union has restricted certain imports, particularly shoes, American trade barriers have drawn more attention. 
 ''The U.S. government is still trying to protect its own markets, unlike Europe, which is very free,'' argued Huang Yasong, international sales manager for the Hubao Group, a men's shirt maker that is rapidly expanding in Eastern Europe and Brazil. 
 Even so, trade barriers limit a small percentage of commerce. A more powerful driver is the strength of domestic demand and currency fluctuations.
 Indeed, the rise in the euro's value propelled China's exports to European Union countries past its exports to the United States for the first time in February. 
 Currency rates have certainly influenced the finances of the Hang-zhou Jilin Machinery Company, which makes screwdrivers and other tools. Its American sales have remained basically flat, while those to Africa, Europe, the Middle East and especially Australia are on the rise. 
 Zhao Wei, the company's sales manager, assigns much of the blame to the dollar's lower value against the Chinese yuan. Officials in Beijing raised the value of their currency by 2.1 percent against the dollar in July 2005, and have let it drift up 5 percent more since then.
 ''It's a big problem,'' Ms. Zhao said.
 To be sure, China's exports to the United States are huge and growing, as is the trade imbalance, which is significantly larger than the European Union's deficit with China. That is the main reason trade is a focus of attention for the newly empowered Democrats in Congress, making it likely that trade frictions between the two countries will persist and possibly worsen in the months ahead. 
 China surpassed Canada in the first two months of this year as the largest exporter to the United States. According to statistics released by the World Trade Organization last Thursday, China also overtook the United States in the second half of 2006 to become the world's second-largest exporter of goods over all, after Germany. 
 China is still nearly 25 times as dependent on exports to the United States as a percentage of its total economic output as the United States is on exports to China. Given that the Chinese economy is less than a quarter the size of the American economy, it is all the more striking that Chinese exports to the United States are worth more than six times American exports to China.
 The American exports accounted for roughly four-tenths of 1 percent of economic output in the first two months of this year, while Chinese exports to the United States equaled nearly 10 percent of China's entire output.
 The government and companies across China increasingly see a danger in becoming too dependent on a single market. So they are stepping up efforts to sell to other countries, particularly those outside the industrial world. For example, the Great Wall Motor Company, a maker of sport utility vehicles and sedans, has more than quintupled its exports in two years, to 27,505 vehicles last year. Virtually all the increase has come from fast-growing, oil-rich markets like Russia and the Middle East. ''Europe and North America are not our primary markets,'' the company's chairman, Wei Jianjun, said.
 And Franklin L. Lavin, the American under secretary of commerce for international trade, said, ''China has been making more of an effort in recent years to diversify its export markets.'' He noted that the Chinese share of American imports was still climbing, but at a slowing rate.
 China has also moved beyond just making huge numbers of T-shirts and toys for prosperous Western consumers. It now produces a wide range of industrial goods and transportation gear, like weaving machines and heavy-duty trucks. It exports them in growing quantities to developing nations, many of them profiting from soaring world commodity prices and in need of the rough-and-ready durability of Chinese products.
 China ships a growing share of its goods to Southern Europe, with sales especially strong to Spain and Italy, where buyers are often less affluent than in Northern Europe -- although there have been signs of a backlash by workers and their unions.
 The shift in exports away from the United States has been under way for several years. But it has accelerated in the last year and particularly in the first two months of this year as the dollar has weakened against the yuan, as well as other currencies.
 At the same time, the strength in the euro and other currencies has made Chinese goods less expensive in those markets. 
 China sent more than 31 percent of its exports to the United States in 2000, but that dropped below 24 percent in November and reached 22.7 percent in February, according to a Goldman Sachs tabulation that included Chinese goods trans-shipped through Hong Kong. Exports to the rest of Asia have leveled off, while those to European Union countries rose slightly. Exports to the rest of the world, notably India, Brazil and Russia, have doubled in the last seven years, to 32 percent this winter.
 ''Right now, the prices we can get from Russia are a lot higher,'' said Sean Zhu, vice general manager of the Ningbo Guotai Knitwear Company, which makes knit shirts.
 Wang Tongsan, a senior Chinese economic forecaster and member of a committee of experts overseeing the current five-year plan, said the government did not have a policy of pushing exporters to focus on markets other than the United States. He attributed the rise in sales to developing countries to the strong entrepreneurial talents of many Chinese business people.
 Several exporters here said they had not been told by the Commerce Ministry to reduce their dependence on the American market. But government-run trade associations have become more active in helping companies attend trade fairs in Europe and the developing world, they said.
 Mr. Zhu said that abundant information in Chinese about foreign markets could now be found on Internet sites run by Alibaba.com, based in Hangzhou, and by various government agencies.
 Chinese officials are acutely conscious of the risks of rising trade barriers in the United States. The Bush administration opened the door on March 30 to requests by American industries that contend that their Chinese competitors receive subsidies. Last week, the administration filed two complaints with the World Trade Organization arguing that Beijing tolerates widespread abuses of copyrights and trademarks.
 Chinese officials are expected to go on another buying trip to the United States before next month's round of meetings in Washington to discuss economic policies with the United States. By wrapping together a lot of separate purchase agreements in a few heavily promoted announcements, the officials hope to portray the United States as needing the Chinese market. 
 Similar heavily promoted purchases preceded and coincided with President Hu Jintao's visit to the United States a year ago. And Japanese executives conducted such buying trips to the United States in the 1980s, when Japan's trade surplus became a political issue in Washington.
 State-controlled media reported on Friday that China would proceed with long-expected plans to reduce tax rebates for exporters, especially in industries like steel that use a lot of energy and fresh water, both in short supply in China.
 To underline China's desire to increase imports, the name of the Canton Fair has been formally changed, starting this week. It is now officially the China Import and Export Fair, though the organizers and many of those attending continue to call it the Canton Fair. 
 Certain old habits die hard, though. Foreign companies were invited to show their wares, but were relegated to the remote top floor of just one of the more than 30 halls that the trade fair fills at the city's two convention centers.
 Only 18 American companies attended, most of them little known and with small booths. One of the few publicly traded companies was Columbus McKinnon of Amherst, N.Y., selling American-made electric chain hoists. Zhang Qing, the company's China sales manager, said that even with the weakening dollar, Columbus McKinnon focused on selling top-quality hoists instead of trying to compete just on price with Chinese manufacturers.
 Far below, in a heavily traveled ground-floor corridor, executives like Henry Hu, general manager of the Ningbo Rightool Industrial I/E Company, said he was responding to the dollar's weakness by improving the company's products.
 ''Everyone is worried, but we focus on increasing the quality of our products,'' said Mr. Hu, who makes socket wrench sets. ''The government is encouraging us not just to manufacture, but to do more research and development.''

HEADLINE: Sudan Flying Arms to Darfur, Panel Reports

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 17 

 BODY:
A confidential United Nations report says the government of Sudan is flying arms and heavy military equipment into Darfur in violation of Security Council resolutions and painting Sudanese military planes white to disguise them as United Nations or African Union aircraft.
 In one case, illustrated with close-up pictures, the report says ''U.N.'' has been stenciled onto the wing of a whitewashed Sudanese armed forces plane parked on a military apron at a Darfur airport. Bombs guarded by uniformed soldiers are laid out in rows by its side.
 The report says that, contrary to the Sudanese government's earlier denials to United Nations investigators, the freshly painted planes are being operated out of all three of Darfur's principal airports and used for aerial surveillance and bombardments of villages, in addition to the transportation of cargo. 
 The report was compiled by a five-person panel responsible for helping the Council's sanctions committee monitor compliance with resolutions on Darfur, the war-ravaged region in Sudan. It was made available by a diplomat from one of the 15 Council nations, which believes that the findings ought to be made public. 
 More than 200,000 people have died in Darfur and 2.3 million have been uprooted from their homes, largely by repeated attacks from Arab militias supported and equipped by the Sudanese government.
 But while the report focuses much of its attention on the government, it says that rebel groups were also guilty of violating Council resolutions, peace treaty agreements and humanitarian standards. It recommends a tightening of the arms embargo imposed by the Security Council and other restrictions on activities involving illicit weapons, regardless of who is responsible.
 The report covers recent conduct, from September 2006 to March 12, 2007, and emerged a day after Sudan announced it was dropping its objections to large-scale United Nations assistance to the overwhelmed African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur. Sudan said Monday that it would agree to a force of 3,000 military police officers, along with six attack helicopters and other aviation and logistics support.
 Left uncertain was whether Sudan would drop its longstanding resistance to a proposed 21,000-member joint African Union-United Nations force, to replace the 7,000-member African Union force that has said it cannot curb the violence there.
 Sudan signaled its willingness to accept the interim force at a moment when at least two countries on the Security Council, Britain and the United States, were threatening tough new sanctions because of Sudan's stalling tactics.
 Diplomats say those measures include further curtailing the flow of illegal arms, broadening sanctions against individuals who undermine the peace process and imposing a no-fly zone that would put an end to the government's aerial campaign against its citizens.
 Secretary General Ban Ki-moon asked Council members last week to hold off consideration of further sanctions, to give diplomacy a chance to proceed. But on Monday, Margaret Beckett, the British foreign secretary, and Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting American ambassador, held out the possibility that tougher measures might have to be adopted at some point.
 Mr. Wolff expressed doubts about whether Sudan would carry out the agreement announced Monday, adding that he sensed a rising frustration and a diminished tolerance toward Sudan among Council members that could cause them to ''consider the need for other measures.''
 Gerard McHugh of Ireland, the coordinator of the five-person panel that has traveled widely in the region since its creation in June 2005, said he could not comment on the specific findings since they were still confidential, but he said they should be published now. ''It's actually the view of the panel that certain actions could be taken that would actually enhance the peace process rather than holding them back,'' he said. To make the report a public document requires the agreement of all 15 Council members.
 Marcello Spatafora, the United Nations ambassador from Italy, which leads the sanctions committee, said he had circulated a letter among the other 14 members asking if there were any objections to releasing the document.
 Barring objections, he would be free to make the report public in 48 hours, he said.
 In the past, China has objected to tough actions against Sudan, and in a closed meeting about Darfur on Monday, China was adamant that talk of sanctions would set back the peace process and lessen the chances of Sudanese compliance with the Council.
 The panel report said the Sudanese government had done little to disband armed groups, in particular the government-supported janjaweed militias, which the report said still carried out attacks on civilians across Darfur.
 It described a night attack by men wearing Sudanese armed forces uniforms and traveling in 60 Land Cruisers mounted with rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns to a village that they burned. A 105-year-old man was burned alive and three girls were abducted, raped and sent home naked, the report said.
 Sudanese officials also were not enforcing the travel ban and assets freeze imposed on four individuals accused of war crimes -- a Sudanese Air Force officer, an Arab militia leader and two rebel commanders -- last year by the Security Council, it said. ''The panel believes that any undue delay in the implementation of the resolution could embolden the designated individuals to carry on their acts and could also encourage others to commit violations without any fear of sanctions from the United Nations,'' the report said.
 The report said that the Sudanese government was shipping small-caliber weapons, heavy weapons, artillery pieces, ammunition and other military equipment into Darfur on cargo planes, using airports at El Geneina, Nyala and El Fasher.
 It reported that one of the planes crash-landed on Feb. 24 during a trip from Khartoum to El Geneina, and Sudanese Army officials guarded it on the ground for a week while soldiers unloaded howitzers and up to 50 wooden boxes painted in olive drab that, the panel suspected, contained arms and ammunition.
 On the painting of the planes, the report said, ''The panel believes the use of white aircraft by the government of the Sudan constitutes a deliberate attempt to conceal the identity of these aircraft.''
 The panel said that the government was refusing to give advance word, as it was directed to do by the Council, of any introduction of weapons and related equipment into Darfur. When challenged to explain its action, the government said ''it does not feel obliged to request permission in advance from the Security Council,'' the report said.
 The report said various rebel groups fighting the government were also illegally shipping weapons, regularly violating border controls between Sudan and Chad, extending lawlessness in the immediate region and attacking peacekeepers and aid workers. ''Organized crime and acts of banditry have now become a source of livelihood for the many groups operating in Darfur and in other neighboring states,'' it said.
 It said that in addition to jeopardizing the work of the United Nations and the African Union by disguising its aircraft, the government was permitting and sometimes aiding attacks and harassment of people representing the two organizations.
 ''The prevailing insecurity in Darfur and the raised level of harassment of humanitarian personnel have conspired to seriously curtail humanitarian operations through Darfur,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Hits Impasse Over Debate On Warming

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 17 

 BODY:
Britain and China faced off on Tuesday in the first United Nations Security Council debate on climate change, with Britain pushing the issue and China saying the 15-member body had no competence to deal with it. 
 The British foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, who presided over the meeting, argued that the potential for climate change to cause wars made it an issue for the Security Council, the most powerful United Nations body, but one that has a mandate to deal only with international peace and security.
''Our responsibility in this Council is to maintain international peace and security, including the prevention of conflict,'' said Ms. Beckett, whose country holds the current Council presidency. ''An unstable climate will exacerbate some of the core drivers of conflict, such as migratory pressures and competition for resources.'' 
 She noted that President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, whose economy depends on hydropower from a reservoir depleted by drought, had called climate change ''an act of aggression by the rich against the poor.''
 ''He is one of the first leaders to see this problem in security terms,'' she said. ''He will not be the last.'' She called the debate ''a groundbreaking day in the history of the Security Council.'' 
 But China's deputy ambassador, Liu Zhenmin, was blunt in rejecting the session. His nation's economy is growing fast and still depends heavily on coal and other fossil fuels that scientists say are contributing to climate change. 
 ''The developing countries believe that the Security Council has neither the professional competence in handling climate change, nor is it the right decision-making place for extensive participation leading up to widely acceptable proposals,'' he said.
 Russia, China, Qatar, Indonesia and South Africa, among others, also said the Security Council was not the place to take concrete action, though no resolution is expected.
 Pakistan argued against the debate on behalf of 130 developing nations, with many saying the Council was encroaching on more democratic bodies, like the 192-member United Nations General Assembly.
 Other developing nations, like Peru and Panama and small island states, among the most threatened by climate change, agreed with Britain. So did Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. ''Projected changes in the earth's climate are thus not only an environmental concern,'' Mr. Ban said. ''And, as the Council points up today, issues of energy and climate change can have implications for peace and security.''
 The United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases that spur climate change, opposes mandatory caps on emissions but has instead pushed alternative fuels and energy efficiency.
 The acting American ambassador, Alejandro D. Wolff, said the issue must be dealt with in a way that does not effect economic growth and development.
 Most industrial nations, including the European Union, agreed with Britain. As did Papua New Guinea, head of the Pacific small island states, which fear they may disappear under rising oceans levels as the earth warms up.
 ''The dangers that the small island states and their populations face are no less serious than those nations threatened by guns and bombs,'' Ambassador Robert Guba Aisi of Papua New Guinea told the Council.
 Italy's deputy foreign minister, Vittorio Craxi, said members should support Mr. Ban's effort to create a new United Nations Environmental Organization to coordinate action on climate change.
 ''It is clear that climate change can pose threats to national security,'' said Ambassador Kenzo Oshima of Japan. ''In the foreseeable future climate change may well create conditions or induce circumstances that could precipitate or aggravate international conflicts.''

HEADLINE: For U.S.-Nigeria Go-Between, Ties Yield Profits and Criticism

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria 

 BODY:
For years, Andrew Young, the civil rights leader, has been deeply involved in this country through the lobbying and consulting firm he heads, GoodWorks International. Its motto is: ''We do well by doing good.'' 
 But the question of what exactly GoodWorks is or is not doing here has turned Mr. Young and his firm into something of a lightning rod, as Nigerians prepare to elect a successor Saturday to this country's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, whom Mr. Young has known for 30 years.
''We believe that the relationship between GoodWorks International and Nigeria is foisted on juicy financial benefits to the former,'' said an editorial earlier this year in a newspaper here, This Day.
 For his part, Mr. Young, the former congressman, United Nations ambassador and mayor of Atlanta, dismissed such comments as sniping by opponents of Mr. Obasanjo's party, which is expected to win the weekend election. 
 But there is also little question that Nigeria has been very good for GoodWorks; thanks in part to Mr. Young's long ties to Mr. Obasanjo, his firm in Atlanta has earned millions of dollars here over the years through a network of business dealings that extend far beyond lobbying.
 As business has gone increasingly global, many consulting firms based in the United States, like GoodWorks, have increased their operations abroad, taking on assignments in developing nations like Nigeria where power and wealth are frequently concentrated in a few hands. And consulting experts say it is common for United States firms that lobby for foreign governments in Washington to also have business interests in those countries. 
 A look at GoodWorks' activities in Nigeria, based on interviews and documents, provides a window into how embedded such lobbyists can become in developing economies.
 Along with lobbying for Nigeria, for example, GoodWorks is paid to represent many major companies like Chevron, General Electric and Motorola that seek big contracts from the Nigerian government.
 In addition, executives of GoodWorks have stakes in Nigeria's oil industry, the country's main source of wealth. And several years ago, the firm's chief executive, Carlton A. Masters, started an American company with close relatives of President Obasanjo that bought an expensive Miami property with Mr. Masters's money, Florida records show.
 It is not illegal for lobbyists simultaneously to represent foreign countries and companies seeking business from them. And they are not barred from having business interests in countries they represent in Washington.
 Mr. Young and Mr. Masters also said in recent interviews that they had been scrupulous in avoiding conflicts between their governmental and corporate clients. They added that their clients who have won contracts in Nigeria have done so fairly, by outbidding competitors.
 ''We don't pay anyone under the table, and we don't accept any kind of questionable payments or relationships,'' Mr. Young said. ''We don't work with people where there are questions of integrity involved.''
 For Mr. Young, the involvement of GoodWorks in Nigeria is also one of the lesser-known chapters in a long, celebrated and at times controversial career. 
 Last year, for example, Mr. Young, who first became known as a top aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., resigned as a consultant to Wal-Mart after he said that Jewish, Arab and Korean store owners had ''ripped off'' black communities by ''selling us stale bread and bad meat.'' He subsequently apologized for the remarks.
 GoodWorks has also generated controversy here. Two years ago, for instance, one local activist filed a complaint that, among other things, criticized Mr. Masters for his role in fund-raising for a $50 million, American-style presidential library named after Mr. Obasanjo that is being built in his hometown north of this chaotic and desperately poor city. 
 Also in 2005, the Nigerian leader was the host for Mr. Masters's wedding at the official presidential banquet hall, an event that drew outcries from Mr. Obasanjo's critics.
 Several activists in Nigeria said in recent interviews that they believed that Mr. Young had decided simply to profit here from his legacy rather than use it to help a country that remains beset by problems of political corruption, crumbling infrastructure and failed school systems. 
 ''Andrew Young has never been interested in these issues,'' said Femi Falana, a human rights lawyer who is also president of the West African Bar Association. ''He is just here making money.''
 Mr. Young said that while some people still viewed him as an ''activist trapped in the '60s,'' he had decided long ago that he could effect more change by attracting private investment to places like Nigeria that needed it. 
 He also said that the Obasanjo library, which is being underwritten by donations from local politicians and companies, would benefit all Nigerians by serving as a conference center.
 ''For 40 years of my life, I was on the outside seeking change,'' he said. ''I realized that I could be more effective being on the inside implementing it.''
 GoodWorks, which Mr. Young and Mr. Masters helped found in 1996, has also lobbied in the United States for Rwanda and Turks and Caicos Islands. Mr. Young declined to disclose the firm's revenue but said that the vast bulk of it came from its operations here.
 A spokesman for Mr. Obasanjo, Uba Sani, said that the Nigerian government was pleased with GoodWorks' performance, describing the firm as ''good friends of Nigeria.'' And Mr. Masters said much of the recent criticism of GoodWorks was coming from those who did not want to see the firm's lobbying contract, which expired in April, renewed by Nigeria's next president. After eight consecutive years as president, Mr. Obasanjo is barred from running again.
 GoodWorks' dealings in Nigeria reflect Mr. Young's relationship over three decades with Mr. Obasanjo. And like much else in Mr. Young's life, it is a relationship filled with a mix of drama, ideals and opportunism.
 The two men met in the late 1970s, when Mr. Obasanjo, then a general, first served as this country's president, one in a long line of military figures who ruled Nigeria. 
 ''Obasanjo and I kind of hit it off immediately,'' said Mr. Young, who was the United States ambassador to the United Nations at the time. ''We were mainly concerned with democracy.''
 Two decades later, the names of Mr. Young and Mr. Obasanjo, who was no longer in public office, appeared together in a United States Senate report about the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the rogue financial institution.
 The report criticized Mr. Young for, among other things, trying to obtain a bank loan to help Mr. Obasanjo start a farm equipment company for which he would have worked as a consultant.
 That deal never went forward. But in the mid-1990s, Mr. Young found himself urging Gen. Sani Abacha, then Nigeria's president, to release a number of political opponents he had jailed, including Mr. Obasanjo. In 1999, the year after his release, Mr. Obasanjo was voted president in democratic elections.
 Mr. Young said he believed that his old ally had since reshaped the country for the better by eliminating entrenched corruption and raising the quality of life. 
 ''There isn't anything that's happened in Africa worthwhile, almost since 1960, that he hasn't been involved in,'' Mr. Young said.
 Some activists credit Mr. Obasanjo for certain improvements, like taking some steps to increase the transparency of how this country's oil wealth is distributed. But they added that he has allowed Nigeria's infrastructure to disintegrate further while a small group of insiders has grown richer; electrical blackouts are routine and highways are so bad that short journeys can take hours.
 Mr. Masters said that GoodWorks, which became Nigeria's lobbyist in 2001, had worked with officials there to reduce the country's international debts. But unlike some lobbyists for foreign governments, the firm appears to have done little to influence American policy toward its client. For instance, GoodWorks said that it had ''no recollection'' of a single instance in which it represented Nigeria in talks with any federal overseas development agencies.
 Instead, the firm, apparently in keeping with Mr. Young's philosophy, has focused its energies on business development in Nigeria and representing companies before Mr. Obasanjo's government.
 Mr. Masters said that GoodWorks typically received a ''success fee'' equal to 1 1/2 percent of a contract's value, a fee that can lead to big payouts. In 2005, for example, G.E. Energy, a GoodWorks client, won a $400 million contract to supply generating turbines in Nigeria.
 The company, a subsidiary of General Electric, said in a statement that it had a ''standard sales representative agreement'' with GoodWorks, but declined to elaborate. 
 Mr. Young said that GoodWorks has started small companies here that employ Nigerians. But the company also has other local business interests. For example, the head of the company's Nigerian office is the major shareholder in a local energy company, Suntrust Oil, which won a lease during a 2002 government auction of offshore fields that did not interest major energy companies.
 While Mr. Young, 75, still serves as the firm's public face, it is Mr. Masters, in his late 50s, who spends much of his time traveling through Africa and the Caribbean. Along the way he has made his own connections.
 In 2001, for instance, Mr. Masters formed a Florida company, Sunscope Investments, with Mr. Obasanjo's brother-in-law and his wife, that purchased a Miami condominium for about $750,000, Florida public records indicate.
 Asked about the issue, Mr. Masters said in a written statement that he had put up the money that Sunscope used to buy the property. He added, however, that Mr. Obasanjo's relatives had quickly lost interest in the venture and had not profited from it in any way. 
 Florida records indicate that Mr. Obasanjo's sister-in-law, Yamisi Abebe, remained an officer of Sunscope until last year, when the company was dissolved and transferred its interest in the condominium to Mr. Masters for a nominal sum.
 One lobbying expert, Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan group in Washington that monitors lobbying, said that given Mr. Masters's multiple lobbying roles in Nigeria, his decision to involve President Obasanjo's relatives in his business dealings was troubling.
 ''It looks like hell,'' Mr. Lewis said.
 Mr. Masters stated he had done nothing wrong.
 This weekend's election will decide whether Umaru Yar'Adua, the candidate of Mr. Obasanjo's party, will succeed him. If he does, it is far more likely that GoodWorks will remain Nigeria's lobbyist than if one of the opposing parties is elected. 
 ''We've never gotten involved in politics,'' Mr. Young said earlier this year. ''We've tried to stay friendly with everyone.''

HEADLINE: Army Cost-Cutting in Budget Standoff May Actually Add to Costs

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
As the Army juggles its financial accounts and cuts logistical corners to maintain combat operations during a budget standoff between the White House and Congress, efficiency and economy are likely to be the first casualties.
 The Army has announced that it would squeeze out money for the continuing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan by requesting the temporary transfer of $1.6 billion from Air Force and Navy payrolls and slowing the purchase of spare parts and other supplies not bound for those countries. It also said it would freeze new civilian hires and suspend some service contracts.
Whether in war or in peace, this kind of stop-and-start spending pattern has long been recognized as one of the chief sources of inefficiency and cost overruns in military programs, which are always subject to the shifting priorities reflected in annual White House budget proposals and subsequent Congressional spending legislation. 
 Faced last year with a budget standoff between the White House and Congress, then held by Republicans, the Army pinched pennies by making moves similar to this year's to guarantee money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It halted civilian hiring, froze orders for nonessential spare parts, reduced administrative travel and transferred large sums from other Army accounts to its combat operations.
 Pentagon budget officials have said that extra costs resulting from unusual spending restrictions are seen first in the area of contracts. ''Rather than sign a long-term contract, one tied to performance, we may have to contract for goods and services incrementally, job by job as required, under these new rules,'' said a Pentagon budget official who was not authorized to speak for attribution. ''That is a nightmare. It is inefficient, and more expensive. You would never run your household that way.''
 This year's steps, announced Monday night, were devised to find money to continue Army combat operations through June -- time, perhaps, for the White House and Congress to settle their differences.
 ''In order to stretch the money it has, the Army will tell commanders to slow spending in certain areas so that war-related activities and support to families can continue,'' said an official Army statement announcing the new spending restrictions.
 For the next two months, the Pentagon statement said, purchasing regular supplies with government charge cards will be restricted, nonessential travel will be postponed or canceled, and shipping equipment or supplies will be restricted or deferred ''unless needed immediately for war efforts.'' The Army, it said, ''will delay the repair of facilities and environmental programs unless the work is for safety or health reasons, or impacts on family support.''
 Many of the measures will roll out in sequence. ''If the budget impasse is not resolved by May, the Army will freeze new civilian hiring, will release temporary employees and will cease entering into new contracts while suspending some service contracts for training and facilities,'' the Army announced. ''Orders for nonessential spare parts and supplies will be canceled.'' Those actions ''carry consequential effects, including substantial disruption to installation functions, decreasing efficiency and potentially further degrading the readiness of nondeployed units,'' the Army statement said. 
 William H. Campbell, the deputy director for the Army budget, said the service learned last year that some of its spending targets, programs with high visibility and impact, yielded little savings. Thus, this year, the Army will not restrict its summer hiring program, since last year's freeze on that effort ''brought very, very little in return,'' he said.
 One other difference between the set of levers chosen by the Army this year over last is the request for borrowing funds from Air Force and Navy personnel accounts. Last year, the $1.4 billion in money switched between programs came from within the Army.
 Because of the unexpected nature of last year's spending battle, Gen. Richard Cody, the Army vice chief of staff, announced spending restrictions in late May that were rushed into effect over just a few weeks. This year's restrictions ratchet up the cost-cutting measures more gradually, over the next eight weeks.
 ''Frankly, what I worry about is that second- or third-order effect that might affect a soldier or a soldier's safety or his ability to do a mission,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''As we put these brakes on, I do worry about the impact that we don't know about, that someone will take some action trying to do the right thing, but it will have a negative impact on the ability of a soldier to do his or her job.''
 Most of the new spending restrictions ''are not savings,'' he said. ''We are deferring when we will spend the money.''

HEADLINE: Maybe Only God Can Make a Tree, but Only People Can Put a Price on It

BYLINE: By DAVID K. RANDALL

 BODY:
It seems like a Zen koan: how much is a New York City tree worth? Since New York's first park was created in 1733, the various incarnations of the modern Parks and Recreation Department have tried to quantify a resource that at best is viewed as inherently valuable, like sunshine, or at worst is chopped down. 
 ''Trees are great for a variety of reasons, but how do you explain that to the Office of Management and Budget?'' Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, has said. 
Now, for the first time, the Parks Department can actually translate the value of the city's trees into real dollars and cents. And as expected, it's a big number.
 Step 1 was a tree census, a two-year process that sent more than 1,000 volunteers to count every tree on every street in the city. The census results were then fed into a computer program that spit out a dollar value for each of the 592,130 trees counted, a figure that does not include the roughly 4.5 million trees in parks and on private land. 
 The program, called Stratum, was developed by researchers at the University of California at Davis and the United States Forest Service. It takes into account several factors, including a tree's impact on local property values, its contribution to cleaning the air by absorbing carbon dioxide, and how much its shade helps reduce energy consumption.
 Factoring in the costs associated with planting and upkeep, New York City's street trees provide an annual benefit of about $122 million, according to the Parks Department. The study concludes that New York receives $5.60 in benefits for every dollar spent on trees. 
 Trees in lower-density areas, typically in Queens and on Staten Island, are generally more valuable than those in Manhattan and high-density areas of Brooklyn and the Bronx because they provide the greatest environmental benefits, according to Fiona Watt, chief of forestry and horticulture for the city. ''Trees in front of single-family homes will provide greater shade, and it's intuitive that a large tree in front of a home seems to resonate more than the same tree in front of a huge apartment building,'' she said.
 Trees with large leaves, like London plane trees or maple trees, are more valuable because they provide more shade and consume more carbon dioxide. 
 The information on the economics of the city's trees gives the Parks Department concrete evidence when it comes to budget discussions, Mr. Benepe said. ''We plan on using these values as a baseline to say that this is what we have now, and argue for additional funds to plant more trees,'' he said. 
 The tree census found that Queens has about 40 percent of the city's street trees, followed by Brooklyn, with about 25 percent; Staten Island, with about 16 percent; the Bronx, with about 10 percent; and Manhattan, with roughly 8 percent. 
 The city has made planting more trees as a small way to improve air quality part of a broad plan developed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to make the city a better place to live by 2030. Mr. Benepe called it ''a happy coincidence'' that the tree census puts a dollar value on a tree's environmental benefits at the same time that the city is trying to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. 
 The first step in determining a tree's environmental value is measuring the rate at which different tree species absorb pollutants. This is being done at a monitoring station at the University of California that simulates New York's City's climate, said Dr. Greg McPherson, the lead designer of the computer program and the director of the Forest Service's Center for Urban Forest Research. 
 Dollar values are assigned through an equation that compares carbon dioxide emissions from power plants with the amount of carbon dioxide that a tree species takes in, he said. Power plant smokestack emissions are used because they are easily traceable in the atmosphere, Dr. McPherson said. 
 The computer model determines a tree's environmental value based on how much carbon it absorbs that would have to be eliminated from the air through some other means, and how much less carbon is emitted by power-generating plants because of a reduced demand for energy resulting from a tree's shade.
 To calculate the dollar effect of a tree on property values, the city used a 1988 study in Athens, Ga., that found that homes with a tree in front sell for almost 1 percent more than similar homes without trees. The city took the median value of a single-family home sold in 2005 as a constant and based each tree's contribution on its size, location and species. A large tree in front of a single-family home would have the highest value, while a small tree in front of an apartment building would have the lowest value. 
 Dr. McPherson said he developed his computer program over the last 25 years by incorporating several studies that showed the economic benefits of trees.
 ''I hope this model provides ammunition for people on the front lines who have to battle for budgets to maintain their trees and expand their urban forests,'' he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 26, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 18 about a program that allows the city to calculate the dollar value of its trees referred imprecisely to one of the environmental benefits. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is a primary contributor to global warming, but that process has no effect on the cleanliness of the air.

HEADLINE: The Harlem Revival Brings in the Shops

BYLINE: By CLAIRE WILSON

 BODY:
An increasingly vigorous retail scene on Harlem's main commercial street is likely to gain further headway in the next five years as four parcels are set for development into offices and shops geared to a residential population that is becoming more prosperous. 
 Scattered along the bustling 125th Street corridor from Second Avenue to Amsterdam Avenue in northern Manhattan, each of the projects includes two or more floors of retailing aimed to attract high-profile and high-fashion national chains that historically have been absent from the mix in Harlem. Real estate professionals say they understand that a prominent department store is also looking at the street. 
''Retailers are getting the message,'' said Eric S. Yarbro, senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis, a commercial brokerage firm. ''They are looking at the market and wondering how they can tap into the existing density and those higher-income families that now have to go south of 96th Street to get the basic services they need.'' 
 The projects that are on the books include a 30,000-square-foot three-story retail complex at 261 West 125th Street next to the Apollo Theater. It is being developed by Grid Properties in partnership with the Gotham Organization, according to Drew Greenwald, the president of Grid Properties. The site had been a vacant lot since the mid-1980s, when fire destroyed a small office building. 
 On the corner of West 125th Street and Lenox Avenue, Wharton Realty is developing a 33,000-square-foot parcel into 230,000 square feet of space that includes three stories of retailing and either a community facility or residential units on upper floors. The shops could open as early as next spring. A five-story building with about a dozen stores at ground level formerly occupied the site. 
 Vornado Realty Trust will be developing the southwest corner of Park Avenue and East 125th Street. According to a spokeswoman, the project is expected to be in excess of 600,000 square feet with several levels of retailing capped by numerous floors of office space. Formerly a parking lot owned by the New York College of Podiatric Medicine, it is adjacent to the Metro-North train station. 
 On East 125th Street between Second and Third Avenues, a proposed development involves three contiguous parcels owned by New York City. From October to January, the city's Economic Development Corporation solicited bids for the six-acre site, where the plans include 300,000 square feet of retail space. A portion of that is expected to be taken by national chains while other space is earmarked for local retailers, restaurants, a movie theater, nonprofit cultural groups and 1,000 units of affordable housing. According to the development corporation, a hotel is also a possibility. In the late 1990s, there were plans to develop the site into an outlet mall, but community opposition quashed that idea. 
 The final size and scope of the new projects will not be determined until a river-to-river rezoning plan currently in the works is passed by the City Planning Department; no date has been set for approval.
 Business is brisk, meanwhile, along the corridor. FedEx Kinkos signed its first lease in the area last month, joining a roster that includes Staples, Starbucks, Marshall's, Pathmark, Children's Place, Old Navy and H&M. 
 A Chase bank branch is moving to a larger 6,000-square-foot location adjacent to its original in Harlem USA, a multilevel urban retail complex, where other tenants are also expanding. Open only since December, Chuck E. Cheese, the Texas-based family entertainment and restaurant chain, is adding 5,000 square feet to its original 15,000 square feet of space. The New York Sports Clubs, one of the charter tenants in the complex when it opened in 2003, is expanding for the second time.
 According to Mr. Greenwald, the developer with the Gotham Organization of Harlem USA, his lessees on this swath of 125th Street report that average sales in January were 30 percent ahead of sales one year earlier. 
 Among locally owned businesses that are specifically aimed at more sophisticated customers are Citarella, the specialized grocery chain; the high-end MAC makeup line; and Carol's Daughter, a bath-and-skin-care products company. Others include the restaurant Mo-Bay, which serves Southern and Jamaican specialties; the Harlem Lanes bowling alley and restaurant; the Triple Candie gallery exhibition space; and farther afield, a brunch spot called the Settepani Bakery. 
 According to Barbara Askins, president and chief executive of the 125th Street Business Improvement District, the vacancy rate has hovered between 2 and 3 percent for some time.
 Despite that, and the street's status as a transportation hub with subways, buses and a Metro-North station, rents have remained much lower than in comparable shopping corridors around the city. 
 Rates are now $150 to $200 on prime blocks between Lenox Avenue and St. Nicholas Avenue, according to figures provided by RKF & Associates. This compares with $400 a square foot for comparable property on East 86th Street and Lexington Avenue or $275 a square foot on Broadway in the West 80s and West 90s. Both of those areas are relatively near to Harlem and are already frequented by residents of the neighborhood.
 Prices on 125th Street have increased by only 50 percent over the last five years, said Barry Fishbach, executive vice president for RKF. Prices in the two neighborhoods farther south have doubled in that time. 
 Prices on 125th Street vary greatly according to location and age of the buildings, which range from 100-year-old low-rise structures to gleaming complexes like the Harlem Center.
 Eugene Fata, principal in the Fata Organization, who owns a number of buildings on West 125th Street, as well as a vacant parcel at 350 West 125th Street, says the spread among his leases is from $30 a square foot to ''$200 in select corner locations.'' 
 Scott Auster, a broker with the Ripco Real Estate Corporation, said rents on East 125th Street are much lower than those on the busier West 125th Street. ''Rents range from about $100 per square foot to $125 per square foot on East 125th Street,'' he said. ''It's less developed. There's less retail over all and less traffic.'' 
 But, over all, the continued vigor of the housing market from 96th Street to 145th Street and the planned expansion of Columbia University are giving the area the critical mass of consumers that attract retailers.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Profit Is Up, Despite Slow U.S. Sales

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. reported solid gains in quarterly profit and modest growth in revenue yesterday, as the company's strategic shift toward higher-margin software and services makes gradual progress.
 The largest information technology services company, International Business Machines is also a major global supplier of software and hardware to corporations. So its results are closely watched as a barometer of corporate spending on technology.
The results paint a picture of dynamic markets in the Asia-Pacific region, notably China and India; a rebound in Europe, with the big German market especially strong; a continuing recovery in Japan; and sluggishness in the United States. 
 Sales in the Americas grew only 1 percent, to $9.1 billion. Within that geographic market, which is the company's largest, business in Canada and South America held up fairly well, but the United States was the source of weakness. 
 In a conference call yesterday afternoon, Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said the falloff in the United States was most pronounced in March, particularly among large corporations. 
 Based on customer prospects and field reports, Mr. Loughridge expressed confidence that I.B.M. would see ''some improvement'' in the current quarter in the United States.
 Still, at a time when economists are concerned about whether softness in business investment will slow the American economy this year, the I.B.M. results suggest there is cause for concern.
 ''The one surprise here was the weakness in the U.S.,'' said David Grossman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco.
 I.B.M. shares closed slightly higher, up 94 cents at $97.12 a share. In after-hours trading, shares slipped 63 cents, to $96.49. In contrast to the sluggish performance in the United States, the company's sales in China rose 31 percent from a year ago, and sales in India increased 24 percent.
 I.B.M.'s quarterly revenue rose 7 percent, to $22 billion, but the increase was only 4 percent in constant currency after adjusting for the weakness of the dollar. Earnings per share rose 12 percent, to $1.21. 
 That performance matched the consensus estimates of Wall Street analysts for profit and slightly exceeded their projections for revenue, as compiled by Thomson Financial.
 The company's global services business grew by 8 percent, to $12.4 billion. Within the overall services business, the unit that handles high-end consulting work -- helping companies use technology to streamline their procurement, manufacturing and marketing -- grew 9 percent, to $4.2 billion. 
 Profit margins in that unit, called global business services, have improved for eight consecutive quarters to 10.5 percent, or 2 percentage points higher than a year ago.
 That is crucial to I.B.M.'s strategy to move further up the ladder in the services business to work that requires more specialized skills. 
 Revenue at I.B.M.'s other services unit, which includes managing data centers for corporate customers and maintenance, rose 7 percent, to $8.3 billion, but its profit margins fell 2.5 percentage points in the past year, to 7.8 percent, which the company attributed to high costs in the United States. 
 I.B.M.'s big services business is under pressure from rivals, especially Indian outsourcing specialists, who contend that they will do to the technology services industry what the Japanese did in autos: compete first on price and later with superior quality and products. 
 Though far smaller than I.B.M., the Indian services companies are growing rapidly. Within the last few days, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, for example, each reported that its most recent quarterly revenue rose more than 40 percent from the year-earlier quarter.
 I.B.M.'s software sales rose 9 percent, to $4.3 billion, helped by particularly strong growth products like its Websphere line, which uses Internet software standards to link a company's programs, and its Tivoli data center management software.
 Hardware revenue increased only 2 percent, to $4.5 billion. Within the division, results were mixed. Mainframe sales increased 12 percent and big Unix server computers rose 14 percent, but minicomputer sales fell 13 percent.
 I.B.M.'s computer chip business fell 7 percent from a year ago, but the company said that was mainly because last year was a peak period of demand for video-game chips used in the Microsoft Xbox, the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo Wii machines in the long run-up to product introductions last holiday season.
 The company's storage systems business was also a disappointment, with sales falling 1 percent. Earlier yesterday, EMC, the leader in storage systems, reported that its quarterly revenue rose 17 percent, to $2.98 billion, and its earnings per share rose 36 percent, to 15 cents a share.

HEADLINE: Veal to Love, Without the Guilt

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
THE most successful animal rights boycott in the United States started more than 20 years ago and had nothing to do with foie gras. 
 When photographs of formula-fed veal calves tethered in crates where they could not turn around appeared across the country, sales of veal plummeted. They have never recovered. In the 1950s and 1960s Americans ate four pounds of veal a year on average. Today per capital consumption is around half a pound a year.
It wasn't until a few years ago that some farmers finally got the message and changed the way their calves were raised.
 Some returned to the old-fashioned method of putting them out to pasture with their mothers. John Holloway of Misty Morning Farm in Cherry Tree, Pa. was one of them. ''Unfortunately I was a sinner,'' he said. ''I did raise factory veal -- all the chemicals, antibiotics, steroids I used. We wouldn't let our friends eat what we used to raise. For our own use we were raising humane veal.'' Now all of his veal is pastured and organic. 
 Others got rid of the crates but kept the calves in barn pens, letting them mingle with other calves and giving them room to walk and turn around. Calves raised this way are still separated from their mothers, and most still get a milk-replacement formula, not mother's milk. But some also get grain along with the milk replacement. 
 Those changes on the farm have led to corollary changes in the kitchen -- a culinary serendipity that is just beginning to be recognized. Veal from calves fed sufficient grass or grain as well as milk has real character and flavor. For anyone who knows only the bland old-fashioned veal, it is as if a brand-new ingredient has been discovered. Tasting this new veal is not unlike biting into your first heirloom tomato from the garden after a lifetime of eating supermarket tomatoes bred for durability.
 Even Stanley Lobel of the fine-meat purveyor Lobel's of New York -- where veal from crated formula-fed calves was once valued beyond all others because of its ''cut it with a fork'' tenderness -- says the new veal is better. ''Veal becomes more flavorful if it's allowed to walk around,'' he said.
 Unlike the formula-fed veal -- prized for its whiteness, which comes from a lack of iron -- almost all grass- or grain-fed veal raised outside crates not only is rosy or pink, but has a delightfully clean, subtle beef taste. The names it is sold under reflect the changes: meadow, red, rose, pastured, grass-fed, free-range and suckled. Not all of it can be cut with a fork, but an ordinary dinner knife works fine.
 In a tasting of 20 samples raised by the newer, more humane methods, the tastiest veal was from animals raised on grass or grain, or both, along with milk. The samples -- from producers, restaurants and grocery stores -- were from calves four to six months old. Those fed formula only, even under the more tolerable living conditions, were not as flavorful. 
 Chefs who once refused to serve formula-fed veal because of its blandness are now delighted to have the newer version. 
 ''I just never liked it because it didn't have a lot of flavor,'' said Bill Telepan of the old-style veal. At his restaurant, Telepan, on the Upper West Side, he now serves veal whenever he can get it from Duane Merrill's farm in upstate New York. ''This tastes like something very much like mild beef. If veal is on the menu it sells, and people like it.''
 In a sentiment repeated by other chefs, Mr. Telepan added, ''People are more hip to eating things that are raised right, and they trust I will get something that is well taken care of.''
 At Wolfgang Puck's restaurant Spago in Beverly Hills, Calif., Wiener schnitzel from humanely raised veal is the third most popular item. ''If we feed the animals better, treat them better, we will have a better product and a healthier product,'' Mr. Puck said in a telephone interview. He recently announced that he would serve meat only from humanely raised animals. 
 The Animal Agriculture Alliance, a meat industry lobbying group, says that Mr. Puck has surrendered to ''groups that would prefer he not be serving any animal products at all. ''The alliance says its members follow animal welfare guidelines. 
 And the American Veal Association, a majority of whose members still raise their animals in crates, maintains that the new kinds of veal on the market don't even deserve the name. ''We don't believe it's veal,'' said Bryan Scott, the executive vice president for legislative and regulatory affairs. ''By definition, any animal that's grass-fed or grain-fed has taste and texture and characteristics of beef animals. We believe they should be called calf or young steer.''
 Such assertions carry no official weight: the United States Agriculture Department has no definition of veal. But ''we're working on it,'' said Steve Cohen, a spokesman. 
 Farm Sanctuary, an organization that sponsors a campaign urging people not to eat veal, acknowledges that raising animals in pens rather than in individual crates is more humane. But the organization believes, as its president, Gene Baur, put it, that ''the least objectionable way to do it is on pasture.'' That said, he added, ''We think vegan is better.'' 
 Pen-raising gets some backing from Humane Farm Animal Care, an organization approved by the Humane Society and the A.S.P.C.A. Animals raised in pens can earn the organization's ''certified humane'' label, but they must be fed some kind of forage (grain), and they must be raised under a strict protocol that governs their living conditions, their transport to slaughter and the slaughter itself.
 The humane treatment of veal calves has become so important that even the American Veal Association points out on its Web site that calves that are still kept in crates can lie down in them. Nothing is said about their inability to turn around. 
 ''The industry moves with consumer demand,'' said Mr. Scott of the Veal Association. So far, that demand has moved the association's members only so much: of the veal they sell, 10 percent is now raised in group pens rather than crates. Mr. Scott said that figure is unlikely to rise to more than 25 percent because it costs so much to make the changes.
 Jonathan and Nina White of Bobolink Dairy in Vernon, N.J., known for its cheeses, have watched the turnaround in what shoppers will eat. They once raised their bull calves for beef, but when the herd grew too big they started using those calves for veal. 
 ''In 2003 people were horrified at the idea I would sell veal,'' Mr. White said. ''It took several years with customers seeing calves running free with moms to come around to the idea it's O.K. to eat them, that they have actually had a life. By 2004 they were encouraging me to sell them.''
 The changes in the industry have had a measurable impact on sales. D'Agostino, the 20-store supermarket chain in New York, said that its sales of veal have jumped 35 percent since it began carrying ''certified humane'' veal only. 
 People like Elaine Burden of Middleburg, Va., who stopped eating veal about 10 years ago, have come back. Ayrshire Farm, an 800-acre organic farm in nearby Upperville, is selling certified-humane veal at its Home Farm Store in Middleburg, and she is buying it. ''I'm delighted we can have it again,'' she said. ''Psychologically you feel better because it can graze on the fresh field of grass. It's a more natural and wholesome way to eat. But in fact, the taste is better.''
 Even a vegetarian can have a change of heart. Zach Schulman, a community garden organizer with Green Guerillas, a nonprofit group that helps establish and maintain community gardens in New York, considers himself mostly vegetarian. But he worked for a time at Bobolink Dairy and enjoys the veal raised there. 
 ''I know the cows at the farm and have seen how they live and where they live and how they are treated,'' Mr. Schulman said. ''And it makes sense from an ethical standpoint, and it makes sense sustainably and in terms of supporting a small local farm.'' 
 ''Eating that veal felt right,'' he added, ''but it's really just occasional -- a few times a year.'' 
 Humanely raised veal, particularly the pastured variety, is not easy to find and commands a premium price. One reason is that many barriers face small farmers who feed their animals milk, along with grass or grain, or a combination of the two. Consolidation of the meat industry has put many small slaughterhouses out of business and has made it harder for small farmers to find distribution channels. Most grass- or grain-fed veal is found at farm stands and farmers' markets. 
 Not all the drop in veal sales over the years can be attributed to the boycott. Supplies have also shrunk because the demand for beef has been increasing and dairy herds have shrunk. (Traditionally, dairy farmers have raised their bull calves for veal.) 
 Bill Niman, founder of Niman Ranch, who is noted for helping small farmers raise their animals without antibiotics or hormones, has had a hard time trying to start a program for humanely raised veal. His first effort, a few years ago, was abandoned temporarily, he said, ''because the economics of it didn't work: milk was so expensive.'' Mr. Niman said would try again in the next year or two. ''It is best thing for male offspring of dairy breeds if they actually became part of veal culture,'' he said. ''That is certainly what is happening in Europe.''
 Dr. George Saperstein, a veterinarian at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts, has created a small pastured-veal success story in New England, where the tradition of eating veal is stronger than elsewhere in the country. But his vision met resistance at first. (Though not from me: the sample I tasted was very tender, juicy and sweet, and it had a delicate beef taste.)
 First he had to persuade farmers that they would make money selling veal; then he had to persuade restaurants to serve it. ''I met with blank stares when I first mentioned it to farmers,'' he said. ''We've been selling for three years now under the name Azuluna. The first year we sold about 60; last year between 250 and 300 calves, and we are representing between 15 to 20 farmers throughout the Northeast.
 ''It's sort of retro agriculture.'' DIJON- AND ROSEMARY-CRUSTED VEAL CHOP WITH DANDELION AND LEMON-ANCHOVY VINAIGRETTE Adapted from Ignacio Mattos and Adam Weisell, Il Buco Time: 30 minutes For the chops: 4 veal chops, no more than 1 inch thick, fat removed Salt and coarsely ground black pepper 2 cups fresh bread crumbs, preferably from ciabatta 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 cup Dijon mustard For the salad and vinaigrette: 2 medium heads radicchio, cut into large chunks 8 ounces whole baby dandelion leaves, curly endive or arugula 3 anchovy fillets, roughly chopped 1 to 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped or pounded in a mortar Coarsely chopped zest and juice of half a lemon 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Salt Olive oil, for frying. 1. For chops: Season chops with salt and pepper to taste. In a large bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, rosemary, thyme, garlic and coarsely ground black pepper. Spread a generous layer of mustard on front and back (but not sides) of each chop, and pat with a thick layer of bread crumb mixture. 2. For salad and vinaigrette: In a large mixing bowl, combine radicchio and dandelion leaves. In a small bowl, combine anchovies, garlic, lemon zest and juice, and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Whisk in the extra virgin olive oil, season with salt to taste and add more vinegar if desired; mixture should be slightly sharp. 3. For assembly: Place a large skillet over medium heat. Add enough olive oil (about 1/2 inch) to come halfway up sides of chops. When oil shimmers add chops and let them cook until golden brown and crisp on undersides, about 7 minutes. Turn, and continue to fry about 7 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer stuck into the chop shows 135 (for medium-rare) to 140 degrees (for medium). 4. Whisk vinaigrette, and add about half to salad, tossing and adding more as desired. On each of four plates place a chop and a portion of salad. Serve immediately. Yield: 4 servings. SLOW-ROASTED SHOULDER OF VEAL WITH SPRING VEGETABLES Adapted from Bill Telepan Time: 2 hours, 15 minutes 1 3-pound boneless veal shoulder, rolled and tied Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons olive oil 8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter 12 baby spring onions or scallions, trimmed to 2 inches 4 large artichoke hearts, 1 inch of stem left on, cut into 4 or 5 slices 3/4 cup fresh or frozen peas 1/2 cup vegetable or chicken stock 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley. 1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Season veal with salt and pepper to taste. Place a large roasting pan over high heat; add oil, and heat until shimmering. Add veal, and sear until well browned on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons butter, and let it melt and brown. Baste veal with butter, and transfer pan to oven. 2. While veal roasts, turn and baste it every 15 minutes for 1 hour. Then carefully drain butter and oil from pan, melt 2 more tablespoons butter in pan and baste roast. Return to oven and continue turning and basting roast until it reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees, about 30 minutes longer. Remove roast from pan, set aside and keep warm; do not drain pan. 3. Return pan to medium heat on stove. Add 2 more tablespoons butter. When it has melted add spring onions or scallions, and cook until translucent and lightly caramelized, 5 to 7 minutes. Add artichokes, and cook 3 minutes longer. Add peas, stock and 2 remaining tablespoons butter. 4. Cook, scraping bottom of pan with a wooden spoon, until reduced to a glaze, about 5 minutes. Add thyme and parsley, and adjust salt and pepper as needed. To serve, slice veal thinly, and serve topped with glazed vegetables. Yield: 6 servings. Finding Character and Flavor

HEADLINE: Trailer-Park Sales Squeeze Out Residents

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

DATELINE: SYOSSET, N.Y., April 11 

 BODY:
In the middle of Long Island's Gold Coast, where home prices easily reach $1 million, sits the Syosset Mobile Home Park, where a trailer can be had for under $50,000 and the monthly fee for taxes, water and sewage runs about $500. The children growing up in the park's 80 narrow homes attend Syosset schools, reputed to be among the best in the country.
 But fliers stuffed in the mailboxes next to the decorated trailer hitches and propane tanks on April 9 brought bad news: The park had been sold. It was left to the affable handyman to expand on the single-sentence announcement, explaining that the new owners had told him they planned to replace the 250 working-class residents' single-wide slice of the American dream with luxury housing.
''I was totally dumbfounded,'' said Debbie St. Clair, a Web site developer in her mid-50s who moved to an aging blue-and-white trailer here three years ago after finding she could not afford even a small house in Nassau County. ''When I bought, no one ever told me the land could be sold out from under us. I planned on spending the rest of my life here.'' 
 Syosset, the last remaining trailer park in Nassau and one of a dwindling number in the New York suburbs, is among several in the region being snapped up by developers in an ever-tightening real estate market. Hidden behind shabby fences, they have persisted for decades as quiet pockets of affordability in expensive enclaves, but as sprawl has grown denser and property values have increased, these parks are steadily being squeezed out. 
 Local officials and homeowners have long regarded the parks as blight, and now their owners are finding it harder to turn down lucrative offers from developers wanting to build high-end town houses or shopping malls.
 It is happening at the Manhattan Mobile Home Park in North Bergen, N.J., a 10-minute drive from the Lincoln Tunnel, and also at Knolls Trailer Court in Mahopac, N.Y. Two parks in Lodi, N.J., are fighting a plan by local government to replace them with a shopping center and housing for the elderly. Other parks are besieged with fears of closing, including the Frontier Mobile Home Park in Amityville, N.Y., where a used single-wide goes for as little as $10,000 and the trip to Midtown Manhattan by train or car is about an hour.
 For residents, who typically own their trailers but rent the plots they sit on, often on one-year leases, such a sale can quickly turn a $50,000 asset into a liability. In New York State, owners are required to give residents written notice of a pending sale, but no compensation, and can begin eviction proceedings six months after leases expire. Many of the decades-old trailers could not survive being moved even on a flatbed truck, and available plots in the dwindling number of local parks are almost nonexistent.
 So Assemblyman Marc S. Alessi, a Democrat who watched the 30-unit Roll-In Mobile Home Park in his Suffolk County close in 2005 and be turned into a Walgreens, has proposed legislation that would require park owners to consider a fair market value bid from the trailer owners before selling to outsiders, similar to laws already on the books in New Jersey and Connecticut. 
 ''These mobile home owners have nowhere to go,'' Mr. Alessi said. ''People have invested in these trailer homes, but they're no longer trailers. They're stuck on their plots, so the owner has no bargaining power.'' 
 Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr., a Republican who is also pushing a bill to allow trailer owners to make court challenges to large rent increases in the parks, agreed. ''These people invested in their homes with the understanding they could stay on the land,'' said Mr. Thiele, whose Suffolk district includes mobile home parks in the Hamptons and Montauk. ''But they wind up being at the mercy of whatever the landowner decides to do.''
 The lawmakers say suburban trailer parks have become a crucial affordable housing alternative amid rising home prices, and census figures show that their populations are increasingly younger, better educated and more solidly middle class than previous generations of trailer park residents. 
 In Suffolk County's approximately 40 parks, the median household income increased to $43,825 in 2005 from $33,015 in 1990, a much bigger jump than the overall increase in the county, to $78,900 from $76,547. The median age of the park residents fell to 48 from 61, while the median age in Suffolk overall rose to 37 from 33.
 At the same time, the percentage of trailer-park residents with a college degree more than doubled, to 18.2 percent in 2005 from 7.7 percent in 1990, and the percentage lacking a high-school diploma dropped to 14.5 from 33.7. (In both cases, the changes outpace those in the county overall: college degree holders jumped to 31.7 percent from 23.2, and those without diplomas dipped to 10.2 percent from 17.7.)
 There are some 75,000 trailers in 2,100 parks across New York State, including about 15,000 in 300 parks ranging in size from 5 to 400 units within a 75-mile drive from New York City, according to the New York Housing Association, a trade group for the factory-built home industry. (Just one is within the New York City limits: Goethals Garden Homes Community in Staten Island, a clutch of 130 trailers between a marsh and the Staten Island Expressway near the Goethals Bridge.)
 There are roughly 250 trailer parks across Connecticut, according to state officials. No numbers were available in New Jersey, either from the state government or the industry association.
 The longtime owner of the Manhattan Mobile Home Park in North Bergen, N.J., died last year, and the property will soon be sold, according to Paul Kaufman, administrator of the late owner's estate. He said several residential developers had expressed interest since a light rail station opened next to the park. 
 ''We feel like sitting ducks,'' said Maria Castaneda, who has lived in the park about 10 years and takes a quick bus ride to her job as a hair stylist in the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Manhattan's West Side. ''This park is a godsend. How else could you live this cheaply so close to Manhattan?''
 James Hayes, 73, a retired stagehand who pays $350 monthly rent to keep his rundown trailer there, said: ''I've been offered $50,000 for it, but now that the park is closing, it's worth nothing.''
 The morale is no better at Brown's Trailer Park or the Costa Trailer Court in nearby Lodi, N.J., where residents and the owner are fighting the borough's attempt to invoke eminent domain to close them. 
 ''We don't know exactly when, but the end is coming,'' said Clifton Lawrence, 51, an auto mechanic who bought his trailer 20 years ago for $7,500 and pays $650 a month rent at Brown's. ''Are they going to just wipe out our homes and push us all out into the street with nothing? Is this a third-world country?''
 John Agor, whose family owns Knolls Trailer Court in Mahopac, N.Y., said he had already been offered more than $1 million for the 3.5-acre plot an hour's drive north of New York City, and that he planned to close the park if it is rezoned for commercial development, a change that he has requested. ''Property in that area has so appreciated,'' he said. ''It used to be farmland and now it's surrounded by a shopping center and a gas station.''
 Mr. Agor said he did not plan to pay anything to residents of the park's 14 trailers, many of whom are World War II veterans who have lived there for decades. ''The state law says you just have to give them notice,'' he noted.
 Ray Matthews, 80, a retired propane-gas service technician and a Navy veteran who served in the South Pacific, has been at Knoll's 38 years. He said he had paid $9,500 for his trailer when he moved in, plus rent that is now $450 a month, and had invested in hardwood floors, ceiling repairs and new siding.
 ''I put my life into this trailer, and now it's going to be junked,'' Mr. Matthews lamented. ''I worked hard all my life, but I have no savings and no pension. I live on Social Security checks. Senior housing's all taken up and rents are up around $1,500. This place was my salvation, and now I've got nowhere to go.''
 Amid the spate of sales, Richard K. Freedman, president of Garden Homes Management, which owns 74 parks in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, including Goethals in Staten Island, said he was holding fast. ''We would never sell a park for another use because they bring in good income the way they are,'' Mr. Freedman said.
 But here in Syosset, in the shadow of luxury developments under construction like Stone Hill at Muttontown, where custom houses start at $2.3 million, the trailer park offers people with Civil Service and blue-collar jobs a chance to own a home where they grew up. With residents shaken by the news in their mailboxes, Bill Mazzie, the park handyman, said he had pressed one of the new owners, Larry Rush, about plans for the park.
 ''He said, 'We want to build condos,' '' Mr. Mazzie recounted as he showed off a spruced-up single-wide that recently sold for $75,000. ''I said, 'Can I tell the residents this?' and he said, 'No problem.' ''
 Messages for Mr. Rush were answered by Michael Weinstein, a lawyer who said he represented a group of investors who bought the property but would not say what they planned to do with it.
 ''My clients are developers, but there are no specific plans at the moment,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cupid and Cupidity

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
There have been many tender love stories in war.
 Ike and Kay. Pamela Harriman and Edward R. Murrow. Aeneas and Dido. Achilles and his tent temptation, Patroclus.
 But my favorite is the unfolding saga of Wolfie and Shaha. Never has a star-crossed romance so perfectly illuminated a star-crossed conflict. 
 The weekend meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were consumed with the question of how the bank chief could fight corruption while indulging in cronyism. Who could focus on a weak yen when you had a weak Wolfie with a strong yen for Shaha? 
 In addition to the story about Paul Wolfowitz's giving his girlfriend, Shaha Ali Riza, a promotion and a $60,000 raise because he felt guilty that she had to be transferred from the World Bank to the State Department when he took over, The Times reported yesterday on more imperialist hanky-panky.
 Steven Weisman and David Sanger wrote that in 2003, when Wolfie was No. 2 at the Pentagon, the office of his consigliere, Douglas Feith, directed a private contractor to hire Ms. Riza, then at the World Bank, to spend a month traveling in Iraq to study ways to set up the new government.
 (It was simple to get the contractor, the Science Applications International Corporation, to play along. As Vanity Fair reported, the Pentagon awarded SAIC seven contracts valued at more than $100 million before the war, without competitive bidding. Mr. Feith's deputy was Christopher Henry, a former SAIC senior vice president.) 
 Wolfie and Shaha did not let a little thing like World Bank rules -- which barred the bank from providing economic assistance to an area under military occupation -- keep them from pushing the neocon delusions. 
 When she returned, Ms. Riza briefed members of the executive board of the World Bank on her trip, giving them a sanguine account of Iraq's future and the fate of women there.
 ''The bank was under a lot of pressure at the time to do something in Iraq very quickly,'' Jean-Louis Sarbib, a former bank vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, told The Times. But some of the bank's directors, he said, were ''very concerned about why she was briefing the board, under which authority and with whom she had gone there. I did not know anything about this at the time, and I was the vice president, and she was reporting to me.''
 As they rushed to war, the neocons delighted in blowing off international treaties, international institutions and diplomats, treating them as impediments and whiners. So it only made sense that Wolfie wouldn't hesitate to blow off rules he didn't like once he began running an international institution himself.
 Sometimes you've got to break some rules and tell some half-truths to help the world.
 Despite fears among the bank's member governments that Wolfie's smug and stupid behavior is impairing the bank's credibility, he has dug in his heels and said he will stay put. The president has backed him up.
 Astonishingly, W., Wolfie, Dick Cheney and the Prince of Darkness himself, Richard Perle, have learned nothing from their mistakes of blindness and hubris, except to sweep them under the bed and indulge in more blindness and hubris.
 In a chapter shown last night of the PBS series ''America at a Crossroads,'' Mr. Perle chatted with Pat Buchanan, his old colleague from the Reagan administration, arguing that America should ignore naysayers and work for regime change in Iran. 
 ''There's got to be some advantage to being a superpower,'' Mr. Perle said grandly.
 Asked by Bob Schieffer on ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday whether the administration had a credibility problem, given the problems with Alberto Gonzales, the optimistic statements about the death spiral in Iraq and the perjury conviction of Scooter Libby, the vice president replied, ''You do the best you can with what you've got, obviously,'' an echo of Rummy's famous ''You go to war with the Army you have.''
 In America last week to promote a book about the occupation of Iraq, Ayad Allawi, Iraq's former prime minister and failed U.S. puppet, told a group at the Council on Foreign Relations that the Bush administration had invaded an ''imagined'' country.
 The Financial Times reported Mr. Allawi as saying that ''the Iraqi exiles who advised the U.S. war planners described the country of their memories. Sadly, the Iraq with a solid infrastructure, a solid middle class and a secular tradition had ended 'decades ago.' '' 
 Shouldn't Rummy and Cheney have followed their own advice: You go to war against the country you have, not the one you imagine?

CORRECTION-DATE: April 19, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Due to a fact-checking error, in some editions of Wednesday's Times, Maureen Dowd's column cited the wrong former Iraqi official as critical of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. He was Ali Allawi, the former finance minister, not Ayad Allawi, the former prime minister.

HEADLINE: Pound Jumps Above $2 Mark On Expectations of Rate Rise

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, April 17 

 BODY:
The pound rose above the $2 mark on Tuesday for the first time in 15 years after a surprise increase in Britain's inflation rate spurred expectations the Bank of England would raise interest rates at least once more this year. 
 The pound jumped as high as $2.0017, breaking $2 for the first time since 1992. The dollar has also been declining this year against other major European currencies, particularly the euro. On Monday, the dollar approached its record low of $1.3666 against the euro, on rising concerns about slowing economic growth in America. Early Tuesday afternoon, the dollar was trading at $1.3562 a euro in New York, touching $1.3594, its weakest since December 2004.
 The pound's rise came after reports that British inflation unexpectedly rose to 3.1 percent last month, the highest since January 1997, according to data released by the Bank of England. 
 Investors said they expected the central bank to curb inflation by raising interest rates from 5.25 percent. The central bank has increased interest rates three times since last August. 
 The rise of inflation beyond the Bank of England's 2 percent target comes at a difficult time for Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer, who has been relying on his track record of generating economic growth to campaign for prime minister. 
 For the first time since Mr. Brown granted the bank independence to set interest rates in 1997, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, was required to send a letter to the government explaining why the inflation rate rose more than one percentage point above the bank's target and outlining plans to bring the rate back down. 
 In the letter, Mr. King explained that higher prices for oil and food pushed inflation up but said the bank remained confident that the inflation rate would fall again within months.
 ''Because there are long-term lags between changes in interest rates and their impact on inflation, the committee will continue to look through the short-term volatility in inflation over the next year or so,'' the letter said.
 Some economists and strategists are expecting the inflation rate to fall again as the impact of recent interest rate increases filters through the economy. Some energy companies have already started to cut prices.
 Yet, some risks remain, as rising oil prices could again push up energy costs and retailers could keep prices high to improve their margins on the back of a buoyant economy.

HEADLINE: City Reopens Old Rail Line for Staten Island Trash and Freight

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced the reopening of the Staten Island Railroad yesterday, an important step in his plan to transform the way the city disposes of the thousands of tons of garbage it collects daily. 
 The once abandoned and weed-strewn eight-mile line reconnects the borough with the national rail network, allowing freight traffic to leave Staten Island by rail for the first time since 1991.
Reopening the rail line makes Staten Island the first borough to achieve one of the major goals outlined in the mayor's 20-year waste management plan, which the City Council approved last summer after nearly two years of political infighting. The centerpiece of the plan is to make the city rely more on barges and trains and less on trucks to carry garbage to landfills out of the state. 
 The line is also expected to help the Staten Island economy, providing freight shippers direct rail access to the New York Container Terminal at Howland Hook, the borough's largest employer. 
 City officials said the line would cut out thousands of truck trips on Staten Island each year, easing traffic on the West Shore Expressway and the Goethals Bridge. 
 ''Taking trucks off the road, minimizing their impact on communities, is going to mean safer, cleaner, quieter streets for generations to come,'' the mayor said. ''This really is the beginning of a real transformation for this city.''
 Yesterday's announcement was held in a chilly warehouse in front of mounds of smelly garbage at the Staten Island Transfer Station. Afterward, the mayor, surrounded by an entourage of sanitation and rail officials, went outside and, in a symbolic gesture, waved a railroad lantern at a waiting locomotive. 
 The city began testing the line on April 2, moving some garbage to New Jersey from the transfer station, which receives garbage from all over the borough. The city expects to begin hauling all of Staten Island's garbage by ray by May 1.
 Although the Staten Island segment of the mayor's plan is under way, city officials made it clear yesterday that other key components of the transformation -- mainly building marine transfer stations in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan -- could still be years away as the city seeks environmental permits from the state. One of those, on the Upper East Side at 91st Street, has been beset by local and political opposition. 
 For years, the city's garbage went to the mammoth Fresh Kills landfill, to the dismay of Staten Island political leaders and residents. Since the landfill was closed to residential trash in 2001, the city has struggled with how to dispose of the 12,000 tons of garbage it collects each day from homes, schools and municipal buildings. 
 Now, the vast majority of that waste is shipped out by truck, eventually ending up in landfills in South Carolina, Virginia and other states. Some goes to an incinerator in Essex County, N.J. 
 Under the new plan, each borough is responsible for putting its garbage into containers at private or city-operated transfer stations. From there it will be sent out of state by barges or rail.
 City Councilman Michael E. McMahon, who represents the northern part of the borough, called yesterday's announcement a Golden Spike moment, a reference to completion of the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s. 
 ''Firstly, we will move Staten Island's trash by sealed containers over rail, and secondly, we are reconnecting our borough to the rest of the continent by railroad,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Moktada al-Sadr's Gambit

 BODY:
Just when it looked as if the Iraqi government had sunk as low as it could go, it sank still further, following a brazen power play by Moktada al-Sadr. 
 Until now Mr. Sadr, a virulently anti-American cleric with an unquenchable appetite for attention and power, had been Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's strongest political ally. But on Monday, at his direction, his party's six ministers quit the Maliki cabinet. The government still depends on the parliamentary votes of Mr. Sadr's party, the largest faction in the ruling Shiite bloc.
Mr. Maliki, a colorless and ineffective politician, has been prime minister for the past year. But from the beginning, his authority has depended on the backing of Mr. Sadr, a charismatic demagogue with an intimidating private army, a potent political party and an impressive capacity for sending his followers into the street. 
 Mr. Maliki had probably figured that he was better off having Mr. Sadr's party inside his cabinet, demanding patronage for its followers and official protection for its rampaging private militia, than outside, publicly challenging government policies, including Mr. Maliki's support for a continued American military presence in Iraq. 
 Now Mr. Maliki may be about to experience the worst of both options. Mr. Sadr had his cabinet ministers resign in an attempt to bully the government into setting a timetable for the departure of American troops from Iraq. Mr. Maliki cannot just say no, because if Mr. Sadr's party turns against him, he could lose his parliamentary majority. Nor can he just say yes because the physical survival of his administration probably still depends on those American troops. Meanwhile, Mr. Sadr has aligned himself with a highly popular cause that is likely to expand his following even further. 
 This squeeze play leaves the Bush administration holding what looks like an even weaker political hand in Baghdad than it held before. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, now traveling through the region pleading with Arab leaders to ignore their misgivings about the Maliki government's performance, is gamely trying to sell the idea that the departure of the Sadr ministers, and their likely replacement by politically neutral technocrats, could actually help stabilize the Iraqi government. 
 But technocratic caretaking will scarcely be enough, especially with Mr. Sadr inciting division from the sidelines. The American military drive in Baghdad has yet to show significant results. But even if it did, any security gains would be quickly erased without a series of decisive moves by the Iraqi government. These include sharing political power and economic resources with the Sunni minority, shutting down sectarian militias, and creating security forces committed to protect all Iraqis. 
 That will require political will and authority, not mere administrative competence. Mr. Maliki displayed neither before Mr. Sadr's latest power play. He seems even less likely to display them now.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Puts Limits on Political Contributions at the Top of His Wish List

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 17 

 BODY:
Campaign-finance reform tops Gov. Eliot Spitzer's agenda for the rest of the legislative session, which has two more months to run.
 ''The first step, and this is the predicate of any meaningful conversation on campaign-finance reform, is lowering dramatically the threshold for contributions'' -- which would require legislative action -- the governor said at a press conference on Tuesday to discuss his priorities.
But as he has learned in his first few months in office, the Legislature often has its own, far different, agenda. When the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, spelled out his priorities this week, campaign-finance reform was nowhere to be found. 
 Instead, Mr. Bruno and other Senate Republicans counterpunched with their own bid to claim the mantle of reform on Tuesday. They lined up behind a long-shot proposal from a freshman senator, Joseph Griffo, a Republican from Rome, that would impose eight-year term limits on statewide elected officials, legislative leaders and the heads of legislative committees. 
 It would not apply to the current legislative leaders, however. ''The first question I asked Joe when he discussed this with me: 'How's it affect me? Is it retroactive? Do we go back eight years?' '' Mr. Bruno said, with a knowing smile. ''And I got the proper assurances.''
 Mr. Bruno, 78, has been majority leader for more than a decade and has evinced no plans to leave.
 The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who has also held his post for more than a decade, said of the Senate proposal: ''I think it's perfectly appropriate, if the Senate feels that way, that they can have this done immediately by passing an amendment to the Senate rules that requires it'' for senators. As for the Assembly, he said, ''I haven't heard our members express this passion.''
 Asked if the Senate would take such a step unilaterally, Mr. Bruno said his focus was on making the proposal law. As for campaign-finance reform, he said, ''The governor's top priority ought to be the upstate economy.''
 ''When the governor ran for office, he traveled this whole state and did remarkably well, and everywhere he went he talked about the upstate economy and how desperate some of the areas are in terms of job creation and growth,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''That's our No. 1 priority.''
 The governor emphasized that his priority was lowering contribution limits -- he has already lowered the limit on how much he will accept, from roughly $50,000 per donor to $10,000, though he has on occasion appeared at state party fund-raising events that have higher limits.
 He has also proposed a number of other changes, like public financing of state elections, and closing loopholes, including one that allows contributors to far exceed limits by using limited liability companies. 
 Other items near the top of the governor's agenda include the first raises for judges in several years and streamlining the overlapping layers of the state court system. 
 He also will propose amending the State Constitution to set up a new process for redistricting the Legislature, a proposal that is sure to face strong resistance in the Legislature.
 He is also negotiating with lawmakers changes to the Wicks Law, which requires that four separate contractors be hired for different kinds of work on public building projects, driving up costs. And he said that he would propose measures to fight childhood obesity and limit children's access to violent video games.
 Hot-button issues that are not on his priority list include gay marriage, which he has said he would support, and raises for lawmakers. 
 ''The issue of legislative pay raises,'' he said, ''is simply not on the table.''

HEADLINE: Assessing The Advisers In the '08 Race

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
In the late 1990s, a small team of economists began traveling down to Austin, Tex., for occasional visits with Gov. George W. Bush, then an unannounced candidate for president. The economists were mostly old Republican policy hands. The youngest member of the group -- the only one who hadn't worked for Ronald Reagan or Gerald Ford -- was Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia professor in his early 40s.
 After Mr. Bush won, Mr. Hubbard went on to become the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and an architect of the tax cuts that -- love them or hate them -- have undeniably been the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's domestic policy. Mr. Hubbard was later responsible for bringing Ben Bernanke, then a professor at Princeton, into the Bush orbit. 
 All of which is to say that the early advisers to presidential candidates can leave a big imprint. For the 2008 campaign, the six leading campaigns have each signed up their first-string economic policy teams. These advisers don't hold the sway that the political aides do, but they can ultimately have a bigger effect on the world. If the next president is going to reform health care, attack climate change or address middle-class anxiety, the solution is going to be shaped by these policy advisers. As Douglas Holtz-Eakin, John McCain's director of economic policy, says, ''If you're specific about what you want to do and you win, you have a mandate.''
 For now, the more interesting story is on the Democratic side. Among the Republicans, the three main candidates -- Mr. McCain, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney -- all favor extending Mr. Bush's tax cuts. That leaves the campaigns less room to propose other policies that cost money. It also makes it harder for the candidates to seem serious about the long-term budget deficit, a topic on which a number of the advisers, including Mr. Holtz-Eakin, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office, have been quite eloquent in the past. 
 The Democrats, besides talking about a broader range of subjects, also have the freshest face among the top campaign advisers -- Barack Obama's lead economist, Austan Goolsbee, a 37-year-old star professor at the University of Chicago (who writes a monthly column for The New York Times). The two men met when Mr. Obama was teaching at the law school there, and they both seem to favor achieving Democratic goals through market-oriented policies. As Mr. Goolsbee has written: ''Moral exhortation doesn't change people's behavior. Prices do.'' Given their respective professions, the two are also more irreverent than you may expect: Mr. Goolsbee was once a member of an improvisational comedy group.
 But the biggest reason he got the job may simply be that many Democratic economists were already loyal to Hillary Clinton. Her team is dominated by former aides from her husband's administration like Roger Altman, an investment banker, and Gene Sperling, who worked his way up from serving as a campaign aide in 1992 to becoming a senior White House adviser. Dick Gephardt, the former House Democratic leader, is also working with Mrs. Clinton.
 Both the Clinton and Obama campaigns are now playing catch-up on policy ideas. John Edwards, who's running third in fund-raising and the early polls, has tried to grab attention by releasing a series of specific proposals. Rather than bringing economists into his campaign, he is relying on a network of former aides from Capitol Hill to help him sort through ideas. (One Edwards proposal -- on tax simplification -- was originally Mr. Goolsbee's, in fact.)
 To me, the most compelling question is how the Clinton and Obama campaigns will respond to Mr. Edwards's health care plan. He wants to require companies that don't cover their workers to pay into a fund. That fund, along with government subsidies, would cut the cost of insurance for families buying it on their own. He would then require all Americans to have health insurance. 
 It's a serious plan, one that resembles the law signed in Massachusetts by Mr. Romney, the former governor there. But lack of insurance is only one of the two big problems with health care in this country, and it may well be the smaller problem. Even among the insured, there is an enormous amount of inefficiency today. Some patients get expensive treatments that bring little benefit, while millions of others miss out on basic care, like cholesterol-lowering drugs, that would make a huge difference to them.
 Solving that problem will require changing the system so that it rewards good care not just any care. It will mean that Medicare and insurance companies must get tougher about saying no to $10,000 operations that haven't been proven effective. Mr. Edwards's white paper on health care includes some of these ideas, but he doesn't emphasize them on the stump. And this is the sort of change that will require political leadership. Will Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama try to provide it?
 For that matter, will one of the Republicans? At this point, they are focused on taxes, a make-or-break issue for many Republican primary voters. ''We're facing a gigantic tax increase,'' said Michael Boskin, a top Giuliani adviser who, as an aide to George H. W. Bush, unsuccessfully tried to persuade his colleagues to take the 1990-91 recession more seriously. 
 It's conceivable that Mr. Romney may go even further than extending the recent tax cuts and propose new ones. His top economic advisers are Mr. Hubbard; Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor and former aide to the current President Bush; and John F. Cogan, a Reagan budget official now at Stanford. They like tax cuts.
 Mr. McCain, for his part, voted against both of the big Bush tax cuts. He said the first was too big and didn't do enough to help the middle class, while the second was too expensive in a time of war. But because letting them expire would feel like a tax increase -- and because Mr. McCain knows how his primary voters feel about tax increases -- he supports them now.
 Eventually, though, the Republican candidates will talk about issues besides taxes. To deal with the budget deficit, they will have to come up with ideas for spending cuts. Nothing is a bigger long-term expense than Medicare, which will bring the debate right back to health care.
 The truth is that if you put the economic advisers, from both parties, in a room and told them to hammer out solutions to the country's big economic problems, they would find a lot of common ground. They could agree that doctors and patients need better incentives to choose effective medical care. They would probably hit upon education policies along similar lines, requiring that schools be held more accountable for what their students are, and are not, learning. They might suggest a carbon tax -- a favorite idea of Mr. Mankiw -- to deal with global warming. And they would shore up Social Security by reducing benefits for high earners, as Mr. Hubbard has suggested.
 Not all of these ideas are politically feasible at this point, but presidential campaigns can change what's feasible. Here's hoping that this year's crop of economic advisers has the courage of their convictions.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, a Gehry-Designed Awakening

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The influx of thousands of new residents has reinvigorated this city's downtown in recent years, but most of the development has been clustered on its southern end, near the Staples Center, the sports and entertainment arena.
 For more than a decade, however, Eli Broad, a billionaire and civic leader, has envisioned a vibrant focal point for the city -- ''a place where people from all communities want to gather,'' as he put it -- on the opposite edge of downtown. That section, known as Bunker Hill, is home to some of the city's leading cultural institutions and architecturally significant structures, but they are scattered amid a hodgepodge of unsightly parking lots and drab government buildings.
 Now Related Urban, the division of the Related Companies that developed the massive Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle in Manhattan, is poised to try to fulfill Mr. Broad's ambitions. By the end of the year, the company expects to begin demolition for the first phase of a $2.05 billion mixed-use project along Grand Avenue, opposite the Walt Disney Concert Hall. 
 Designed by the concert hall's architect, Frank Gehry, the Grand Avenue development will echo the Time Warner Center in some respects -- the plans call for a five-star 275-room Mandarin Oriental Hotel, luxury condominiums, restaurants run by celebrity chefs and an upscale food market. But it is also expected to feature terraces and rooftop gardens to take advantage of the mild climate, the developers say. 
 Included in the $750 million first phase, which extends from First to Second Streets and reaches 35 feet from Grand Avenue to Olive Street, are 400 condominiums in two towers, 48 and 24 stories respectively, to be priced at around $1,000 a square foot or higher; 100 apartments devoted to families earning less than $35,000 a year; 284,000 square feet of retail space; and a 16-acre park linking the Music Center and City Hall to replace an unused swath of sloping green space near the government buildings.
 As part of an agreement with community groups and public officials, Related Companies is to advance $50 million of its ground-lease rent toward the cost of the park. The agreement also requires Related and its tenants to meet specified hiring and wage goals and to set aside one-fifth of the units for low- and moderate-income residents. In exchange, officials have agreed to just under $100 million in subsidies, principally from hotel tax revenues, said William A. Witte, the president of Related California.
 The City Council and County Board of Supervisors recently gave their blessing to the project, and Mr. Gehry said he expects to complete the design in June. 
 Rather than compete with his concert hall, with its billowing stainless-steel walls, the glassy Grand Avenue development should play a ''supporting role,'' Mr. Gehry said, adding that ''you don't put a bunch of iconic buildings one next to the other.'' With construction costs rising, the architect said he has had to ''adjust the project to that reality'' by, for example, searching for less-expensive materials. 
 Unlike the planned Atlantic Yards development near downtown Brooklyn, which is Mr. Gehry's other major urban project, Grand Avenue has engendered few fireworks. But some opponents maintain that subsidies are not justified for a project intended primarily for wealthy residents. They say the developer is already getting a break on the land. 
 Joel Kotkin, a Los Angeles resident and author of ''The City: A Global History,'' also argues that Los Angeles is a decentralized place with a number of lively downtowns, including Santa Monica, Pasadena and West Hollywood. In his view, the city would do better to nurture organic downtown neighborhoods, like its fashion district, ''instead of replicating experiences you can get anywhere.''
 But Mr. Broad said that piecemeal development of the city- and county-owned sites would have been a mistake. ''I was fearful we would have unplanned development there that would create a mess,'' he said. He also said that allowing the developer to define the project ensured that it would be economically workable. ''You've got to find a developer that's got the experience to make it work from a commercial point of view,'' he said. ''Without understanding what is going to work financially, you end up with no project.''
 Since 1999, when the local zoning ordinance was changed to allow residential conversion of older office buildings, more than 1,500 units of housing have been built or are under construction downtown, said Carol E. Schatz, the president of the Los Angeles Downtown Center Business Improvement District. 
 About 29,000 people live downtown, many of them young, well-paid single people who walk to work, according to a recent survey. They are also urban pioneers who are undaunted by the many homeless people who camp out downtown. The new residents are also willing to drive five miles or more to shop for groceries. In July, however, a long-awaited 50,500-square-foot Ralph's Fresh Fare supermarket is to open at Ninth and Flower Streets, said Terry O'Neill, a spokesman for the chain.
 For the first time in memory, a number of office tenants, including Perkins Coie, a law firm, and Psomas, an engineering firm, have been migrating from the West Side to downtown, where rents are cheaper, said H. Carl Muhlstein, an executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield. 
 These rents are rising, yet vacancies also increased last year, from 11.9 percent to 15.2 percent. Mr. Muhlstein attributed the rise in vacancies to the consolidation of the Los Angeles Unified School District's headquarters and the merger of Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank. 
 In addition to Grand Avenue, another megadevelopment is planned for downtown Los Angeles -- a $2.5 billion entertainment and retail complex known as L.A. Live, which is under construction next to the Staples Center. Developed by the arena's owner, AEG, it is expected to cater to sports and pop music fans and offer some of the flash of Times Square. 
 The Related project, by contrast, is designed to appeal to older, more affluent residents, including international buyers and others seeking a downtown pied-a-terre offering hotel services and restaurants. ''That's something that L.A. hasn't seen,'' Mr. Witte said.
 Related Companies has not announced any retail leases yet, although Kenneth A. Himmel, the chief executive of Related Urban, said two potential anchor tenants for the freestanding retail structures were talking with Mr. Gehry. 
 Rick J. Caruso, the developer of the Grove, the popular open-air retail and entertainment center near the Farmers Market at Third Street and Fairfax Avenue, said Related was unlikely to have a problem attracting a supermarket and other stores to serve its residents. But he said downtown might not be ready for larger retailers that need to draw from a large base of customers. ''The jury is still out on the retail,'' Mr. Caruso said. 
 The Grand Avenue project is getting started at a time when the market for high-end condos appears to be softening. In December, KB Homes withdrew from its partnership with AEG to build a 54-story hotel and condominium project at L.A. Live. A planned condominium tower designed by Thom Mayne at Broadway and 11th Street was shelved after it was unable to attract financing. And Standard Pacific Corporation abandoned plans to buy a new building near Union Station and sell its 272 units as condominiums. But Mr. Witte said projects that faltered were not in desirable locations. ''The best-located projects are doing very well,'' he said.
 Victor B.MacFarlane, a managing principal of MacFarlane Partners, one of Related's investment partners in Grand Avenue, said he was not worried about the market's long-term prospects.
 ''There's no question that the condo market right now is softer,'' he said. ''But we believe that in two or three years it will be different. We believe that downtown L.A. is for real and not just a flash-in-the-pan trend.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 20, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Square Feet pages of Business Day on Wednesday about plans for a large mixed-used real estate development in downtown Los Angeles misstated the number of housing units that have either been built downtown since 1999 or are under construction. It is more than 15,000, not 1,500.

HEADLINE: Dow Index Flirts With New High

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The economy remains on an even keel, reports released yesterday by the government suggested, with underlying inflation showing signs of easing and growth not slipping too far.
 This abundance of relatively benign data, together with several healthy corporate earnings reports, helped put Wall Street within striking distance of a record close on Tuesday. In trading yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly climbed above its record close but then fell back a bit. The blue-chip average finished the day up 52.58, or 0.4 percent, at 12,773.04, about 13 points short of the record of 12,786.64 on Feb. 20.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, meanwhile, rose 3.01 points, 0.2 percent, to close at 1,471.48, its highest level in six and a half years. Yesterday was the 10th day of gains in the S.& P. 500 in the last 11 trading sessions, a sign that investors have mostly shaken off the sting of February's global stock market plunge.
 The Nasdaq composite was the laggard among the major stock indexes yesterday, closing down 1.38, or 0.1 percent, at 2,516.95. 
 While the economic data helped lift stocks, profit reports from Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson for the first quarter were probably even more important in stoking the rise. 
 Coke's earnings rose 14 percent, beating Wall Street's expectations; Johnson & Johnson's quarterly profit fell on a large one-time charge but easily surpassed analysts' forecasts on strong revenue gains. Johnson & Johnson and Coke are both among the 30 stocks included in the Dow; Johnson & Johnson accounted for 12 points of the Dow's gain, and Coke added 10.6.
 But as markets open today, investors could find their mood soured by a disappointing earnings report from Yahoo, which was released after regular trading closed. Investors will also be watching earnings reports today from JPMorgan Chase and United Technologies. And Motorola and eBay are scheduled to report after the market closes. 
 The economic data released yesterday, while mixed, struck investors as generally positive. Higher gas prices helped push up the Consumer Price Index, the Labor Department reported, but the more closely watched core indicator, which does not include the volatile food and energy prices, edged up only 0.1 percentage point.
 Still, the annual rate of core inflation remained above the roughly 2 percent level the Federal Reserve considers acceptable, virtually ensuring that interest rates will remain unchanged for at least the next few months, economists said.
 ''Core consumer inflation has been retreating, irregularly, for the past six months,'' Steven A. Wood of Insight Economics wrote in a newsletter. ''Despite worries about the upside risks associated with inflation and sluggish economic activity,'' he wrote, the Fed will probably not raise interest rates for most or even all of this year.
 New data from the Commerce Department showed that builders picked up the pace of construction on new homes last month while the rate of building permits issued rose. A separate report from the Fed found that manufacturing activity in March expanded even though overall industrial production and capacity utilization fell slightly.
 The modest increase in core inflation was just half the 0.2 percent advance in February. Falling apparel prices, along with slower increases in shelter and medical care costs, helped keep the core increase tame.
 But inflation statistics for the full year remain outside the Fed's preferred target. Overall inflation rose 2.8 percent compared with March 2006; core inflation rose 2.5 percent in the same period. 
 ''Inflation is rising quite rapidly, and that is not an environment in which one gets terribly confident about the trajectory of inflation,'' said Dean Maki, an economist with Barclays Capital. ''Core inflation is moderating,'' he added, but ''it would have to play out over a few months for it to be convincing.''
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and other members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy, have said they would like to see yearly core inflation of 1 percent to 2 percent. 
 ''We're still not getting inflation improvement that's putting the trend numbers back within the Fed's comfort zone,'' said Gregory Miller, chief economist at SunTrust Banks. ''The Fed has said, 'If inflation rates are outside our band, we're going to stay biased against inflation.' And I believe them.''
 Some economists noted signs of potential aberrations in the data that could suggest that the slowing core inflation last month was a one-time event. Apparel prices dropped 1 percent, falling for the first time since October. Hotel prices fell 2.3 percent, a sharp decline considering that they rose steadily last year.
 And with gas prices rising again, the Fed could become concerned that energy increases might be passed through to other prices and stoke core inflation. In March gasoline prices rose more than 10 percent. 
 The Fed probably saw little else in the economic reports yesterday that would persuade it to change its posture, economists said. The residential construction report, while not suggesting a substantial rebound in the housing market, did appear to hint at stabilization. 
 The rate of building permits authorized last month rose 0.8 percent after falling in January and February. And the rate of construction of new homes increased for the second consecutive month, climbing 0.8 percent.
 ''There's a suggestion that perhaps the decline in housing starts from here on out is going to be limited,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. But it could turn out that growth slows more than economists now foresee. 
 ''We have a slowing economy,'' Mr. Hatzius said. ''And housing getting better doesn't mean you're no longer seeing a drag. In some ways, the drag from housing is still ahead of us.'' On Monday, Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate for growth in economic activity for the first quarter to 1.2 percent from 2 percent.
 Economists took some comfort in the industrial production numbers released yesterday by the Federal Reserve. While overall industrial output declined 0.2 percent, much of that was caused by a 7 percent drop in output from utilities because of warmer temperatures.
 On the upside, economists noted, manufacturing grew 0.7 percent, a sign that businesses are selling off their excess inventories both at home and abroad.

 BODY:
In this group of new releases the question of the moment seems to be: What if? What if cavemen started showing up in the backyards of a surburban subdivision? (''Twin Study'' by Stacey Richter.) Or if a billionaire sheik decided to introduce salmon to a Yemeni river? (Paul Torday's ''Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.'') Answers to those questions, and others, can be found in these recently published books. Twin Study Stories By Stacey Richter 261 pages. Counterpoint. $24. 
 Many characters in Ms. Richter's second collection of stories are outsiders. A Jewish woman with a taste for sinsemilla moves into a community called Yuletide Village, where Christmas is a three-week festival of lights and caroling. (''Caroling, the most odious of verbs.'') A pair of sisters, ardent fans of Joan Jett and Chrissie Hynde, are left more or less to raise themselves in the conformist culture of Utah. And of course there are the cavemen, who've come through a time portal in a condemned Pizza Hut. In addition to a sense of disconnection, Ms. Richter's people tend to share smart mouths and cranky states of mind. As the pot-loving narrator of ''Christ, Their Lord'' notes: ''Something happens to people's brains in the Sun Belt. I believe the constant overload of vitamin D has softened my skull and turned me nice, so that I've started to act like a nice person -- though maybe with a little more of it, I will overdose and just come into my own nastiness.'' The Back Nine By Billy Mott 245 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24. 
 ''You here to loop?'' is the first question asked of Charlie MacLeod when he wanders onto a Northern California golf course one morning. (To loop, in the jargon of golf, is to caddy.) And as it turns out, he is. Charlie, a former golf phenom who was injured in high school, has been on the run from his failed marriage in Pittsburgh. In California he finds his swing -- and his life -- again. Sitting on the bench in the caddy shack, ''his worry slowly began to peel away, like the strips of bark from the giant trees, and for the first time in a long while he imagined that someday he might just leave it behind for good.'' But a player of his talent can't stay in the shack of course, and the book culminates in a cinematic showdown on the greens between Charlie and Larry Siegal, a Los Angeles hotshot backed by a man known as the Czar. The Unnatural History of Cypress Parish By Elise Blackwell 210 pages. Unbridled Books. $23.95. 
 Set on the eve of Hurricane Katrina's destructive landfall in New Orleans, Elise Blackwell's second novel looks back to the flood of 1927 (a real event) in the (fictional) Cypress Parish, childhood home of Louis Proby. Louis's father is town superintendent for a lumber company, and he keeps order with a mixture of benevolence and violence. From the vantage point of old age, Louis looks back on the choices he made in ''the strange and wet spring I turned 17 and crossed the marshy border that separates all that is good and bad of boyhood from all that is good and bad of manhood.'' As the water rises in the Mississippi, Louis falls in love, accompanies his father on business and becomes the driver for the dissolute lumber company representative, Charles Segrist. Louis's mother gets to the bottom of the matter when another character comments that ''so far it's just backwater flooding.'' She replies, ''I suppose there's nothing just about backwater flooding if you live on backwater.'' Salmon Fishing in the Yemen By Paul Torday 333 pages. Harcourt. $24. 
 When the fisheries scientist Alfred Jones is first asked to investigate the possibility of introducing salmon, and the sport of salmon fishing, to Yemen, he dismisses the matter out of hand. The problems, he notes, are fairly fundamental. ''First, water,'' he says. ''Salmon are fish. Fish need water.'' But the persuasive power of politics, money and the beautiful Harriet Chetwode-Talbot are brought to bear upon him, and soon Dr. Jones is lending his services to Sheik Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama, a Yemeni billionaire and dedicated angler, in his attempt to stock the Wadi Aleyn with fish. The book is told through e-mail messages, diary entries and transcripts from an investigation begun after the unexpected denouement of the plan; its heart is Jones's journey from skepticism to belief. The Midnight Choir By Gene Kerrigan 356 pages. Europa Editions. $14.95. 
 On a Wednesday afternoon in Galway, Joe Mills, a garda or Irish policeman, talks a suicidal man out of jumping off the roof of a pub. Meanwhile in Dublin, Detective Garda Rose Cheney and Detective Inspector Harry Synnott are investigating an alleged rape; in another part of town Dixie Peyton tries to rob a pair of American tourists, using what seems to be a syringe full of HIV-infected blood as her weapon. In this, his second crime novel, Gene Kerrigan connects the dots between those events and more in a weeklong journey through an Ireland that has been transformed by the Celtic Tiger economic boom of the '90s. At the book's center is Synnott, a man with a reputation for telling the truth. Europa Editions, which specializes in bringing European literature to the United States, is publishing the book here as a paperback. Black & White By Dani Shapiro 256 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24. 
 Ruth Dunne, a photographer, is famous for taking intimate, often naked pictures of her daughter Clara. (Sally Mann may come to mind.) Clara fled her mother's grasp the moment she turned 18, settling on Mount Desert Island in Maine. But at the start of Dani Shapiro's new novel she returns to her childhood home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Ruth is dying of lung cancer, and tries to come to terms with the woman as a mother and an artist. ''I have hated you for so many years,'' Clara thinks as she stands by her mother's bedside, Ms. Shapiro writes. ''And then -- like an overlay, a transparency on top of the thought -- and I have loved you.''

HEADLINE: Kips Bay, Where Everything Glitters

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
THERE was a celebratory fizz all along Madison Avenue last week, on that stretch of the Upper East Side that makes a kind of decorator's gulch, and that serves as a barometer of the rarefied neighborhood's consumer confidence. 
 The Kips Bay Decorator Show House, the interior design world's yearly coming-out party, was having its unofficial curtain-raising, which coincided with a few others.
At 63rd Street, Wall Streeter-turned-decorator Charlotte Moss threw open the doors of her new store, a five-story town house emporium laid out, as it happens, like a decorator's show house in lush, high-'80s style with lots of silk taffeta. The Colony Club set bottlenecked in the trompe l'oeil limestone foyer, while the doorman, a burly and affable guy, kept his back to the door frame, hiding the fresh paint that had smeared his suit jacket. 
 A few blocks north, at 70th Street and within shooting distance of the Gucci store across the street, Tom Ford was ''at home'' in his new men's store to a select group of reporters (though not this one; the three politely thuggish bouncers outside made sure of that). 
 Peering through the windows, you could hardly see through the gloom cast by the gray suede walls, the beaver fur rugs, the macassar ebony staircase. Women in black-and-white maid's outfits wandered about, amping up the ''Eyes Wide Shut'' decadence of the place, which has been designed as a copy of Mr. Ford's own home in London. It was clear that that there was a party going on -- a party that felt, even to the uninvited hovering outside, a bit sexual, a bit pharmaceutical and utterly financial (men in suits doing nasty things).
 There were no bouncers at the Kips Bay show house, held this year, its 35th, in a 1904 Beaux-Arts town house at 14 East 82nd Street (and open to the public for four weeks starting Tuesday). But nonetheless a raucous party atmosphere dominated that afternoon, as decorators, assistants and artisans tweaked the rooms amid the aural stew of competing soundtracks. There was world music, disco, jazz, opera, the Bloomberg Report on three screens hung like paintings over the fireplace in Noel Jeffrey's elegant ''power room,'' and the thunderous soundtrack of ''The Fifth Element,'' a truly terrible Bruce Willis movie that came with the Sony plasma television and DVD player in the architect Stephen Miller Siegel's pale gold silk media room -- equipment Mr. Siegel was unable to control. ''I've watched it twice now,'' he said helplessly. ''It doesn't get any better.''
 Touchstones from history's hardest-partying eras and locales -- Imperial Rome, Versailles, Babe Paley's living room, Andy Warhol's Factory, Studio 54 -- winked from nearly every one of the 22 rooms there, making a glittery, disco ball whole. 
 So many shiny things! Walls were polished to a high white gloss (in Eve Robinson's parlor); rubbed with black Venetian plaster (Eric Cohler's dining room); padded with white leather punched with huge silver studs (Etienne Coffinier and Ed Ku's delirious second floor landing); or wrapped in sweet-pea-pink silk moire (Jamie Drake's bedroom). 
 The front hall, designed by Carl Lana and Randall Beale, had more reflective surfaces than Halston's bathroom. There were two 10-foot-high mirrored obelisks, a silver chandelier with tentacles, an aluminum ''pillow'' captive in a glass vitrine, silver leather Arne Jacobsen Egg chairs, and aluminum foil glued to the stair's wainscoting. You can try this at home, Mr. Lana said: use Reynolds Wrap and 3-M spray mount. ''It's O.K. if it starts to break down a little,'' he continued. ''Nothing is perfect. It's got wrinkles. It's got a few little tears. That's life.'' 
 Mr. Beale, who was wearing a silver down jacket, said, ''This is all about self-reflection.'' 
 Mr. Lana added: ''And retrospection. We began to realize we were making a retrospective here of our years together.''
 Above the aluminum foil wallpaper, Mr. Beale and Mr. Lana's collection of photographs made a portfolio of ghosts and good times gone by: there was a Billy Name print of Andy Warhol, a Janis Joplin portrait, a few Cecil Beatons and a few of a young man teaching a flamenco class, a former beau of Mr. Lana's. 
 ''To quote Auntie Mame,'' Mr. Lana said, ''life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving. You've got to live, live, live!''
 The high design world marked the 1990s with a kind of penitent minimalism, and the early aughts by disappearing from the public eye altogether, trampled by the hordes of HGTV carpenter-hosts, ambitious stylists and craft-loving homemakers. But this year, two decades after the stock market crash of 1987 and not far from three since the beginning of the AIDS crisis, high design seems not only revivified but giddily celebratory, toasting its hedge fund-fueled present, while alluding briefly to the sorrows in its past. 
 The very grown-up parlor by Eve Robinson is a mise-en-scene of impeccable 20th-century haute design, but what's most arresting is the Ross Bleckner painting above the macassar ebony mantel, from his tainted blood cell series. Ms. Robinson said her room was all about new life; the Bleckner painting makes her manifesto dark and poignant. 
 In his ''gentleman's bath'' on the sixth floor, Scott Salvator opened his arms before the six-foot-long, caramel-colored marble soaking tub, the torso-size gilded sconces and the silver-leaf ceiling. Then he asked out loud, ''What was I inspired by?'' His answer: ''Men bathing. That was my hallucination.'' 
 Pointing to the tiger's-eye stone vanity, in its cabinet of wenge wood and burnt cowhide, he said, ''This isn't something you'll find at Home Depot.''
 ''Seriously,'' he continued, ''it's my fourth time here. After 25 years of doing this, I wanted to stand back and do an analysis of the show house, what it was, what it has been, what it should be. It should be couture. It should be the Academy Awards. What wiped this business out was AIDS, and the people who stepped in to fill all those empty places were B players. This is the first year in a long time I've seen an upswing of quality.'' 
 While Mr. Salvator is pushing a vision of decorating as high fashion -- ''What I do is for the one percent,'' he said -- others frame their work in high culture terms. 
 ''Curate, don't decorate,'' said Amy Lau, who said she had used frequent flier miles to bring in artists to contribute to her '60s-ish Miami-tropical living room next door to Mr. Salvatore's power bathroom (Kevin Inkawhich made a twiggy mobile; Jennifer Prichard made pale green porcelain petals that crawl along one wall). Ms. Lau is a founder of the Design Miami fair, which runs alongside Art Basel Miami each year.
 There was a bit of cross-pollination. Ms. Lau's green and yellow palette, she said, was inspired by Joseph Albers's square paintings. So was the bed in the bedroom designed by Jed Johnson Associates, appearing at Kips Bay for the first time. 
 There were ghosts in here, too: the late Jed Johnson began designing first for his acquisitive roommate, Andy Warhol, ''in self-defense,'' as his twin brother, Jay, likes to say. Jay Johnson is now president of the company, which counted Richard Gere and Mick Jagger among its early clients. The imagined inhabitant of this funky-swanky bedroom has a few Warhols, portraits of transvestites from his ''Ladies and Gentlemen'' series, as well as a McDermott and McGough oil painting over the bed that proclaims: ''The Hidden Secrets of Sex Are Daringly Revealed!'' 
 This guy is ready for love -- there were hot pink condoms in a ceramic dish by that limed oak bed, one of the many pieces here from the Jed Johnson Home Collection -- but seriously ambivalent about the whole thing, Jay Johnson said. 
 ''We put a Tracy Moffatt video piece on the television, clips of love stories from movies. It starts out all lovey-dovey and then deteriorates, everyone's slapping everyone else, throwing drinks in each other's faces, until finally the women all shoot the men,'' Mr. Johnson said cheerfully. ''Total carnage.''
 Jamie Drake's pink moire and pink tweed bedroom is also designed for a solo inhabitant, a woman who ''may or may not invite her lovers in,'' said Mr. Drake, to her pink velvet bed. 
 Mr. Drake, who is known for his use of high-octane color, as well as for being Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's decorator, has a new fabric line. He's named the pink tweed for Babe Paley, still the most over-exposed of Truman Capote's swans; the slim sofa in James Rixner's silky and very urban midcentury sitting room is named for her, too. 
 But although icons of old money may still be called on to add luster to new money's spending choices, the real issue at the show house -- and all along Madison Avenue -- is the divide between the rich and the superrich, as Kate Betts, the editor of Time Style & Design magazine noted last week. 
 ''If that's the conversation,'' she said, ''how do the superrich set themselves apart? How does Mr. Hedge Fund Manager, who's worth $3 billion -- hello! -- trade up?'' 
 Ms. Betts had spent Wednesday evening at the Carlyle, at Tom Ford's dinner party for his store. ''Ford's point,'' she said, ''is that the rich are buying intimacy and privacy, and service -- his maids and butlers -- goes along with that. It's a club thing.'' 
 Or a private party, and you're not invited.
 ''It is true that people are celebrating, or allowing themselves to celebrate their success,'' Mr. Drake said. ''That's not a negative thing. We live in a filter-down society.''
 Just off the Jed Johnson bedroom is a little women's study made by Wayne Nathan and Carol Egan that has the sort of vacant look of a young fashion model. She's got the right clothes, but something's missing. The occupant's bulletin board -- made from padded silver metallic fabric -- is mostly empty, except for a few magazine tearsheets and a little thesis, written in pink ink in block letters, that reads in part: ''Pleasure consumes us. Work strengthens us. Let us choose!''
 Party on. The Kips Bay Decorator Show House, to benefit the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, is open April 24 through May 22. Admission $30: (718) 893-8600 ext. 245; kipsbay.org.

POWER ROOMS -- Scott Salvator created a bathroom for a male bather with imperial aspirations, above. Of the fake Warhol portrait of Sophia Loren, Mr. Salvator said, ''I wanted breasts.'' The lady of the house may or may not invite this guy into her pink bedroom, below right, designed by Jamie Drake, with cut silk velvet on the bed, as well as chairs, not shown, covered in a pink tweed named after Babe Paley. The sofa in James Rixner's mid-century sitting room, below left, was also named for Mrs. Paley.

HEADLINE: Matrimony Has Its Benefits, and Divorce Has a Lot to Do With That

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and co-author of a blog at www.marginalrevolution.com.

 BODY:
Divorce seems an unusual topic for economists, but decisions to end a marriage weigh costs and benefits and thus reflect economic reasoning. Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson, both assistant professors of economics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, have led the creation of new studies, which are surveyed in their working paper ''Marriage and Divorce: Changes and Their Driving Forces.'' 
 The evidence suggests that married people -- especially married men -- are better off than the unmarried. But this doesn't mean that everyone should marry, or that no one should divorce. Sometimes a marriage no longer makes sense, or it didn't make sense in the first place. 
In the year after a separation, most people report being less happy, at least in one major study based on British data. Nonetheless, one year after the divorce, both men and women are happier for their decisions (Jonathan Gardner, a business consultant, and Andrew J. Oswald, an economics professor at the University of Warwick, ''Do Divorcing Couples Become Happier By Breaking Up?''). 
 In the United States, the availability of divorce has increased with unilateral divorce, which allows either member of the couple to dissolve the union. The change has been associated with lower rates of female suicide and domestic violence, and fewer wives murdered by their husbands. Unilateral divorce shifts the bargaining power to the person who is getting less out of the marriage and thus is most likely to leave. The partner getting more from the marriage has to work harder to keep the other person around, which can be good for the marriage and good for the couple. In other words, unilateral divorce benefits victims and potential victims.
 When unilateral divorce was adopted, divorce rates rose sharply in the two years that followed, reflecting a pent-up demand for divorce. But after 10 years had passed, the divorce rate went back to normal or in some cases, compared with states without unilateral divorce, it had fallen further. 
 In fact, the divorce rate for married couples peaked in the United States in 1979, when it was 22.8 per thousand married couples per year. Since then it has continued to decline, reaching 16.7 divorces per thousand married couples in 2005. 
 If matrimony as an institution has declined, it is because fewer people are marrying in the first place. Marriage is at its lowest rate in recorded American history, and marriages are shorter than before. If fewer weddings mean fewer divorces, individuals are probably making better matches. Perhaps there should have been fewer marriages in the first place. 
 One group more likely to be married today than ever before is Americans over age 65. Men are closing the life expectancy gap with women, and that means fewer widows, a comforting thought. The elderly are the most likely to require marriage for assistance with medical problems, not to mention sex and companionship. 
 Consistent with economic reasoning, marriage is growing among groups who benefit from marriage the most. Furthermore, the women least likely to remarry are highly educated with a high income, namely those who are best able to handle single life. Women with the least resources are the most likely to remarry.
 Unilateral divorce does make for less committed marriages. In states that allow unilateral divorce, a spouse is 10 percent less likely to be putting the partner through school. The obvious fear is that once the costly education is over, the beneficiary will leave the marriage. In states with unilateral divorce, adjusting for the relevant demographics, a couple is 6 percent less likely to have a child. Again, couples seem to be making decisions with the prospect of divorce in the back (or the front) of their minds. That may be one reason for the surge of female interest in higher education and advanced degrees. 
 Often, earlier approaches to marriage were based on the idea of a division of labor; the man would earn the income and the woman would take care of the household. But as female earning power increases, this arrangement makes less sense. Men and women are more likely to pair off on the basis of similar education, similar interests and similar tastes in consumption. In other words, modern marriage is more fun.
 And what about the children? Don't they suffer in happiness and future prospects from divorce? Maybe so, but Mr. Wolfers and Ms. Stevenson do not think the question has received a final answer. To be sure, it is better for a child to have happily married parents, but when the family is dysfunctional anyway, we don't know whether divorce harms the children. In any case, the number of children in a given divorce is, on average, declining. In 1968, the average divorce involved 1.34 children. By the 1990s, this had fallen to an average of less than one child per divorce. Since many people put off having children, and the average marriage is shorter, many divorces arrive before the children do.
 By the way, Mr. Wolfers and Ms. Stevenson met in a labor economics seminar in graduate school and have been a couple for almost 10 years. They've yet to marry.

HEADLINE: Singing the Praises of a New Asia

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 18 

 BODY:
Lawrence H. Summers, the former Harvard president, has maintained a low profile in the United States since he stepped down from the university post last year amid controversy and criticism.
 But in Asia, Mr. Summers appears to be the man of the hour. His views on the importance of Asia's growth, the challenges of globalization and the danger of the United States' huge trade deficit are widely promoted by policy makers and economists. He is eagerly solicited for lectures and keynote speeches, where his characteristically unvarnished opinions creep into discussions of fiscal policy.
On Tuesday, Mr. Summers spoke to an audience that overflowed a ballroom at the Taj Mahal Hotel in New Delhi, telling hundreds of economists, government officials and business executives that most of the action on global warming needed to ''take place in the developing world.'' 
 The industrial world was responsible for much of the problem, he said, but most of the solutions must come from the developing world, where emissions are growing the fastest and infrastructure is still unbuilt. The developing world should ''demand'' that it be compensated and supported for taking actions ''in the interest of all,'' he said. 
 ''Larry is very stimulating intellectually and an 'out of the box' thinker,'' said Isher Judge Ahluwalia, the chairwoman of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, the group that invited Mr. Summers to speak. 
 ''There is a wisdom in the way that he looks at problems which are global,'' Ms. Ahluwalia said, adding that Mr. Summers listens to other people's ideas, particularly when the topic is developing countries. 
 Ms. Ahluwalia and Mr. Summers recently served on a small panel given the duty of mapping the future of the Asian Development Bank, where Mr. Summers was the only American participant. The six-member panel decided that by 2020 a ''new Asia'' will need a ''radically'' different development bank with a global focus. 
 Mr. Summers's participation in and influence on Asian economic policy dates back to his role as the chief economist at the World Bank in the early 1990s. 
 While eminent Indian economists like Jagdish Bhagwati, a proponent of unfettered free trade, were arguing against regional trade alliances in the mid-1990s, India and other South Asia countries were pushing for them, in part because Mr. Summers supported the alliances, said Saman Kelegama, the executive director of the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka and co-editor of The South Asia Economic Journal.
 ''Larry was one of the main proponents'' of regional trade alliances, Mr. Kelegama said, ''and his view was considered seriously.'' 
 On that issue, ''South Asia generally goes along with Summers,'' Mr. Kelegama added, which is why the region has pursued the South Asian Free Trade Alliance and other bilateral alliances while negotiating in the World Trade Organization. 
 In a series of visits to China, India, Singapore and Hong Kong since early 2006, Mr. Summers has reiterated several themes that have special resonance in Asia, but have yet to be widely accepted in the United States. 
 Among them are the idea that growth and changes in Asia are the most important thing to happen during our lifetimes, that the United States and Europe have not yet appreciated the impact of these changes and that the global imbalances from the United States' current-account deficit -- nearly $1 trillion in 2006 -- could have severe consequences.
 Mr. Summers has been sharply critical of current American fiscal policy and the way that Asia sustains borrowing by the United States by continuing to purchase government debt. During a visit to Mumbai in March last year, Mr. Summers warned the Reserve Bank of India of the United States' ''unsustainable and dangerous'' current-account deficit. 
 In Beijing this January, he asked hundreds of economists and policy makers at a Global Development Network conference to consider the fact that $2 trillion from developing Asia, invested in United States Treasury bills, was making a ''zero real return.'' Imagine instead, he said ''all the opportunities in these countries for productive investment.'' 
 Mr. Summers also visited Singapore for the International Monetary Fund conference in September, then stopped in Hong Kong, where he told those attending an Asia Society dinner that 300 years from now, what will be seen as the most important event of these times will not be the end of the cold war, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, or the war in Iraq, but ''the rise of Asia and all that it meant for people in Asia and all that it meant for the world system.'' 
 Mr. Summers did not attend a New Delhi conference in March about new ways to finance Asian infrastructure, but he was cited so often by government ministers and development specialists there that he might as well have been.
 Ramgopal Agarwala, the senior adviser to R.I.S., or the Research and Information System for Developing Countries, quoted Mr. Summers extensively in a proposal that all Asian countries contribute to a fund that diverts money away from United States Treasury bills and into Asian infrastructure. 
 ''If exposure to the United States deficit is not managed well, we cannot rule out a possible global recession, even depression,'' said Mr. Agarwala, a former World Bank economist based in China, adding that Asia has a crucial role to play in correcting these imbalances. 
 The governments of China and India have both announced that they will invest their foreign exchange reserves in new areas, which will divert them from United States Treasury bills. 
 Subir Gokarn, the chief economist at Crisil, a ratings agency in India, said that Mr. Summers's remarks about ''the race to the bottom, and the adverse effects of globalization'' strike a chord in Asia.

HEADLINE: The Biggest Sell Is the Audition

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN; Shivani Vora contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WEST CHESTER, PA. 

 BODY:
IT took most of her life for Roma Seegers to arrive at this moment. Clutching a wreath of pastel-color eggs as she entered a long hallway that is hallowed space to her, Ms. Seegers, a 26-year-old sales specialist at a bank outside Pittsburgh, thought back to when she was a little girl, playing with her friend Sarah in her bedroom. 
 At an age when some girls played house and others pretended to be movie stars, little Roma held a ring her mother had bought from a home-shopping network and, facing an imaginary camera, extolled its shininess, versatility and extremely fair price.
''We pretended to be QVC hosts,'' Ms. Seegers said last week, a few minutes before she entered a tiny room off the hallway at QVC headquarters here, to audition in front of a real camera. ''I would say the price, the item number and the specifics of the product: a blue-topaz, 14-karat-gold marquise-shaped ring.'' 
 Ms. Seegers was one of 392 aspiring program hosts who showed up at a once-a-year open audition at QVC, the largest home shopping network. 
 What the 392 were competing for was a career soaked in fame of a strange kind. If any one of them eventually manages to land a job, he, or more likely she, will appear before millions of viewers not because she can croon a spine-tingling ''Mandy,'' dance up a storm with Jerry Rice or out-congenial Miss Mississippi, but because she can effuse extemporaneously to a camera about everything from zinnia-petal earrings to ''country style'' crab cakes.
 ''Most people show up thinking it's easy,'' said Jack Comstock, the vice president for television sales at QVC. In his 14 years at the network, he has hired 18 of its 23 hosts. ''But it's difficult to find someone that can really talk to the camera as if it was their friend.''
 Rare is the Hollywood movie, network television program or Broadway show that casts its stars from an open call. But QVC, a $7 billion annual business, where hosts can have television careers that span decades, does. The nominal stars of QVC are the budget clothing and jewelry designers who offer their creations, inventors touting new housewares and faded celebrities with exercise programs. But on a network that can move tens of thousands of dollars of merchandise a minute, the host plays a crucial role: part cheerleader for a celebrity guest, part M.C. executing the orders of producers to end a slow-selling item's airtime gracefully, part fantasy friend to viewers, coaxing them to call. 
 It's a rare skill set, and industry sources say the network is willing to compensate hosts for it extremely well, up to $500,000 a year. 
 Among the hopefuls who lined up outside QVC's corporate headquarters before 6:15 a.m. last Friday was Mark Werden, a former singer and dancer with the self-empowerment performance group Up With People. The candidates had been told to bring an object they would pretend to sell during their two-minute auditions. Mr. Werden, wearing a bright pink sweater, carried an aluminum frying pan his mother gave him when he left for college. 
 ''This frying pan comes with love,'' he said, beginning his audition in a cramped room with three QVC employees looking on from behind a videocamera. Tapes from promising candidates would be shown to higher-ups, and around 35 would be called back for the next round. The company intends to hire two to four hosts this year, said Michael George, its president and chief executive. 
 Afterward, Mr. Werden, 42, said he was hoping for a career change from being a private guidance counselor. Why the old frying pan? 
 ''It's pretty easy to sell something if you believe in it,'' he said.
 Professional hosts must move merchandise even if they don't believe in it. As the hopefuls auditioned, Leah Williams, a host who joined QVC in 1996, performed live in the spacious studio at the back of the building, playing a gracious sidekick to an accessories designer, Kathy Van Zeeland, who was offering an imitation leather handbag. After Ms. Van Zeeland flipped the bag open and said the exterior fabric had a ''leather hand'' (meaning it feels like leather), Ms. Williams said that what appealed to her was the tiny makeup mirror on the inside of the top flap.
 ''Love it,'' the host said, sweeping her gaze from bag to camera. ''Love,'' she repeated. She paused long enough for the word that can mean so much, and so little, to inhabit its own full measure of airtime. Finally, she completed her thought with another word spoken as if it deserved its own sentence: ''It.''
 A lot of drama for a $37.12 handbag and only a few seconds in a three-hour shift on camera.
 ''For me,'' said Sandra Bennett, a host who was hired after last year's open call, ''the hardest challenge is staying perky for three hours.''
 Ms. Bennett, 36, a former television news anchor in Harrisburg, impressed her auditioners so much that they ushered her into Mr. Comstock's office that very day. She soon signed a contract and began the rigorous six-month training program and trial period for new hosts. Now she typically arrives at QVC at 11 p.m. to prepare and appears on the air at 3 a.m.
 QVC officials would not say how much hosts are paid, but Kerry McNally, a former host on rival HSN who is now on the ShopNBC network, said they can make half a million dollars or more annually.
 And a kind of celebrity comes with the job. Mary Beth Roe, a former Minnesota beauty queen, who has been a QVC host for 17 years, said that fans often want to hug her. ''Viewers are very sweet,'' she said.
 While QVC, which employs 16,900 people worldwide (there are channels in England, Germany and Japan), is a major economic engine for West Chester, some residents say a few of the hosts have developed swollen egos. 
 ''There's some of them who host shows who think they're movie stars,'' said Allan Hofmann, the general manager of Transplant Transmissions, a repair shop in this college town, the home of West Chester University, founded in 1871. ''They talk down to people. When they're in the stores, they act like they shouldn't have to pay for stuff. 'Do you know who I am?' they ask.''
 Online discussion boards like those at tvtalkshows.com chronicle every hairstyle change and facial wrinkle of some hosts. One thread on a discussion board about Ms. Bennett is titled ''Sandra is superhot, but lacks pizazz.'' Another remarks on her ''sexy feet.'' 
 Ms. Bennett said she has stopped reading about herself. ''I'd rather my feedback come from my producers than whether someone online likes my hair or not,'' she said.
 Being the subject of celebrity gossip is a problem plenty of people might like, judging by the eagerness of would-be hosts. Sporting a furry beard and metal-rim glasses, and with a soft midsection, Eddie Deutch, a salesman at an Apple computer store in King of Prussia, showed up with a laptop to ''sell'' at his audition. 
 Mr. Deutch, 53, spoke easily to the camera during his two minutes. Was he telegenic enough for QVC? He did not have the baby blue eyes of Rick Domeier, who appeared in his pre-host days on the soap opera ''The Young and the Restless'' and in the movie ''Evil Dead II.''
 Appearance did not seem to concern Mr. Deutch, who maintained: ''Viewers don't care if it's coming from a model or someone who can just talk clearly to them. Talking about tech is something I'm good at.'' He went away hopeful. 
 Although QVC is more than twice the size of HSN, its nearest competitor, Mr. George, the QVC president, keeps watch on his rivals. He has seven televisions on in hisoffice, some tuned to ShopNBC, Jewelry Television and HSN. 
 How does he compare his network with the others? ''What makes us unique in the world of televised retailing,'' he said, ''is we were founded on the basic notion that this is a new nascent industry of TV shopping that is filled with hype and schlock, and we're going to be the opposite of that, the quality, value, convenience network.''
 Executives at HSN, formerly the Home Shopping Network, did not seem to dispute that assessment. Andy Sheldon, who was named the senior vice president for television at HSN five months ago, said by phone he hopes to class up its image, in part by toning down the on-the-air talent's heavy eye makeup and ''big hair.'' He is flying his hosts to New York to have them styled by Oscar Blandi at his salon. 
 ''If a host starts putting on weight, then I will absolutely say something to them,'' Mr. Sheldon said from his company's headquarters in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
 As Ms. Seegers, the bank employee, auditioned, her blond hair was perfectly in place and her voice was calm as she made her points, including remembering the correct item number, H98618, for the sugared Easter wreath she was selling. (It had already appeared on QVC.) The fabric on the wrists of her black blazer vibrated slightly, apparently betraying her nerves. 
 Even television pros can falter under audition pressure. Shelley Crenshaw, a former television news reporter at stations in the Seattle area, who has been out of work for about a year, was also hoping to be hired. Wearing a low-cut purple shirt, she spoke clearly, but her performance did not wow Mr. Comstock, who said later he would probably invite her back for a second audition, based only on her resume. ''My advice to Shelley would be calm down, be yourself,'' he said.
 Ms. Crenshaw said she would not be ashamed at moving from the world of television journalism to home shopping, but while waiting to hear from QVC, she's spending her time watching CNN.
 ''For example, that stuff with the shootings in Virginia and Imus,'' she said, ''I've been glued to the TV. I still like to know what's going on in the world.''

HEADLINE: Should Wolfowitz Stay, or Should He Go?

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Public Rebuke for Wolfowitz, but He Digs In'' (front page, April 16):
 For someone who prides himself on holding nations accountable on ethical standards, Paul D. Wolfowitz, the president of the World Bank, has shown that he is not above the corruption he supposedly decries. 
 His appointment to the World Bank was already clouded with cries of cronyism from the beginning, and Mr. Wolfowitz has only reinforced the belief that Bush administration officials -- both former and current -- do not respect the bounds of decency. 
 Although his resignation is appropriate, it would do nothing to repair the damage already inflicted on America's world image. Kevin Yeh Ithaca, N.Y., April 16, 2007 To the Editor:
 Re ''Time for Mr. Wolfowitz to Go'' (editorial, April 16):
 I do not agree that Paul D. Wolfowitz should resign as president of the World Bank. Although your ostensible reasons for his doing so have nothing to do with Iraq, or his last job in Donald H. Rumsfeld's Pentagon, I would be willing to bet that the calls for his staying put or resigning coincide very neatly between those who supported the Iraq war (and the Bush administration) and those who did not.
 From all that I have read, it appears that Mr. Wolfowitz was above board about his relationship with his companion, and his attempts to recuse himself from decisions about her placement were rebuffed. 
 Because of the Bush administration's incompetence in Iraq, the president and those associated with him are weakened. The knives are out, and a Wolfowitz resignation will be a victory for those at the World Bank (and elsewhere) who resented his appointment from Day 1. Alexander Goldstein Brooklyn, April 16, 2007 To the Editor:
 Over the last 30 years, Paul D. Wolfowitz has been accused of, among other things, being an apologist for dictators, developing and carrying out the strategies for the illegal invasion of Iraq, and most recently, his uncompromising and damaging executive stint at the World Bank.
 And after all of this, we are just now publicly scrutinizing Mr. Wolfowitz's character because he is accused of using influence to get his girlfriend a job and a pay raise. Thank heaven for the indiscretions of the heart. They may just save the world. Jim Hill Patchogue, N.Y., April 16, 2007
