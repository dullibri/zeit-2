HEADLINE: In Search of Terroir, Ear to the Ground

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
WALLA WALLA, Wash. -- Nobody would call Kevin Pogue a rock star, but in the smallish world of the Washington wine industry, few would dispute that he is Dr. Rock.
Dr. Pogue, a geology professor at Whitman College, a small liberal arts school with a bucolic campus here, has made a specialty of the study of terroir, that French term that has come to stand for many of the important components that make wines distinctive. Along with climate, altitude, exposition and the human factor, soil, drainage and terrain are terroir's chief components, which is where Dr. Pogue comes in.
Aside from teaching a seminar on terroir every year, in which he introduces his students to the intricacies of the subject, complete with wine tastings, Dr. Pogue has become a spokesman for the potential of Washington terroirs and the wines they produce. He has even turned his expertise into an opportunity. 
He has developed a thriving side business as a terroir finder, assessing pieces of land and divining promising vineyards for would-be grape growers and winemakers. He's put more than 115,000 miles on his 2009 Nissan Xterra, traveling the back roads of wine country with a pick, shovel and other tools of the trade, looking for unusual geological and climatological combinations. With the help of his students, he has planted a network of temperature monitors on hillsides and in meadows, upslope and down, looking for pockets of land that may hold the potential to produce great wine.
His clients have included anybody from established winemakers to serious wine-loving investors to ''just a bunch of lawyers from Seattle,'' a phrase heard not infrequently around Walla Walla, a charming town in southeastern Washington that has not yet been engulfed by boutiques and other indications that winemaking has shifted from agriculture to ''lifestyle.''
''If people are going to spend a small fortune on a piece of land, they need to talk to Kevin Pogue,'' said Christophe Baron, proprietor of Cayuse Vineyards, who makes beautifully complex wines. ''There's no better man who knows about terroir in the Northwest.''
The importance of the work of Dr. Pogue, building on the work of pioneering academics like Alan Busacca and Larry Meinert, signals the increasing maturity and seriousness of the Washington wine industry. Since the modern Washington wine industry took off in the 1970s, many vineyards have been planted in the fertile silty loams alongside other important crops like wheat, apples and hops.
At their best, wines made from these grapes, often cabernet sauvignon and merlot, offered superb fruit flavors and lush, silky textures. But they were limited by the simplicity of the terroirs, which were often chosen for convenience or economics rather than with an eye to complexity.
Now, in appellations like Walla Walla Valley, Red Mountain, Columbia Gorge and others, many growers are looking beyond valley floors to explore hillsides, some of which are insanely steep and rocky, hoping to make wines with more complexity and a greater sense of place.
''We're just beginning to figure out where our good terroirs are,'' Dr. Pogue said. ''Most plantings have been driven by things like cost, or whether water was available, or whether it's easy to farm.''
Some of the newer projects are most definitely not easy to farm. Ryan Johnson, a top vineyard manager, has recently planted a vineyard in 12 acres of rocky soils on the steep upper slopes of Red Mountain, including syrah, grenache, mourvèdre and tempranillo, an area Dr. Pogue calls ''primo Washington terroir.'' And three years ago, Mr. Baron of Cayuse planted a little more than two acres of syrah on another steep, rocky slope overlooking the north fork of the Walla Walla River, where the Walla Walla appellation dips into Oregon near the city of Milton-Freewater.
''It's a crazy project, but it's not about the money,'' Mr. Baron said. ''What drives me is the passion. Kevin gathered hundreds of samples to document the soils. It's an incredible mix.''
Mr. Baron, who said the site reminded him of Côte-Rôtie, said he was inspired by legendary northern Rhône vignerons like Marius Gentaz and Noël Verset: ''I want to do it exactly the same way, very traditionally, fermented in concrete tanks with lots of stems, and age in big old barrels with no new oak.''
Such projects are just the leading edge of the Washington wine business, accounting for only a minute fraction of the state's production, which is dominated by behemoths like Chateau Ste. Michelle Wine Estates and Hogue Cellars.
They make good, sound wines, but the excitement for wine lovers is with smaller producers who are striving for something more distinctive, like Cayuse, Buty, Maison Bleue, Kerloo Cellars or Analemma in the Columbia Gorge. With Dr. Pogue's work, the hope is that more and more producers will seek out the sort of cool-climate, steep-slope vineyards with the potential to make distinctive wines.
Dr. Pogue didn't start out to study terroir. His original fieldwork involved studying the geological composition of the Himalayan foothills near the Peshawar Basin in Pakistan. But research in the area became too dangerous after the 9/11 attacks, so he shifted his academic focus closer to home. It helped that he had become a wine lover as well.
''What it boiled down to, I like to drink wines that don't taste like every other wine, that have some unique character to them,'' Dr. Pogue said. ''I think it's more exciting when that character comes from the ground and not the person who made it.''
He's particularly excited by the unique geological character of Washington, which stems from a series of huge floods that engulfed the region at the end of the last ice age. These floods deposited a wealth of gravel, silt and granite boulders while eroding the volcanic basalt that forms the bedrock. That, along with the long growing season, the intensity of the light and the fact that Washington is one of the few grape-growing areas on earth that has not yet been affected by phylloxera, an aphid that destroys vines, gives the state vast potential for its wines, Dr. Pogue believes.
''Everybody can talk, but not everybody has something to say,'' he said. ''I think we're going to find a lot more places that have something interesting to say.''

HEADLINE: A Corporate Retreat For Team-Building, With a Taste of Wine

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI and STACY SLINKARD

 BODY:
IT seems counterintuitive for companies to take their employees somewhere where the alcohol begins to flow even before lunch is served. But wineries around the world are increasingly accommodating businesses asking for meeting space, catering and even wine-making lessons for their workers.
These are not drunken office parties; most of the alcohol consumption is associated with supervised wine-making activities, and top executives are usually present, says Mauricio Romo, tourism manager at the Viu Manent vineyard in Chile, who said he had not seen ''bad behavior'' in the five years his winery had offered business meetings. At the same time, once guests learn how complex winemaking is, company goals seem more achievable, Mr. Romo said. 
Here is a sampler of vineyards offering corporate retreats.
Chile
With smocks over their casual business clothes, guests at Viu Manent, near Santa Cruz in the Colchagua Valley about 90 miles south of Santiago, go out in the vineyard and pick grapes. Or, if they prefer, they can do what employees of Bayer did recently: blend wine, design labels and market their finished product in an exercise called ''Winemaker for a Day.'' Participants aren't creating anything Wine Spectator is going to review, but the vineyard's tourism manager says they may pay more attention at a meeting like this one.
''The objective for large companies is to take their executives prisoner in order to concentrate their attention,'' Mr. Romo said, describing an excursion that might begin at 7 a.m. in Santiago, the capital, with a two-hour bus ride to the valley. ''After a coffee, they have their telephones amputated from their soul so they can concentrate on the message.''
How much time will be spent as amateur viticulturists depends on the agenda and what the boss wants to accomplish. But a day always ends with a dinner and generous servings of the Malbec that Viu Manent is known for. The vineyard has indoor and outdoor meeting facilities appropriate for groups of all sizes and a plan for overnight accommodations is in the works.
Germany
One hour by train from Frankfurt along the Main River is the wine-growing region of Franconia. Tourists come to enjoy the historic villages and winding bike paths, but with banking, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing in the region, more than a quarter of the Americans visiting Germany are there for business, according to the national tourism board. In 2000, Artur Steinmann and his daughter, Steffi, decided to corral this market by adding a conference center and a six-room inn to the Artur Steinmann Winery.
''Today it's not enough anymore to focus only on wine production,'' Ms. Steinmann said. ''We are very proud of being one of the first wineries in our region, which could offer business meetings and accommodation combined with wine.''
Small groups of employees from SSI Schaefer Noell, a German warehouse and logistics company, regularly visit Steinmann for sales meetings. The company's travel manager, Nico Kiesl, says costs are about half of what it pays for similar accommodations in a big city, and participants get more personal attention as well as wine when the day is done.
Wine tastings and a tour of the cellar are available if a company requests it, and sometimes guests will hike up to the trail above town and visit the vineyards where the region's Silvaner and Müller-Thurgau grapes are grown.
''A little walk and a small glass of wine can really bring energies back,'' Ms. Steinmann said.
Italy
Tourism is a large part of the economy in Italy's Lombardy Lake District, but Lake Iseo, north of Milan, is still relatively undiscovered.
Seeing an opportunity, the Bersi Serlini winery five years ago added a large meeting room and four guest suites to its brick-and-stone structure. One hundred and eighty people can now attend conferences in the main hall.
When they are ready for a break, guests head down an old stairway to the vaulted cellar where a unique Italian sparkling wine called Franciacorta is made in the traditional method of Champagne, with the secondary fermentation taking place in the bottle.
The meeting space opened in 2006 with social events in mind, but adding corporate functions has been a boon, bringing customers in during the workweek when business is otherwise slow. Hosting companies has also increased sales, according to Chiara Bersi Serlini, who manages the winery along with her sister. ''Typically they ask to have a special bottle included in the whole deal so that the guests all take it home,'' Ms. Serlini said. ''Most guests will also buy some from the shop.''
California
In the Napa Valley, the vineyards producing the region's famous cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay have long welcomed tourists, and about 10 percent of them are traveling on business, according to the Napa Valley Conference and Visitors Bureau, so it is no wonder that many of the valley's wineries encourage corporate gatherings.
''The corporate client is looking for a unique, customized event,'' says Tracy Drash, director of retail operations for Constellation Brands, which owns the Robert Mondavi Winery. In addition to wine-related activities, Mondavi offers business meeting attendees an opportunity to join in a garden-to-table program, picking and preparing produce from the gardens.
Ten miles north of the Robert Mondavi Winery is the Castello di Amorosa, a castle and wine estate inspired by 13th-century Tuscany, where Mary Pham, digital marketing manager for Toyota, recently held an event for auto dealers. Other businesses that come for work-related meetings might want to advise their employees to dress down, because team-building activities here could mean stomping grapes.

HEADLINE: Plan to Do Work in Coach? You'd Better Not Count on It

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
WHEN you travel for business, do you have every intention of getting work done on the plane? If you're in business class, you could be good to go. If you're in coach, good luck with that.
Given the right conditions, an airplane can be an excellent place to work because it's a chance to get away from it all and focus, says Julie Morgenstern, a productivity consultant in New York and author of ''Organizing From the Inside Out.'' On a plane, too, ''you've got a built-in deadline, which is the landing time,'' she said, and that can help you pace your work. 
Ms. Morgenstern regularly helps executives manage their time. Here's something she has heard from them: ''Travel can get tedious on the body, and you miss your family, but it also can be the best place to get things done.''
However, working on a plane is ''a lot easier if you're in business class, there's no question about it,'' she said. She advises employers to invest in business-class seats for their workers and to talk to them in advance about the work they plan to do.
Joe Brancatelli, publisher of a Web site for business travelers called Joesentme.com and a frequent flier himself, is appalled at the number of business people who are expected to fly coach and still get work done. Coach seats will give you around 31 inches of legroom, and the seats are 17 to 18 inches wide, he said. Can you imagine sitting that close to your colleagues at work? Plus, the tray table is a flimsy piece of plastic that can barely hold a drink and you're ''putting a three- to seven-pound laptop on it,'' he said. In business class, by contrast, you and your things can spread out.
His advice is stark: if you have to fly coach, you shouldn't expect to get work done. That is based on his own experience and his conversations with thousands of business travelers, he said.
Ms. Morgenstern is less dogmatic. She thinks you can still get work done in coach, unless you're sitting in the middle seat. It's best to get an aisle seat for the extra room on the side, she said. If your employer or client is unwilling to shell out for business class, consider paying a little extra for the Economy Plus or similarly named seats that have more legroom, she said.
And here's something she's learned from experience: If you're flying coach, don't take a seat at the bulkhead, because that's where airlines tend to put parents with babies.
To be productive on a plane, you need to prepare on the ground, Ms. Morgenstern said. Limit yourself to two or three projects and determine in advance which devices, files and printouts you will need to tackle them. She also recommends buying plastic jacket sleeves in different colors and putting each project in a separate sleeve for the plane, so you aren't constantly rummaging for your work. Don't pick projects that are ''paper dense,'' she said, so that everything can fit in your carry-on.
She advises carrying a small pouch for work materials: for example, a flash drive, pens, pencils and reading glasses -- and whatever else you need to create an instant office in the air.
Noise-canceling headphones can be useful not only to muffle noise, she said, but also to signal to your seatmates: I'm here to work.
An airline flight can be an ideal time to tackle strategy work or aspects of your professional development, she said. ''When I'm on a plane, all of a sudden I can solve the big problems,'' she added. Removed from the distraction of external demands, you can use your plane time for introspection, she said.
Toward that end, Ms. Morgenstern has some advice that may surprise business travelers: Don't check your e-mail when you're on a plane. ''This is your quiet place. This is your study carrel. Don't bring that staccato stuff.''
With Wi-Fi becoming widely available on planes, however, many business travelers are expected to be available at all times, Mr. Brancatelli said. ''We've built a society that says you can never be out of touch. Business travelers were better off when the plane was a cocoon.''
''In the old days, pre-electronic device, you either relaxed on a plane, or it was your creative thinking time.''
Betsy Nicoletti, a health care consultant based in Springfield, Vt., who flies at least a few times a month, says there can be ideal conditions for working while flying, ''but I'm not often in those ideal conditions.'' Spreading out in business class is not a luxury she can generally afford, so she works as best she can when she flies coach. ''But if I don't have an aisle seat, I can almost give up,'' she said. And her heart sank recently when she found herself seated next to a ''Typhoid Mary,'' who coughed repeatedly with no attempt to cover her mouth.
At times, being a good worker means knowing when to quit, Ms. Nicoletti said. ''On a recent flight, I spent about an hour writing one paragraph, and it was a lousy paragraph,'' she said. ''So I watched a movie on my computer.''
She added: ''Sometimes the most productive thing I do on an airplane is nap.''

HEADLINE: To Satisfy Its Investors, Cash-Rich Apple Borrows Money

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and PETER EAVIS; Charles V. Bagli contributed reporting.

 BODY:
9:00 p.m. | Updated
With a $145 billion cash hoard, Apple could acquire Facebook, Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo. Put another way, it could buy every office building and retail space in New York, according to city estimates.
But despite its extraordinarily flush balance sheet, the technology behemoth borrowed money on Tuesday for the first time in nearly two decades. In a record-size bond deal, the company raised $17 billion, paying interest rates that hovered near the low-cost debt of the United States Treasury.
Apple's return to the debt markets raises a riddle: Why would a company with so much cash even bother to issue debt?
The answer has a lot to do with the frenzied state of the bond markets. Companies are issuing hundreds of billions of dollars in debt to exploit historically low interest rates. They are also feeding strong investor demand for high-quality corporate bonds as an alternative to money market funds and Treasury bills, which are paying virtually nothing. 
Apple's maneuver, however, also reflects the unusual challenges of a fabulously successful company with a sinking stock price. Apple is plagued by concerns that its growth may be slowing, and its shares have plummeted from a high last fall of more than $700 to under $400 last month.
In an effort to assuage a growing chorus of frustrated investors, the company is issuing bonds to help finance a $100 billion payout to shareholders. Apple said last week that it planned to distribute that amount by the end of 2015 in the form of paying increased dividends and buying back its stock. Since that announcement, Apple shares have risen 10 percent, closing at $442.78 on Tuesday
Taking on debt can actually magnify the returns for shareholders and improve stock performance, financial specialists say. It can reduce the overall cost of the capital that a company invests in its business. In addition, after a stock buyback, there are fewer shares, which can increase their value.
Yet even as shareholders and analysts welcome the financial tactics, they emphasize that the maker of iPhones, iPads and Macs must continue to innovate and fend off increasing competition. After all, today's Apple could be tomorrow's Palm.
''This is a substantial return of cash and it's the right thing to do on many levels,'' said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. ''But, ultimately, the company has to execute. This is no substitute for that.''
By raising cheap debt for the shareholder payout, Apple also avoids a potentially big tax hit. About two-thirds of Apple's cash -- about $102 billion -- sits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions. If it returned some of that cash to the United States to reward its investors, it could have significant tax consequences for the company. In some ways, the bond issue is a response to that tax situation.
''They have been so successful with their tax planning that they've created a new problem,'' said Martin A. Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a publisher of tax information. ''They've got so much money offshore.''
The $17 billion debt sale by Apple is the largest corporate issuance on record, surpassing a $16.5 billion deal from the drug maker Roche Holding in 2009, according to Dealogic.
Apple joins a parade of large companies issuing debt with astonishingly low yields. Last week, Nike sold bonds that mature in 10 years that yielded only 2.27 percent. In November, Microsoft set the record for the lowest yield on a five-year bond, issuing the debt at 0.99 percent. In comparison, the yield on the 10-year Treasury on Tuesday was 1.67 percent, while the five-year note yielded 0.68 percent.
''If you look at these big companies like Apple and Microsoft doing these big, low-cost bond offerings, it's a way for them to raise money in an effort to create better returns for their shareholders,'' said Steven Miller, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. ''The bond markets are practically begging these corporations to issue debt because of how cheap it is to raise money.''
On Tuesday, Apple issued six different securities, with maturities ranging from a three-year note yielding 0.45 percent to a 30-year bond that yields 3.85 percent. The largest piece, a $5.5 billion issue, is a 10-year yielding 2.4 percent. While good for the company, longer-term bonds with yields this low can fall steeply in price if interest rates go up, hurting investors who hold them. Still, $3 billion of the Apple debt are notes whose interest rates are periodically reset.
Despite all the cash held by Apple, the credit-rating agencies have not awarded it their coveted AAA ratings, citing increased competition and a concern that its future product offerings could disappoint. Moody's Investors Service gave Apple its second-highest rating, AA1, as did Standard & Poor's, rating the company AA+. (Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, and Automatic Data Processing have the highest credit ratings from Moody's and S.&. P.)
''There are inherent long-run risks for any company with high exposure to shifting consumer preferences in the rapidly evolving technology and wireless communications sectors,'' wrote Gerald Granovsky, a Moody's analyst.
Apple's less-than-perfect rating did not drive away investors on Tuesday. The offering generated investor demand of about $52 billion, according to Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, which led the sale of the issuance.
Desperate for returns in a yield-starved world, investors like insurance companies, pension funds and foreign governments have been snapping up corporate debt. Individual investors are also driving the demand: this year, through last Wednesday, a record $55 billion has flowed into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest in corporate debt with high-quality ratings, according to the fund data provider Lipper.
Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and former chief executive, had long resisted calls to dispense big sums to investors. In 2010, when Apple's cash stood at $50 billion, he rejected pressure to make large distributions to shareholders. The company's cash balance continued to grow after Mr. Jobs's death in 2011, as it generated billions of dollars in earnings each quarter. Over the last 12 months, Apple operations have been generating about $150 million of cash a day.
A year ago, the new chief executive, Tim Cook, announced a decision to start returning $45 billion to shareholders. But that did not satisfy everyone. David Einhorn, chief executive of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital and an Apple shareholder, pressed the company to do even more.
The excitement surrounding Apple's bond deal on Tuesday stood in stark contrast to the gloom that hung over the company when it last issued debt. In 1996, Apple faced a crisis, with shrinking sales of its niche computers and a weakening balance sheet that earned a junk credit rating. In the middle of the year, its shares reached a 10-year low.
''Will Apple Computer run out of cash soon?'' asked an article in The New York Times on April 7, 1996. That summer, it tapped the bond markets, raising about $600 million and averting a crisis.
Later in the year, Mr. Jobs, who had left Apple more than a decade before, returned to the company.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Anheuser-Busch InBev Reports a Small Profit Increase

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -- Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, posted a small rise in profit in the first quarter, but sold 4.1 percent less beer and other drinks compared with the period last year. The company also cut its sales forecast for Brazil, its second-biggest market, in part because rising food prices are reducing the amount of money that consumers there have to spend on beer. 
Core profit, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rose 0.9 percent to $3.43 billion, but was below even the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll of brokers. Anheuser-Busch also reported sales declines in every region except Asia, where China was exceptionally strong.
The company, which has a two-thirds share of the Brazilian beer market, said consumers there drank 8.2 percent less beer than a year ago because of the earlier timing of the Carnival, poor weather and high food inflation. It also lost market share.
''Brazil has been a great banker for years. It wobbled a bit last year. Now, it's taken a further leg down,'' said Andrew Holland, beverage analyst at Societe Generale.
The company, which makes Budweiser, Stella and Beck's, missed first-quarter profit forecasts, and said that Brazilian sales volumes were likely to be flat or down by a low-single-digit percentage this year. It had previously forecast low- to mid-single digit growth there.
The world's top brewers are relying on emerging markets for growth amid a prolonged squeeze on consumer incomes in austerity-hit Europe and limited expansion in the United States. But bad weather and tax-related price increases have posed challenges recently.
Felipe Dutra, the company's chief financial officer, said the early Carnival in Brazil, which shortened the summer drinking season, and wet weather had been known factors. But March proved particularly weak, with industry volumes down by a percentage in the high teens.
''We had continued weak weather into March,'' Mr. Dutra said. ''But we also saw a peak in food inflation which impacts real disposable income.''
Brazilian inflation accelerated in March to 6.59 percent, breaching the official target ceiling of 6.5 percent for the first time since November 2011.

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Crisis, Deutsche Bank Issues Shares to Shore Up Its Books

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
4:58 p.m. | Updated FRANKFURT -- Shares in Deutsche Bank rose for a second day after the bank sold 2.96 billion euros ($3.87 billion) in new stock on Tuesday to help it bolster the size of its capital reserves.
Deutsche Bank has long faced criticism that its capital buffers, the money that banks set aside to absorb losses in a crisis, were inadequate and that it carried too much risk from derivatives and other volatile investment banking products. 
But since taking over last year, Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, the bank's co-chief executives, have been hoarding profit and selling assets to raise the proportion of capital to money at risk. Bank officials insisted that the share sale was not done in response to pressure from regulators in Europe or the United States.
''It was our decision,'' Mr. Jain said on Tuesday during a conference call with analysts. ''There was no gun to the head.''
Still, the move will go a long way toward ending the bank's reputation as one of Europe's riskiest and least-capitalized lenders. The new capital will allow it to rank near the top among large European banks in the size of its reserves, rather than near the bottom, and to comfortably meet new regulatory requirements.
The bank also raised more than it aimed for when it first announced the share sale on Monday. Institutional investors paid 32.90 euros a share for the new equity, Deutsche Bank said, a discount to the market price in Frankfurt on Tuesday of 35.03 euros.
Shares of Deutsche Bank, the largest German lender, rose 5 percent in New York trading on Tuesday on expectations that the share sale will clear the way for higher dividend payments, even though an increase in the number of shares lowers each shareholder's cut of profits.
Mr. Jain and Stefan Krause, the bank's chief financial officer, portrayed the share issue as a turning point that would set the stage for the bank to focus less on its baggage from the financial crisis and more on growth and profit.
''We could see where a capital raise would bring us to the point where the capital issue was off the table,'' Mr. Jain said.
European banks have as a rule taken longer to put the financial crisis behind them than American banks. The European lenders have had to deal with the burden of euro zone debt, but they also faced less pressure from regulators to confront their problems. Lately, though, there have been signs that some of the bigger banks are returning to health.
Investors had other good news to cheer from the bank this week. On Monday, the bank reported that net profit in the first quarter rose nearly 18 percent, to 1.66 billion euros, from 1.41 billion euros in the period a year earlier.
Though revenue rose a modest 2 percent, to 9.4 billion euros, the bank was able to cut costs. Mr. Krause said on the conference call that the bank expected to save about a billion euros over the full year.
Some analysts were still cautious about the bank's long-term prospects. The bank faces uncertainty over the European economy, which is stuck in recession. It also continues to address an array of legal proceedings that could be costly to resolve.
''Whilst we still see risks from litigation, regulation and the macro environment, the strengthened capital position should put the group in a better position to deal with these challenges going forward,'' analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note to clients. Credit Suisse upgraded Deutsche Bank shares to neutral, from underperform.
Deutsche Bank also said it would raise an additional 2 billion euros later in the year in the form of so-called hybrid equity, a form of debt that converts to shares in time of crisis and can thus be counted toward capital. The bank is waiting for German regulators to clarify rules for such instruments before it issues them.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Single-Family Home Prices Increased 9.3% in February

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Home prices rose in February at their fastest rate in almost seven years, another sign the housing market recovery will help counter the drag on the economy from government belt-tightening. 
The S&P/Case Shiller index of 20 metropolitan areas released on Tuesday showed single-family home prices rose 9.3 percent in February from a year earlier.
The data reinforces the view that rising home prices could make Americans feel better about spending this year, helping counter a blow to economic growth from tax increases and government spending cuts.
''This will be a powerful positive fundamental, not only for housing, but presumably helpful for consumer spending as well,'' said Stephen Stanley an economist at Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Conn.
Another report showed consumer confidence rebounded in April as Americans felt better about the outlook for the economy and their income prospects. The Conference Board, a private industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 68.1 from a revised 61.9 the previous month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 60.8.
Still, there appears to be a growing risk that weakness in the labor market and broader economy could dial down the housing recovery's strength. Hiring slowed drastically in March and economic growth was lackluster in the first quarter, raising fear that the economy could struggle to cope with Washington's austerity drive.
Business activity in the Midwest unexpectedly contracted in April to its lowest level since September 2009 as a gauge of employment declined, another report showed.
The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer fell to 49, below the 50 mark that denotes contraction and falling short of economists' expectations for 52.5.

HEADLINE: In Continuing Sign of Weakness, Unemployment Hits New High in the Euro Zone

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The euro zone jobless rate rose to a record 12.1 percent in March, a sharp reminder that unemployment remains among the region's biggest problems.
The unemployment rate in the 17-nation currency union ticked up by one-tenth of a percentage point from February, when the previous record was set, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported from Luxembourg. A year earlier, the rate was 11 percent. 
A separate report Tuesday from Eurostat showed that inflation dropped sharply, well below the European Central Bank's target rate of 2 percent a year. The annualized rate of inflation for consumer prices was 1.2 percent in April 2013, down from March, when it was 1.7 percent.
The reports, along with other recent data that suggested that the economy was healing more slowly than many had hoped, could prompt the European Central Bank to take action at its policy meeting on Thursday. The central bank could cut its key interest-rate target, already at a record low of 0.75 percent, by a quarter point, economists said, though the impact of such a move would probably be slight because banks remain less than eager to lend.
''Stabilizing the peripheral euro zone countries will take at least until the end of 2013,'' said Ralph Solveen, an economist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. As a result, he said unemployment would probably keep rising ''until next spring.''
For the 27-nation European Union, the jobless rate was unchanged in March, at 10.9 percent. Eurostat estimated that 26.5 million men and women were unemployed in Europe, including 5.7 million young people.
Jobless figures for both the euro zone and the European Union are the highest Eurostat has reported since it began keeping the data in 1995, in the days before the euro. In comparison, the unemployment rate in the United States was 7.6 percent in March.
The European economy remains trapped in a torpor with little relief in sight. Governments have tightened public finances to meet deficit targets, and companies remain reticent about hiring. The euro zone's gross domestic product is widely expected to decline for a second consecutive year in 2013.
Manufacturers are largely dependent on demand from outside Europe for growth. Carmakers, which employ about two million people in Europe, anticipate that sales in the European Union will this year fall back to levels last seen in the early 1990s.
A decline in energy prices helped push the inflation rate lower, but Jennifer McKeown, an economist in London with Capital Economics, said that the jobless problem was probably itself part of the reason for the downward pressure on prices.
She said in a note that it would be ''a disappointment'' if the central bank failed to ease rates and ''announce further unconventional policies to boost bank lending.''
Two nations are staggering under depression-level jobless rates: Greece, where the European sovereign debt crisis began, had a rate of 27.2 percent in January, the latest month for which data were available; and Spain, which had unemployment of 26.7 percent in March.
Portugal was next at 17.5 percent. Germany, which has the largest economy in the European Union, was at 5.4 percent, with only Austria, at 4.7 percent, lower. Britain's rate was 7.8 percent, while France's was 11 percent.

HEADLINE: Élysée Palace To Put Wine Up for Bid

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- The dreaded phantasm of economic austerity has finally knocked its bony fingers on the door of the Élysée Palace, which announced on Tuesday that it would auction off 1,200 bottles of its finest wines, renew its cellar with ''more modest'' vintages and return the surplus to the state budget. 
President François Hollande, a Socialist who was elected a year ago, has made a point of trying to be a ''normal president'' and contrast his simpler style with the ''bling bling'' image of his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. He has trimmed the presidential and ministerial fleet of cars, and has cut ministerial salaries.
But the wine cellars of the Élysée are rightly famous for showcasing the best of French wines. And while Mr. Hollande has offered guests a knowledgeably chosen selection of more modest wines, selling some of the older stock is a bit like selling grandmother's silver.
The last Socialist president, François Mitterrand, was well known for his love of Burgundy and for a St.-Estèphe, Haut-Marbuzet. Georges Pompidou was said to love Chasse-Spleen, while Valéry Giscard d'Estaing favored fine Bordeaux from the Médoc. Jacques Chirac, who had high tastes in art and wine, and a fondness for Dom Pérignon, preferred to be seen in public drinking beer.
Given the size of the deficit, this auction represents just drops in the bucket -- highly exclusive drops.
Among the wines to be auctioned at the end of the month at the Hôtel Drouot, through the Paris auction house Kapandji Morhange, are three bottles of 1990 Château Petrus, estimated to be worth $3,000 to $3,400 a bottle, and a 1998 Meursault Premier Cru, a fine white burgundy. There will also be bottles of 1975 Château Lafite Rothschild, estimated at more than $1,000 each, and 1985 Krug Champagne, as well as Champagne from Salon, some of the world's rarest and most expensive.
In general, the best bottles are served to heads of state and monarchs. When President George W. Bush made his last visit to France in 2008, Mr. Sarkozy, who like Mr. Bush does not drink alcohol, served Château Mouton Rothschild to his guests.
The chief sommelier of the Élysée, Virginie Routis, who was appointed in 2007, selected the bottles to be sold. They make up just a tenth of the presidential cellars, which were established in 1947. Lesser bottles will be sold, too, with some expected to start at as little as $20 and many available for less austere prices of under $130.
In a statement, the Élysée said that ''the proceeds from this sale will be reinvested in more modest wines, and the excess will be returned to the state budget.''
While the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has been excoriated in France as the mother of austerity, especially by the Socialists, there will be no German wines for sale. The cellars of the Élysée allow no foreigners. But French rieslings from Alsace will be on sale.

LENGTH: 793 words

HEADLINE: Douglas R. Lebda

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Lebda, 43, is the chairman and chief executive of Tree.com, a public company based in Charlotte, N.C., and the parent of LendingTree.com, an online marketplace that matches mortgage borrowers with lenders.
Mr. Lebda started LendingTree in 1996, and in 2003 it was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp. LendingTree was spun off by IAC five years later under the corporate name Tree.com.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. LendingTree grew out of your own frustration with mortgage shopping.
A. So in 1994 I bought a condo in Pittsburgh. I opened up the newspaper, looked at interest rates and picked a bank that had the lowest rate. I walked down to the bank branch and applied for a loan. Sure enough, the rate in the paper wasn't the rate they offered me. I tried to comparison shop, and, of course, I had to walk to another bank branch.
I thought: Why can't you have banks compete for business and create a marketplace the same way as you can for anything else? I founded the company because I felt that the banks had control over me in this process and I felt very disempowered through the whole thing. I think consumers still feel that way.
Q. What was the genesis of the ''Tree'' name?
A. Before LendingTree the company was named Credit Source for a very brief time. On the eve of closing my very first financing, I got a letter from a major financial services firm, who will remain unnamed, saying they have the name ''Credit Source'' and you can't use it.
We went through a naming exercise with an agency. We brainstormed hundreds of names before choosing LendingTree. Some of them were just horrible. I remember one of them was Loan-Ranger. I was first going down the path of something related to ''exchange,'' like Loan-Ex. At one point we had the name Lend-Ex.
Q. Which was the first lender to sign up?
A. It was PNC, then National City.
Today we have over 300 lenders -- not all the big ones are on there all the time.
Q. How much do lenders pay LendingTree to facilitate deals?
A. They pay us a fee for every borrower we introduce them to, and that will vary. It'll be as low as a couple of dollars to as high as over $100.
Q. How is business right now?
A. Business is phenomenal.
Q. How many transactions so far?
A. We actually don't disclose transactions.
Q. Are 30-year fixed-rate loans still the most popular mortgage product?
A. That still seems to be the trend.
Q. What is your assessment of the lending market right now?
A. As refinancing is slowing down, banks need more volume and so they look to people like us to give them volume. Underwriting standards are starting to loosen a little bit.
Q. How so?
A. It really involves the credit score, loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio. Lowering the credit score, allowing higher debt-to-income ratios and higher loan-to-values.
Q. Where do you see the company in the next few years?
A. The Internet has made it easier to shop for prices, but it's almost made it more confusing, not less. We find that most consumers don't comparison shop for a mortgage.
We want to demystify that. Through new tools and improvements in our technology and in our processes, we want to make it so everybody can have an account on LendingTree -- whether you're a customer or not. We want to make the tools and the calculators easy to use, save scenarios, and figure out what you can afford.
We just launched a rate table product. We're launching something called the best loan for life in the middle of this year, which will enable you to never have to guess again whether you should refinance. We'll simply monitor your credit, we'll monitor your home value, we'll let you set a goal and when the goal is achieved -- whether it's a savings goal or shortening your payment or term or reducing your payment -- we will essentially introduce you to a lender to do that deal.
We're also launching something called the Lender Directory -- like a TripAdvisor for the mortgage industry. For loan officers or mortgage brokers there will be a page on LendingTree where their customers can rate them and review them.
Q. What about mobile users?
A. We're redoing our mobile site right now to make it better. We have not done any apps yet. We have one small rate-finder app that hasn't gotten a lot of traction. That's something else we expect to address this year. The best mobile applications are ones that actually need to be location-dependent. Shopping for homes, for example, is a great mobile app; figuring out a restaurant is a great mobile app while you're on the go. Things where you need to get alerted are good mobile apps. Filling out a mortgage form? Not so much.
Q. So are you still doing Ironman triathlons?
A. I did Kona two years ago and switched to ultramarathons. Running is a great time to think and just relax.

HEADLINE: South Korea Pulls Bosses From Plants In North

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- All the remaining South Korean factory managers in an industrial park in North Korea returned home early Tuesday, as political tensions drove the two Koreas to sever their last economic ties.
The withdrawal of the 43 factory managers meant that the Kaesong Industrial Complex, in the North Korean border town of Kaesong, was emptied out except for seven South Koreans who will remain for a few days to sort out a dispute over unpaid wages.
When that is settled, South Korea is expected to turn off the electricity it supplies to the complex, which until now has been one of the most brightly lighted parts of North Korea, a country shrouded in darkness at night because of a severe lack of fuel. 
South Korea had planned to withdraw all 50 of its citizens from Kaesong by 5 p.m. Monday, but a dispute over the payment of some wages and taxes owed to the North delayed their departure. In the end, 43 factory managers were allowed to cross the border after midnight, while five officials and two communications technicians from the South stayed to sort out the dispute.
North Korea pulled out all of its 53,000 workers from Kaesong on April 9 in a protest against joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea. It also blocked South Korean managers and supply trucks from entering the complex.
But it was not until Friday, when the North rejected a proposal for dialogue, that the South announced a decision to withdraw all of its 175 managers and officials, who had stayed in Kaesong hoping the complex would reopen. Of those, 125 left on Saturday, loading as many finished products as they could fit in the trunks and on the seats, roofs and hoods of their cars.
The emptying out of the Kaesong complex represents a new low in inter-Korean relations. South Korea cut off all other economic ties with North Korea in 2010, blaming it for the sinking of a warship and the deaths of 46 sailors. North Korea cut off all military and Red Cross hot lines with the South last month, removing all official ties between the Koreas except for the lines of communication between their civil aviation authorities.
The American-South Korean military drills ended Tuesday. But there was no sign that the Koreas would end their dispute over the complex anytime soon.
''Our offer for dialogue still stands,'' Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae, South Korea's point man on the North, said in a speech to government advisers on Tuesday. ''But North Korea must abandon its trite behavior. If they act like this, who will invest in the North?''
Even if the Kaesong complex resumes operation, Mr. Ryoo said, it will take a considerable effort by the North to dispel the mistrust it sowed among South Korean and other potential investors by the way it forced the closing of the factory park.
Since it began operations in late 2004, the Kaesong industrial park, where South Korea ran factories with low-wage North Korean labor, had served as a symbol of Korean cooperation. In recent years, as those ties deteriorated, the complex stood as the last vestige of the ''sunshine policy'' the South pursued from 1998 to 2008. That policy was built upon the idea that projects like the Kaesong complex would encourage North Korea to engage more with the outside world.
But the complex, built in ''a very carefully constrained environment'' that essentially detached it from the rest of North Korea, ''has not led to the kind of systematic openings and interactions'' that the supporters of the project had hoped for, Kurt Campbell, a former American assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said during a conference organized by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul on Tuesday.
So far, the Kaesong complex is the biggest casualty in the standoff that developed after North Korea's nuclear test in February.
The North indicated that it was placing military priorities over the $90 million in hard currency its Kaesong workers earned annually at the factory park.
On Saturday, the North said shutting the complex down for good would allow its military to redeploy more troops, artillery and tanks along the border just north of Seoul, the South's capital, ''thus opening up the route of advancing to the South.'' The building of the Kaesong complex pushed North Korean troops away from the corridor between Kaesong and Seoul, which was the North Korean Army's main invasion route at the outset of the Korean War in 1950.

HEADLINE: Banks Resist Strict Controls Of Foreign Bets

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON; Ben Protess contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Wall Street bankers and some of the world's top finance ministers are waging a bitter international campaign to block Washington financial regulators from extending their policing powers far beyond the nation's shores.
The effort -- centered on oversight of the $700 trillion marketplace of the financial instruments known as derivatives -- is just one front in the battle still being waged nearly three years after Congress passed the Dodd-Frank law, which revamped financial regulations in the United States in hopes of curtailing the risky trading practices blamed for the global financial crisis in 2008.
Industry players have spent tens of millions of dollars to avert, delay or weaken new rules that are being drafted as part of the law. Members of Congress from both parties have joined in the effort, directed at an obscure but increasingly powerful agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has written and must approve some of the most contentious provisions.
Banks and overseas regulators are resisting an agency proposal, intended to go into full effect as early as mid-July, that would require overseas offices of American-based banks, foreign institutions and hedge funds to turn over information on foreign trades if they involve United States customers, or are guaranteed by a financial institution with American ties, requirements that the industry calls redundant and excessive. 
The battle -- led by high-powered lawyers and lobbyists, including former top regulators and Congressional staff members, like a former aide to retired Representative Barney Frank, a chief author of the law -- has played out in hundreds of meetings with Gary Gensler, the chairman of the commission, other commission members and major players on Capitol Hill.
It has divided Democrats in Congress, caused strains in the commission and provoked public charges by industry officials that Mr. Gensler is overreaching his authority and private complaints that he is ''reckless'' and ''stubborn.''
A former investment banker, Mr. Gensler defends his proposals, arguing that too many bad bets in the global derivatives market can be traced to overseas locations -- including the $6 billion loss last year by a JPMorgan Chase trader called the London Whale -- and threatened markets in the United States.
''It would be letting down the American public if we said, we are just about to complete the task but now, let's retreat,'' Mr. Gensler said in an interview. ''If we don't do this right, we will blow a hole in the bottom of the boat of reform.''
Industry officials argue that the proposals, called the cross-border guidance, will inevitably produce conflicts with foreign regulators and perhaps even drive trading away from Wall Street banks to competitors overseas.
''We should all care, because that cost will have to be passed on, in the form of higher prices for products sold to consumers or a lower return for investors,'' said Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., a former House lawmaker turned financial industry lobbyist, whose organization Sifma has urged Mr. Gensler to compromise on the cross-border rules.
Some of the strongest objections have come from foreign regulators, including officials from Britain, Russia, Japan and Germany, who complained about the plan last month in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. Global markets, they said, ''will not be able to function under such burdensome regulatory conditions,'' advocating instead that the United States agree to respect rules each nation adopts, assuming they are reasonably compatible.
Mary L. Schapiro, who recently stepped down as chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said she admired Mr. Gensler for his doggedness. But, she noted, ''he believes very strongly in the positions he takes -- that does not always lend itself to compromise quickly.''
The S.E.C., which has jurisdiction over a much smaller share of derivatives trading than Mr. Gensler's agency, is scheduled to consider a narrower cross-border requirement on Wednesday. With American regulators in disagreement, the industry could have more leverage.
The role of Mr. Gensler's agency greatly expanded under Dodd-Frank, which called for significantly tighter regulation of derivatives, used by a broad array of companies to help manage risk. An airline, for instance, uses them to hedge against the fluctuating cost of jet fuel. One form of derivatives, credit-default swaps, helped topple the giant insurer American International Group in 2008, deepening the financial crisis.
In the fight over the law's provisions, the commission has been outmatched, said Bart Chilton, one of three Democratic appointees on the panel. ''They have really unlimited resources,'' he said of industry officials. Rules expected to take one year in the making have stretched out to three.
''It has created what I call dysfunction junction,'' he added.
Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were among the first to weigh in. Kenneth M. Raisler, a former general counsel at the commodity commission and now a partner at the New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, said the plan would damage his clients in overseas markets, as foreign customers would start to avoid American banks. JPMorgan Chase alone had $70 trillion of derivatives outstanding at the end of last year, a large portion of which were booked overseas.
Annette L. Nazareth, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member and now a lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell, whose clients include Goldman Sachs and an industry trade association, said that foreign regulators, in most cases, should be able to oversee transactions that take place in their own nations, including those handled by American-based banks.
''You might have Citibank London doing business with a Swiss branch of a Dutch bank,'' Ms. Nazareth said in an interview. ''That is the kind of stuff that is coming up every day.''
The protests by the banks have been reinforced by dozens of members of Congress, who have written letters complaining to Mr. Gensler, introduced legislation to try to block the cross-border plan and questioned him about the proposal.
''That's a considerable amount of concern expressed, not only by the industry, but by members of Congress,'' Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr., Democrat of Georgia, told Mr. Gensler last month.
To court Democrats, Goldman Sachs enlisted Michael Paese, who served as senior aide to Mr. Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who had been chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. JPMorgan Chase hired Thomas C. Koonce, the former legislative director to another Democrat who had served on that committee, while Citibank hired Paul Thornell in 2007, a former aide to Vice President Al Gore. A separate team focuses on Republican lawmakers.
Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey, who serves as chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees capital markets, has emerged as a leading critic of Mr. Gensler's plan, sponsoring legislation that would curb his powers.
Mr. Garrett has collected more than $535,000 in contributions from investment banks and securities companies in the last election cycle, behind only Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, in the House.
Banks made a simple request, Mr. Garrett said: ''Put as much pressure as possible on the C.F.T.C.''
Consumer advocates, who had been wary of Mr. Gensler at first because of his 18-year career at Goldman Sachs, now see him as one of their most important allies.
''He uses the knowledge he gained working inside at a high level in a Wall Street bank to regulate Wall Street in a way that they can't evade,'' said Dennis M. Kelleher, a former Capitol Hill staff aide who runs a consumer advocacy group called Better Markets.
But Mr. Gensler has struggled at times to win support for his proposals from the two other Democratic appointees on the five-member commission.
(''Fratricide,'' one commissioner jokingly described the tensions to an industry executive, speaking only on condition of anonymity.)
Backing off from Mr. Gensler's demands has led to some important industry victories, including one that avoided higher collateral standards for all but the biggest banks or hedge funds.
Protests have also slowed down a rule that would have required companies to notify at least five banks when requesting a price for a planned swap, a requirement intended to create more competition.
Agency records show Mark P. Wetjen, a Democratic commissioner, has met dozens of times with a variety of industry groups on the issue.
Mr. Wetjen, in an interview Tuesday, said he now supports reducing the requirement to as few as two calls, as he said demanding more could be counterproductive, increasing the price, instead of lowering it.
He and Mr. Chilton, his fellow commission Democrat, have both expressed concerns about the cross-border plan, which may force Mr. Gensler to compromise before a final vote is taken on the proposal; the Republican appointees both appear to support narrowing the provision. One of them, Scott D. O'Malia, said the Dodd-Frank law allows the agency to regulate only actions that have a ''direct and significant connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States.''
Mr. Gensler said his determination to protect the cross-border regulation plan is motivated in part by the memory of a visit in September 1998 -- while he was working in the Treasury Department -- to the Connecticut headquarters of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, which was collapsing.
The company, he said, was engaged in $1.2 trillion in derivatives transactions, conducted in part through the Cayman Islands, making it harder to trace the origins of its implosion.
''This thing is going down, it is going down,'' he recalled telling his boss. ''I don't want to make that call again, and I don't want to leave it to my successors.''

HEADLINE: Tech Shares Help Lift S.&P. 500

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market moved slightly higher on Tuesday, recovering from an early slump, after I.B.M. announced in midmorning that it would buy back more stock and raise its dividend.
I.B.M. and other technology stocks, including Apple, helped lead the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to another nominal record closing high. The broad-market measure ended April with a 1.8 percent gain, the sixth consecutive month that the S.& P. 500 has moved higher. That is the longest stretch of gains since a seven-month run that started in March 2009, when the market hit a financial crisis low, and ended in October 2009.
Worries about slower economic growth have rattled the stock market during April, but it has consistently bounced back. Brad Sorensen, director of market research at the brokerage firm Charles Schwab, said that was a result of investors having few alternatives. 
''Right now it seems like every pullback in the market is seen as a buying opportunity,'' Mr. Sorensen said. ''People may say they're getting nervous, but where else are you going to put money at this point? Into Europe with their political issues? Into Treasuries paying less than 1.7 percent?''
The S.& P. 500 edged up 3.96 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,597.57. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had fallen as much as 84 points in morning trading, ended with a gain of 21.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 14,839.80. The Nasdaq composite index rose 21.77 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,328.79.
A report of another record high in European unemployment helped drive money into United States government debt, briefly sending the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its lowest level of the year, at 1.65 percent. By the end of trading, however, the price of the 10-year Treasury note was down 2/32, to 102 30/32, while its yield was unchanged at 1.67 percent.
I.B.M. rose $3.39, or 1.7 percent, to $202.54, after it said it would increase its quarterly dividend by a dime, to 95 cents, and buy back up to $5 billion more of its own stock.
Apple rose $12.66, or 2.9 percent, to $442.78. The company on Tuesday borrowed $17 billion in a record-size corporate bond offering to take advantage of very low interest rates in order to help finance a $100 billion payout to its shareholders.
This earnings season has delivered investors a mixed collection of news. More than half of the companies in the S.& P. 500 have turned in results, and seven of 10 have beaten analysts' estimates for earnings, according to S&P Capital IQ. Nearly as many, however, have come up short on revenue: Six of 10 have missed analysts' revenue targets. That suggests companies are getting more of their profits from laying off staff and other cost-cutting efforts instead of from higher sales.
Among the stocks making big moves, Pfizer dropped 4 percent after the drug maker's results fell short of what analysts had expected. Falling sales of Lipitor, its cholesterol drug, crimped revenue. The drug maker also cut its profit forecast for the rest of the year. Pfizer lost $1.36 to $29.07
Stock in Pitney Bowes, the maker of mailing equipment and software, fell 16 percent after it cut its dividend in half and posted a 58 percent drop in net income. Its shares sank $2.53 to $13.67.
Avon Products gained 4 percent after its quarterly loss was not as deep as analysts had expected. The direct-seller of cosmetics has been cutting staff and scaling back operations in an effort to turn around its business. Shares of Avon rose 92 cents to $23.16.

HEADLINE: E-Books and Democracy

BYLINE: By ANTHONY W. MARX. 
Anthony W. Marx is the president of the New York Public Library.

 BODY:
WRESTLING with my newspaper on the subway recently, I noticed the woman next to me reading a book on her smartphone. ''That has to hurt your eyes,'' I commented. Not missing a beat, she replied, in true New York style, ''My font is bigger than yours.'' She was right.
The information revolution raises profound questions about the future of books, reading and libraries. While publishers have been nimble about marketing e-books to consumers, until very recently they've been mostly unwilling to sell e-books to libraries to lend, fearful that doing so would hurt their business, which is under considerable pressure. 
Negotiations between the nation's libraries and the Big Six publishers -- Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Group, Random House and Simon & Schuster, which publish roughly two-thirds of the books in America -- have gone in fits and starts. Today Hachette, which had been a holdout, is joining the others in announcing that it will make e-books available to public libraries. This is a big step, as it represents, for the first time, a consensus among the Big Six, at least in principle, that their e-books should be made available to library users.
E-book readership is rising much faster than readership of print books; digital books could soon be the most popular book format. Readership of our e-books soared 168 percent from 2011 to 2012; print circulation, while much larger, remained constant.
Over a quarter of New York City's 8.2 million residents borrow books from the city's three public library systems. For those who cannot afford to buy downloads, digital books from libraries are essential to improving literacy, civic engagement and the technological facility necessary for economic success.
The Great Recession triggered a nationwide surge in library usage. Total circulation at the New York Public Library's 87 neighborhood branches -- in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island -- has risen 44 percent since 2008.
Libraries remain essential repositories of books, periodicals and research collections, but they are also places to check e-mail and browse the Web -- a third of New Yorkers lack home broadband -- and to learn computer skills, seek jobs and get information about government benefits. At a time of painful austerity and rising inequality, we are raising money to rapidly expand English-language classes, computer training and after-school programs. Along with our counterparts in Brooklyn and Queens, we are supplementing school libraries by delivering print books directly to schools.
E-books might not seem like a priority given those daunting tasks -- but as the nature of reading changes, access to these books is essential for libraries to remain vital. The New York Public Library helped lead talks with the publishers over e-books. Before today's breakthrough, we had some false starts. While HarperCollins, in 2003, was the first to provide access, after the downturn, it limited the number of times each e-book could be lent, while Hachette decided to no longer sell new e-books to libraries, and Penguin, which had agreed to do so, said it might back out. To their credit, the publishers have now each come around.
Last September, Penguin agreed to make its e-books available to patrons at the New York Public Library and the Brooklyn Public Library, but with a six-month lag for new titles. Penguin recently agreed to release e-books to libraries at the same time its hardcovers came out. In April, Simon & Schuster agreed to sell e-books to the city's libraries. Today's announcement by Hachette (whose imprints include Little, Brown) is the capstone of that process.
Many issues still need to be sorted out. Five of the Big Six are making their entire e-book inventory available to us to choose from, while Macmillan is offering only a limited selection. HarperCollins allows us to lend each e-book we acquire only 26 times per title; Penguin and Simon & Schuster offer one-year licenses; and Random House sells licenses without time limits but charges much more per license. (In all cases, an e-book can be borrowed by only one patron at a time.) Prices charged to libraries vary widely according to the kind of license agreement, and we hope they will be reduced as demand increases.
Selection remains limited. The New York Public Library had 100,000 copies of 37,000 digital titles in circulation last year, compared with 6.5 million copies in circulation of 1 million print titles. Just as libraries decide which physical books to purchase and how many of each, we now will be deciding the same for e-books. We also have to educate patrons that they can download library e-books anywhere and on any device. Most Americans don't even know that libraries offer e-books, according to national surveys.
We have every interest in seeing that publishers remain sustainable enterprises and that authors are paid fairly for their work. But those economic imperatives must be considered alongside the role of libraries in a democratic society. The challenge is to ensure that the information revolution provides more, not less, access for the public -- including that subway rider.

HEADLINE: New Friction as Mexico Curbs U.S. Cooperation in Drug War

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD, DAMIEN CAVE and GINGER THOMPSON; Randal C. Archibold and Damien Cave reported from Mexico City, and Ginger Thompson from New York.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- In their joint fight against drug traffickers, the United States and Mexico have forged an unusually close relationship in recent years, with the Americans regularly conducting polygraph tests on elite Mexican security officials to root out anyone who had been corrupted.
But shortly after Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, took office in December, American agents got a clear message that the dynamics, with Washington holding the clear upper hand, were about to change.
''So do we get to polygraph you?'' one incoming Mexican official asked his American counterparts, alarming United States security officials who consider the vetting of the Mexicans central to tracking down drug kingpins. The Mexican government briefly stopped its vetted officials from cooperating in sensitive investigations. The Americans are waiting to see if Mexico allows polygraphs when assigning new members to units, a senior Obama administration official said.
In another clash, American security officials were recently asked to leave an important intelligence center in Monterrey, where they had worked side by side with an array of Mexican military and police commanders collecting and analyzing tips and intelligence on drug gangs. The Mexicans, scoffing at the notion of Americans' having so much contact with different agencies, questioned the value of the center and made clear that they would put tighter reins on the sharing of drug intelligence. 
There have long been political sensitivities in Mexico over allowing too much American involvement. But the recent policy changes have rattled American officials used to far fewer restrictions than they have faced in years.
Asked about security cooperation with Mexico at a news conference on Tuesday, President Obama said: ''We've made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two governments over the last several years. But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved.''
Mr. Obama suggested that many of Mexico's changes ''had to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they're dealing with us, per se.'' He added, ''So I'm not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until I've heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish.''
Mr. Obama is scheduled to visit Mexico on Thursday and Friday on a mission publicly intended to broaden economic ties.
But behind the scenes, the Americans are coming to grips with a scaling back of the level of coordination that existed during the presidency of Felipe Calderón, which included American drones flying deep into Mexican territory and American spy technology helping to track high-level suspects.
In an interview, Mexico's interior minister, Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, made no apologies. He defended the moves, including the creation of a ''one-stop window'' in his department to screen and handle all intelligence, in the name of efficiency and ''a new phase'' in fighting crime.
In a country worn down by tens of thousands of people killed in a drug war, he said Mexico needed to emphasize smart intelligence over the militarized ''combating violence with more violence'' approach of the Calderón years.
But American officials here see the changes as a way to minimize American involvement and manage the image of the violence, rather than confronting it with clear strategies.
The lack of certainty over Mexico's plans and commitment has jeopardized new security assistance from the United States. Plans to release $246 million, the latest installment of a $1.9 billion anticrime package known as the Merida initiative, have been held up by Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. His office has been waiting for months for more details from the State Department and the Mexican government on how the money would be spent and what it might accomplish.
A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide a more candid assessment, said a recent visit by Mr. Osorio Chong to Washington helped calm some fears. A delegation of Mexican officials is also expected to visit in the coming weeks to explain the country's plans to members of Congress.
But there is growing anxiety that the violence has not diminished, with daily killings hovering around 50 since last fall. Some American officials say they are increasingly worried by public and private signs suggesting that Mr. Peña Nieto, the young face of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ran Mexico for 71 years, is putting the government's crime-fighting image above its actions.
''The cosmetics -- that's what they care about,'' one American official said, insisting on anonymity so as not to worsen already tense relations.
''The impression they seem to want to send is 'We got this,' '' one former American official said, asking for anonymity because he was discussing private conversations. ''But it's clear to us, no, they don't. Not yet.''
A senior administration official, asked for a sign of progress or a recent accomplishment in security matters, struggled with the question until pointing to the extradition to the United States of a few men on drug charges, conceding they were not big fish. Other extradition requests appear stalled; there were 155 last year, mostly for drug offenses, the highest in nearly a decade.
Tuesday evening, less than 48 hours before Mr. Obama's arrival and with mounting questions on whether Mexico would go after kingpins, Mexico announced it had captured Inés Coronel, the father-in-law of the most-wanted capo, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo. It was unclear if the United States played a role in the arrest.
If so, it would represent a step beyond the Mexican discomfort with Americans operating on their turf that emerged in December, just after Mr. Peña Nieto's inauguration. It solidified after an explosion on Jan. 31 at the office complex of the state oil company, Pemex, in which 37 people died and more than 120 were injured.
Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were invited to help investigate. But after they suggested in a preliminary assessment that a bomb might have caused the blast, the agency's role in the investigation was cut short, American officials said, adding that Mexican officials canceled a visit by a team of investigators from the United States.
An administration official said that while American explosives experts were not allowed to contribute as much as they could have to the investigation, creating a sense that the Mexicans were rushing to conclude that the blast was an accident.
On Feb. 4, the attorney general of Mexico announced that the cause was an unexplained buildup of gas, possibly methane, that was ignited by a spark in the basement of one of the buildings.
The American ambassador was invited to the news conference on the findings, but a State Department official said the level of American involvement in the investigation did not warrant the ambassador's presence. With the American agents leaving the cooperative center in Monterrey, which was first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, and the development of the one-stop intelligence mechanism, the United States is worried and is seeking more information.
''We're still figuring out what that means,'' a senior administration official said of the new intelligence arrangement.
But the fear is that it will diminish the access that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies have established with branches of the Mexican police and military. Those hard-fought relationships could disintegrate if American agents have to go through a central office to communicate and share knowledge with their Mexican counterparts, some American officials say.

HEADLINE: Transcript of Obama's News Conference

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of a news conference by President Obama at the White House on Tuesday, provided by Federal News Service. Click on a topic below to navigate to that section of the conference.
Syria (related article) | Benghazi | Boston Marathon Bombing (related article) | Domestic Agenda | Guantánamo Bay (related article) | Health Care | Immigration Reform | Mexico (related article) | Jason Collins (related article)
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Hello, everybody. Hello. Good afternoon -- or good morning, everybody. I am here to answer questions in honor of Ed Henry, as he wraps up his tenure as president of the White House Correspondents' Association. Ed, because of that, you get the first question. Congratulations.
Q: Thank you, sir. I really appreciate that. And I hope we can go back to business and being mad at each other in a little bit. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I'm not mad at you.
Q: OK. Thank you. I appreciate it.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You may be mad at me. (Laughter.)
Syria
Q: I'm not. (Laughter.)
A couple questions on national security. On Syria, you said that the red line was not just about chemical weapons being used but being spread, and it was a game changer, seemed cut and dry (sic). And now your administration seems to be suggesting that line is not clear. Do you risk U.S. credibility if you don't take military action?
And then on Benghazi, there are some survivors of that terror attack who say they want to come forward and testify, some in your State Department, and they say they've been blocked. Will you allow them to testify?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, on Syria, I think it's important to understand that for several years now what we've been seeing is a slowly unfolding disaster for the Syrian people, and this is not a situation in which we've been simply bystanders to what's been happening.
My policy from the beginning has been President Assad had lost credibility; that he attacked his own people, has killed his own people, unleashed a military against innocent civilians; and that the only way to bring stability and peace to Syria is going to be for Assad to step down and -- and to move forward on a political transition.
In pursuit of that strategy, we've organized the international community. We are the largest humanitarian donor. We have worked to strengthen the opposition. We have provided nonlethal assistance to the opposition. We have applied sanctions on Syria. So there are a whole host of steps that we've been taking precisely because even separate from the chemical weapons issue, what's happening in Syria is a blemish on the international community generally, and we've got to make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect the Syrian people.
In that context, what I've also said is that the use of chemical weapons would be a game changer, not simply for the United States for but the international community. And the reason for that is that we have established international law and international norms that say when you use these kinds of weapons, you have the potential of killing massive numbers of people in the most inhumane way possible, and the proliferation risks are so significant that we don't want that genie out of the bottle.
So when I've said the use of chemical weapons would be a game changer, that wasn't unique to -- that wasn't a position unique to the United States, and it shouldn't have been a surprise. And what we now have is evidence that chemical weapons have been used inside of Syria, but we don't know how they were used, when they were used, who used them; we don't have chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened. And when I am making decisions about America's national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapon use, I've got to make sure I've got the facts.
That's what the American people would expect. And if we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we can find ourselves in the position where we can't mobilize the international community to support what we do. There may be objections even among some people in the region who are sympathetic with the opposition if we take action. So, you know, it's important for us to do this in a prudent way.
And what I've said to my team is, we've got to do everything we can to investigate and establish with some certainty what exactly has happened in Syria, what is happening in Syria. We will use all the assets and resources that we have at our disposal. We'll work with the neighboring countries to see whether we can establish a clear baseline of facts. And we've also called on the United Nations to investigate.
But the important point I want to make here is that we already are deeply engaged in trying to bring about a solution in Syria. It is a difficult problem. But even if chemical weapons were not being used in Syria, we'd still be thinking about tens of thousands of people, innocent civilians, women, children, who've been killed by a regime that's more concerned about staying in power than it is about the wellbeing of its people. And so we are already deeply invested in trying to find a solution here.
What is true, though, is that if I can establish, in a way that not only the United States but also the international community feel confident is the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, then that is a game changer because what that portends is potentially even more devastating attacks on civilians, and it raises the strong possibility that those chemical weapons can fall into the wrong hands and get disseminated in ways that would threaten U.S. security or the security of our allies.
Q: By game changer, do you mean U.S. military action?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: By game changer, I mean that we would have to rethink the range of options that are available to us.
Now, we're already, as I said, invested in trying to bring about a solution inside of Syria. Obviously, there are options that are available to me that are on the shelf right now that we have not deployed, and that's a spectrum of options. You know, as -- as early as last year I asked the Pentagon, our military, our intelligence officials to prepare for me what options might be available. And I won't go into the details of what those options might be, but you know, clearly, that would be an escalation, in our view, of the threat to the security of the international community, our allies and the United States. And that means that there's some options that we might not otherwise exercise that we would -- that we would strongly consider.
Benghazi
Q: And on the Benghazi question, I know pieces of the story have been litigated, and you've been asked about it. But there are people in your own State Department saying they've been blocked from coming forward, that they survived the terror attack and they want to tell their story. Will you help them come forward and just say it once and for all?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Ed, I'm not familiar with this notion that anybody's been blocked from testifying. So what I'll do is I will find out what exactly you're referring to. What I've been very clear about from the start is that our job with respect to Benghazi has been to find out exactly what happened, to make sure that U.S. embassies not just in the Middle East but around the world are safe and secure and to bring those who carried it out to justice.
But I'll find out what exactly you're referring to.
Q: They hired an attorney because they're saying that they've been blocked from coming forward.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I'm not familiar with it.
Jessica.
Boston Marathon Bombing
Q: Mr. President, there's a report that your director of national intelligence has ordered a broad review -- this is in regards to the Boston marathon bombing -- that your DNI has ordered a broad review of all the intelligence gathering prior to the attack.
There is also a series of senators -- (name inaudible) -- Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham -- who allege that all these years after 9/11 there still wasn't enough intelligence shared prior to the attack. And now Lindsey Graham, who's a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, has said that Benghazi and Boston are both examples of the U.S. going backwards on national Security. Is he right and did our intelligence miss something?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No. Mr. Graham is not right on this issue, although I'm sure it generated some headlines. I think that what we saw in Boston was state, local, federal officials, every agency, rallying around a city that had been attacked, identifying the perpetrators just hours after the scene had been examined. We now have one individual deceased, one in custody. Charges have been brought.
I think that all our law enforcement officials performed in an exemplary fashion after the bombing had taken place. And we should be very proud of their work, as obviously we're proud of the people of Boston, all the first responders and the medical personnel that helped save lives.
What we also know is that the Russian intelligence services had alerted U.S. intelligence about the older brother as well as the mother, indicating that they might be sympathizers to extremists. The FBI investigated that older brother. It's not as if the FBI did nothing. They not only investigated the older brother; they interviewed the older brother. They concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity. So that much we know.
And the question then is, was there something that happened that triggered radicalization and actual -- an actual decision by the brother to engage in the attacks that we -- the tragic attack we actually saw in Boston, and are there things -- additional things that could have been done in that interim that might have prevented it?
Now, what Director Clapper's doing is standard procedure around here, which is when an event like this happens, we want to go back and we want to review every step that was taken. We want to leave no stone unturned. We want to see, is there in fact additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack? And we won't know that until that review is completed. We won't know that until the investigation into the actual crime is fully completed, and that's still ongoing.
But what I can say is, is that based on what I've seen so far, the FBI performed its duties; Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing.
But this is hard stuff. And I've said from -- for quite some time that because of the pressure that we put on al-Qaida core, because of the pressure that we put on these networks that are well- financed and more sophisticated and can engage and project transnational threats against the United States, one of the dangers that we now face are self-radicalized individuals who are already here in the United States, in some cases may not be part of any kind of network, but because of whatever warped, twisted ideas they may have, may decide to carry out an attack. And those are in some way more difficult to prevent.
And so what I've done for months now is to indicate to our entire counterterrorism team, what more can we do on that threat that is looming on the horizon? Are there more things that we can do, whether it's engaging in -- engaging with communities where there's a potential for self-radicalization at this -- of this sort? Is there work that can be done in terms of detection? But all of this has to be done in the context of our laws, due process. And -- and so part of what Director Clapper is doing then is -- is going to be to -- to see if we can determine any lessons learned from -- from what happened.
Q: Are you getting all the intelligence and information you need from the Russians? And should Americans be worried when they go to big public events now?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The Russians have been very cooperative with us since the -- since the Boston bombing.
You know, obviously, old habits die hard. There are still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back 10, 20, 30 years, back to the Cold War. But they're continually improving.
I've spoken to President Putin directly. He's committed to working with me to make sure that those who report to us are cooperating fully in not only this investigation but how do we work on counterterrorism issues generally.
In terms of what -- you know, the response of the American people, I think everybody can take a cue from Boston. You don't get a sense that anybody's intimidated when they go to Fenway Park a couple days after the bombing. There are joggers right now, I guarantee you, all throughout Boston and Cambridge and Watertown.
And I think one of the things that I've been most proud of in watching the country's response to the terrible tragedy there is a sense of resilience and toughness and we're not going to be intimidated. We are going to live our lives.
And, you know, people, I think, understand that we've got to do everything we can to prevent these kinds of attacks from taking place, but people also understand, in the same way they understand after a shooting in Aurora or Newtown or Virginia Tech or after the foiled attempts in Times Square or in Detroit, that we're not going to stop living our lives because warped, twisted individuals try to intimidate us. We're going to do what we do, which is go to work, raise our kids, go to ball games, run in marathons.
And at the same time, we're going to make sure that everybody's cooperating and is vigilant and doing everything we can, without being naive, to try to prevent these attacks from happening in the future.

Domestic Agenda
Q: Mr. President, you are a hundred days into your second term. On the gun bill, you put, it seems, everything into it to try to get it passed. Obviously, it didn't. Congress has ignored your efforts to try to get them to undo these sequester cuts. There was even a bill that you threatened to veto that got 92 Democrats in the House voting yes. So my question to you is do you still have the juice to get the rest of your agenda through this Congress?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, if you put it that way, Jonathan -- (laughter) -- maybe I should just pack up and go home. (Laughter.) Golly. You know, the -- I think it's -- it's a little -- (chuckles) -- as Mark Twain said, you know, rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point.
Look, we -- you know, we understand that we're in divided government right now. Republicans control the House of Representatives. In the Senate, this habit of requiring 60 votes for even the most modest piece of legislation has gummed up the works there. And I think it's -- comes to no surprise, not even to the American people, but even to members of Congress themselves, that right now things are pretty dysfunctional up on Capitol Hill.
Despite that, I'm actually confident that there are a range of things that we're going to be able to get done. I feel confident that the bipartisan work that's been done on immigration reform will result in a bill that passes the Senate and passes the House and gets on my desk. And that's going to be a historic achievement. And I'm -- I've been very complimentary of the efforts of both Republicans and Democrats in those efforts.
It is true that the sequester is in place right now. It's damaging our economy, it's hurting our people and we need to lift it. What's clear is, is that the only way we're going to lift it is we do a bigger deal that meets the test of lowering our deficit and growing our economy at the same time, and that's going to require some compromises on the part of both Democrats and Republicans. I've had some good conversations with Republican senators so far. Those conversations are continuing. I think there's a genuine desire on many of their parts to move past not only sequester but Washington dysfunction. Whether we can get it done or not, you know, we'll see.
But I think, you know, the sequester's a good example, or this recent FAA issue is a good example. You'll recall that, you know, even as recently as my campaign, Republicans were saying, sequester's terrible. This is a disaster. It's going to ruin our military. It's going to be disastrous for the economy. We've got to do something about it.
Then when it was determined that doing something about it might mean that we close some tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well- connected, suddenly, well, you know what? We'll take the sequester. And the notion was, somehow, that we had exaggerated the effects of the sequester. Remember? The president's, you know, crying wolf. He's chicken little. The sequester? No problem.
And then in rapid succession, suddenly White House tours, this is terrible. How can we let that happen? Meat inspectors, we've got to fix that. And most recently, what are we going to do about potential delays at airports?
So despite the fact that a lot of members of Congress were suggesting that somehow, the sequester was a victory for them and this wouldn't hurt the economy, what we now know is that what I warned earlier or what Jay stood up here and warned repeatedly is happening. It's slowed our growth, it's resulting in people being thrown out of work, and it's hurting folks all across the country.
And the fact that Congress responded to the short-term problems of flight delays by giving us the option of shifting money that's designed to repair and improve airports over the long term to fix the short-term problem, well, that's not a solution. So essentially, what we've done is we've said, in order to avoid delays this summer, we're going to ensure delays for the next two or three decades.
Q: Why -- (inaudible) --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, hold on a second. The -- so the alternative, of course, is either to go ahead and impose a whole bunch of delays on passengers now, which also does not fix the problem, or the third alternative is to actually fix the problem by coming up with a broader, larger deal.
But, you know, Jonathan, you seem to suggest that somehow, these folks over there have no responsibilities and that my job is to somehow get them to behave. That's their job. They are elected, members of Congress are elected in order to do what's right for their constituencies and for the American people. So if, in fact, they are seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety, then they shouldn't just be thinking about tomorrow or next week or the week after that; they should be thinking about what's going to happen five years from now, 10 years from now or 15 years from now.
The only way to do that is for them to engage with me on coming up with a broader deal. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do is to continue to talk to them about are there ways for us to fix this. Frankly, I don't think that if I were to veto, for example, this FAA bill, that that somehow would lead to the broader fix. It just means that there'd be pain now, which they would try to blame on me, as opposed to pain five years from now. But either way, the problem's not getting fixed. The only way the problem does get fixed is if both parties sit down and they say, how are we going to make sure that we're reducing our deficit sensibly; how are we making sure that we've investing in things like rebuilding our airports and our roads and our bridges and investing in early childhood education and all -- basic research, all the things that are going to help us grow, and that's what the American people want.
Just one interesting statistic when it comes to airports. There was a recent survey of the top airports in the country -- in the world. And there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25, not one. Not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world. I think Cincinnati Airport came in around 30th. Well, what does that say about our long-term competitiveness and future?
And so when folks say, well, there was some money in the FAA to deal with these furloughs, well, yeah, the money is this pool of funds that are supposed to try to upgrade our airports so we don't rank in the, you know, bottom of industrialized countries when it comes to our infrastructure. And that's what we're doing. We're using our seed corn short term. And the only reason we're doing it is because right now we've got folks who are unwilling to make some simple changes to our tax code, for example, to close loopholes that aren't adding to our competitiveness and aren't helping middle class families.
So I'm -- that's a long way of answering your question, but the point is that there are common-sense solutions to our problems right now. I cannot force Republicans to embrace those common-sense solutions. I can urge them to. I can put pressure on them, I can, you know, rally the American people around those -- you know, those common-sense solutions, but ultimately they themselves are going to have to say, we want to do the right thing.
And I think there are members certainly in the Senate right now and, I suspect, members in the House as well who understand that deep down, but they're worried about their politics. It's tough. Their base thinks that compromise with me is somehow a betrayal. They're worried about primaries. And I understand all that. And we're going to try to do everything we can to create a permission structure for them to be able to do what's going to be best for the country. But it's going to take some time.

Guantánamo Bay
Q: Mr. President, as you're probably aware, there's a growing hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay, among prisoners there. Is it any surprise, really, that they would prefer death rather than have no end in sight to their confinement?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it is not a surprise to me that we've got problems in Guantanamo, which is why, when I was campaigning in 2007 and 2008 and when I was elected in 2008, I said we need to close Guantanamo.
I continue to believe that we've got to close Guantanamo. I think -- well, you know, I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.
Now Congress determined that they would not let us close it and despite the fact that there are a number of the folks who are currently in Guantanamo who the courts have said could be returned to their country of origin or potentially a third country.
I'm going to go back at this. I've asked my team to review everything that's currently being done in Guantanamo, everything that we can do administratively, and I'm going to re-engage with Congress to try to make the case that this is not something that's in the best interests of the American people.
And it's not sustainable. I mean, the notion that we're going to continue to keep over a hundred individuals in a no man's land in perpetuity, even at a time when we've wound down the war in Iraq, we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, we're having success defeating al-Qaida core, we've kept the pressure up on all these transnational terrorist networks, when we've transferred detention authority in Afghanistan -- the idea that we would still maintain forever a group of individuals who have not been tried -- that is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop.
Now, it's a hard case to make because, you know, I think for a lot of Americans, the notion is out of sight, out of mind, and it's easy to demagogue the issue. That's what happened the first time this came up. I'm going to go back at it because I think it's important.
Q: (Off mic) -- continue to force-feed these folks -- (inaudible) --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I don't -- I don't want these individuals to die. Obviously, the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can. But I think all of us should reflect on why exactly are we doing this. Why are we doing this?
I mean, we've got a whole bunch of individuals who have been tried who are currently in maximum security prisons around the country. Nothing's happened to them. Justice has been served. It's been done in a way that's consistent with our Constitution, consistent with due process, consistent with rule of law, consistent with our traditions. The -- the individual who attempted to bomb Times Square -- in prison serving a life sentence. Individual who tried to bomb a plane in Detroit -- in prison serving a life sentence. A Somali who was part of al-Shahab (sic) who we captured -- in prison.
So we can handle this. And I understand that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, with the traumas that had taken place, why, for a lot of Americans, the notion was somehow that we had to create a special facility like Guantanamo, and we couldn't handle this in -- in a normal, conventional fashion. I understand that reaction.
But we're not over a decade out. We should be wiser. We should have more experience at -- in how we prosecute terrorists. And this is a lingering, you know, problem that is not going to get better. It's going to get worse. It's going to fester.
And so I'm going to -- as I've said before, we're -- examine every option that we have administratively to try to deal with this issue. But ultimately, we're also going to need some help from Congress. And I'm going to ask some -- some folks over there who, you know, care about fighting terrorism but also care about who we are as a people to -- to step up and -- and help me on it.

Health Care
Q: Mr. President, thank you. Max Baucus, Democratic senator, referred to the implementation of your health-care as a potential train wreck. (We've had ?) other Democrats been whispering nervousness about the implementation and the impact -- (inaudible) -- the impact that it might have on their own political campaigns in 2014. Why do you keep -- just curious, why does Senator Baucus, somebody who extensively helped write your bill, believe that this is going to be a train wreck? And why do you believe he's wrong?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I -- you know, I think that any time you're implementing something big, there is going to be people who are nervous and anxious about is it going to get done until it's actually done.
But -- but let's just step back for a second and -- and -- and make sure the American people understand what it is that we're doing. The Affordable Care Act, ''Obamacare,'' has now been with us for three years. It's gone through Supreme Court tests. It's gone through efforts to repeal. A huge chunk of it's already been implemented.
And for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they're already experiencing most of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act even if they don't know it. Their insurance is more secure. Insurance companies can't drop them for bad reasons. Their kids are able to stay on their health insurance until they're 26 years old. They're getting free preventive care.
So there are a whole host of benefits that -- for the average American out there, for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, this thing's already happened, and their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better, more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it. Now they don't have to worry about anything else.
The implementation issues come in for those who don't have health insurance, maybe because they have a pre-existing condition and the only way they can get health insurance is to go out on the individual market and they're paying 50 percent or a hundred percent more than those of us who are lucky enough to have group plans. People who are too poor to get health insurance and the employers don't offer them. Maybe they work for a small business and that small business can't afford right now to provide health insurance.
So all the implementation issues that are coming up are implementation issues related to that small group of people, 10 to 15 percent of Americans -- now, it's still 30 million Americans, but relatively narrow group -- who don't have health insurance right now or are on the individual market and are paying exorbitant amounts for coverage that isn't that great.
And what we're doing is we're setting up a pool so that they can all pool together and get a better deal from insurance companies. And those who can't afford it, we're going to provide them with some subsidies. That's it. I mean, that's what's left to implement because the other stuff's been implemented and it's working fine.
The challenge is that, you know, setting up a market-based system, basically an online marketplace where you can go on and sign up and figure out what kind of insurance you can afford and figuring out how to get the subsidies, that's still a big complicated piece of business.
And when you're doing it nationwide, relatively fast, and you've got half of Congress who is determined to try to block implementation and not adequately funding implementation, and then you've got a number of members of -- or governors -- Republican governors who know that it's bad politics for them to try to implement this effectively -- and some even who have decided to implement it and then their Republican-controlled state legislatures say don't implement and won't pass enabling legislation -- when you have that kind of situation, that makes it harder.
But having said all that, we've got a great team in place. We are pushing very hard to make sure that we're hitting all the deadlines and the benchmarks. I'll give you an example -- a recent example. You know, we put together initially an application form for signing up for participation in the exchanges that was initially about 21 pages long.
And immediately everybody sat around the table and said: Well, this is too long, especially, you know, in this age of the Internet. People aren't going to have the patience to sit there for hours on end. Let's streamline this thing.
So we cut what was a 21-page form now down to a form that's about three pages for an individual, a little more than that for a family, well below the industry average. So those kinds of refinements, we're going to continue to be working on.
But I think the main message I want to give to the American people here is despite all the hue and cry and, you know, sky-is- falling predictions about this stuff, if you've already got health insurance, then that part of ''Obamacare'' that affects you, it's pretty much already in place. And that's about 85 percent of the country. What is left to be implemented is those provisions to help the 10 to 15 percent of the American public that is unlucky enough that they don't have health insurance. And by the way, you know, some of you who have health insurance right now, at some point you may lose your health insurance, and if you've got a pre-existing condition, this structure will make sure that you are not left vulnerable.
But it's still a big undertaking. And what we're doing is making sure that every single day we are constantly trying to hit our marks so that it will be in place
And -- and the last point I'll make, even if we do everything perfectly, there'll still be, you know, glitches and bumps, and there'll be stories that can be written that says, oh, look, this thing's, you know, not working the way it's supposed to, and this happened and that happened. And that's pretty much true of every government program that's ever been set up.
But if we stay with it and we understand what our long-term objective is, which is making sure that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should go bankrupt if they get sick and that we would rather have people getting regular checkups than going to the emergency room because they don't have health care -- if -- if we keep that in mind, then we're going to be able to drive down costs, we're going to be able to improve efficiencies in the system, we're going to be able to see people benefit form better health care, and that will save the country money as a whole over the long term.
Q: Do you think without the cooperation of a handful of governors, particularly large states like Florida and Texas, that you can fully implement it?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think it's harder; there's no doubt about it.
Q: But can you do it without those?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: We -- we will implement it. There will be -- we have a backup federal exchange. If states aren't cooperating, we set up a federal exchange, so that people can access that federal exchange.
But yes, it puts more of a burden on us. And it's ironic, since all these folks say that they believe in empowering states, that they're going to end up having the federal government do something that we'd actually prefer states to do if they were properly cooperating. See how we're doing on time here. Last question. Antonieta Cadiz. Where's Antonieta? There you are. Tell those big guys to get out of your way. (Laughter.)
Immigration Reform
Q: Thank you. And two questions. There are concerns about an immigration deal from the House -- from the Gang of Eight -- in the House can complicate the chances for immigration reform in the Senate. It seems to be a more conservative proposal. Is there room for a more conservative proposal than the one presented in the Senate? That's immigration.
And second, on Mexico, yesterday the Mexican government said all contact with the U.S. law enforcement will now go through a single door, the federal Interior Ministry. Is this -- is this change good for the U.S. relationship with Mexico?
Do you see -- (inaudible) -- of security and cooperation -- (inaudible)?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: On immigration reform, I've been impressed by the work that was done by the
Gang of Eight in the Senate. The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would've written. There are elements of it that I would change. But I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start, which is we've got to have more effective border security, although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last four to five years. We should make sure that we are cracking down on employers that are gaming the system. We should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome, the bureaucracy is not as complicated so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion. And we want to make sure that we've got a pathway to citizenship that is tough but allows people to earn over time their legal status here in this country. And, you know, the Senate bill meets that -- those criteria -- in some cases, not in the ways that I would, but it meets those basic criteria. And I think it's a -- you know, it -- it's a testament to the senators that were involved that they made some tough choices and make some tough compromises in order to hammer out that bill.
Now, I haven't seen what members of the House are yet proposing. And maybe they think that they can answer some of those questions differently or better, and I think we've got to be open-minded in seeing what they come up with.
The bottom line, though, is, is that they still got to meet those basic criteria. Is it making the border safer? Is it dealing with employers and how they work with -- with the governments to make sure that people are not being taken advantage of or taking advantage of the system? Are we improving our legal immigration system? And are we creating a pathway for citizenship for the 11 million or so who are undocumented in this his country?
And if they meet those criteria but they're slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise. If it doesn't meet those criteria, then I will not -- I will not support such a bill. So we'll have to wait and see.
Mexico
When it comes to Mexico, I'm very much looking forward to taking the trip down to Mexico to see the new president, Pena Nieto. I had a chance to meet him here, but this will be the first more extensive consultations and will be an opportunity for his ministers, my Cabinet members who are participating to really hammer out some of these issues.
A lot of the focus is going to be on economics. We've spent so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes I think we forget this is a massive trading partner responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border. We want to see how we can deepen that, how we can improve that and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time.
That doesn't mean that we're not going to be talking about security. I think that in my first conversation with the president, he indicated to me that he very much continues to be concerned about how we can work together to deal with transnational drug cartels. We've made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two governments over the last several years. But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved. And some of the issues that he's talking about really have to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they're dealing with us per se.
So -- so I'm not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until I've heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish. But overall, what I can say is that my impression is, is that the new president is serious about reform. He's already made some tough decisions. I think he's going to make more that will improve the economy and -- and security of Mexican citizens, and that will improve the bilateral relationship as well.
And I -- I -- I don't want to leave out that we're also going to be talking to -- during my visits, to Costa Rica, the presidents of Central American countries, many of whom are struggling with both economic issues and security issues but are important partners for us, because I think the vision here is that we want to make sure that our hemisphere is more effectively integrated to improve the economy and security of all people. That's good for the United States. That will enhance our economy. That can improve our energy independence.
There are a whole range of opportunities, and -- and that's going to be the purpose of this trip.
And I'm sure that those of you who will have a chance to travel with me will have a chance to discuss this (part of it ?). All right? Thank you very much, everybody
Jason Collins
Q: Jason Collins, do you want to say anything about him?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah, I'll say something about Jason Collins. I had a chance to talk to him yesterday. He seems like a terrific young man, and, you know, I told him I couldn't be prouder of him. You know, one of the extraordinary measures of progress that we've seen in this country has been the recognition that the LGBT community deserves full equality, not just partial equality, not just tolerance but a recognition that they're fully a part of the American family. And, you know, given the importance of sports in our society, for an individual who's excelled at the highest levels in one of major sports go ahead and say, this is who I am, I'm proud of it, I'm still a great competitor, I'm still seven feet tall and can bang with Shaq and, you know, deliver a hard foul -- and for, you know, a lot of young people out there who, you know, are -- are -- are, you know, gay or lesbian, who are struggling with these issues, to see a role model like that who's unafraid, I think it's a great thing. And I think America should be proud that this is just one more step in this ongoing recognition that we treat everybody fairly. And everybody's part of a -- part of a family, and we judge people on the basis of their character and their performance, and not their sexual orientation. And so I'm very proud of him. All right?

HEADLINE: Measuring The Benefits Of Tech Tools

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER.

 BODY:
When I was a young reporter we could not afford cellphones. I remember waiting in line for a pay phone in downtown Mexico City one afternoon to call in the news about the auction to privatize the phone company Telmex, driving those behind me crazy while a copy editor on the other end patiently typed it into those glowing green letters of an earlier information age.
I traveled to Japan with a TRS-80 portable computer, which ran on AA batteries and had plastic cups to put over the phone receiver. It transmitted copy at the blistering speed of 300 bits per second. And I wrote about Mexico's tequila crisis of 1994 without the benefit of a full set of Mexican financial statistics a few clicks away.
From my perspective, the evolution of the tools of journalism between then and now has been nothing less than breathtaking. 
Articles are more thorough -- informed by complementary data and analysis, enriched with links to things like interactive charts, videos and slide shows. They get to readers much more quickly. Most important, they reach many more of them.
For all its financial troubles, never has The New York Times been read by more people: 44 million unique viewers online in the United States every month. Yet if you were to rummage through American economic statistics you would find little evidence of journalism's technological leaps. Measured by its contribution to gross domestic product, the most prominent indicator of the nation's economic well-being, much of this new journalistic value enabled by information technology is not worth much.
This is true not only of journalism. The failure of I.T. to deliver measurable value has been a popular meme among economists for years. Back in 1987 Nobel laureate Robert Solow posed a now famous paradox: ''We can see the computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics.''
The meme is back. The burst of productivity during the dot-com revolution of the 1990s gave skeptics pause. But as productivity has slowed substantially in recent years, doubts have re-emerged about whether information technology can power economic growth like the steam engine and the internal combustion engine did in the past.
Last year, Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University proposed that the I.T. revolution has pretty much exhausted its promise. He asked, provocatively: ''Is U.S. economic growth over?'' And he forecast stagnating living standards for the vast majority of Americans for decades to come.
Government statistics lend support to his skepticism: Value added by the information technology and communications industries -- mostly hardware and software -- has remained stuck at around 4 percent of the nation's economic output for the last quarter century.
But these statistics do not tell the whole story. Because they miss much of what technology does for people's well-being.
News organizations that take advantage of computers to let go of journalists, secretaries and research assistants will show up in the economic statistics as more productive, making more with less. But statisticians have no way to value more thorough, useful, fact-dense articles.
What's more, gross domestic product only values the goods and services people pay for. It does not capture the value to consumers of economic improvements that are given away free. And until recently this is what news media organizations like The New York Times were doing online.
The Commerce Department is in the process of revising the way it measures G.D.P. to take better account of the contributions of investment in research and development and artistic creation. But even though the revisions to be announced this summer are expected to make the economy look bigger, they are not devised to capture the value that Americans get from digital technologies.
''G.D.P. is not a measure of how much value is produced for consumers,'' said Erik Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Everybody should recognize that G.D.P. is not a welfare metric.''
G.D.P. misses what Americans gain from sharing information on Facebook or finding information on Google or Wikipedia. It misses how dating sites reduce the cost and increase the odds of finding a mate. It misses the time saved by drivers who use Google Maps and the time gained by consumers from shopping online. Measured in money -- what it contributes to G.D.P. -- the recording industry is shrinking. Yet never before have Americans had access to so much music.
''Pretty much every human on earth can access all human knowledge,'' said Hal Varian, Google's chief economist. That may not be as impressive as civilization's 60-year technological jump from the horse-drawn buggy to the man on the moon. But it's probably useful, and it is mostly ignored by our measures of progress.
So how to measure the Internet's contribution to our lives? A few years ago, Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago and Peter J. Klenow of Stanford gave it a shot. They estimated that the value consumers gained from the Internet amounted to about 2 percent of their income -- an order of magnitude larger than what they spent to go online. Their trick was to measure not only how much money users spent on access but also how much of their leisure time they spent online.
The approach makes intuitive sense. Time is not only a valuable asset. Its relative value increases with economic development, as workers' incomes grow while their allotment of time remains stubbornly fixed.
It puts the Internet in a different light. Earlier this year, Yan Chen, Grace YoungJoo Jeon and Yong-Mi Kim of the University of Michigan published the result of an experiment that found that people who had access to a search engine took 15 minutes less to answer a question than those without online access.
Using the average wage of $22 an hour as the value of workers' time, and assuming that people who could answer more questions would ask more of them, Mr. Varian estimated that a search engine might be worth about $500 annually to the average worker. Across the working population, this would add up to $65 billion a year.
Last year, Mr. Brynjolfsson and an M.I.T. postgraduate, JooHee Oh, used a similar accounting technique to that of Mr. Goolsbee and Mr. Klenow and concluded that the consumer surplus from free online services -- the value derived by consumers from the experience above what they paid for it -- has been growing by $34 billion a year, on average, since 2002. If it were tacked on as ''economic output,'' it would add about 0.26 of a percentage point to annual G.D.P. growth.
Technoskeptics may scoff at these calculations. The Internet is hardly the first technology to offer consumers valuable free goods. The consumer surplus from television is about five times as large as that delivered by free stuff online, according to Mr. Brynjolfsson's calculations.
Gross domestic product has always failed to capture many things -- from the costs of pollution and traffic jams to the gains of unpaid household work. As the economist Paul Samuelson once pointed out, if a man married his maid, G.D.P. would decline.
Notably, it almost inevitably misses some economic gains from new technologies. The missed consumer surplus from the Internet may be no bigger than the unmeasured gains in the production, for example, of electric light.
But there is a case to be made that the unmeasured benefits from the Internet deserve more attention.
The amount of time Americans devote to the Internet has doubled in the last five years. Information, encoded in bits, is bound to become a larger and larger share of our economic output. Much of its value will be delivered to each additional consumer at a marginal cost of nearly zero.
''We know less about the sources of value in the economy than we did 25 years ago,'' wrote Mr. Brynjolfsson and Adam Saunders of the University of British Columbia. If we really want to understand the impact of information technology on our future well-being, we first need to find a consistent way to measure it.

HEADLINE: Plan to Do Work in Coach? You'd Better Not Count on It

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
WHEN you travel for business, do you have every intention of getting work done on the plane? If you're in business class, you could be good to go. If you're in coach, good luck with that.
Given the right conditions, an airplane can be an excellent place to work because it's a chance to get away from it all and focus, says Julie Morgenstern, a productivity consultant in New York and author of ''Organizing From the Inside Out.'' On a plane, too, ''you've got a built-in deadline, which is the landing time,'' she said, and that can help you pace your work. 
Ms. Morgenstern regularly helps executives manage their time. Here's something she has heard from them: ''Travel can get tedious on the body, and you miss your family, but it also can be the best place to get things done.''
However, working on a plane is ''a lot easier if you're in business class, there's no question about it,'' she said. She advises employers to invest in business-class seats for their workers and to talk to them in advance about the work they plan to do.
Joe Brancatelli, publisher of a Web site for business travelers called Joesentme.com and a frequent flier himself, is appalled at the number of business people who are expected to fly coach and still get work done. Coach seats will give you around 31 inches of legroom, and the seats are 17 to 18 inches wide, he said. Can you imagine sitting that close to your colleagues at work? Plus, the tray table is a flimsy piece of plastic that can barely hold a drink and you're ''putting a three- to seven-pound laptop on it,'' he said. In business class, by contrast, you and your things can spread out.
His advice is stark: if you have to fly coach, you shouldn't expect to get work done. That is based on his own experience and his conversations with thousands of business travelers, he said.
Ms. Morgenstern is less dogmatic. She thinks you can still get work done in coach, unless you're sitting in the middle seat. It's best to get an aisle seat for the extra room on the side, she said. If your employer or client is unwilling to shell out for business class, consider paying a little extra for the Economy Plus or similarly named seats that have more legroom, she said.
And here's something she's learned from experience: If you're flying coach, don't take a seat at the bulkhead, because that's where airlines tend to put parents with babies.
To be productive on a plane, you need to prepare on the ground, Ms. Morgenstern said. Limit yourself to two or three projects and determine in advance which devices, files and printouts you will need to tackle them. She also recommends buying plastic jacket sleeves in different colors and putting each project in a separate sleeve for the plane, so you aren't constantly rummaging for your work. Don't pick projects that are ''paper dense,'' she said, so that everything can fit in your carry-on.
She advises carrying a small pouch for work materials: for example, a flash drive, pens, pencils and reading glasses -- and whatever else you need to create an instant office in the air.
Noise-canceling headphones can be useful not only to muffle noise, she said, but also to signal to your seatmates: I'm here to work.
An airline flight can be an ideal time to tackle strategy work or aspects of your professional development, she said. ''When I'm on a plane, all of a sudden I can solve the big problems,'' she added. Removed from the distraction of external demands, you can use your plane time for introspection, she said.
Toward that end, Ms. Morgenstern has some advice that may surprise business travelers: Don't check your e-mail when you're on a plane. ''This is your quiet place. This is your study carrel. Don't bring that staccato stuff.''
With Wi-Fi becoming widely available on planes, however, many business travelers are expected to be available at all times, Mr. Brancatelli said. ''We've built a society that says you can never be out of touch. Business travelers were better off when the plane was a cocoon.''
''In the old days, pre-electronic device, you either relaxed on a plane, or it was your creative thinking time.''
Betsy Nicoletti, a health care consultant based in Springfield, Vt., who flies at least a few times a month, says there can be ideal conditions for working while flying, ''but I'm not often in those ideal conditions.'' Spreading out in business class is not a luxury she can generally afford, so she works as best she can when she flies coach. ''But if I don't have an aisle seat, I can almost give up,'' she said. And her heart sank recently when she found herself seated next to a ''Typhoid Mary,'' who coughed repeatedly with no attempt to cover her mouth.
At times, being a good worker means knowing when to quit, Ms. Nicoletti said. ''On a recent flight, I spent about an hour writing one paragraph, and it was a lousy paragraph,'' she said. ''So I watched a movie on my computer.''
She added: ''Sometimes the most productive thing I do on an airplane is nap.''

HEADLINE: A Field That Once Looked Bleak Attracts Young Careerists

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
THE allure of the travel industry as a career, recently seen as dated as a Pan Am stewardess pillbox, is surging as more people take jobs in a sector bolstered by renewed spending.
Hotels, restaurants and other travel-related businesses are adding more positions, attracting people like Matthew Bryant, a hospitality studies student at the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University.
''The hospitality industry is beginning to recover, and I decided to switch careers because I saw a professional future in it,'' said Mr. Bryant, 26, who worked for five years as a federal government consultant in Washington after college. ''I wanted to combine the skills I had learned as a consultant in a customer service industry, and this seemed a great fit.'' 
While job recovery nationally has been lagging, the travel industry has been faring much better. About 8 percent, or 7,000, of the total of 88,000 jobs added by employers in March were in the travel industry, according to the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group.
The growth is being spurred, in part, by a modest rise in business travel spending. As the economy improves, such spending is predicted to climb 5.1 percent this year, to $268.5 billion, according to the Global Business Travel Association, a trade group. Its forecast, released in April, is up substantially from the 1.8 percent rise in industry spending in 2012, and higher than the group's previous prediction for growth of 4.6 percent.
''Companies feel the need to compete, and the global economy is driving companies to invest in business travel,'' said Michael W. McCormick, the association's executive director.
Shored up by strong corporate profits, companies are sending more employees to conventions, meetings and industry events -- gatherings that were more strictly circumscribed when the economy sank.
''Events are being planned farther in advance,'' said Eric Eden, vice president for marketing at Cvent, a meeting and event management technology company. ''And there are more national meetings instead of small, regional ones, and higher numbers of people attending each event.''
As a result, hotels are seeing more bookings for meetings, and rates are increasing, he said. Spending on group events, Mr. Eden added, is expected to increase 6 percent this year, to almost $116 billion, compared with an earlier prediction of 5.2 percent growth in 2013.
And hotel occupancy rates are moving up steadily, said Jan Freitag, senior vice president for global development at Smith Travel Research, which tracks the hotel industry.
''Occupancy rates, which are a bellwether for business travel, rose over the last three years to 64.3 percent,'' he said.
Over all, about 7.7 million people worked in the travel sector, according to figures for the last three months of 2012 provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of the Commerce Department. Although spending declined in air and other transportation, outlays rose for traveler accommodation and for food services and drinking places, by 9.4 percent and 8.6 percent respectively, according to the federal figures released in March.
The data covers a range of jobs, from the minimum-wage, no-benefit slots to well-paid hotel analyst positions, but some 53 percent of travel industry workers are paid $25,000 to $69,000, according to a U.S. Travel Association analysis of the federal jobs data done in conjunction with Oxford Economics, an economics forecasting firm.
According to the analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the travel industry is one of the top 10 largest employers of middle-class wage earners, with a maximum average salary of $81,900. Two of every five workers who start their careers in the travel industry go on to earn more than $100,000 a year, according to the association analysis.
Those prospects persuaded Mr. Bryant to enroll in hospitality studies. After graduating with a political science degree in 2008 from American University, Mr. Bryant landed a job at a management consulting firm. But after five years, he said, ''I wanted a change and be involved in a customer service industry.''
He enrolled last fall in the Tisch program, part of the 75 percent increase in undergraduate and graduate students there since 2010. When he graduates in spring 2014, he hopes that the experience he has gained from internships in real estate investment and other areas will land him a management-level job.
The university does not provide separate figures for hospitality, tourism and sports management enrollment or specifics on employment, but it says that more than 90 percent of its 2012 graduates are working in industry operations, development, branding or finance.
Although few graduates lack jobs, Bjorn Hanson of the Tisch Center noted that the travel sector recovery could be somewhat lower than forecast.
''If the 1.1 percent decrease in the number of business trips forecast by the association is realized, I think a 5 percent spending increase is on the high side,'' he said, referring to the Global Business Travel Association's 2013 forecast. ''On that basis I estimate spending would increase maybe 3 percent.''
Business trips, in fact, are expected to dip 1.1 percent, to 431.7 million trips, according to the Global Business Travel Association's 2013 forecast, although the cost per trip is rising, and that generates higher travel industry spending figures.
The overall industry outlook encouraged Nicholas Hosseini, 21, a junior from Jacksonville, Fla., to switch recently from a major in economics at Cornell to its school of hotel administration.
According to Cornell, 94 percent of the hotel administration school's 2012 graduates have full-time jobs (1 percent went to graduate school), up from 88 percent in 2011 .
''It's rare around here to find someone who does not have a job,'' said Mr. Hosseini. ''This summer I will be working at a hotel investors group in San Francisco, a job I found through our alumni network, and that's practical experience I plan to use to go into the hotel field.
''The hardest part,'' he said, ''was convincing my parents that hospitality did not mean I would be working at a front desk.''

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
FROM Asia to Africa to the Middle East and the Americas, the business of business travel is booming in emerging countries. And it shows.
Dubai, an emirate with global ambitions to diversify, expanded its airport recently with a new terminal paved with white marble, devoted to its growing fleet of Airbus A380s double-deckers. Similarly, Beijing greets foreign travelers with a gleaming and spacious new international terminal.
Istanbul, ancient capital of empires, is successfully refashioning itself as a modern transportation hub with better connections to Asia than rivals in the United States or Europe. And Brazil, a rising oil power, is pouring billions into infrastructure as it prepares to host the soccer World Cup next year and the Olympic Games in 2016.
Business travelers are expected to spend about $1.16 trillion on airfare, accommodations and other travel this year, according to the Global Business Travel Association, up from $1.07 trillion last year. Much of that growth is coming from developing nations, prompting a boom in new construction in emerging markets while business travel in the United States recovers at a slow pace and Europe, mired in the euro crisis, remains stagnant. 
''What we've seen in terms of infrastructure in recent years recalls the old baseball adage -- if you build it, they will come,'' said Tony Davis, a partner at Irelandia Aviation, an investor in low-cost airlines like VivaAerobus in Mexico and Tiger Airways in Singapore.
The growth in passenger travel tells the story. Global traffic rose 4 percent last year, according to the Airports Council International, a trade group that represents more than 1,700 airports in 170 countries. In North America and Europe, airports had only modest gains. But air transportation in emerging economies has been buoyant -- a testament to their dynamism and growth prospects in time of low interest rates, and their opportunities in raw materials, commodities and trade.
Traffic last year grew by 7.5 percent in Asia, 7.3 percent in Latin America, 6.4 percent in Africa and 13 percent in the Middle East, according to the airport trade group, outpacing Western airports by a wide margin. Five airports in emerging markets, each with more than 40 million annual passengers, reported double-digit growth -- Istanbul, Dubai, Jakarta, Bangkok and Singapore -- according to a report released last month by the airport group.
Atlanta, currently home to the world's busiest airport, grew 3.3 percent. Chicago O'Hare International Airport, the second-busiest in the United States, actually shrank slightly, according to the report.
Nowhere has the growth in business travel been more robust and prolonged than in China. Passengers at Beijing Capital International Airport tripled in the last decade, and most travel experts expect that it will jump ahead of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport as the world's top airport by passenger traffic next year.
China's business travel spending has grown an average of 15.5 percent each year from 2000 to 2013 and is set to reach $226 billion this year, according to the Global Business Travel Association. Remarkably, that figure is growing even as China's export-led economy begins to slow and make the transition to a consumer-oriented one.
Chinese business travel is forecast to increase nearly 17 percent next year, and China is set to overtake the United States as the world's top business travel market by then.
Shanghai built a new terminal at the Hongqiao International Airport as part of a $9 billion investment program that also included a transportation hub linking the airport to city buses, subways and a new high-speed rail network. The airport, which opened three years ago and can handle 300,000 flights a year, has high-end shops like Armani and chains like Starbucks.
To cater to China's rising middle class and fulfill the leadership's desire to reduce the economy's reliance on exports, businesses will need a better travel infrastructure across the vast Chinese interior. To that end, the Chinese government has outlined plans to build another 100 airports throughout the country over the next couple of years.
''You really have a changing landscape throughout the developing economies,'' said Michael W. McCormick, the executive director of the Global Business Traveler Association, a group whose members include corporate travel managers. ''The infrastructure is clearly racing to catch up with demand.''
Of course, travel off the beaten path holds its share of perils and inconveniences. Hotel infrastructure is often inadequate. Roads can be hazardous. Sometimes vaccines and antimalarial medication may be necessary.
Climate is another challenge. Summer temperatures in Qatar, which won its bid to host the 2022 Soccer World Cup, exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit on average from May through September and can reach highs of 120 degrees. (Rest assured, there are plans for high-end cooling technology at match venues or, alternatively, to hold the tournament in the winter.)
There are other hazards presented by a rise in global travel, notably a greater risk of rapid disease transmission and pandemics. The latest threat emerged in China, where a previously unknown influenza virus infected dozens and killed at least 17 people recently. Another virus, similar to the one that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, was also recently identified in the Middle East.
Security issues are another consideration. In some places, the risk of kidnapping cannot be ruled out. Business travel suffered throughout the Middle East in recent years during the Arab uprisings, though they have also created new opportunities in the region. The Libyan economy had one of the world's fastest growth rates last year, according to the International Monetary Fund, reflecting a strong recovery after its collapse during the uprising that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
While air travel is going through its safest period in its history -- the United States recently had an exceptional four-year stretch without a fatal crash -- flying in some parts of the world remains perilous. With just 3 percent of global traffic, airlines in Africa accounted for 17 percent of airline crashes last year, according to the International Air Transport Association, a group that represents most of the world's airlines.
Africa has the worst record. Airlines, globally, averaged one accident for every five million flights last year. Africa lost one commercial plane every 270,000 flights. That figure has actually improved in recent years. In 2009, the rate was one accident for every 100,000 flights.
That poor safety record is hurting the region's economic potential, according to Tony Tyler, I.A.T.A.'s director general. Of the 12 airlines in Central West Africa, for instance, only three have committed themselves to international safety standards -- Cabo Verde Airlines, Air Burkina and Trans Air Cargo.
''With a few kilometers of tarmac, the most remote region can be connected to the global community,'' Mr. Tyler said in a speech in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, last month. ''And that could mean access to vital sources of health care and emergency assistance; jobs selling products in global markets or welcoming tourists; or opportunities for education, exploring the world or creating business.''
But, he said, ''the biggest challenge for air transport in Africa is safety.''
Obviously Africa is not the only place with safety concerns. In April, a new Boeing 737 operated by Lion Air crashed into the sea as it tried to land at the Bali airport in Indonesia, though all the passengers survived.
Differences across countries and regions make it impossible to draw broad conclusions for business travelers, said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst at Hudson Crossing, a consulting firm in San Francisco. In many cases, the situation will vary greatly by country or by city. ''It is very inconsistent,'' he said.
The growth in emerging-market passenger demand has attracted the attention of big hotel chains, who are making large strategic bets throughout Asia, Latin America and the Middle East to cater to foreign business travelers and a growing number of domestic travelers.
Starwood Hotels, which owns the Sheraton and W Hotels chains, plans 100 new hotels in China over the next few years, many designed for the Chinese domestic audience and local tastes.
Last year, Marriott outlined a $2 billion, three-year plan to open new hotels around the world with an emphasis on emerging nations. A third of those will be in Asia. It plans to more than double its 54 hotels in China, with midprice hotels aimed at China's middle class along with luxury five-star hotels.
As they cope with all this growth, global hotel chains are also bringing more consistent travel standards to emerging markets, said Christie Hicks, who runs Starwood's sales operations and its business-to-business relations. Business travelers increasingly expect to find the same sort of amenities anywhere they travel, including high-speed Internet connections and Wi-Fi, fitness centers and healthy food options.
''They want a brand they recognize,'' Ms. Hicks said. ''They want all the things they need to feel at home when they are abroad.''
Yet travel experts still warn of room shortages and high hotel rates as the supply of accommodations fails to keep up with rising demand.
Largely because of a persistent shortage of hotel rooms, Moscow was the most expensive city for business travelers for the ninth consecutive year in 2012, according to the Hogg Robinson Group, a corporate services company based in Britain. Lagos, Nigeria, came second, despite a rise in new hotel construction for big-name brands like Sheraton, Ibis, Radisson Blu and InterContinental. Reflecting the room shortage, the Radisson Hotel in the city's Victoria Island neighborhood advertises a standard room at about $410 a night.
In Latin America too, room rates have soared as capacity has failed to keep up with demand. Business travel spending in Brazil has tripled since 2000 and is expected to reach $34.5 billion this year, according to the Global Business Travel Association. At that pace, the country is set to overtake France, Britain and Italy in travel spending in the next two years.
But even though Brazil is pumping billions of dollars into airports as it prepares for the World Cup and Olympics, work on hotels is still lagging, travel experts said. The last luxury chain to open a hotel in São Paulo did so 10 years ago, according to Hogg Robinson. Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo registered the biggest room rate increases, rising as much as 19 percent last year.
''The development is challenging in Brazil,'' Ms. Hicks said. ''There are not enough hotel rooms for either the Olympics or the World Cup. Everybody could use a lot more hotels in Brazil. Like anything -- it does not happen fast enough.''
The airlines, at least, hope they are moving fast enough. They plan more flights with more direct routes from the United States, and they are investing in more comfortable seats on their international flights along with tastier meals for business passengers.
United Airlines has unveiled a new service between Houston to Lagos, as well as between Washington and Guatemala City this year. Delta Air Lines will start daily nonstop flights between Seattle and Shanghai in June. Its partner in Europe, Air France, just introduced a new service between Paris and Kuala Lumpur. And Lufthansa will soon fly Airbus A380s between Frankfurt and Shanghai five times a week.
American Airlines is starting a new route this summer between Miami and Manaus, Brazil. It is also increasing the number of weekly flights between Dallas-Fort Worth and São Paulo, as well as increasing frequency of service to Brasilia and Belo Horizonte. The airline bought new Boeing 777s, which can fly long-range routes, and outfitted them with its newest lie-flat seats. Those planes, which will become the flagship of its fleet, will serve both London and São Paulo from New York.
Airlines are also expanding their international alliances to offer travelers seamless connections and more destinations than they could on their own.
Star Alliance, the largest of the three major global alliances, added Shenzhen Airlines, Avianca of Columbia and Eva Air of Taiwan. Separately, China's Xiamen Airlines, Aerolinas Argentinas, Saudi Airlines and Lebanon's Middle East Airlines all joined SkyTeam last year.
After months of speculation, Latam Airlines, which is the result of the merger between Lan Airlines of Chile and Tam Airlines of Brazil, said it would join the Oneworld alliance. The decision means that Tam will withdraw from the Star Alliance next year.
The megacarriers from the Persian Gulf, long reluctant to join in the alliance game, have also entered the fray lately. Qatar Airlines joined Oneworld last year. Etihad Airways has taken equity stakes in several airlines, including Air Berlin, Air Seychelles and Virgin Australia.
Even Emirates, which is based in Dubai and is the largest and most successful of the three gulf carriers, has entered into a partnership with Qantas Airlines, the Australian carrier.
The airports of Doha, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai, where the three carriers are based, now serve about 15 percent of all passenger traffic going from Asia to Europe, and from Europe to the South West Pacific region, including Australia, according to Amadeus, an air travel technology developer.
And while Paris, Frankfurt or London find it difficult to expand their airports to accommodate higher traffic, and often run at full capacity, Dubai has outlined plans for an entirely new airport to eventually replace the current one.
All this activity augurs well for business travelers. A recent survey of global routes by Amadeus found that the global industry had become more competitive over the last three years, with a higher percentage of air routes served by three or more airlines. The survey said the Asian market had the most competition among airlines, with 75 percent of air passenger volume served by three or more airlines.
''I am absolutely sure the future growth of our business is in Asia,'' said Dr. Jurgen Weber, the chairman of Lufthansa. ''Living standards are going up and it turns out that the Chinese like to travel even more than the Japanese do.''
And finally there is India, one of the world's most populous nations with a vibrant economy, but a country that is still hobbled by poor investments and a cumbersome bureaucracy.
Ian Carter, the president for international development at Hilton, said that in most regions of the world, good infrastructure -- airports, roads and highways -- generally comes before the hotels.
''It is rarely the other way round, the exception being India,' he said. ''Generally speaking there are beautiful hotels there but getting there is like navigating an obstacle course.''

HEADLINE: Health Coverage Worthy of a Senator

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: A provision forcing members of Congress to get their health insurance under the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act may prompt them to make such coverage too attractive, and ultimately weaken the system, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
To promote economic efficiency and the goal of universal health coverage, perhaps members of Congress should not be required to enroll in the new insurance exchanges.
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 seeks to invigorate the nongroup health insurance market - that is, health insurance that people can buy without going through an employer - by creating and subsidizing insurance exchanges similar to the one created by Massachusetts in 2007. In addition, the law seeks to make health insurance affordable for middle-class families by having the federal government pay part of premiums and out-of-pocket costs, but only for people buying nongroup health insurance through the new exchanges. 
A provision of the law known as the Grassley amendment requires members of Congress and their staffs to obtain their own health insurance through the exchanges. The amendment gives the authors of the law, and the authors of future tweaks of the law, a personal stake in the success of the plans to be provided through the new exchanges.
Because members of Congress are accustomed to high-quality medical care provided to them through federal employee benefit programs, one might expect that they would push for top quality care to be delivered through the exchanges too. That is one reason why an (ultimately unfounded) report that the Grassley amendment might be reversed prompted so much outrage. (What's actually at issue is uncertainty over whether the employer contributions in the current health plan for those on Capitol Hill can be applied to coverage through the exchanges.) 
But the possibility that middle-class families could obtain care that is both top quality - good enough for your senator - and subsidized creates a number of economic problems. It gives employers a stronger incentive to drop their coverage, because employers and their employees can take comfort in the prospect that the alternative to employer insurance is a health plan that is good enough for your senator.
If the exchange plans were good enough, people who are rushing to find a job, and people considering leaving their job, would no longer have to see employment as their only means of obtaining top quality, subsidized coverage. As a result, some of those would work less (see the Congressional Budget Office on some of health reform's work incentives, and a 1994 explanation from Alan Krueger and Uwe E. Reinhardt).
The more attractive the subsidized plans are, the more people will join them, and the greater the costs to the federal government. If the Affordable Care Act proves to be too expensive, drastic steps may result, such as closing enrollment in the subsidized exchange plans or repeal of the law all together. Either result would mean that the law's objectives would go unmet.
There is an alternative approach, pursued in Massachusetts, for those not covered through an employer, a spouse's employer, or Medicaid or Medicare. They may be eligible to join one of several subsidized plans under the state's Commonwealth Care program (most are operated by the Medicaid managed care organizations), but those are less desirable than the plans typically offered by employers. With that as the alternative for their middle-class employees, employers would be discouraged from dropping coverage. People would have an incentive to work, because that's where the best plans would be available.
Massachusetts did not have anything like the Grassley amendment.
For these reasons, economists have long recommended that subsidized goods be of somewhat lower quality than goods available without subsidy. Massachusetts followed that advice, and found that (a) their health reform approach significantly reduced the number of uninsured and that (b) less than 10 percent of the people in Massachusetts whose family income fell in the subsidy-eligible range chose to participate in the subsidized plans.
Although politically incorrect and perhaps unfair, allowing members of Congress to keep their federal employee coverage might be the best thing for universal coverage and reducing the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the federal budget.

HEADLINE: Yoga Instructors, Tile Layers, Others Get New Outlet for Web Lessons

BYLINE: NICK WINGFIELD


HIGHLIGHT: The founder of a new start-up, Curious, that begins on Wednesday believes he has created a better way for the little guys on YouTube and other video sites to teach others. 

 BODY:
Online education is a sprawling category that encompasses everything from open online courses on physics, history and other college subjects to intensive, multiday workshops on photography on sites like CreativeLive. 
Then there's the wild teaching scene on sites like YouTube, where it sometimes is difficult to find a life skill for which there is not a short how-to video made by somebody, somewhere. I realized this once when, flushed with frustration, I searched for a video on YouTube on how to convert an uncooperative Transformer action figure into vehicle mode. A capable young instructor made me, and my child, very happy that day.
A new start-up, Curious, believes it has created a better way for the little guys on YouTube and other video sites to teach. While YouTube is for video of all stripes, Curious, founded by a former Intuit executive, Justin Kitch, gives people a set of Web tools specially tailored for developing video lessons and making money from them.
Let's say you have a killer technique for building a dresser. The site, which opens to the public on Wednesday, lets you divide your lesson into chapters, with quizzes that students have to take before advancing to the next stage. Curious gives you a way to suggest a set of tools that might be handy for making the dresser, like a dovetail jig and router, along with a method for embedding links where people can buy the tools on the Web.
The first couple of chapters of each lesson are free for viewers, but they have to formally enroll in the course, paying a small fee if the teacher has decided to charge for the lesson. Curious will allow teachers to charge between $1 and $5 a lesson. During a private testing phase for the site, Mr. Kitch said music, fitness and foreign language lessons have shown signs of generating the most viewer interest.
Mr. Kitch believes the enrollment requirement will help elevate the quality of comments that form around lessons on Curious by weeding out the troublemakers who often leave inflammatory comments on YouTube videos. "It's not that you can't accomplish some of this on YouTube, but trying to get interaction on YouTube is a bear," Mr. Kitch said. "Comments are so horrific and gross. YouTube wasn't made for teaching. It was just for showing random videos."
Curious has raised $7.5 million from Redpoint Ventures and individual investors like Bill Campbell, the chairman of Intuit and a veteran adviser to Silicon Valley leaders.
In a phone interview, Mr. Campbell said that it would take Curious a while before it had a large library of high-quality lessons, but that he expected it would attract good teachers with its tools for organizing lessons. "I don't think this is like Khan Academy," he said. "I view these as upbeat fun things to do in your spare time."
When asked what lessons he has taken on the site, Mr. Campbell said he enjoyed one on beer making. "I thought the salsa dancing one was really funny," he said. "When am I going to do that?"

HEADLINE: Apple's Debt Market Foray

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Apple issued $17 billion of bonds, a record amount. | Wall Street and foreign finance ministers are fighting a proposal to require overseas offices of American-based financial firms to turn over information on certain foreign trades. | Venture capital investments can be brutal for founders and employees. | Yahoo&#8217;s deal for Dailymotion has fallen through after opposition from France. 

 BODY:
It might not seem that Apple, with a $145 billion cash hoard, would need to raise money. But on Tuesday, the company issued $17 billion of bonds, a record amount, paying interest rates that hovered near those on the low-cost debt of the United States Treasury.
The logic behind Apple's move has to do with the frenzied state of the bond market, which is allowing companies to issue lots of debt at historically low interest rates. But the maneuver "also reflects the unusual challenges of a fabulously successful company with a sinking stock price," DealBook's Peter Lattman and Peter Eavis write. After its shares plummeted from a high last fall of more than $700 to under $400 last month, Apple is borrowing money to help finance a $100 billion payout to shareholders, which it plans to distribute by the end of 2015 in the form of increased dividends and stock buybacks. In addition, "taking on debt can actually magnify the returns for shareholders and improve stock performance, financial specialists say."
Apple is also avoiding a potential big tax hit. "About two-thirds of Apple's cash - about $102 billion - sits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions. If it returned some of that cash to the United States to reward its investors, it could have significant tax consequences for the company." 
The company issued six different securities on Tuesday, ranging from a three-year note yielding 0.45 percent to a 30-year bond that yields 3.85 percent. The largest piece, worth $5.5 billion, is a 10-year yielding 2.4 percent.
BANKS RESIST RULES ON FOREIGN BETS | Nearly three years after Congress passed the Dodd-Frank law, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is facing bitter opposition to a proposal, set to go into effect as early as July, to require overseas offices of American-based banks and other institutions to turn over information on foreign trades that involve United States customers or are guaranteed by a financial institution with American ties. In the eyes of banks, these requirements seem redundant and excessive, The New York Times's Eric Lipton writes.
But Gary Gensler, leader of the commission, argues that too many bad derivatives bets can be traced to overseas locations, including the big trading loss by JPMorgan Chase last year. "It would be letting down the American public if we said, we are just about to complete the task but now, let's retreat," Mr. Gensler said in an interview. "If we don't do this right, we will blow a hole in the bottom of the boat of reform." Some of the biggest objections have come from foreign regulators, including officials from Britain, Russia, Japan and Germany, The Times writes.
VENTURE CAPITAL'S DIRTY SECRET | Every entrepreneur dreams of riches. But that dream "can be dashed as the venture capitalists make millions in a sale, leaving the founders with nothing," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "A recent Delaware court case arising from the 2011 sale of Bloodhound Technologies illustrates how this happens." Mr. Davidoff writes: "Venture capital investments are structured to ensure that the venture capitalists are paid before founders and employees," a requirement that "can sometimes hit founders and employees in a brutal manner."
ON THE AGENDA | Knight Capital, Time Warner and Chesapeake Energy report earnings before the market opens. Facebook and Yelp report results on Wednesday evening. The Federal Reserve releases a decision on interest rates at 2 p.m. The American insurance unit of the Dutch financial services company ING plans to price its initial public offering. Joseph Dear, chief investment officer for Calpers, is on Bloomberg TV at 11:30 a.m.
YAHOO'S DAILYMOTION DEAL FALLS THROUGH | It was supposed to be the first big acquisition for Yahoo under its chief executive, Marissa Mayer. But the deal to buy a majority stake in Dailymotion, a French video Web site, ran into trouble after a Yahoo executive met with Arnaud Montebourg, the French industry minister, who said he didn't like the idea, The Wall Street Journal reports. "I won't let you sell one of France's best start-ups," Mr. Montebourg said, according to the newspaper, which cites people briefed on the meeting. "You don't know what you're doing." Since then, attempts to revive the sale have failed, the newspaper says.

HEADLINE: Baltic Brouhaha

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: What does the experience really show? 

 BODY:
Martin Wolf has a very good piece on the attempts to put the Baltic states, Latvia especially, on a pedestal and claim that they prove that austerity works. Mainly he makes points I have made previously: first, that output is still well below the previous peak, and unemployment still very high despite drastic out-migration: 
Wolf adds that in some ways the Baltic adjustment was also made easier by the fact that these are very open economies playing catchup to the West, so that fast export growth was relatively easy to achieve.
There is, however, an additional point I'd like to raise.
People praising the Baltics tend to brush off the observation of still-high unemployment and output still well below pre-crisis peaks by claiming that the high output and employment of 2006-7 were a bubble and we shouldn't expect them to come back. I don't think they realize just how problematic an argument this is.
First of all, the idea that real GDP and employment can be hugely inflated above sustainable levels by a bubble is questionable. We know that economies can operate far below capacity; operating far above capacity is a tougher proposition to defend. In fact, it's normal to assess trends in capacity by "peak to peak" interpolation, assuming that the peaks are much more similar than the troughs, that "overfull" employment, while it can happen, can't be all that large.
Relatedly, think about what this kind of apology would imply for the United States in the 1930s. Here's real GDP for America from 1924 to 1936:
The US economy plunged from 1929 to 1933, but grew very fast from 1933 to 1936. By 1935 it was already producing more than in 1924; by 1936 it was above its 1929 level. So, was the Great Depression over, and was America a great success story? Few would make that claim; surely we were still far short of where we should have been.
But there's an even bigger logical hole in the Baltic story as it's told. The claim is that Latvia shows that austerity works as a response to a deeply depressed economy. But then when you point out that recovery has still left output and employment well below their pre-crisis levels, you're told that those levels weren't sustainable anyway. Do you see the problem? The apologists, by claiming that the pre-crisis peak isn't a realistic goal, are also claiming that Latvia has never been that deeply depressed an economy in the first place. 
I think they're wrong about that. But they can't have it both ways, claiming that austerity is just what troubled economies need and then excusing the limits of Latvia's performance by saying that the previous boom was an illusion.

HEADLINE: Young Movers, With a Passion for Change

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Contestants for the Peace First Prize, some as young as 8 years old, have devised innovative ways to fight problems like bullying and poverty in their communities. 

 BODY:
I intended to write this column next October, but why wait? As President Obama observed last week, we've been through a tough time. And as the Boston Marathon bombing continues to be headline news - and gut-wrenching images continue to circulate - we need to keep in mind what behavioral scientists call the "availability heuristic" - our tendency to mistakenly estimate the probability of events based on how readily examples come to mind. A story that leaves a painful and vivid impression like this one can distort our sense of reality for a long time.
Which is why I'm reporting today on the polar opposite of terrorism: the inaugural Peace First Prize - a new award, introduced by a Boston-based organization, to recognize young people the group identifies as "peacemakers": people in the United States from the ages of 8 to 22 who engage in courageous, compassionate and collaborative actions to make their communities stronger, safer and better over the long term. 
The announcement of the winners, who will each be awarded $50,000, won't happen until the fall. But the application round has recently closed and I had a chance to speak with some of the entrants - there were 658 from 47 states and the District of Columbia - and they offer a glimpse into a hidden side of reality, one that may help us to anticipate the future. While the peacemakers are not typically news headliners, there are a lot more of them than there are terrorists.

These young peacemakers challenge the standard notions many adults have about people their age. "We tend to look at young people in one of two ways: they're either victims or potential victims we need to protect, or they're perpetrators we need to punish. That's our narrative. That's our public policy," said Eric Dawson, Peace First's founder. "The idea behind the Peace First Prize is to offer a different narrative. That young people are peacemakers - powerful change makers."
Consider Emily-Anne Rigal, from Virginia, who, at 16, turned her talents for videography and social media into a lively online platform, WeStopHate, that is attacking bullying at its roots, providing a space where hundreds of thousands of teenagers exchange views and insights about self-image. 
Or check out the work of 11-year-old Gerry Orz, from Los Angeles, whose organization, Kids Resource, teaches young people how to prevent or respond to bullying. Gerry and his friends have made two short films that dramatize bullying: Day of Silence and Born to Bully; they've put together a public service announcement, and they are busy at work on other films. "I have gay parents and I am Jewish so people had two things to bully me about," Gerry said. "I didn't want to see any other child go through this."
Many of these young people are drawing upon their own painful experiences. Amit Dodani, 15, from California, struggled with a speech impediment for many years. So he established My Name, My Story, offering a space for young people to exchange stories and start clubs that aim to build empathy.
Christopher Carswell, 14, from Georgia, has endured serious health problems and seizures for much of his life. After receiving life-changing assistance from a service dog, he decided to create 1Boy4Change, an organization that provides service dogs and iPads to disabled children and veterans. Caitlin Chapski, 18, from New Jersey, was distressed to see friends and family members struggling with depression. For her Girl Scout Gold Award project, she brought youngsters together to express themselves through art in public places.
Fifteen-year-old Sarah Cronk, from Iowa, was a high school cheerleader. Her older brother, Charlie, was on the autism spectrum. After an older student encouraged Charlie to join the swim team, Sarah saw that it "turned his life around." She wondered if she could open up cheerleading to students with disabilities?
When she approached school administrators, they were "incredibly skeptical," she recalled. But she managed to persuade them to let her try it out. She found students who were excited by the idea; they practiced for a month and a half, and then, one Friday night, under the bright lights in front of thousands, they walked onto the football field arm in arm. "The crowd rose to their feet and started chanting in unison," Sarah recalled. "I've never seen bigger smiles."
Since then the Sparkle Effect has spread to 90 schools and Sarah has won a prestigious Do Something Award. Students with a wide range of physical and developmental disabilities, from different age groups, are involved. "Our youngest participant was in second grade," said Sarah. "She's never going to know what it feels like to be excluded."
Young peacemakers are deepening our appreciation of the environment. At age 9, Avalon Theisen founded Conserve It Forward, and for the past three years she has been teaching others about habitat loss and conservation through class presentations, interactive booths at parks, zoos and community gatherings, and other outreach efforts. (Avalon is particularly compelling when she talks about frogs, and the importance of saving them.)
A sense of economic justice also runs deep. When Nicholas Lowinger, from Rhode Island, was 5 years old, his mother took him to a homeless shelter. He was shocked to see kids who didn't have sneakers. When he was 12, he started the Gotta Have Sole Foundation to provide new shoes to children in shelters. "A lot of the kids are being ridiculed or bullied because they have used shoes or holes in their shoes," he said. To date, Nicholas's foundation has assisted 8,000 kids. "A lot of people in the United States think they have to go to a third world country to find poverty," he added.
Yasmine Arrington, 20, isn't one of them. A sophomore at Elon University, in North Carolina, Yasmine never got to know her father because he was in and out of prison throughout her childhood. When she was in high school, she took part in a program called LearnServe International, which encouraged her to address a social problem in her community. She created ScholarCHIPS, a scholarship program for children with incarcerated parents. "I understand the financial and emotional struggles that come with having a parent in prison and being stigmatized," she said. ScholarCHIPS is now supporting its first four students. Yasmine hopes to support hundreds more over the next five years. "The average age of a child of an incarcerated adult is 8 years old," she said. "There are a lot of children growing up feeling like they're not good enough for college. We need to give them opportunities."
Karim Abouelnaga, 21, a senior at Cornell University, agrees. Karim is the son of Egyptian immigrants and next month he will be the first person in his family to graduate from college. He attributes his success to a mentoring program. That's why he started Practice Makes Perfect, a summer program that pairs academically struggling middle school students with high-achieving high school students from the same low income neighborhoods. Last summer, Practice Makes Perfect served 100 students in high poverty areas of New York, demonstrating impressive results. Karim's goal is to raise $100,000 to serve 500 students this summer. "I think this is an opportunity to replace summer school for middle school nationwide," he says.
Some of the children focus in on needs that adults overlook. Jessica Carscadden, 10, from California, was adopted at the age of 5 from an orphanage in China. She had been abandoned by her birth parents because she was born with a cleft lip and palate. Two years ago, Jessica was thinking about how frightening it is for children when they are involved in fires or car accidents and she got the idea to donate her stuffed animals to the local fire department. "It just kind of came to me," she said. "I got really sad for those kids and I thought a cuddly bear could help them."
Since then the We Care Bears Project has collected hundreds of bags of bears, which now sit in every emergency response vehicle in San Diego, as well as in hundreds of others across Southern California and Nevada, plus the Ronald McDonald Houses of San Diego and Las Vegas. For this October, Jessica is organizing a drive at her school, hoping to collect 500 more bags of bears. "They have to be clean," she insisted. Her dream is to take the project to New York City, where she has heard about the bravery of the firefighters.
The peacemakers I spoke to had plenty to say about what they'd learned. They spoke of skills they'd acquired: how to work in a team, how to spread an idea, how to fund-raise, how to talk with the media, how to fill out legal forms, how to present themselves so people will take them seriously.
Given this extraordinary education, it makes you wonder if our schools should focus far more on peacemaking than test taking.
"We don't call our young people to big things," says Eric Dawson, whose organization has been training educators to teach peacemaking skills for two decades. "We spend our time telling them not to use drugs, not to smoke, not to be a bully. All good messages, but at the end of the day what are we advising young people to do?"
Dawson suggests three things adults can do:
1. Ask young people questions of engagement. What do you think about that? What would you do? How do you think we could make this better?
2. Take young people's ideas seriously.
3. Give young people concrete opportunities to act on their ideas.
"The idea is to invite them to try on this role," he adds. "And to show that peacemaking isn't holding hands and singing songs, nor is it the huge examples of Dr. King and Gandhi and Mother Teresa. It's having courage and compassion, taking risks, showing perseverance, crossing lines of difference, mobilizing and working with others."
I'll follow up in October, when the winners are announced. And if you know of any young peacemakers in your community, please write in and share their stories.

HEADLINE: 'Big, Hot, Cheap and Right': Erica Grieder Talks About Texas

BYLINE: JOHN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Ms. Grieder&#8217;s new book analyzes the Lone Star state&#8217;s past, present and future. 

 BODY:
In her new book, "Big, Hot, Cheap and Right: What America Can Learn From the Strange Genius of Texas," Erica Grieder, an editor at Texas Monthly magazine, writes about the forces that shaped the state's attitudes as well as its current economic growth in the face of widespread troubles in the rest of the country. In a recent e-mail interview, Ms. Grieder discussed the state's economic "miracle," whether the future there bodes well for Democrats and more. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation:
 Q. 
Did you grow up in Texas? What's the biggest change there that you've felt as a day-to-day resident (as opposed to a journalist) over the years? 
 A. 
I was a military brat, so I grew up all over, but San Antonio, where we lived when I was a child, and where my family has since settled, is home. The growth in every major city, including San Antonio and Austin, has been the biggest day-to-day change. Most of it has been to the good, but there have been some costs, such as the 2008 closure of Las Manitas, a Tex-Mex diner in Austin. I haven't even eaten a refried bean in the past five years. There's no point anymore.
 Q. 
Could you briefly summarize the facts of the "Texas miracle," which is a big part of the book? And do you think the word "miracle" is appropriate?
 A. 
Over the past 10 or so years, Texas' economy has been outperforming those of most states, and the country as a whole, to such a noticeable degree that people have started talking about it in terms our more devout friends reserve for things like transubstantiation. So I can see how calling it a "miracle" might be contentious, but I'm comfortable with the phrase because Texans use strong language.
 Q. 
Given that the state's economy has become increasingly diversified - beyond oil - how has that "miracle" continued in spite of the national economy's struggles? 
 A. 
I think the lesson Texans took from the 1980s oil bust is that being counter-cyclical is only good when the cycle isn't counter to you. That bust spurred the state's interest in diversification, which has been significant, and it meant that losses in one sector were often offset in another. (For the benefit of the state's critics, let me note that parts of Texas that are less diversified haven't been so well hedged; in much of the Rio Grande Valley, for example, unemployment is once again in the double digits, largely because the global market malaise has triggered layoffs in manufacturing.)
Then, too, you had all the things that we generally summarize as a pro-business climate, and a couple of helpful idiosyncrasies. We have pretty strong lending laws, so we weren't very heavy on subprime mortgages. Oil prices were high, and although the vast majority of Texas' jobs aren't in oil - the energy industry is capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive - it's still a significant component of state G.D.P. The result was that although we didn't get through without a scratch, the wheels never fell off the wagon altogether.
 Q. 
You write that after the initial oil boom in Texas, the state "could easily have become a banana republic of the wealthy, industrialized Northeast." Why didn't it?
 A. 
By the time oil was discovered in great quantities (at Spindletop, in 1901) the state was already wary of outside interference, for a variety of historical reasons. Some years before, Texas had passed the nation's second anti-trust law as a way to push back against northeastern industrial interests - a shrewd, albeit protectionist, thing to do. That's what Texas used to keep Big Oil at bay in those early years. Although Texas' oil wealth wasn't distributed equally, we were, at least, able to keep a lot of it inside the state.
 Q. 
You say that Americans outside the state have often mistaken its rhetoric about independence as an echo of the Confederacy, but that they're wrong to do so. Why?
 A. 
After staging a revolution against the young republic of Mexico, Texas was an independent country from 1836 to 1845. The Texas Revolution wasn't as glorious as some accounts suggest, and the Republic of Texas wasn't glamorous, but both are crucial to Texas' conception of itself; the revolution created a sense of common purpose, and the years as a republic differentiated us from other states. So today, when Texans talk about independence, that's the history they're evoking. There are pockets of Confederate nostalgia in Texas, but the Civil War has never had the same psychological stranglehold on Texas that it seems to have in some states.
 Q. 
There's been a lot of talk recently about how Texas is likely to become more favorable to Democratic candidates in coming years. But you say the state's electorate has "remained much the same as ever: pragmatic, fiscally conservative, socially moderate, and slightly disengaged." So to what extent do you believe the predictions about a "bluer" Texas?
 A. 
It's certainly possible. Texas's demographics, specifically its youth and its urbanization - which are correlated with ethnicity, but not the same - are auspicious for Democrats. And on social issues the people of Texas are more centrist than the state's current Republican leadership, although the biggest issue for voters here, as in most places, is the economy. The Democrats have a number of hurdles, though, the primary one being that they need to run more candidates. At the moment, they don't have anyone queued up for next year's Senate election. It's the soft bigotry of low expectations, perhaps, but I do think John Cornyn is better than "no one."
 Q. 
Since your book acknowledges the state's strengths and drawbacks in equal measure, I imagine it could be a "can't win" scenario with some Texan readers. How has the book been received by readers there?
 A. 
It's been received warmly by most Texans I've heard from, although a number have raised points of disagreement, which is fine, of course. Most Texans, including me, are a little tired of the caricatures, but we can handle criticism, especially when it's fair. I'm proud of Texas, and I want it to be the best Texas it can be, and there's no conflict between those two statements. What a punitive world it would be, if we only loved things that were perfect.
 Q. 
What are three other books you would recommend people read if they want to get a better sense of the state?
 A. 
"Lone Star," by T.R. Fehrenbach, is my favorite single-volume history of Texas. Caro's Lyndon Johnson series - read the first volume and keep in mind the fact that Johnson's hardscrabble Hill Country youth is concurrent with, you know, the Jazz Age. That really helps explain where Texas is coming from. And let's say Larry McMurtry's "Terms of Endearment" - a sexy, sprawling mess of a novel that somehow, improbably, totally works.

HEADLINE: In Brown-Vitter Bill, a Banking Overhaul With Possible Teeth

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Senators Sherrod Brown and David Vitter introduced a bill that could be a barbaric yawp of anger at big banks or something with actual force. 

 BODY:
The biggest banks have done an excellent job of delaying and undermining the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law and staving off criminal investigations into wrongdoing.
Maybe, just maybe, they've been too successful.
Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat from Ohio, and David Vitter, Republican from Louisiana, introduced a bill last week that calls for two things: making the giant banks much safer and tying regulators' hands to prevent them from using taxpayer money to save a failing financial institution.
If the bankers who blew up the financial world had been held accountable, the popular fury that fuels this bill would have dissipated by now. And if Dodd-Frank were fully in place today, instead of being bogged down in the courts and in the halls of Washington regulatory offices, there would be no political momentum behind such an effort.
Now, we will see whether the bill is simply a barbaric yawp of anger at the big banks or something with actual force. It probably won't get passed, but its underlying premise cannot be dislodged from the Washington conversation. 
The Brown-Vitter bill calls for the banks with more than $500 billion in assets - I'm looking at you, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - to have capital reserves of 15 percent. That's a much higher standard than exists today, especially because the current requirements have weak definitions of capital and total asset size.
The banks have rounded up a bunch of critics, led by the likes of the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and the lobbying firm Hamilton Place Strategies, the volume of their lamentations most likely in direct proportion to the hourly rate they bill their clients. They invoke terrifying, talismanic statements: the bill is a "punishment" to big banks. It is simplistic, impossible, will render American banks "uncompetitive," lead to financial crises and probably cause tooth decay.
This naïve bill would force the giant banks to raise too much capital and would hurt the economy as the companies were forced to shrink or break up. Standard & Poor's is one of the observers warning of a financial crisis. And who better to know than the people who brought us the last one?
Goldman Sachs and S.& P. estimate the big banks might be forced to raise $1 trillion or more. That's a lot, so much that the leviathans' agents cry out that they couldn't sell that much stock. But they don't have to raise it all at once. And they can retain their earnings and stop paying dividends in addition to selling shares.
In putting that argument forward, they don't realize they make Senator Brown's and Senator Vitter's case for them. If investors are so terrified of the big banks that they won't buy their stock, that's a terrific problem. Most of the big banks trade below their net worth, an indication that investors don't trust them. Brown-Vitter might actually help banks by restoring that trust.
The Brown-Vitter bill serves as a good time to remind defenders of big banks what bank "capital" is. As Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig have pointed out in their indispensable book "The Bankers' New Clothes," capital is not a rainy-day fund. It's not stored away in a vault somewhere, never to be touched. Capital - the rest of us know it as "equity," like the down payment on a house - is simply money that absorbs losses. The more money a bank raises from shareholders, the more profit it keeps on hand, the less it has to borrow and the more solid it is. The bank can still lend that money. And if JPMorgan Chase doesn't lend to some small business, perhaps a regional or community bank will.
There might be some trade-offs to higher capital requirements, but we know there are costs to lower ones: financial crises. Some try to argue that the banks faced a liquidity crisis in 2008, what we call a run on the bank. Yes, that was true in the autumn of 2008. But the crisis didn't start then. It started in the late summer of 2007. If the banks had been more solidly capitalized, there would have been fewer panicked investors.
Banks desire as little capital as they can get away with. It's easier to make higher returns on equity with greater debt. Often management is paid in stock. But society as a whole doesn't benefit from banks that are running with too much leverage. They collapse.
So, it is better to have higher equity capital. But Brown-Vitter doesn't go far enough. The bill's definition of equity could be tighter. It still contains bookkeeping entries called intangible assets and deferred tax assets, which don't absorb losses.
But, gratifyingly, Brown-Vitter does tighten up the definition of assets. Capital is the numerator and assets are the denominator. Both need to be made as solid and trustworthy - and resistant to manipulation by banks or regulatory capture - as they can be. When calculating assets, Brown-Vitter tightens up rules on things like how the banks measure their exposure to derivatives.
Oh, the critics shout, this is just a backdoor way of making banks smaller. The bill's authors fail to understand that diversity of exposure saves gargantuan banks, they say. This requires a slap to the side of the head and a one-word rebuttal: Citigroup. Citi blew up because of its exposure to collateralized debt obligations. That exposure was dismissed and misunderstood by the top ranks because it was seemingly small as a portion of the bank's balance sheet. It was wonderfully diversified into all kinds of investments, which didn't help at all. Sure, small banks are less diverse. But when they collapse, the problem is more manageable.
Brown-Vitter inhibits regulators from using risk-weighting of assets, where banks and regulators determine which kinds of investments are safe and require little capital behind them. Davis Polk declared that getting rid of risk-weighting is "too blunt," somehow immune to the absurd spectacle of lawyers opining on proper risk management.
In fact, risk-weighting has a storied history of blunder. Residential mortgages and sovereign debt, like that of, say, Greece, were once viewed as carrying little risk. Risk-weighting encourages banks to crowd into assets thought to be safe, in that way making them unsafe. It lulls them, and regulators, into a false sense of confidence. Perhaps throwing out risk-weighting might lead lots of banks to buy stuff that is known to carry risk. It's far better to have them piling into investments that are known to be risky and count those purchases with a clearer, less manipulated number. Then, regulators need to pay attention, which, call me crazy, is their job.
Brown-Vitter also ties regulators' hands on whether they can pour taxpayer money into failing banks. Here, it's less plausible. Dodd-Frank has given regulators resolution authority, which gives them the power to unwind failing institutions and impose losses on the shareholders and creditors. Brown-Vitter tries to eliminate what Dodd-Frank skeptics see as too much regulatory flexibility.
It's a noble idea. But the problem, as Paul A. Volcker has pointed out, is that if JPMorgan Chase is truly failing, it's almost a certainty that Citi and Bank of America are going down, too. And taxpayers would then have to step in in some fashion.
So, taxpayers are implicitly on the hook for the financial sector, even with Brown-Vitter.
That's why we need the biggest banks to have truly clear and understandable balance sheet fortresses.

HEADLINE: Can Every Group Be Worse Than Average? Yes.

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Within a seeming contradiction in the long-term national pay trends is a statistical aberration. 

 BODY:
My Off the Charts column last week noted that pay disparities had grown in the United States since 2000. The real income necessary to reach the 90th percentile - the top 10 percent of all wage owners - was 9 percent higher in the first quarter than it had been 13 years earlier. The income necessary to be in the 10th percentile was down 3 percent over the same period. The pay needed to be at the median was up 1 percent. 
The column showed similar trends among college graduates and among high school graduates.
What I did not point out, but might have, is an interesting statistical aberration. The pay necessary to reach the 90th percentile of every educational group rose less than the overall number. The same was true for the 10th percentile, the 25th percentile, the median and the 75th percentile.
How could that happen? Some readers deemed it evidence that I must have made a mistake. 
The answer is that the relative size of the groups changed greatly over those 13 years. There are now many more college graduates working than there were then. There are fewer employees with a high school education or less. That changing nature of the work force meant that there are more (higher wage) well-educated people in the overall total now than there had been in 2000.
Adding to the population changes is the fact that the percentage of people with jobs has fallen less for college graduates (78.5 percent in 2000, 72.6 percent now) than it has for either high school graduates or people with some college education. The share of high school dropouts with jobs, however, is virtually the same now as it was in 2000.
As a result, we can get the following, seemingly unlikely, results:
 Median change in real weekly wages, 2000-13 
Total: +0.9%
High School Dropouts: -7.9%
High School Graduates, No College: -4.7%
Some College: -7.6%
Bachelor's or Higher: -1.2%

HEADLINE: Days of the Jackals

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins compare cooperation among animals in the wild to cooperation among politicians in Washington. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, I just got back from a vacation in Botswana. We were cut off from the outside world for quite a while, just looking at nature. One of our guides showed us a wild dog who had wandered into the area a few years before, apparently lost from her pack. So she stole some jackal pups and raised them. Now they're a team - the dog does the hunting and the jackals keep a lookout for lions.
David Brooks: I've been to Africa a few times, and every time I go I develop deeper affection for jackals. Does this mean I've been living in Washington for too long?
Gail: I did keep trying to think of a way to make the wild dog-jackal story a metaphor for a road toward harmony between President Obama and Congress. But I guess it really wouldn't work unless the president was permitted to replace the current House and Senate with a passel of abducted infants. 
David: This is a form of government the founders did not consider: a group of genetically diverse infants raised together as one family and then appointed to rule the country. Studies from Israeli kibbutzim show that people who were close before puberty tend not to develop sexual interests in one another throughout their lives. This would be very good for Mark Sanford.
Gail: I did pick a good two weeks to be out of touch. I can't believe the depressing list of stories out of Washington. The little bitty excruciatingly modest gun bill died. Among the Senators voting no - Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who then announced a couple of days later that he wasn't running for re-election. The man can't even take a principled stand when he has nothing to lose!
David: Have you considered the possibility that not taking principled stands is his principle, and that he would be willing to sacrifice his career, his livelihood, his sacred honor and even the lobbying prospects of his former employees in order to live up to his anti-creed?
Baucus's career was an odd one. He rose to high position. He projected an air of responsible moderation. But never really left a mark. Moderation without a worldview.
Gail: Then Congress made it clear that the sequester - the stupidest way to cut spending in history - is going to stay with us. Except for the one part that inconveniences people who spend a lot of time traveling by air.
David: I see where this is heading. You're going to tell us to move to Africa, where even the wild dogs show a sense of decency. I do have to agree with you about the sequester. The history of American politics over the past few years has been about protecting the upper bourgeoisie at the expense of everyone else. But when they dump kids from Head Start while protecting frequent flyers, they are making it kind of obvious.
Gail: In a normal year, the idea of cutting the defense budget by $46 billion would be O.K. by me. Not, of course, in the way they sequester does it - by chipping 8 percent out of every little category and subcategory regardless of merit. In a sane world you'd look for unnecessary weapons programs, or in a crunch even get rid of those military bands.
David: I'd vote for saving the bands and getting rid of the tanks. Can you envision a massive ground invasion led by tanks? In the 21st century?
 Gail: The tanks could ride in parades instead of the bands. But right now, even completely reasonable defense cuts aren't all that desirable. Cutting defense spending is just another brake on the economy. As is cutting Head Start teachers or scientific researchers.
David: While you were away I offered my 396th grand bargain idea. The Republicans give Democrats significant discretionary spending increases to reduce inequality short term, and the Democrats give the Republicans structural entitlement reform to reduce debt long term. Makes sense to me, but I guess pretty much no one else.
Gail: Poor David. Making sense is so 20th century. While I'm whining about money and Congress, can I mention the way the House Republicans spent years obsessing about the fact that the Senate wasn't passing a budget? In theory, as you of course know, the House and Senate are each supposed to pass a general plan for how much they want to tax and spend. And if the bills disagree, which they always do, they go to a conference committee to work out the differences.
David: That's called Regular Order, which has become the sexiest phrase in Washington over the past month or so. Everybody says they want to return to it. It's the gluten-free of fiscal policy.
Gail: The Senate skipped the whole budget thing for four straight years. That was definitely wrong, although I don't know that it made any great difference, given all the chaos in the other parts of the process. But to hear the House Republicans talk, you'd think that the Senate's lack of a budget was the central problem facing the American economy.
David: Well, it was a part of the problem.
Gail: Now this year the Senate did pass a budget, but the House is refusing to follow the rules and let the two versions go to a conference committee. It's true that the two bills are so different it's impossible to imagine them working out a compromise. But after all that carping, you should at least finish the process.
David: These are not really budgets though, if by budget you mean a piece of legislation that could conceivably be part of an agreement that could be enacted into law. These are more like campaign documents - airy-fairy imaginary visions of what the country would look like if the other party didn't exist.
People get to Congress and instead of acting like legislators they begin acting like academics. They're more interested in making points than in making laws.
Gail: I know there's great hope of a big immigration bill this year, but given what's gone on so far, I'm dubious Congress can even pull that off. And God knows what they'll do about raising the debt ceiling.
Turning over the whole process to a wild dog and a bunch of jackals might be an improvement.
David: I figured we'd wind up with this thought. Years ago I saw a movie that I think was set in Botswana. It was called "The Gods Must Be Crazy." They still are.

HEADLINE: French Efforts to Block Sale of Stake in Video Site to Yahoo Are Criticized

BYLINE: ERIC PFANNER


HIGHLIGHT: The French government&#8217;s objections to plans by Yahoo to buy a controlling stake in the video-sharing site DailyMotion has alarmed entrepreneurs in France. 

 BODY:
The government of President François Hollande has expressed its objections to plans by Yahoo to buy a controlling stake in the video-sharing site DailyMotion, which is owned by France Télécom, in an effort to keep one of the country's most successful technology start-ups out of foreign hands.
The move has probably scuttled any hope of an agreement, according to two people briefed on the situation, who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity. 
The government's intervention has alarmed entrepreneurs in France, who say it sends a bad message to foreign investors, especially at a time when the country is seeking their money to help jump-start its economy.
"I'm sure France will be downgraded in foreign investors' eyes because they will think it is too complicated," said Frédéric Montagnon, co-founder of OverBlog, a blogging platform.
DailyMotion, which was created in 2005 by private investors in a Paris apartment, was effectively selected to be a French national champion in 2009, when the country's strategic investment fund pumped 7.5 million euros into the company. Later, DailyMotion was taken over by Orange, a subsidiary of France Télécom, a former state-owned monopoly in which the French government wields considerable influence because it still holds a 27 percent stake.
Stéphane Richard, the chief executive of France Télécom, has said on several occasions that he was interested in finding a partner, preferably an American technology company, to help DailyMotion expand internationally.
DailyMotion has an audience of more than 110 million unique visitors a month, making it the 12th largest online video site in the world, according to comScore, a research firm. But it has struggled to compete with the giants of the business, including YouTube, which is owned by Google, for advertising revenue.
Yahoo has also been trying to expand its video presence under the leadership of Marissa Mayer, the chief executive it hired away from Google last year. A few months ago, Yahoo began talks with France Télécom on a deal under which it would have taken control of DailyMotion, according to people briefed on the negotiations. Yahoo was apparently interested in buying at least a 75 percent stake, in a deal that would have valued DailyMotion at more than 200 million euros, these people said.
The French government apparently favored an arrangement under which France Télécom would have retained control. Word of its objections leaked to the French news media last week.
Late Wednesday, Arnaud Montebourg, France's minister for industrial renewal, acknowledged that the negotiations had broken down, saying he "regrets that the talks were unable to achieve an agreement satisfactory to all the parties involved." While neither Yahoo nor France Télécom has publicly disclosed that they were conducting talks, Mr. Montebourg showed no such reluctance.
"The minister has expressed his desire that a partnership between Yahoo and Orange should be built on an equal base, mutually beneficial to both companies," his office said in a statement.
One person close to Mr. Montebourg, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he thought there was still a possibility that the talks could be revived. But another person briefed on the situation said that Yahoo had walked away and was unlikely to come back. Yahoo declined to comment.
The move to block a takeover by Yahoo comes even as France has been stepping up its efforts to attract foreign investment - much needed, analysts say, to pull the country out of a slump in which gross domestic product declined by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
Under the tag line "Say oui to France," government agencies have been running advertisements in American newspapers promoting French "innovation clusters," tax credits for research and entrepreneurial spirit.
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, France received $62 billion of foreign direct investment in 2012, placing it fifth in the world and second in Europe, after Britain.
French entrepreneurs appear to have prevailed in a campaign to encourage the government to modify plans for a sharp increase in the capital gains tax, which they say would have stifled start-up activity. But they add that the government's pitch to foreigners looks strikingly at odds with the message sent to would-be investors like Yahoo.
"France Télécom has been a fair partner for DailyMotion, but this company needs to find an appropriate host," said Jean-David Chamboredon, president of ISAI, a fund that invests in French start-ups. "Montebourg is sending a bad and wrong signal to international investors."
It is not the first time that France has moved to assert national sovereignty over the digital economy, a push that seems to have gained momentum under the current government. Mr. Hollande has called for legislation to bring social networks into line with French laws against hate speech, following a spate of anti-Semitic posts on Twitter. He also brokered a settlement in which Google will help finance French news publishers' efforts to develop their Web operations, and is pushing for foreign Internet companies to pay higher taxes in France.
Mr. Montagnon, of OverBlog, said the move to scuttle a takeover of DailyMotion showed that the administration did not "get" the Internet, where national borders can be surmounted with the click of a mouse.
"It's a great thing when a company like Yahoo shows an interest in a French company," Mr. Montagnon said. "I'm not sure DailyMotion should be considered a strategic asset for this country."

HEADLINE: Survey Shows Strong Support for Fuel Efficiency Standards

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: A Consumer Federation of America survey shows that most people want more fuel efficient cars, and that they support stricter federal standards, too. 

 BODY:
A new survey has found that consumers want more fuel efficient cars and also support the new federal fuel economy standards that the federal government plans to reach by 2025. 
The survey, conducted by the Consumer Federation of America, polled 1,001 adults by telephone. The results, released on Monday, indicate strong public support for the 54.5 mile per gallon federalfuel economy standards. It also suggested strong intentions on the part of most vehicle buyers to seek improved fuel economy on their next vehicle.
According to the survey, 85 percent of respondents said they supported the 54.5 m.p.g. rule and 54 percent strongly supported it. Those results cut across political lines, according to the poll, with support from 77 percent of the Republicans surveyed, 92 percent of the Democrats and 87 percent of the independents. Eighty-eight percent of those participating in the poll said that fuel economy would be an important factor in their next car purchase, the survey said, and 59 percent said it would be a "very important" consideration.
Respondents now driving 24 m.p.g. vehicles told the federation that they expect an improvement to about 31 m.p.g. in the next vehicle they buy. And 57 percent of those who said they planned to buy an S.U.V. said they expected it to achieve at least 25 m.p.g. The federation also pointed to the increasing popularity and availability of 4-cylinder engines.
Mark Cooper, the federation's director of research, said in a telephone interview that concern about fuel economy had increased sharply among American car buyers.
"Even 10 years ago, it was not much of an issue," he said. "But subsequent gas price hikes got people thinking about it. The automakers needed a good framework for dealing with efficiency, and that's why we think the federal fuel economy standards are very effective - they arrived at a time when the market was ready."
Jack Gillis, a federation spokesman, said in a telephone interview that consumers weren't just talking about buying the more efficient cars that are increasingly available to them; a look at the most popular vehicles shows that they're actually buying them.
A random telephone survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center, released in February, reached similar conclusions about market intent. It said that two-thirds of car buyers expected their next car or truck to provide much better or somewhat better fuel economy than their current one.

HEADLINE: Not Everything Is Political

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Doctrines work or they don&#8217;t. 

 BODY:
Brad DeLong directs me to a screed by Clive Crook, who sort of admits that I've been right about a lot of things but accuses me of being, well, shrill. Where have I heard that before?
But the Crook piece is actually useful, in an unintended way.
Brad points out, correctly, that Crook demands that I engage respectfully with reasonable people on the other side, but somehow fails to offer even one example of such a person. Not long ago Crook was offering Paul Ryan as an exemplar of serious, honest conservatism, while I was shrilly declaring Ryan a con man. But I suspect that even Crook now admits, at least to himself, that Ryan is indeed a con man. 
But in a way the most revealing point here is Crook's demand that I engage with 
thoughtful, public-spirited Americans whose views on the proper scale and scope of government are different from his, yet worthy of respect.
Wait - is that what it's about? If you read my original post, and Noah Smith's KrugTron the Invincible post that inspired it, you'll see that it's all about macroeconomics - about questions like whether budget deficits in a depressed economy drive up interest rates and crowd out private investment, about whether printing money in a depressed economy is inflationary, about whether rising government debt has severe negative impacts on growth. 
What do these questions have in common? They're factual questions, with factual answers - and they have absolutely no necessary relationship to the "proper scale and scope of government". You could, in principle, believe that we need a drastically downsized government, and at the same time believe that cutting government spending right now will increase unemployment. You could believe that discretionary policy of any kind is a mistake, and at the same time admit that the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet isn't at all inflationary under current circumstances.
So where's this stuff about the scale of government coming from? Well, in practice it turns out that many conservatives are unwilling to concede that Keynesian macro has any validity to it, or that you can sometimes run the printing presses without unleashing runaway inflation, because they fear that any such admission would open the doors to much wider government intervention. But that's exactly my point! They're letting their views about how the world works be dictated by their vision of the kind of society they want; they're politicizing their economic analysis. And that's why they keep getting everything wrong.
And I guess that Crook becomes part of the "they" I'm talking about, because he too seems unable to distinguish between how things are and political value judgments.
Do I do the same thing? Well, I try not to - which is one reason I've been leery of linking my concerns about inequality to my macro advocacy.
And for what it's worth, Noah Smith is right to suggest that almost all of what I'm writing about macroeconomics these days has its roots in my late-1990s analysis of Japan - which surely had nothing at all to do with US politics.
The bottom line is that although I have political views - and wear them on my sleeve! - I'm not so postmodern as to believe that all truth is political. Some economic doctrines work, others don't. And my doctrine seems, objectively, non-politically, to have been working better than the other guys'.

HEADLINE: A Mortgage Agency Pick Is Likely to Cause Conflict

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS and ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Some Republicans were not happy with the president&#8217;s choice of Representative Melvin L. Watt, whose housing stance could draw scrutiny. 

 BODY:
President Obama's overhaul of the mortgage market has been a long time coming.
But he took a significant step forward on Wednesday, announcing his intention to nominate a new director for an agency that plays a crucial role in the housing market.
 The president tapped Representative Melvin L. Watt, a Democrat of North Carolina, to become the new director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Mr. Watt has advocated for strong measures to provide relief to struggling homeowners, including reducing how much borrowers owe on their mortgages. 
"Mel understands as well as anybody what caused the housing crisis," President Obama said on Wednesday. "He knows what it's going to take to help responsible homeowners fully recover."
Still, Mr. Watt's nomination will most likely inflame long-running political battles over how much the government should do to make mortgages available and support homeowners. Most immediately, Republican senators opposed to Mr. Watt's housing stances might try to hold up his confirmation.
"I could not be more disappointed in this nomination," Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.
As director of the housing agency, Mr. Watt would oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two taxpayer-owned mortgage finance giants that have provided enormous support to the housing market since the financial crisis of 2008. They guaranteed two-thirds of all the mortgages made last year.
The Obama administration wants to reduce government involvement but has made almost no big moves in that direction. Some critics question its resolve to scale back the role of Fannie and Freddie, which received one of the biggest bailouts of the financial crisis. They say Mr. Watt's nomination looks like tactical maneuvering, designed in part to placate progressives in Congress who say the president has done too little to help homeowners.
"It seems like a political move when a substantive one is needed," said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody's Analytics who has focused on housing, was also a candidate to lead the housing agency. Mr. Zandi, "seemed to be a perfect nominee," said Mr. Swagel, who was an assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
Consumer advocates are upset that Mr. Obama did not long ago remove Edward DeMarco, the current head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. He effectively stopped Fannie and Freddie from cutting loan balances for stressed homeowners. Last year, Mr. DeMarco argued that such a program "would not make a meaningful improvement in reducing foreclosures in a cost-effective way for taxpayers."
Reducing mortgage balances could be the issue that draws the most scrutiny for Mr. Watt during the confirmation process.
Given the level of controversy around this policy, some mortgage market analysts questioned on Wednesday why the White House had nominated someone who has identified so closely with it.
But Gene B. Sperling, an assistant to the president on economic policy, said the administration stood behind Mr. Watt's support for cutting mortgage balances. "That's our position, and we're not going to disqualify someone for agreeing with us," he said.
In an interview, Mr. Watt said that, as director of the agency, he would be obliged to take into account the risk of losses to taxpayers from writing down mortgages.
"My role would be to look at this from all sides, from the homeowner's perspective and the taxpayer's perspective," he said. "There are a lot of things I might have to approach differently as a director of this agency."
Those in favor of cutting mortgages received some support on Wednesday. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a study showing that reducing the amounts borrowers owe could actually save taxpayers money by reducing the chance underwater homeowners would default and end up in foreclosure, thus causing losses to Fannie and Freddie, which own or guarantee more than half of all residential mortgages. But other analyses suggest that the approach is not a silver bullet. About one-third of borrowers who had their mortgage balances reduced by more than 20 percent went back into default within two years, according to a study by Fitch Ratings.
Despite the mortgage relief questions, Mr. Watt may still gain support in the Senate for his nomination. He is well known in Congress and sits on the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Some Republicans may vote for him.
"Having served with Mel, I know of his commitment to sustainable federal housing programs and am confident he will work hard to protect taxpayers from future exposure to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac," Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said in a statement.
While Mr. Watt is known for promoting lending to low-income and minority borrowers, he is not considered unfriendly to banks. Financial firms and insurers are among his biggest donors, in no small part because Charlotte, part of which is in Mr. Watt's district, is a banking center.
Still, many members of Congress and analysts are eager to reduce the government's role in housing, and feel Mr. Watt may not push hard enough to curtail the activities of Fannie and Freddie.
"It's coming up on five years and nothing has happened," said Edward Pinto, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
But Mr. Watt says he's firmly behind the administration's plans to have the government largely withdraw from the housing market.
"I've indicated in committee that I am committed to finding a new model, and that model includes winding down Fannie and Freddie," he said. As director of the housing agency, "I'd be ideally situated to facilitate that."
Should Mr. Watt fail to win Senate confirmation, the White House could name him as a recess appointment.

HEADLINE: Banks Ease Capital Cost of Loans to Brokers

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: An arbitration case shows the different choices financial firms make about where to house virtually identical assets and how those decisions can reduce costs. 

 BODY:
To attract financial advisers, brokerage firms often offer them loans. They are loans with a difference, however.
The loans are essentially payments to lure the advisers - and presumably many of their clients - to the firm and keep them there. The loans are typically forgiven over time if the financial adviser, or broker, meets various performance requirements and does not defect to a rival.
 There is a cost to this practice. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires brokerage firms to hold a significant amount of capital, one dollar for each dollar lent, to protect against loan losses. Then, if the customer does not make good on the loan, the shareholders of the brokerage firm are protected. 
Morgan Stanley, however, houses the roughly $6 billion in loans it has made to its financial advisers outside its broker-dealer unit. Segregating these loans allows the bank to set aside just 8 cents for every dollar lent, a much lower capital cost than its rivals Wells Fargo and Bank of America pay. Wells says it keeps all these loans at its broker-dealer, taking a higher capital charge. Bank of America keeps some at its broker-dealer and some in a unit that allows it to set aside less capital. An arbitration case in Tampa, Fla., has opened a window on the different choices that financial firms make about where to house virtually identical assets and how those decisions can reduce a firm's capital burden. Such calls - rarely disclosed publicly - have become more important since the financial crisis as regulators have pushed banks to hold more capital to protect against potential losses.
"This is classic regulatory arbitrage," said Rebel A. Cole, a professor of finance at DePaul University. "There is clearly an incentive for Morgan Stanley to hold these loans outside their brokerage operations."
A spokesman for Morgan Stanley, James Wiggins, said the bank held these loans outside its brokerage operation because they were not related to customer activity.
"While carrying the loans in the servicing entity does decrease the amount of capital held in the broker-dealer subsidiary, it does not reduce the amount of capital held against them at the overall company level," the spokesman said, referring to the 8-cents-on-the-dollar capital charge for loans held at banks' holding companies. He said that Morgan Stanley had had this structure for years to take a lower capital charge and that Citigroup had the same structure. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup combined their wealth management operations in 2009.
Neither Bank of America nor Wells Fargo Bank would disclose the value of their broker loans. Wall Street executives with knowledge of the loan structures, who were not authorized to speak on the record, suggested that some banks have not moved the loans outside of the broker-dealer because doing so might draw regulatory scrutiny and would require these banks to rewrite thousands of client contracts.
Details about Morgan Stanley's arrangement emerged in a recent dispute involving a former financial adviser. The broker, James Eastman, 59, filed an arbitration claim against the bank after he left in 2010, arguing defamation of character and wrongful dismissal. He sought to have his loans from the bank forgiven, something Morgan Stanley was unwilling to do.
After working at Citigroup for years, Mr. Eastman became part of Morgan Stanley after the two firms combined their brokerage operations.
He ended up with two loans. The first was made in 2001, when he started at Citigroup, and it was valued at $942,532. It was forgivable over 10 years, and then subsequently extended. In 2009, he received another loan, valued at $214,648, to encourage him to stay through the merger. Mr. Eastman left the company in 2010, owing roughly $400,000 on the two loans, according to his lawyer, Chris Vernon.
Typically a broker gets a loan that covers several years and is required to pay interest on it. The broker repays the loan using earnings from a parallel bonus pool, assuming certain performance targets are met. If they are not, or the broker bolts to another firm, the broker may be required to pay the loan back.
Mr. Vernon says he was concerned that the entity holding Mr. Eastman's loans was something called Morgan Stanley FA Notes Holdings, and not the brokerage business, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. He says he did not want a third party coming after his client later, so he argued that Morgan Stanley FA Notes Holdings, not Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, should be a party to the arbitration case. As part of the arbitration, Jeffrey Gelfand, the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley's wealth management business, was called to testify.
Under oath, Mr. Gelfand explained that Morgan Stanley had always housed broker loans outside its broker-dealer. The current holding company, he said, was created in 2009, just weeks before the announcement that Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were combining their wealth management operations.
"Having them away from the broker-dealer just allows us to minimize the regulatory capital associated with them and operate the broker-dealer more efficiently," he explained to the three arbiters hearing his claim.
He said Morgan Stanley financed its broker-dealer "well in excess of the minimum capital requirement," so leaving the loans there might not necessarily affect how much capital the bank's broker-dealer has, but it "reduces the requirement if that was important at any point in time."
The arbitration was bittersweet for Mr. Eastman. While he received a lesson in Wall Street capital decisions, the arbitration panel denied Mr. Eastman's claims in March and ordered him to pay back roughly $200,000 of the $400,000 he owed the bank. As well, the panel granted his motion to dismiss Morgan Stanley Smith Barney as a party on his two loans.
Mr. Vernon has now filed a claim in Florida court for lawyers' fees.

HEADLINE: Bolivia: U.S. Agency Is Expelled

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
LA PAZ, Bolivia -- President Evo Morales expelled the United States Agency for International Development from Bolivia on Wednesday, suggesting that it had conspired against his leftist government.
Mr. Morales made the announcement at the start of festivities to commemorate May 1, a holiday in Bolivia and in many other countries that celebrate workers' movements and organized labor. 
The agency, which has nine American employees here, had already sharply reduced its presence. The Obama administration had asked for $17 million for the agency's Bolivia programs this year, a steep drop from its $89 million budget in 2007.
''Some institutions of the United States Embassy continue to conspire against this process, against the people and especially against the country,'' Mr. Morales said. As a result, he said, ''We have decided to expel U.S.A.I.D. from Bolivia.''
A State Department spokesman, Patrick Ventrell, said the United States denied ''the baseless allegations made by the Bolivian government,'' adding, ''Those who will be most hurt by the Bolivian government's decision are the Bolivian citizens, who have benefited from our collaborative work on education, health and the environment.''
The agency said its projects in Bolivia included work to reduce pollution in Lake Titicaca and to support nongovernmental organizations that provide health care for pregnant women, infants and young children.
Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a Bolivian research group, said Mr. Morales has long distrusted the aid agency, since the days when it helped finance a program to get coca growers, an important constituency for the president, to switch to other crops. The program was linked to a highly unpopular campaign for the forced eradication of coca.
Mr. Morales has often accused Washington of trying to undermine his government. He expelled the American ambassador in 2008 and the Drug Enforcement Administration the following year.
He did not give details on Wednesday to back up his assertion that the aid agency was conspiring against him, but he said it manipulated the leaders of social movements in areas where it worked.
He also said the expulsion was a response to comments last month by Secretary of State John Kerry that angered other leftist leaders in the region by conjuring images of an imperialist foreign policy. ''The Western Hemisphere is our backyard,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''It's critical to us.''
The United States ''still has a mentality of domination, of subjugation,'' Mr. Morales said.

HEADLINE: Banks Ease Capital Cost of Loans to Brokers

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
To attract financial advisers, brokerage firms often offer them loans. They are loans with a difference, however.
The loans are essentially payments to lure the advisers -- and presumably many of their clients -- to the firm and keep them there. The loans are typically forgiven over time if the financial adviser, or broker, meets various performance requirements and does not defect to a rival.
There is a cost to this practice. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires brokerage firms to hold a significant amount of capital, one dollar for each dollar lent, to protect against loan losses. Then, if the customer does not make good on the loan, the shareholders of the brokerage firm are protected. 
Morgan Stanley, however, houses the roughly $6 billion in loans it has made to its financial advisers outside its broker-dealer unit. Segregating these loans allows the bank to set aside just 8 cents for every dollar lent, a much lower capital cost than its rivals Wells Fargo and Bank of America pay. Wells says it keeps all these loans at its broker-dealer, taking a higher capital charge. Bank of America keeps some at its broker-dealer and some in a unit that allows it to set aside less capital. An arbitration case in Tampa, Fla., has opened a window on the different choices that financial firms make about where to house virtually identical assets and how those decisions can reduce a firm's capital burden. Such calls -- rarely disclosed publicly -- have become more important since the financial crisis as regulators have pushed banks to hold more capital to protect against potential losses.
''This is classic regulatory arbitrage,'' said Rebel A. Cole, a professor of finance at DePaul University. ''There is clearly an incentive for Morgan Stanley to hold these loans outside their brokerage operations.''
A spokesman for Morgan Stanley, James Wiggins, said the bank held these loans outside its brokerage operation because they were not related to customer activity.
''While carrying the loans in the servicing entity does decrease the amount of capital held in the broker-dealer subsidiary, it does not reduce the amount of capital held against them at the overall company level,'' the spokesman said, referring to the 8-cents-on-the-dollar capital charge for loans held at banks' holding companies. He said that Morgan Stanley had had this structure for years to take a lower capital charge and that Citigroup had the same structure. Morgan Stanley and Citigroup combined their wealth management operations in 2009.
Neither Bank of America nor Wells Fargo Bank would disclose the value of their broker loans. Wall Street executives with knowledge of the loan structures, who were not authorized to speak on the record, suggested that some banks have not moved the loans outside of the broker-dealer because doing so might draw regulatory scrutiny and would require these banks to rewrite thousands of client contracts.
Details about Morgan Stanley's arrangement emerged in a recent dispute involving a former financial adviser. The broker, James Eastman, 59, filed an arbitration claim against the bank after he left in 2010, arguing defamation of character and wrongful dismissal. He sought to have his loans from the bank forgiven, something Morgan Stanley was unwilling to do.
After working at Citigroup for years, Mr. Eastman became part of Morgan Stanley after the two firms combined their brokerage operations.
He ended up with two loans. The first was made in 2001, when he started at Citigroup, and it was valued at $942,532. It was forgivable over 10 years, and then subsequently extended. In 2009, he received another loan, valued at $214,648, to encourage him to stay through the merger. Mr. Eastman left the company in 2010, owing roughly $400,000 on the two loans, according to his lawyer, Chris Vernon.
Typically a broker gets a loan that covers several years and is required to pay interest on it. The broker repays the loan using earnings from a parallel bonus pool, assuming certain performance targets are met. If they are not, or the broker bolts to another firm, the broker may be required to pay the loan back.
Mr. Vernon says he was concerned that the entity holding Mr. Eastman's loans was something called Morgan Stanley FA Notes Holdings, and not the brokerage business, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. He says he did not want a third party coming after his client later, so he argued that Morgan Stanley FA Notes Holdings, not Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, should be a party to the arbitration case. As part of the arbitration, Jeffrey Gelfand, the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley's wealth management business, was called to testify.
Under oath, Mr. Gelfand explained that Morgan Stanley had always housed broker loans outside its broker-dealer. The current holding company, he said, was created in 2009, just weeks before the announcement that Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were combining their wealth management operations.
''Having them away from the broker-dealer just allows us to minimize the regulatory capital associated with them and operate the broker-dealer more efficiently,'' he explained to the three arbiters hearing his claim.
He said Morgan Stanley financed its broker-dealer ''well in excess of the minimum capital requirement,'' so leaving the loans there might not necessarily affect how much capital the bank's broker-dealer has, but it ''reduces the requirement if that was important at any point in time.''
The arbitration was bittersweet for Mr. Eastman. While he received a lesson in Wall Street capital decisions, the arbitration panel denied Mr. Eastman's claims in March and ordered him to pay back roughly $200,000 of the $400,000 he owed the bank. As well, the panel granted his motion to dismiss Morgan Stanley Smith Barney as a party on his two loans.

HEADLINE: Almost Half of Americans Say Budget Cuts Will Hurt Economy

BYLINE: By ALLISON KOPICKI

 BODY:
Nearly half of Americans agree with the Obama administration's contention that the economy will be hurt by the spending cuts prompted by the sequestration, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. 
About one-third said the automatic cuts to military and domestic programs that went into effect because President Obama and Republicans in Congress could not agree on a budget plan would have no effect on the economy one way or the other. Just 1 in 10 said the automatic cuts would help the economy.
In his news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that his administration's disaster warnings about the economic effects of the automatic spending cuts were not overblown: ''It's slowed our growth, it's resulting in people being thrown out of work, and it's hurting folks all across the country.''
The poll results showed that the sentiment that the cuts will hurt the economy was shared by Republicans, Democrats and independents alike.
Troy Carter, a Democrat and a professor of physics in Los Angeles, has seen the cuts limit his department's ability to staff positions.
''While I've been personally impacted, I also think the cuts are going to hurt the economy in general. Having to cut staff that is not easily recoverable is harmful, and building a work force back up is costly,'' he said in a follow-up interview. ''We can't just do austerity. We should take a comprehensive look at government spending, cut in some areas, raise some taxes, and increase investments in spending that are strategic for the growth of the country.''
But few Americans in the Times/CBS News poll said they had personally felt any effects from the budget cuts. Sixty-nine percent of Americans said they personally had not been affected, 19 percent said they had been somewhat affected, and just 8 percent said they had been affected a great deal.
''I haven't personally noticed any difference,'' said Carolyn McDonald, 67, a clinical microbiologist in Lexington, Ky., who identifies as a Republican. ''I think the cuts could hurt some people. Whether they would be hurt more if they had to pay more in taxes, I don't know. It's hard to weigh which would be better.''
Kristie Shirley, a homemaker in Albuquerque, said she and her husband, who is in the military, had worried about what the cuts would do to his future paychecks.
''The government seems to cut the programs according to whichever ones whine the most or put up the least fight, instead of agreeing on which programs deserve to be cut,'' said Ms. Shirley, a 37-year-old Republican. ''They're cutting defense, and I don't know if that's the smartest place to cut.''
The nationwide telephone survey was conducted from April 24 to 28 on both land lines and cellphones with 965 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. More results will be released at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday on nytimes.com.

HEADLINE: Business Hiring Slipped To 7-Month Low in April

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Companies hired the fewest employees in April in seven months while manufacturing growth slowed to a crawl, suggesting that the economy was weakening as tight fiscal policy in Washington started to hold back growth. 
Businesses added 119,000 employees to payrolls last month, according to the ADP National Employment Report released on Wednesday, short of economists' expectations for 150,000 jobs and the smallest gain since last September.
The slowdown in hiring was caused primarily by a combination of increased payroll taxes at the start of the year and the $85 billion in government spending cuts that took effect across the board in March, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which jointly developed the hiring report with ADP, a payroll processor.
''They are starting to bite and starting to weaken growth,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''It's affecting all industries and almost all company sizes.''
The Federal Reserve also expressed its concern about economic growth on Wednesday and said it would continue to pursue its stimulus campaign, although it was ready to increase or decrease its efforts depending on the economy's performance.
After accelerating in the first quarter, recent data suggested that overall economic growth cooled heading into the second quarter.
Two separate reports on manufacturing also showed employment slowed in April. Analysts said there was some risk that the federal April employment report on Friday could be disappointing.
Markit, a financial data firm, said its final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index slipped to 52.1 from 54.6 in March. It was the lowest reading since October.
That was echoed by a separate report from the Institute for Supply Management that showed the sector expanded only modestly, with its index coming in at 50.7, down from 51.3. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.
Regional reports also showed a slowdown in factory activity in April in some areas while some, including the Midwest, fell into contraction.
Another report showed construction spending fell 1.7 percent to an annual rate of $856.72 billion, the lowest since August, according to the Commerce Department. The drop could cause the first-quarter economic growth estimate to be trimmed from a first reading of 2.5 percent.
Economists expect Friday's employment report from the Labor Department to show that overall nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000, an improvement over the paltry 88,000 seen in March. Private payrolls are expected to have risen by 160,000.

HEADLINE: In Brown-Vitter Bill, a Bank Overhaul With Possible Teeth

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
The biggest banks have done an excellent job of delaying and undermining the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law and staving off criminal investigations into wrongdoing.
Maybe, just maybe, they've been too successful.
Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat from Ohio, and David Vitter, Republican from Louisiana, introduced a bill last week that calls for two things: making the giant banks much safer and tying regulators' hands to prevent them from using taxpayer money to save a failing financial institution.
If the bankers who blew up the financial world had been held accountable, the popular fury that fuels this bill would have dissipated by now. And if Dodd-Frank were fully in place today, instead of being bogged down in the courts and in the halls of Washington regulatory offices, there would be no political momentum behind such an effort.
Now, we will see whether the bill is simply a barbaric yawp of anger at the big banks or something with actual force. It probably won't get passed, but its underlying premise cannot be dislodged from the Washington conversation. 
The Brown-Vitter bill calls for the banks with more than $500 billion in assets -- I'm looking at you, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- to have capital reserves of 15 percent. That's a much higher standard than exists today, especially because the current requirements have weak definitions of capital and total asset size.
The banks have rounded up a bunch of critics, led by the likes of the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and the lobbying firm Hamilton Place Strategies, the volume of their lamentations most likely in direct proportion to the hourly rate they bill their clients. They invoke terrifying, talismanic statements: the bill is a ''punishment'' to big banks. It is simplistic, impossible, will render American banks ''uncompetitive,'' lead to financial crises and probably cause tooth decay.
This naïve bill would force the giant banks to raise too much capital and would hurt the economy as the companies were forced to shrink or break up. Standard & Poor's is one of the observers warning of a financial crisis. And who better to know than the people who brought us the last one?
Goldman Sachs and S.& P. estimate the big banks might be forced to raise $1 trillion or more. That's a lot, so much that the leviathans' agents cry out that they couldn't sell that much stock. But they don't have to raise it all at once. And they can retain their earnings and stop paying dividends in addition to selling shares.
In putting that argument forward, they don't realize they make Senator Brown's and Senator Vitter's case for them. If investors are so terrified of the big banks that they won't buy their stock, that's a terrific problem. Most of the big banks trade below their net worth, an indication that investors don't trust them. Brown-Vitter might actually help banks by restoring that trust.
The Brown-Vitter bill serves as a good time to remind defenders of big banks what bank ''capital'' is. As Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig have pointed out in their indispensable book ''The Bankers' New Clothes,'' capital is not a rainy-day fund. It's not stored away in a vault somewhere, never to be touched. Capital -- the rest of us know it as ''equity,'' like the down payment on a house -- is simply money that absorbs losses. The more money a bank raises from shareholders, the more profit it keeps on hand, the less it has to borrow and the more solid it is. The bank can still lend that money. And if JPMorgan Chase doesn't lend to some small business, perhaps a regional or community bank will.
There might be some trade-offs to higher capital requirements, but we know there are costs to lower ones: financial crises. Some try to argue that the banks faced a liquidity crisis in 2008, what we call a run on the bank. Yes, that was true in the autumn of 2008. But the crisis didn't start then. It started in the late summer of 2007. If the banks had been more solidly capitalized, there would have been fewer panicked investors.
Banks desire as little capital as they can get away with. It's easier to make higher returns on equity with greater debt. Often management is paid in stock. But society as a whole doesn't benefit from banks that are running with too much leverage. They collapse.
So, it is better to have higher equity capital. But Brown-Vitter doesn't go far enough. The bill's definition of equity could be tighter. It still contains bookkeeping entries called intangible assets and deferred tax assets, which don't absorb losses.
But, gratifyingly, Brown-Vitter does tighten up the definition of assets. Capital is the numerator and assets are the denominator. Both need to be made as solid and trustworthy -- and resistant to manipulation by banks or regulatory capture -- as they can be. When calculating assets, Brown-Vitter tightens up rules on things like how the banks measure their exposure to derivatives.
Oh, the critics shout, this is just a backdoor way of making banks smaller. The bill's authors fail to understand that diversity of exposure saves gargantuan banks, they say. This requires a slap to the side of the head and a one-word rebuttal: Citigroup. Citi blew up because of its exposure to collateralized debt obligations. That exposure was dismissed and misunderstood by the top ranks because it was seemingly small as a portion of the bank's balance sheet. It was wonderfully diversified into all kinds of investments, which didn't help at all. Sure, small banks are less diverse. But when they collapse, the problem is more manageable.
Brown-Vitter inhibits regulators from using risk-weighting of assets, where banks and regulators determine which kinds of investments are safe and require little capital behind them. Davis Polk declared that getting rid of risk-weighting is ''too blunt,'' somehow immune to the absurd spectacle of lawyers opining on proper risk management.
In fact, risk-weighting has a storied history of blunder. Residential mortgages and sovereign debt, like that of, say, Greece, were once viewed as carrying little risk. Risk-weighting encourages banks to crowd into assets thought to be safe, in that way making them unsafe. It lulls them, and regulators, into a false sense of confidence. Perhaps throwing out risk-weighting might lead lots of banks to buy stuff that is known to carry risk. It's far better to have them piling into investments that are known to be risky and count those purchases with a clearer, less manipulated number. Then, regulators need to pay attention, which, call me crazy, is their job.
Brown-Vitter also ties regulators' hands on whether they can pour taxpayer money into failing banks. Here, it's less plausible. Dodd-Frank has given regulators resolution authority, which gives them the power to unwind failing institutions and impose losses on the shareholders and creditors. Brown-Vitter tries to eliminate what Dodd-Frank skeptics see as too much regulatory flexibility.
It's a noble idea. But the problem, as Paul A. Volcker has pointed out, is that if JPMorgan Chase is truly failing, it's almost a certainty that Citi and Bank of America are going down, too. And taxpayers would then have to step in in some fashion.
So, taxpayers are implicitly on the hook for the financial sector, even with Brown-Vitter.
That's why we need the biggest banks to have truly clear and understandable balance sheet fortresses.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Income Guarantee Swells Crop Insurance

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The worst drought in 50 years led to record payouts from a taxpayer-subsidized insurance program created to protect farms from weather-related disasters. But the high costs were mostly a result of policies that guarantee farmers a portion of their projected revenue, rather than coverage that pays them for their damaged crops, according to a study released Wednesday. 
The study comes as lawmakers are preparing to work on a new farm bill, a spending bill passed every five years that sets the nation's food and farm policy. The last farm bill was passed in 2008.
The study was financed by the Environmental Working Group, a Washington research group, and conducted by Bruce A. Babcock, an agriculture economist at Iowa State University.
Under the federal crop insurance program, farmers can buy insurance that covers poor yields, declines in revenue or both. Dr. Babcock said most farmers bought a combination of the two policies.
The result, he said, is that crop insurance has become more of a farm income support program than a system that protects farmers in times of disasters like the 2012 drought.
Taxpayers pay about 62 percent of the insurance premiums. The policies are sold by 15 private insurance companies, which receive about $1.3 billion annually in total from the government. The government also backs the companies against losses.
These subsidies drive up the cost of the program, Dr. Babcock said, with farmers buying higher levels of coverage than they otherwise would. He estimated that without the subsidies, crop insurance payouts during last year's drought for the two largest crops, corn and soybeans, would have been just over $6 billion, about half of the $12 billion that the government actually paid.
As a result, the study found, many farmers made more money from insurance payouts during the drought than they would have from healthy crops.
''It's good insurance and a good safety net,'' Dr. Babcock said. ''The question is, is there any justification for taxpayers to subsidize the costs?''
Crop insurance will be a major part of the new farm bill. Last year, lawmakers on the House and Senate Agriculture Committees passed legislation that would expand the crop insurance program by eliminating $5 billion a year in direct payments to farmers and farmland owners who receive government checks regardless of whether they grow crops, and diverting some of that money to crop insurance. The Senate passed its version of the farm bill, but the House bill was never brought to the floor for a vote.
Agriculture groups and farmers say the crop insurance program is crucial.
''The significant, widespread crop losses of 2011 and 2012 have clearly demonstrated the need for crop insurance protection and the public-private partnership of program delivery,'' a coalition of farm groups wrote to members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees in March.
The crop insurance program has drawn a wide range of criticism from those who say that the costs need to be reduced and that it benefits mainly insurance companies and large farmers.
Farmers' net income for 2012 is expected to be $114 billion, down 3 percent from 2011 but still the second highest in 30 years. Crop insurance subsidies are set to cost more than $94 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
President Obama has proposed cutting crop insurance subsidies and reducing the amount paid to insurance companies, saving about $4 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: More Forceful Fed Stands By Stimulus

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that its economic stimulus campaign would press forward at the same pace it has maintained since December, putting to rest for now any suggestion that it was leaning toward doing less.
The Fed emphasized that it was ready to increase or decrease its efforts to spur growth and reduce unemployment as necessary, a more balanced position than it took earlier in the year, reflecting the reality that a strong winter has once again yielded to a disappointing spring.
It was the first time that the Fed had explicitly mentioned the possibility of doing more in a policy statement, although officials, including the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have made the point repeatedly in public remarks. 
Analysts disagreed about the central bank's intent. Some saw it as a signal that the Fed's next move could be an expansion of its stimulus.
Others, however, said the Fed was simply underscoring that it did not plan to reduce its asset purchases. It is buying $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.
''I don't think there's much chance of them stepping it up,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. ''But this is certainly their way of saying there's no bias toward scaling down.''
The Fed maintained a relatively sunny economic outlook in its statement, released after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. It said that the economy was expanding at a ''moderate pace'' and that the labor market had shown ''some improvement.'' It added, however, that federal spending cuts were ''restraining economic growth,'' an implicit critique of the rest of the government.
That language was stronger than the Fed had used in previous assessments of the economic impact of fiscal policy. Fed officials have repeatedly expressed frustration that fiscal policy is working at cross-purposes with their own monetary policy. The statement also noted that the pace of inflation had slackened, a potential sign of economic weakness. Bringing the annual rate of inflation closer to its target of 2 percent has been a primary goal of the Fed's four-year-old stimulus campaign, but the statement expressed little concern about the recent deceleration to a pace of only about half that level.
Investors and the Fed have taken the view that inflation is likely to return to a more normal pace without additional effort.
''The committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline'' to a level the Fed regards as acceptable, the statement said.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the stability of the Fed's economic outlook suggested that policy, too, would remain stable.
''In effect, the Fed signaled that the pace of asset purchases would be data dependent in both directions, but that right now the data gives them little reason to change in either direction,'' Mr. Feroli wrote Wednesday in a note to clients.
The statement won support from 11 of the Federal Open Market Committee's 12 members. Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, cast the dissenting vote, as she has at each meeting this year, citing concerns about potential ''economic and financial imbalances'' and the risk of excessive inflation.
The pace of economic growth appeared to slow in the weeks between the Fed's previous meeting and the one this week. Inflation slackened in March to the slowest pace in two years, while employers added the fewest jobs in any month since last summer. And economists say that the pain of federal spending cuts is just beginning to tell.
Inflation was 1.1 percent during the 12 months ending in March, according to the most recent data from the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Commerce Department's index of personal consumption expenditures. That is well below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed considers healthy.
The share of Americans with jobs has not increased since the recession.
The central bank is modestly expanding its stimulus campaign each month, as it increases the size of its bond portfolio. The Fed's most recent economic projections, published in March, showed most officials expected persistently low inflation and persistently high unemployment for years to come.
Officials, however, are reluctant to do more. They see modest benefits and uncertain costs in buying more bonds. The volume of the Fed's first-quarter purchases already roughly equaled the volume of new mortgage bond issuance and about 72 percent of the volume of new issuance of long-term federal debt.
And the Fed already has tied the duration of low interest rates to the unemployment rate, announcing in December that it intended to hold its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent, provided that inflation remained under control.
An official account of the Fed's previous meeting, in March, showed that officials discussed reducing the monthly volume of bond purchases. Some officials who supported the purchase program when it began last year said they saw evidence that the economy was growing more quickly, and that the Fed might be able to curtail the volume of its asset purchases by the third quarter.
An account of this week's meeting will be released in three weeks, providing a comparable look at the latest round of internal debate. But analysts said that the changed language in the statement reflected a shift in that debate.
The statement said, ''The committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.'' The Fed's previous statement said it would adjust the level of purchases based on economic conditions.
Michael Gapen, director of United States economic research at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note to clients that the statement was ''a fairly obvious nod to some of the recent softness in economic activity, labor markets and inflation.'' He said it reinforced his view that the Fed would maintain its $85 billion pace through the end of the year.
The Fed also could increase the impact of its campaign by telling investors how long it will run -- either in terms of a date or an economic target. But officials say that it has been impossible to reach a consensus on that issue.

HEADLINE: Obama Nominates Congressman to Lead Mortgage Agency

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Wednesday nominated Representative Melvin L. Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, to become the overseer of the government-backed mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
If approved by the Senate, Mr. Watt would replace Edward J. DeMarco, who has been acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency for more than three years.
Mr. Watt is a lawyer who has represented North Carolina in Congress for the last two decades. If he won Senate confirmation, he would become a powerful economic policy maker, as the housing market recovers and the White House contemplates the government's future role in it. 
''Mel understands as well as anybody what caused the housing crisis,'' Mr. Obama said in a ceremony in the State Dining Room of the White House. ''He knows what it's going to take to help responsible homeowners fully recover and he's committed to helping folks just like his mom,'' who attended the ceremony, and whom Mr.Obama characterized as ''Americans who work really hard, play by the rules, day in and day out, to provide for their families.''
Between Fannie, Freddie and other agencies, the government is currently backstopping about nine out of 10 new mortgages, stepping in to foster a functioning mortgage market as the effects of the housing downturn linger. The two financing agencies, which required a massive government bailout in 2008, have returned to profitability and are in the process of repaying taxpayers, who are still owed more than $100 billion.
Thus far, the Obama administration and Congress have shown little interest in restructuring or winding Fannie and Freddie down, lest they disturb the nascent housing recovery. But with the market starting to normalize, what to do with Fannie and Freddie -- and what role the government should be playing in the mortgage market more broadly -- look certain to become more hotly contested issues.
For months, members of Congress, housing activists and Democratic state attorneys general have campaigned for Mr. Obama to replace Mr. DeMarco, who has blocked an administration proposal to allow underwater homeowners -- those who own more on their loans than their house is worth -- to reduce the principal on their mortgages.
Such principal reductions could save Fannie and Freddie money by reducing the rate of homeowner default and foreclosure, and many Democrats argue that it would be an important salve for the broader housing market. But the plan might end up costing the taxpayers money, as the Treasury Department would pay increased incentives to Fannie and Freddie to get them to participate.
Mr. DeMarco has argued that he is responsible for protecting taxpayers writ large, and not just for fixing Fannie and Freddie's books -- and thus he has resisted the White House plan. That has stoked liberal frustration with the White House for allowing Mr. DeMarco to remain at the helm of the housing agency.
Mr. Watt looks certain to face a confirmation fight. A prior White House nominee for the position, Joseph A. Smith Jr., a North Carolina banking commissioner, failed to win the support of the Senate. Many Republican members of Congress have expressed skepticism about the principal-reduction plan because it might cost taxpayers money and might make homeowners more likely to default on their mortgages.
Still, Mr. Watt is well known in Congress, and sits on the powerful House Financial Services Committee. He is also known for promoting lending to low-income and minority borrowers, but is not considered unfriendly to banks: financial firms and insurers are among his biggest donors, in no small part because Charlotte, part of which is in Mr. Watt's district, is a major banking center. Should Mr. Watt fail to win Senate confirmation, the White House could name him as a recess appointment.

HEADLINE: Some Retailers Rethink Roles In Bangladesh

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Ever since a building with garment factories collapsed in Bangladesh last week, killing more than 400 people, Western apparel companies with ties to the country have scrambled to address public concerns about working conditions there.
Benetton repeatedly revised its accounts of goods produced at one of the factories, while officials at Gap, the Children's Place and other retailers huddled to figure out how to improve conditions, and some debated whether to remain in Bangladesh at all.
At least one big American company, however, had already decided to leave the country -- pushed by the last devastating disaster, a fire just six months ago that killed 112 people.
The Walt Disney Company, considered the world's largest licenser with sales of nearly $40 billion, in March ordered an end to the production of branded merchandise in Bangladesh. A Disney official told The New York Times on Wednesday that the company had sent a letter to thousands of licensees and vendors on March 4 setting out new rules for overseas production. 
Less than 1 percent of the factories used by Disney's contractors are in Bangladesh, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The company's efforts had accelerated because of the November fire at a factory that labor advocates asserted had made Disney apparel. The Disney ban also extends to other countries, including Pakistan, where a fire last September killed 262 garment workers.
Disney's move reflects the difficult calculus that companies with operations in countries like Bangladesh are facing as they balance profit and reputation against the backdrop of a wrenching human disaster.
Bangladesh has some of the lowest wages in the world, its government is eager to lure Western companies and their jobs, and many labor groups want those big corporations to stay to improve conditions, not cut their losses and run.
But as the recent string of disasters has shown, there are great perils to operating there.
''These are complicated global issues and there is no 'one size fits all' solution,'' said Bob Chapek, president of Disney Consumer Products. ''Disney is a publicly held company accountable to its shareholders, and after much thought and discussion we felt this was the most responsible way to manage the challenges associated with our supply chain.''
The public disclosure of Disney's directive came two days after officials from two dozen retailers and apparel companies, including Walmart, Gap, Carrefour and Li & Fung, met near Frankfurt with representatives from the German government and nongovernment organizations to try to negotiate a plan to ensure safety at the more than 4,000 garment factories in Bangladesh.
With 3.6 million garment workers and more than $18 billion in apparel exports last year, Bangladesh is the world's second-largest apparel exporter after China.
Walmart, Gap and other companies said on Wednesday that they were already taking action, including paying for Bangladesh factory managers to be trained in fire safety. But labor advocacy groups are pushing them to do more, especially to help finance factory improvements like fire escapes.
''Companies feel tremendous pressure now,'' said Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a factory-monitoring group based in Washington. ''The apparel brands and retailers face a greater level of reputation risk of being associated with abusive and dangerous conditions in Bangladesh than ever before.''
On Wednesday, thousands of people continued to gather around the collapsed Rana Plaza building in Savar, a suburb of Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital. As emergency personnel dug through the rubble for yet another day, many relatives of the missing carried signs, holding out diminishing hope that a loved one would be found. A mass burial of unclaimed bodies was conducted as the death count climbed above 400.
In Rome, Pope Francis voiced sympathy for Bangladeshi garment workers on Wednesday, saying he was shocked to learn that many of them earned just $40 a month. ''This is called slave labor,'' he said.
European Union officials called for immediate safety improvements, and said they were considering changes in Bangladesh's duty-free and quota-free status to encourage more responsible management by the country's garment industry.
With some labor groups urging Western companies to stay and fix problems rather than leave, Disney said in its letter to licensees that it would pursue ''a responsible transition that mitigates the impact to affected workers and business.'' It set out a yearlong transitional period for its contractors to phase out production in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Belarus, Ecuador and Venezuela by March 31, 2014.
In that letter, Josh Silverman, executive vice president for global licensing for Disney Consumer Products, wrote that because Disney did not do manufacturing itself and licensed its brand for so many goods produced in so many countries, ''we must rely more heavily upon our licensees and vendors to help ensure working conditions that are consistent with Disney's standards.''
In deciding in which countries to permit production, the company relied heavily on the World Bank's Governing Indicators, which evaluate performance on issues like government effectiveness, rule of law, accountability and control of corruption. Disney decided to prohibit production in several dozen countries that had a combined low score on the World Bank indicators.
Western retailers and brands that sell apparel made in Bangladesh say they use only factories that monitoring firms have inspected and approved. One prominent monitoring group, the Business Social Compliance Initiative, based in Brussels, has acknowledged that it had approved two of the factories inside Rana Plaza, although it said its inspections did not consider the structural soundness of the building.
Kalpona Akter, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity, said on Wednesday that her country's government building inspectors were so ineffectual that it was vital that Western companies make sure that their inspectors also examined the structural integrity of factory buildings.
Adam M. Kanzer, managing director and general counsel at Domini Social Investments, praised Disney's move.
''Disney is trying to focus their effort where they feel they have sufficient leverage and buying power and where they're really involved,'' he said. ''They don't have much of a presence in Bangladesh. At the same time, I feel that Western companies that have a significant economic presence in Bangladesh should stay there and try to fix these problems.''
After the Tazreen fire last November, Bangladeshi labor groups said they had found Disney-brand apparel and production documents inside the factory. Disney officials deny that any licensees had production there.
On Wednesday, Kevin Gardner, a Walmart spokesman, said his company ''has been advocating for improved fire safety with the Bangladeshi government, with industry groups and with suppliers.'' He added, ''We know that continued engagement is critical to ensure that reliable, proactive measures are in place to reduce the chance of factory fires.''
The Children's Place, a New Jersey-based apparel chain of 1,100 stores that obtains about 15 percent of its total goods from Bangladesh, said it was working with Bangladeshi officials, retailers and nongovernment organizations to avoid future safety problems. The company said it ''will be active in supporting important, systemic reform.''
The Disney letter listed 172 countries where it would allow its contractors to produce branded merchandise, emblazoned with popular characters like Wreck-it Ralph, Buzz Lightyear, the Little Mermaid and Mickey Mouse, as well as toys and other goods. But in 101 of those countries, it said it would let licensees do production only if independent monitors approved the factories.
A Disney official said production in Haiti and Cambodia would be allowed only in factories cooperating with the Better Work program, a partnership of the International Labor Organization and the International Finance Corporation, that works with government officials, factory owners and labor groups to ensure safe and decent workplace conditions.
The Disney official said the company would consider permitting its licensees to again produce in Bangladesh and Pakistan if those countries get the Better Work program to help their factories.
Dan Rees, director of Better Work, said that before his group would get involved in Bangladesh, the country needed to enact stronger labor protections and stop suppressing trade unions.
''Disney has sent a strong message to the excluded countries that if they're willing to take responsibility for labor standards, Disney will take another look at them in the future,'' he said.

HEADLINE: One Big Workbench

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
Under different circumstances, or in some earlier America, Yair Silbermintz might have spent his weekday evenings tinkering with a soldering iron alone in the basement of a suburban ranch house.
But Mr. Silbermintz, 27, lives with his wife in a one-bedroom apartment in Fair Lawn, N.J. And though he works as a Web developer for a Manhattan publisher, in this uncertain economy he is unlikely to increase his square-footage anytime soon to indulge his interest in electronics. So on a recent night he could be found at MakerBar, a hacker space in an old factory in Hoboken, N.J.
Mr. Silbermintz has been coming to MakerBar for months on dedicated nights when the club opens to the public. Still, as he stood in the raw, loft-like space, he seemed in awe of the workbenches bustling with people, the metal shelves crammed with supplies, the cool (and costly) tools available for use, like a drill press and a 3-D printer.
''I really wanted a 3-D printer,'' Mr. Silbermintz said later. ''I tried to find a way to get one, I looked at buying a used model, but it's so expensive.'' 
Since he discovered MakerBar, however, it doesn't matter. ''I walked in and thought: 'Oh, they have this. Oh, they have that.' I finally have the ability to make the things I want to. I don't need to find a workplace and buy tools and do all that management.'''
Hacker spaces like MakerBar -- where people gather to build or take things apart, from rockets to circuit boards to LED displays -- are hives of innovation, real-world communities made possible by the emergence of virtual communities.
Businesses like Pinterest and MakerBot have grown out of hacker spaces, which have become networking venues for engineers and inventors. But at their most basic level, the 200 or so hacker spaces across the country function as a modern stand-in for the home workshop, especially in urban areas.
It's no accident that some of the earliest and most popular hacker spaces, like Noisebridge in San Francisco and NYC Resistor in Brooklyn, are in cities where living spaces tend to be small, real estate is expensive and having a home workshop is a pipe dream for all but the very lucky or very wealthy.
''The 1950s version of tinkering was doing it in your garage,'' said Dale Dougherty, who as the founder of Make magazine and its popular get-togethers known as Maker Faires is a patron saint to the hacker community. ''A lot of people in urban settings don't have that.''
''Sometimes these hacker spaces are not much bigger than a garage,'' he said. ''But people can't organize their home into a workshop.''
Sean Auriti, a Web developer who in his off-hours experiments with lasers and other electronics, knows the limitations of trying to carve out work space in a New York apartment. Mr. Auriti used to tinker at home, he said, but ''when I met my girlfriend, she didn't really want my tools lying out.''
''I put my toolbox in the closet,'' he said, ''and it was very inaccessible. I just didn't feel like I had room to grow.''
In 2009, Mr. Auriti was a founder of Alpha One Labs, a hacker space in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where he is known as psytek. Like many hacker spaces, Alpha One charges dues (in this case, $60 a month) and lets members use the work space and its tools whenever they like. Until a hacker space opened in Connecticut, one member from that state was driving two hours each weekend to Alpha One, Mr. Auriti said.
Access to space, he added, has ''been the common thing with people that join.''
But there are reasons beyond additional space that it might be better not to build or tear things apart at home. Laser cutters are prized within the maker community, but they run the risk of catching on fire, said Georgia Guthrie, who belongs to the Hacktory, a hacker space in Philadelphia. ''You have to have a fire extinguisher near them at all times,'' she said.
Or consider Kushal Mukherjee, a MakerBar member who is an information technology consultant for TD Ameritrade. He lives in a condo in nearby Weehawken, and collects vintage Mercedes-Benz cars and modifies their electronics. But, he said, ''I just spent $10,000 on my wood floors. I don't feel like putting wires everywhere.''
So on a recent Friday night, Mr. Mukherjee was at MakerBar, collaborating with another member, Zack Freedman, to hack a car stereo system.
Around them a variety of projects were in progress, from high-tech to crafty. Luke Krill, a freelance video producer from Morristown, N.J., was in a back corner, working on a prototype of a remote-control system for the tiny mounted video cameras used in television production. Christine Curatolo, who runs Jumblzar, an online marketplace where baby gear is bought and sold, and Cara Albanese, a graphic designer, sat across the workbench from Mr. Freedman and his circuit boards, making a necklace holder from a piece of driftwood and sea glass.
Though men are vastly in the majority here, there's an effort within the hacker community to reach out to women, who are increasingly joining and, in some cases, running hacker spaces. Ms. Albanese and Ms. Curatolo were first-time visitors, and while they admitted their craft project could have been made at home, they said they wanted to meet other makers and try new tools, like the drill press and soldering iron. ''It's fun to be here,'' Ms. Curatolo said. ''This reminds me of shop class in seventh grade.''
From Hoboken to San Francisco to Shanghai, you will encounter a similar scene at other hacker spaces on any given night. Though each is unique to itself and its location, said Mitch Altman, a founder of Noisebridge in San Francisco, ''you know you're in a hacker space.'' He added: ''Usually they're kind of funky looking. Not always, though. Some are high-tech.''
Most hacker spaces are clubs that work by pooling members' resources, from rent money to knowledge and equipment. ''Even if you have some cool tools,'' Mr. Altman said, ''you don't have all the cool tools that are available when you have shared resources.''
Among the tools commonly found in hacker spaces are laser cutters, 3-D printers, miter saws and other woodworking tools, esoteric electronics like spectrophotometers and the tiny single-chip computers known as microcontrollers. And almost always there are back issues of Make magazine, the bible of the hacker set.
Sometimes there's a kitchen, as at Noisebridge. Often you'll see old toys, TVs and other random items lying around that have been brought in and hacked in odd or interesting ways.
Indeed, one of the benefits of belonging to a hacker space is that it can help de-clutter your home, as Mr. Altman can attest. A reformed pack rat, he lives in a ''very small but totally wonderful'' studio apartment in San Francisco. ''There are times when I've seen something on the street that, in the old days, I would have taken in,'' he said, citing as examples a sewing machine or a junked computer. ''Now I take it to Noisebridge. It doesn't have to be something I can use, just something I think others can use.''
The atmosphere at a hacker space is a bit like finding yourself in an episode of ''The Big Bang Theory.'' There is unabashed geeking-out on science and technology, and an enthusiasm for making that is infectious.
On a recent night at Crash Space, a hacker space in a crowded little bungalow on Venice Boulevard in Culver City, Calif., a bespectacled computer scientist named Naim Busek giddily showed off his Levitating Water Fountain. A collaboration between Mr. Busek and another Crash Space member, the project uses colored LEDs, a microcontroller and a strobing effect to create the illusion that water droplets are floating through space.
''In the Arduino Mega, on one of the counters in there, you can actually set three different match registers,'' Mr. Busek said, speaking in a jargon-filled programmer talk that, translated for the lay person, meant, ''This project is super cool.''
As he walked through the small workrooms, each one heaped with gear and with someone inside focused on their project or assisting others, Mr. Busek said: ''This is really the workshop we all wish we had at home. There's so much energy here.''
It's this sense of like-mindedness that is the real connecting thread at hacker spaces, Mr. Altman said. ''It's a community supporting people in exploring and doing what they love. That's the main thing, and you can feel it.''
Visit Noisebridge one evening (or at any other time of the day or night, since it's open 24-7) and you begin to question the point of a home workshop, even if there is enough space. The 5,200-square-foot hacker space in a former sewing factory in the Mission District is run as an anarchist collective, so anyone is welcome to use any of the available tools, which include 3-D printers, oscilloscopes and an EEG machine someone hauled up the rickety steps.
''This is everybody's space,'' said Praveen Sinha, an early member who stopped by on a recent weeknight, as he often does. ''We're a do-ocracy.''
Mr. Sinha, a software engineer, said someone taught him how to solder circuits here, something he thought he would need to attend a community college to learn. ''It's a different education model,'' said Mr. Sinha, who recently started Liberating Ourselves Locally, another hacker space, to serve East Oakland.
At a long table, four guys with laptops were trading ideas. The kitchen had been the site of fermented food experiments. In a back nook, a dozen or so people were huddled around tables at a class on making LED bike lights. One of the attendees, Doug Raymond, a retired electrical engineer, had never been to Noisebridge, but within minutes found himself helping a young woman operate a soldering iron and making discoveries about ''blinky things,'' as he called LEDs.
The scene brought to mind an observation from Mr. Dougherty, of Make magazine, about tinkering at a hacker space versus at home. ''The big value is community,'' he said. ''A hobby starts as a very personal thing. As soon as you express that interest, you begin meeting people who share that interest. It can really help with motivation.''
Mr. Raymond had a simpler way of putting it. Glancing around Noisebridge, which was vibrating with creative energy even on a quiet Friday night, he said, ''It looks like a place where you can get some stuff done.''

HEADLINE: A Mortgage Agency Pick Is Likely to Cause Conflict

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS and ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
President Obama's overhaul of the mortgage market has been a long time coming.
But he took a significant step forward on Wednesday, announcing his intention to nominate a new director for an agency that plays a crucial role in the housing market.
The president tapped Representative Melvin L. Watt, a Democrat of North Carolina, to become the new director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Mr. Watt has advocated for strong measures to provide relief to struggling homeowners, including reducing how much borrowers owe on their mortgages. 
''Mel understands as well as anybody what caused the housing crisis,'' President Obama said on Wednesday. ''He knows what it's going to take to help responsible homeowners fully recover.''
Still, Mr. Watt's nomination will most likely inflame long-running political battles over how much the government should do to make mortgages available and support homeowners. Most immediately, Republican senators opposed to Mr. Watt's housing stances might try to hold up his confirmation.
''I could not be more disappointed in this nomination,'' Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.
As director of the housing agency, Mr. Watt would oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two taxpayer-owned mortgage finance giants that have provided enormous support to the housing market since the financial crisis of 2008. They guaranteed two-thirds of all the mortgages made last year.
The Obama administration wants to reduce government involvement but has made almost no big moves in that direction. Some critics question its resolve to scale back the role of Fannie and Freddie, which received one of the biggest bailouts of the financial crisis. They say Mr. Watt's nomination looks like tactical maneuvering, designed in part to placate progressives in Congress who say the president has done too little to help homeowners.
''It seems like a political move when a substantive one is needed,'' said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody's Analytics who has focused on housing, was also a candidate to lead the housing agency. Mr. Zandi, ''seemed to be a perfect nominee,'' said Mr. Swagel, who was an assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
Consumer advocates are upset that Mr. Obama did not long ago remove Edward DeMarco, the current head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. He effectively stopped Fannie and Freddie from cutting loan balances for stressed homeowners. Last year, Mr. DeMarco argued that such a program ''would not make a meaningful improvement in reducing foreclosures in a cost-effective way for taxpayers.''
Reducing mortgage balances could be the issue that draws the most scrutiny for Mr. Watt during the confirmation process.
Given the level of controversy around this policy, some mortgage market analysts questioned on Wednesday why the White House had nominated someone who has identified so closely with it.
But Gene B. Sperling, an assistant to the president on economic policy, said the administration stood behind Mr. Watt's support for cutting mortgage balances. ''That's our position, and we're not going to disqualify someone for agreeing with us,'' he said.
In an interview, Mr. Watt said that, as director of the agency, he would be obliged to take into account the risk of losses to taxpayers from writing down mortgages.
''My role would be to look at this from all sides, from the homeowner's perspective and the taxpayer's perspective,'' he said. ''There are a lot of things I might have to approach differently as a director of this agency.''
Those in favor of cutting mortgages received some support on Wednesday. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a study showing that reducing the amounts borrowers owe could actually save taxpayers money by reducing the chance underwater homeowners would default and end up in foreclosure, thus causing losses to Fannie and Freddie, which own or guarantee more than half of all residential mortgages. But other analyses suggest that the approach is not a silver bullet. About one-third of borrowers who had their mortgage balances reduced by more than 20 percent went back into default within two years, according to a study by Fitch Ratings.
Despite the mortgage relief questions, Mr. Watt may still gain support in the Senate for his nomination. He is well known in Congress and sits on the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Some Republicans may vote for him.
''Having served with Mel, I know of his commitment to sustainable federal housing programs and am confident he will work hard to protect taxpayers from future exposure to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,'' Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said in a statement.
While Mr. Watt is known for promoting lending to low-income and minority borrowers, he is not considered unfriendly to banks. Financial firms and insurers are among his biggest donors, in no small part because Charlotte, part of which is in Mr. Watt's district, is a banking center.
Still, many members of Congress and analysts are eager to reduce the government's role in housing, and feel Mr. Watt may not push hard enough to curtail the activities of Fannie and Freddie.
''It's coming up on five years and nothing has happened,'' said Edward Pinto, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
But Mr. Watt says he's firmly behind the administration's plans to have the government largely withdraw from the housing market.
''I've indicated in committee that I am committed to finding a new model, and that model includes winding down Fannie and Freddie,'' he said. As director of the housing agency, ''I'd be ideally situated to facilitate that.''
Should Mr. Watt fail to win Senate confirmation, the White House could name him as a recess appointment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China Data Confirms Slowdown in Factories

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Growth in the mainland Chinese manufacturing sector unexpectedly slowed in April as new export orders fell, data released Wednesday showed, raising fresh doubts about the strength of the economy after a disappointing first quarter.
The official purchasing managers' index fell to 50.6 in April from an 11-month high in March of 50.9. A reading above 50 indicates expansion; below indicates contraction. Analysts had expected the April reading to be 51.
The reading mirrored a similar decline in a preliminary P.M.I. report last week by the British bank HSBC, suggesting that China's export engine faces obstacles resulting from the euro zone recession and sluggish U.S. growth. 
China's new leadership has signaled it will step up infrastructure investment, which analysts said would provide support for the economy in the second quarter.
''Over all, my general feel is that China is growing, but slower than people expected, say, a month ago,'' said Alvin Pontoh, economist at TD Securities in Singapore.
''But I don't think this is reason for alarm,'' he added. ''This is probably what the new administration is looking for. Structurally, China cannot grow at 9 or 10 percent any more, so over the next few years, you'd reasonably expect growth to edge lower -- to, say, 7 percent or so.''
Global data, including lower-than-expected U.S. economic growth figures, have dented the optimism at the start of the year that the world economy was picking up.
Market reaction to the P.M.I. was muted, as many countries in Asia and Europe were marking the Labor Day holiday. Chinese markets were closed and were scheduled to reopen Thursday.
The official P.M.I. figures showed that a subindex of new orders had fallen to 51.7 in April from 52.3 in March, holding above 50. However, the index of new export orders fell to 48.6 from 50.9 in March, suggesting the orders were shrinking.
The input price subindex fell to 40.1 in April, its lowest in at least four years.
''The dip in April P.M.I. shows that the foundation for China's economic recovery is still not solid,'' Zhang Liqun, an economist at the Development Research Center, a government agency in Beijing, said in an e-mailed statement accompanying the index.
''All these show the possibility for China's growth to slow slightly in the future. We must work to stabilize domestic demand and make our economic recovery more sustainable,'' he said.
HSBC's preliminary P.M.I. for April fell to 50.5, from 51.6 in March, as new export orders shrank. The final reading is scheduled to be published Thursday.
The latest P.M.I. adds risks to market expectations that China's annual economic expansion will pick up to 8 percent in the April-to-June quarter after slipping in the January-to-March period to 7.7 percent, from 7.9 percent in the previous quarter.
Zhiwei Zhang, a China economist at the Japanese bank Nomura, said in a client note before the release of the P.M.I. figures that he expected growth to ease again in the second quarter, to 7.5 percent.
Apart from expectations of more infrastructure investment, the central bank is expected to hold rates steady throughout 2013, as it needs to tread a delicate balance between inflation and growth, a Reuters poll showed.
''We still expect major activity indicators to show a moderate growth recovery in April'' and in the second quarter, Ting Lu, a China economist in Hong Kong for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a note to clients. ''On policies, we expect overall monetary and fiscal policies to remain accommodative, though we see no need for significant stimulus.''
Beijing is aiming for economic growth of 7.5 percent in 2013, lower than the double-digit levels in most years in the past three decades, as it tries to shift the economy to reduce reliance on exports and more towards consumption.

HEADLINE: China Is Seen Nearing U.S.'s Military Power in Region

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- China's growing industrial might is likely to allow it to mount an increasingly formidable challenge to the military supremacy of the United States in the waters around China that include Japan and Taiwan, though it will probably seek to avoid an outright armed conflict, according to a detailed new report by a group of American researchers.
The report by the nine researchers, published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the most likely outcome for the next two decades showed China narrowing the gap with the United States in military abilities, in areas including building aircraft carriers and stealth fighter jets. At the same time, the report, to be released Friday, said China's economic interdependence with the United States and the rest of Asia would probably prevent it from becoming a full-blown, cold-war-style foe, or from using military force to try to drive the United States from the region. 
One of the authors, Michael D. Swaine, an expert on Chinese defense policy, called the report one of the first attempts to predict the longer-term consequences of China's rise for a region whose growing economic prosperity has been largely a result of the peace and stability brought by American military hegemony. He said one conclusion was that the appearance of a new rival meant that, for better or for worse, the current American-dominated status quo might not last much longer.
''We wanted to ask, how should the United States deal with this possibility?'' said Mr. Swaine, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment, based in Washington. ''Can the United States continue with business as usual in the western Pacific, or must it start thinking of alternative ways to reassure the region about security?''
The other authors included scholars, former government officials and other Carnegie analysts.
The report, an advance copy of which was seen by The New York Times, said the consequences of the region's shifting strategic balance might be felt most strongly by Japan, an Asian economic power that has long relied for its security on its alliance with the United States. The report found that in most projections, Japan would probably respond to China's growing power by clinging more closely to the United States, as it has done recently during a heated argument with China over islands in the East China Sea that both countries claim. At the same time, despite the stance of its hawkish new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Japan's fiscal troubles and political paralysis will probably prevent it from significantly bolstering military spending, as some in Washington have hoped it will do to help offset China's increasing capabilities, the report said.
In the most extreme instances, the report predicted, doubts about the ability or commitment of the United States to remain the region's dominant military power could one day grow strong enough to drive Japan to more drastic measures, like either embracing China or building its own independent deterrent, including nuclear weapons.
For the whole region, the report found the most likely outcome to be what it called an ''eroding balance'' -- essentially, a continuation of the current situation, in which American hegemony is slowly undermined by China's increasing military abilities and growing willingness to assert its interests. The report said the biggest risk in this environment would be an accidental escalation of a limited dispute, like the current clash with Japan over the disputed islands.
At the same time, the report said that for the foreseeable future, China would not follow the former Soviet Union in becoming a global rival to the United States. Rather, it said, China would remain a regional power with a narrow strategic focus on territorial disputes with its immediate neighbors. Even so, the report warned, that would still make it a serious challenge to the United States, which has vowed to increase its military presence in Asia despite budget cuts.
''Can the United States maintain its primacy of the past 60 years?'' asked Mr. Swaine. ''The United States says so, but whether it actually can is not entirely clear.''

HEADLINE: North Korea Imposes Term Of 15 Years On American

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Thursday that its Supreme Court had sentenced an American citizen to 15 years of hard labor for committing hostile acts against its government. 
The citizen, Kenneth Bae, 44, a Korean-American from Washington State who ran a tour business out of China, was arrested in the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea in November after leading a group of businessmen there from Yanji, China. On Saturday, the North said it was indicting him on charges that he tried to overthrow Pyongyang's government.
On Thursday, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said the Supreme Court had sentenced Mr. Bae during a hearing Tuesday. The court convicted him of ''hostile acts,'' a charge less grave than the original charge that prosecutors pressed. The crime of trying to overthrow the government could have resulted in the death penalty.
Under North Korean law, Mr. Bae should be transferred to a labor camp within 10 days of the ruling.
The ruling came amid high tensions between Pyongyang and Washington and could complicate Washington's diplomatic balancing act as it tries to hold a tough line with North Korea over its nuclear program.
South Korean human rights advocates have said that Mr. Bae not only ran tours to North Korea but also was interested in helping orphans there. They said security officials in the North may have been offended by pictures of orphans that Mr. Bae had taken and stored in his computer.
North Korea has often used the plight of detained Americans as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Washington. Some were freed only after former American presidents traveled to the North to seek their release.
In 2009, North Korea arrested two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who it said had entered illegally and committed ''hostile acts.'' They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor, but were released five months later, after former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, the North's capital, and met with Kim Jong-il, the leader at the time.
The North has been locked in a standoff with the United States and South Korea since detonating a nuclear bomb in February. Some analysts say the nation's leader, Kim Jong-un, may be chafing at his inability to shift those two countries, which have refused to offer the North aid in order to relieve tensions, from their tough stance.
In January, Bill Richardson, a former American ambassador to the United Nations, tried to see Mr. Bae during a private trip to the North, but he said the government had rebuffed him.

HEADLINE: Expanded Medicaid Raises Use of Care

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Come January, millions of low-income adults will gain health insurance coverage through Medicaid in one of the farthest-reaching provisions of the Obama health care law. How will that change their finances, spending habits, use of available medical services and -- most important -- their health?
New results from a landmark study, released on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, go a long way toward answering those questions. The study, called the Oregon Health Study, compares thousands of low-income people in Oregon who received access to Medicaid with an identical population that did not. 
It found that those who gained Medicaid coverage spent more on health care, making more visits to doctors and trips to the hospital. But the study suggests that Medicaid coverage did not make those adults much healthier, at least within the two-year time frame of the research, judging by their blood pressure, blood sugar and other measures. It did, however, substantially reduce the incidence of depression, and it made them vastly more financially secure.
''There was this view that Medicaid coverage would not do much for the low-income uninsured, either because they had access to charity care or because Medicaid is not good insurance,'' said Amy Finkelstein of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''This rejects that notion entirely.'' Her work on the Oregon study contributed to her receipt last year of the John Bates Clark Medal, a laurel for younger economists considered second only to the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for those in the profession.
Currently about 50 million Americans, nearly all them poor, receive health care coverage under Medicaid, a federal program administered by the states. But most states do not provide Medicaid coverage to adults without disabilities or dependent children, no matter how poor they are.
Health economists anticipate that new enrollees to the Medicaid program will swell the country's health spending costs by hundreds of billions of dollars over time. In 2014, at least 18 states and the District of Columbia will provide coverage to all adults with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line. That currently would translate to coverage for all individuals with incomes below about $15,000 and for households of four people receiving less than about $31,000.
Many more states might join in the expansion in the coming months or years. The Affordable Care Act, President Obama's health care law, has the federal government pay for a large majority of the increased Medicaid costs in perpetuity, making the financial burden on states much smaller.
The unique Oregon study came about when the state found itself with enough money to provide additional Medicaid coverage to about 10,000 low-income adults. Many times that number qualified.
Rather than deny coverage to all Oregonians, the state established a lottery, to distribute coverage randomly. That gave economists and other social scientists a once-in-a-lifetime chance to perform a randomized control experiment -- the gold standard in medical and scientific research, but a rarity in much of social science -- isolating the effect that coverage had on health and broader well-being.
An earlier round of results from the Oregon Health Study analyzed assessments of health and well-being reported by study participants, as well as data from hospitals and credit agencies. This second major set of results stems from biometric data collected at in-person visits with participants. A huge team of researchers collected blood samples, blood pressure readings and weight measurements from thousands of Oregonians; about half of them had won access to Medicaid in a lottery and half had not.
The researchers found that Medicaid coverage did not significantly affect the prevalence or diagnosis of hypertension or high cholesterol, or the use of drugs used to treat those conditions. It significantly increased the probability that a person would receive a diagnosis of diabetes and be treated, though it did not reduce blood sugar levels noticeably.
Where Medicaid seemed to have the strongest measured impact was on depression. Getting Medicaid coverage reduced the probability of a positive screening by more than 30 percent.
''The authors are almost tilting the spin on the story to be a little more pessimistic than I would have been,'' said John Holahan of the Urban Institute, responding to the new findings.
''There are some positive effects on health,'' he said, calling the effect on depression ''especially strong.''
Confirming previous findings released by the researchers, the new round of results found that adults covered by Medicaid increased their use of a broad number of health services, like mammograms and cholesterol tests. That increased their medical spending by about 35 percent, compared to adults who did not win Medicaid coverage in the lottery.
Some researchers had theorized that getting Medicaid coverage would lead to a spike in use of medical services by low-income adults. Once covered, they might visit the doctor, have conditions checked out and treated, then stop using medical services as much.
But the second set of results from the Oregon study shows that is not the case. There is no spike in use of health services, nor is there any decline later on. Rather, use of the health system increased, and that increase persisted between the first year and the second year of the study.
''They go to the doctor more often, they visit the hospital more often, they use more prescription drugs, they are more likely to use preventive care,'' said Katherine Baicker, a Harvard professor, co-author of the study and former economic adviser to President George W. Bush. ''There is no evidence of a spike of utilization from pent-up demand.''

HEADLINE: New Poll Finds Unity on Gun Laws and Immigration, but a Split on Leadership

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and ALLISON KOPICKI

 BODY:
While the public overwhelmingly supports background checks for gun buyers and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, Americans largely retreat into their partisan camps when asked whether President Obama or Congressional Republicans will make the right decisions on those and other domestic issues facing the nation, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
That disconnect could explain why Democrats and Mr. Obama are still struggling to translate public support into tangible political backing for their initiatives. Americans did not give Mr. Obama high marks for his handling of those issues -- even though more than two-thirds of Americans over all, including a majority of Republicans, disapprove of the way Republicans in Congress are handling their job. 
''I'm for stricter gun laws, but the reason I favor the Republicans over the Democrats and the liberals on gun laws is because they have always been against the Second Amendment and the right to own guns,'' said Jim Hensley, 69, a Republican from Grandville, Mich., in an interview after the poll was conducted.
''Yes, I believe the Republicans should have voted for background checks, and they should not legalize automatic weapons,'' Mr. Hensley added. ''I was against the repeal of the ban on automatic weapons, and I don't support the N.R.A. But it's like marriage. You stick with your wife no matter what, and you don't just ditch your political party on one issue.''
Two weeks after a bipartisan measure that would have expanded background checks for gun buyers was defeated in the Senate, nearly 9 in 10 of those surveyed said they favored background checks on all gun buyers, and 6 in 10 said they were disappointed or angry with the vote.
On immigration, 83 percent of respondents said they supported a path to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally, as long as certain requirements -- like paying fines and back taxes, passing a criminal-background check and learning English -- were met. And nearly 6 in 10 favored a combination of cutting spending and raising taxes to reduce the federal deficit, echoing the plans being pushed by Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats.
Yet Americans are closely divided on whether Republicans would handle these issues better than Mr. Obama, the poll showed.
Both stricter gun laws and an immigration overhaul received strong support from Republicans, with 86 percent favoring background checks on all potential gun buyers, and 83 percent favoring a path to citizenship if certain requirements were met. Last month, a bipartisan group of eight senators proposed such immigration legislation, which would offer a 13-year path to citizenship, as well as require certain border security measures.
Only 41 percent of those surveyed approved of Mr. Obama's handling of gun policy, and 52 percent disapproved. Americans were about evenly divided on whom to trust to make decisions about gun laws and an immigration overhaul -- Republicans in Congress or the president.
Rick Buckman, 52, a Republican and an electrical engineer from Dallas, Pa., said that while he supported stricter gun legislation, he did not necessarily approve of the president's approach. ''I was really ticked off that the law didn't pass,'' Mr. Buckman said. ''But I thought it was wrong of President Obama to get in front of the public and use people who had been damaged by gun violence as props.''
Mike Brady, 68, a Democrat and semiretired lawyer in Farmington Hills, Mich., viewed the Republicans' opposition to the gun control legislation as self-serving. ''Well, Obama's trying his best to do the obvious right thing for the country, but he's been roadblocked extensively for political reasons by people who even among themselves would take a different position,'' he said. ''So it's cynical, unprincipled obstructionism.''
The poll also showed that 57 percent disapproved of Mr. Obama's handling of the federal budget deficit. Thirty-six percent of respondents supported reducing the deficit by cutting federal spending.
Though churning support for his agenda remains a problem for the president, according to the poll, Congress is struggling with overcoming its own unfavorable image. Three-quarters of Americans disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job, the poll found, and nearly 9 in 10 said most members of Congress were more concerned with serving special interest groups than helping the people they represent.
''It's like the gladiator sports, where the emperor keeps the people entertained, even though we're starving,'' said Roberta Hughes, 61, of Elizabeth City, N.C. ''But real people are losing out in real ways when they enact the drama.''
The nationwide poll of 965 adults was conducted from April 24 to April 28 on land lines and cellular phones, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Nearly 6 in 10 Americans said they would vote for a candidate who did not share their views of immigration. Only 4 in 10 said they would vote for a candidate who did not share their views on gun control -- seemingly making immigration a less controversial issue at the voting booth, for now, than gun legislation.
''Stricter gun laws might help with some of the out of control people who randomly go around shooting others or killing themselves,'' said Debby Warnock, 44, an independent from Pueblo West, Colo. ''I do favor background checks, though some of the people who have killed others had clean backgrounds.''
She added: ''I personally don't care whether Republicans or Democrats make the decisions as long as it's in the best interest of our country.''

HEADLINE: Immigration Is on Agenda For Obama In Mexico

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Randal C. Archibold from Mexico City.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When President Obama flies across the southern border on Thursday to meet with his Mexican counterpart, the most delicate topic on the agenda will be immigration.
For the first time in two decades, Washington appears headed toward an overhaul of immigration laws that will affect the future of millions of Mexicans who have immigrated, legally and illegally, to the United States over the years. But with a bipartisan group of lawmakers seeking to navigate legislation through Congress this month, White House officials are hoping that Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, treads carefully in any public comments he makes about the issue.
''We've had a good level of dialogue and have kept each other informed about the process, but we've emphasized on our side that this is a domestic political issue, primarily,'' said Ricardo Zuniga, a senior official at the National Security Council. ''It's not an issue where they've tried to become involved in our process, which is something that we very much appreciate.'' 
Mr. Obama's fourth visit to Mexico as president will include his first extended meeting with Mr. Peña Nieto, who assumed office five months ago. After a working dinner on Thursday night, Mr. Obama will travel on Friday to Costa Rica to discuss economic, energy and security issues with a gathering of the region's leaders.
Mexico is the centerpiece of the three-day trip, and Mr. Obama arrives two weeks after Secretary of State John Kerry referred to the hemisphere as the United States's ''backyard,'' a perceived condescension that set off Mexican commentators and others in Latin America.
There is also a growing sense of friction between American and Mexican law enforcement agencies over Mexico's new restrictions on intelligence sharing. Those tensions could reduce the landmark cooperation on drug investigations reached with the previous Mexican administration.
United States security assistance to Mexico is decreasing. Such aid is increasing to Central America and the Caribbean, where drug and organized crime gangs have moved in -- primarily in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala -- and have contributed to skyrocketing violence. Many of those gangs migrated from Mexico as Mexican and American law-enforcement agents clamped down on them.
A senior State Department official said in a recent briefing that one reason assistance to Mexico is declining is that the United States is providing fewer helicopters and other expensive equipment and more training for the police and prosecutors.
Officials on both sides of the border have signaled that the leaders intend to focus publicly on economic cooperation during the meetings. ''The bilateral relationship at least with Mexico has been dominated by drugs and violence,'' said Joshua Meltzer, a scholar at the Brookings Institution. ''I think there is going to be a concerted effort here to refocus attention on the depth and size of the economic relationship.''
Foreign policy observers said they expected Mr. Obama and Mr. Peña Nieto to announce expanded educational and cultural exchanges as well as new economic partnerships aimed at bolstering an improving economy in Mexico.
Trade with Mexico has been increasing as manufacturing recovers from the recession -- Mexican plants help assemble consumer, automotive and aerospace products. Some of that gain has come at China's expense, as manufacturers return or give Mexico another look. Hourly wages are about a fifth lower than China's, according to a report this month by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A decade ago they were nearly three times higher.
That is good news for investors, but the stagnant wages -- and lingering, deep levels of poverty -- have left Mexicans themselves not quite feeling ''Mexico's Moment,'' as Mr. Peña Nieto's public relations people often put it.
On immigration, Mexican officials have kept a relatively low profile in the current debate in the United States. In part, that is because they recall how being vocal during a previous immigration effort in 2007 generated a backlash from conservatives in the United States.

HEADLINE: Showing Grass-Roots Support for Immigration Overhaul

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON; Reporting was contributed by Sarah Garrecht Gassen from Tucson; Rebecca D'Angelo from Richmond, Va.; Rebecca Fairley Raney from Los Angeles; and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of immigrants, Latinos and other supporters of an overhaul of the immigration system turned out on Wednesday for marches, rallies and prayer vigils, hoping to show Congress that momentum is building for a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the country illegally.
Instead of concentrating on large May Day demonstrations, organizers said they had chosen to hold smaller actions in more than 100 cities nationwide to draw more local supporters. 
There were marches in Birmingham, Ala., and Milwaukee, and a rally on the steps of the state Capitol in Denver. In Bozeman, Mont., organizers gave salsa lessons to protesters before marching to the public library.
In Chicago, hundreds of protesters marched through downtown streets, some dressed in stars and stripes and others waving Mexican flags, holding signs that read ''Stop Deportations'' and ''Legalization for All.'' Some, like Luis Moreno, who is 29 and from Mexico, said it was their first time protesting, since they had been hesitant to come out in previous years because of a lack of legal status, but now believed that the political winds were in their favor.
''I think it is time that we come out of the shadows and support what we believe in,'' Mr. Moreno said.
Others in Chicago attributed renewed hope there to the strong turnout by Latino voters in the November election, saying it sent a message to Washington and made them feel more powerful.
''I think many people got afraid to be noticed,'' said Jaime Salgado, 37, an immigrant who works as a bus boy at a city restaurant. ''We didn't have papers, and we didn't want them to know.''
Now, Mr. Salgado said: ''We noticed that they need Latin voters. They know they need us, as we need them.''
In mid-April a bipartisan group of eight senators introduced a sweeping immigration bill, which includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants as well as measures to tighten border security, clear backlogs in the legal immigration system, create new guest worker programs and expand visas for highly skilled immigrants. The measure faces an uphill battle in the Senate, its sponsors acknowledge, and even more uncertain prospects in the House, where many Republicans are reluctant to offer eventual citizenship to immigrants who broke the law.
Addressing the crowd in Chicago, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who is an author of the immigration bill, appealed for unity.
''We have the best chance we've had in 25 years to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year in Washington, D.C.,'' he said.
The May Day events did not begin to approach the size of the demonstrations when immigration legislation was before Congress in 2006 and hundreds of thousands of people turned out in Los Angeles and other cities. Since then, the failure of several immigration bills in Congress and the high rate of deportations by the Obama administration have made many people wary of public protests.
''The big strategy is to point the people power of the movement towards getting Congress to finish the job in 2013,'' said Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, one of the main organizers of Wednesday's events. Mr. Bhargava said immigration groups would focus their efforts on specific lawmakers who could influence the outcome of the vote. People who attended the events Wednesday were asked to send e-mails and make calls to lawmakers on the spot.
In Richmond, Va., about 150 people held a small rally and marched to the headquarters of the Republican Party. In a speech, Jaime Contreras, vice president of a local chapter of the Service Employees International Union, or S.E.I.U., said to Republicans, ''There's no honor in being on the wrong side of history as the last stronghold fighting against civil rights.''
A party official met with a delegation of marchers inside the Republican offices and received a package for Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the majority leader. A union official said the package contained sheaves of data about the contributions of immigrants to Virginia's economy and profiles of immigrant workers in the state.
On the steps of the Capitol in Salem, Ore., Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, received cheers from demonstrators when he signed a bill allowing immigrants in the country illegally to obtain special driver's licenses in the state.
Eliseo Medina, the international secretary-treasurer of the S.E.I.U., monitored the day's activities in what he called ''our war room'' at the union's headquarters in Washington. He said organizers had tried to have activities in many of the nation's 435 Congressional districts.
''We were not particularly looking to have huge events,'' Mr. Medina said. ''We are going for expanding.''
The union and its allies will issue a report card at the end of the year on lawmakers' support for immigration legislation, Mr. Medina said. ''People will know who deserves their support in 2014,'' he said. ''I would dearly love to include some positive marks on Republicans.''
The PICO National Network, an organization of religious activist groups, said they were holding prayer vigils at the district offices of various lawmakers. On Wednesday, they said, vigils were held at offices of three House Republicans: Mike Coffman in Aurora, Colo; Jeff Denham in Modesto, Calif; and Daniel Webster in Winter Garden, Fla.
In downtown Los Angeles, where several thousand people marched, vendors sold the flags of many nations, but most marchers preferred American flags.
Omar Casalas, 26, an immigrant from Mexico who lives in Santa Ana, carried a sign that said, ''Immigrants Create Jobs and Businesses.'' He said he was optimistic about prospects for an immigration overhaul in Congress. ''They have to act, to make things change,'' Mr. Casalas said.
In Tucson, 250 people turned out for a morning march in desert heat. Marchers said the prospect of action in Washington had created an upbeat mood.
Tomás Rodríguez, 41, said he had lived in Tucson for two decades without immigration papers, working in construction. Mr. Rodríguez, who came with his daughter Stephanie, 17, a United States citizen, said he was not afraid to join the march.
''I want to be a citizen,'' he said. ''This is now my country. I've spent 20 years building for Americans. I want people to understand what I'm doing.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Rules Bar Aid to Co-ops Hit by Sandy

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
At the Beverly Hills co-op in Brooklyn, the wallpaper in the lobby is peeling by the yard. The walls themselves show cracks and holes, as if assaulted by a sledgehammer. The boiler is barely sputtering along and may not last the year.
Over all, the 140-unit, seven-story building sustained more than $500,000 in damage from Hurricane Sandy. Even so, it cannot obtain federal aid for repairs.
Since the hurricane, thousands of homeowners have been startled to discover that co-ops are largely barred from federal disaster assistance. The rules have stirred growing criticism from members of Congress from the region, who contend that the system fails to take into account how people live in New York City, where co-ops have flourished.
The lawmakers are calling for the rules to be changed, saying that as severe weather becomes more common, the region will be increasingly shortchanged in disaster aid. 
Under the longstanding policy of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, co-ops are considered businesses, even though they are essentially nonprofit entities set up by property owners.
As a result, co-op boards are prohibited from obtaining grants for common areas, and individual co-op owners cannot seek money for damage to their apartments' walls and floors because those are usually the legal responsibility of the building.
''How can they do that?'' asked Josephine Scarnato, 83, secretary-treasurer at the Beverly Hills, in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood. ''We're not in business. We don't make a profit. We're not providing a service. I think they don't realize what co-ops are.''
FEMA officials said there was nothing they could do unless the law authorizing aid was changed.
The agency also does not provide aid to condominium and homeowners' associations. But individual condo owners can receive assistance for their units, even as individual owners of co-ops cannot.
The disparity hinges on this legal distinction: In a co-op, owners sign leases for the rights to their units, rather than owning them as real property, as the owners of condominium units do.
Co-op owners can receive federal assistance for damage to furniture or other items in their apartments; the aid is similar to that available to renters for uninsured losses.
Nearly 20 percent of the housing units in the storm surge area in New York City were in co-op buildings and an additional 8 percent were in condominiums, according to the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.
The city's Office of Housing Recovery Operations said that at least 120 co-op buildings, with 13,000 apartments, and 368 condominiums, with 7,000 units, sustained flooding and damage to ground floors. Many have boilers and utility rooms that now need extensive repairs.
This dispute over FEMA's rules has flared in the past. After Hurricane Wilma in Florida in 2005, condominium and homeowners' associations lobbied for assistance to pay for removal of storm debris, to no avail, said Donna D. Berger, executive director of Community Advocacy Network, which represents them.
Ms. Berger said homeowners later faced assessments from the associations that pushed some into foreclosure.
''It kind of put communities in a hole, and some never recovered,'' she said.
While neither Congress nor FEMA has responded to such complaints in the past, the issue seems to be coming to a head because New York has such a high concentration of co-ops.
Members of Congress from the New York region said the agency was essentially discriminating against a class of homeowners by interpreting the federal disaster law, called the Stafford Act, too strictly. They said that they would introduce legislation to allow co-ops and condos to obtain aid, but that in the meantime, they were pressuring the agency to relent.
''There's nothing in the Stafford Act that prohibits condos and co-ops from applying for FEMA aid,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''To deny this is wrong.''
Mr. Schumer said he had successfully appealed to the federal housing secretary, Shaun Donovan, to ensure that co-ops and condos would receive money from the $50 billion disaster package approved by Congress. This pool of money is separate from FEMA aid. (Mr. Donovan is a former commissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development.)
But it is not yet clear how much of that money, to be distributed by the states and localities, will go to co-ops and condos.
Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, said he had failed to persuade the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, who oversees FEMA, to change the policy.
Mr. Israel said he sat with her at an inaugural luncheon honoring President Obama in January and explained to her the co-ops' struggles. She was receptive, he said, but word came back later that it would take legislation to include the buildings in the Stafford Act.
Mr. Israel said that his office was drafting legislation, but that he was not optimistic.
''I'm going to have to try to convince the congressman from Kansas whose district was ravaged by a tornado that a resident in a co-op in Queens also deserves disaster aid when a storm ravages his property,'' he said. ''It's going to be difficult.''
Representative Bill Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which oversees FEMA, declined to comment. A spokesman for the committee would say only that it was ''looking broadly'' at ways of overhauling FEMA aid.
A spokesman for the agency, Dan Watson, said it had to follow the law.
''FEMA works one-on-one with disaster survivors to ensure that we provide all assistance for which they are eligible,'' Mr. Watson said. ''Federal law does not permit FEMA to provide financial assistance directly to co-op and condominium associations.''
Co-op residents said the agency seemed confused.
''What are the common areas?'' said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. ''If the roof was damaged or the boiler doesn't work, it means no one can live in the building. Or if it's a spread-out co-op and the trees are down or garages flooded, all of those are common areas. ''
The Lindenwood Gardens Co-op in Howard Beach, Queens, with 312 apartments spread over six acres, had damage to its roofs, boilers, office, community room, rental space and grounds. To pay for repairs, the co-op spent half of its reserves, $300,000, and imposed a one-year assessment of $50 a month to raise $360,000 more. Many retirees and older people have asked to pay $25 a month over two years.
''We agonized because we knew what a financial hardship this would be to our seniors, but we had no choice,'' said Ina Mica, the board president.
The Beverly Hills in Sheepshead Bay borrowed $250,000 to start a triage of repairs to the boiler, elevators and ground-floor apartments, some of which are still not habitable.
In the meantime, unhappy owners are concerned about mold and not being reimbursed for work they did themselves.
''If FEMA gave a co-op $3,000 per apartment, our problems would be over,'' the property manager, Stephen Elbaz, said.

HEADLINE: Racing Industry Eager to See Bill Allowing Usada Oversight

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
Horse racing industry officials said Wednesday that they were eager to see proposed federal legislation that would give the United States Anti-Doping Agency the authority to create a regulatory plan with meaningful penalties to clean up the sport.
The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act was written by Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and Representative Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania, who plan to introduce it when Congress returns to session next week. The act would give the antidoping agency, known as Usada, the authority to develop rules for permitted and prohibited substances, and create testing and stiffer penalty programs for horse racing nationally, replacing the state-by-state system. 
The Jockey Club had Usada's chief executive, Travis Tygart, speak at its annual industry round table. Club representatives and several owners and breeders have had continuing discussions with lawmakers in the past year. The Jockey Club's president, James L. Gagliano, said he was waiting to see the proposed bill.
''The Jockey Club has consistently stated that the overuse of medication endangers our equine and human athletes, threatens the integrity of our sport and erodes consumer confidence in our game,'' he said in a statement. ''We appreciate Congress's continued interest in helping to safeguard the sport of horse racing, in particular with the recent news accounts of the proposed 'Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act.'â[#x20ac][0/00]''
Unlike previous bills, which were not enacted, this one would enable Usada to act as the antidoping body without amending the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 or involve any federal agency or regulation, increasing hopes for its passage. It would be financed by the industry -- racetracks, horsemen groups, breeders and owners -- through either a percentage of the betting handle or a series of fees.
Usada, a nongovernmental organization, is the official antidoping agency for the United States Olympics team and has worked with Major League Baseball and other professional leagues to eliminate performance-enhancing drugs. Its credibility as a vigilant watchdog was enhanced most recently when it was widely credited for its relentless pursuit of the cyclist Lance Armstrong, who earlier this year admitted that he had systematically used drugs during his racing career.
''We look forward to helping the industry clean itself up,'' Tygart said. ''We fully support, and have shown, that the independent model is the only truly effective way to regulate a sport.''
The bill will be introduced after a year in which racing has publicly wrestled with a drug culture that its officials concede is diminishing the sport. A New York Times investigation identified the nation's most dangerous racetracks, showed how a pervasive drug culture put horses and riders at risk and found that 24 horses a week die at America's tracks, a higher rate than in countries where drug use is severely restricted.
''The chronic abuse of racehorses with painkillers and other drugs is dangerous and just plain wrong,'' Udall said. ''Racing groups have promised drug reform for decades, but this bill would bring in real standards and enforcement from an organization with a proven record for cleaning up sports.''
The horse racing industry sustains about 380,000 jobs nationwide, according to Udall's office. Last year, more than $10.8 billion was wagered on American horse racing -- including $133 million on the Kentucky Derby -- and more than 90 percent of it came through off-track or computer wagering across state lines. If states and their industry stakeholders decline to adopt and adhere to Usada's rules and penalties under the proposed bill, they would not be allowed to participate in interstate wagering.
Tygart said his agency had an annual budget of $14 million to regulate and police Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic sports in the United States. The horse racing industry estimates that a total of $35 million is already spent on integrity issues on a state-by-state basis -- money that, according to testimony last year at Congressional hearings, has created an ineffective system in which trainers are not penalized for violations and horses are abused.
''Money can't be an excuse because there is some already out there supporting a flawed, loophole-ridden system,'' Tygart said. ''Unlike any other sport, real money is at stake for the public and real people are impacted. The goal would be to actually return the sport to the beauty we all know is there and ensure that the consumer, or betting public, or just those watching on television would know that it was a level playing field.''
Horse racing officials have taken significant steps to clean up their sport. Eight states recently agreed to operate their racetracks under one set of rules that severely restrict the administration of medication.
The states across the Mid-Atlantic region, including New York, winnowed what had long been an unruly list of medications to only 24 that will be allowed to treat illness and injuries in racehorses. Those drugs will be subject to strict limitations, and the laboratories conducting drug tests must be accredited under standards created by the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium, which conducts medication and drug-testing research for the industry.
''We are encouraged by the significant progress the industry has made on the safety and integrity front over the past several years,'' said Alex Waldrop, the president and chief executive of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.
But Udall and Pitts said there needed to be more sweeping and severe rules in place to restore public confidence in horse racing.
''Last year, I chaired a hearing that took a deep look into the problems of both legal and illegal drugs in horse racing,'' Pitts said. ''We heard testimony about how abuse of drugs is killing horses and imperiling riders. Before more people and animals are hurt, we need to put a responsible national authority in charge of cleaning up racing. This is a sensible, bipartisan measure to restore trust in racing and protect lives.''

To the Editor:
Re ''As Jobs Lag, Fed Is Viewed as Unlikely to Do More'' (Business Day, April 30): 
Economists already have a well-known tool -- the full-employment or cyclically adjusted budget -- to assess whether the federal budget is expansionary or contractionary: the mix of tax and expenditure policy, under conditions of full employment.
Despite the Republican initiative to alter the Federal Reserve's mandate, perhaps our monetary authorities need a similar tool to assess its interest rate policy that would be tied to the labor force participation rate at full employment, though adjusted for the known continuing demographic changes in the economy.

HEADLINE: Shell Makes a Heavy Bet On a Boom in Natural Gas

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- As Big Oil increasingly becomes Big Gas, no major petroleum player may have more at stake in the shift than Royal Dutch Shell.
More than any of its rivals, Royal Dutch Shell, which will report its quarterly results on Thursday, is betting its future on the business of bringing natural gas from remote locations like Qatar to energy-hungry destinations like China and Japan.
And while analysts expect the results to show a sharp decline from last year's first quarter, in part because of disruptions in its Nigerian gas operations, many experts say Shell may eventually show big benefits from its natural gas emphasis.
Increasingly, to make gas a global commodity, companies supercool it into a liquid form for transport on specialized ships. Shell has already invested about $40 billion in liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., production plants, storage terminals and related systems, and plans to continue pumping money into that business. 
Shell now has about 7 percent of the world L.N.G. business, with ambitions to more than double that share through new projects and acquisitions. Last year, L.N.G. and related businesses earned Shell $9.4 billion of its $25.1 billion in profit.
''We are in the lead, and we want to stay in the lead,'' Andrew Brown, Shell's head of international exploration and production, said in a mid-April interview. Mr. Brown said Shell expected global demand for L.N.G. to grow rapidly in the coming years, doubling by 2025 to about 500 million tons a year, the equivalent of about 4.5 billion barrels of oil, making it by far the fastest-growing fuel.
The main reason for the anticipated growth is that natural gas is abundant. And because of the U.S shale gas boom, it has become relatively cheap -- especially in North America, where prices lately have been in the range of $4 per million British thermal units, compared with highs of $13 as recently as 2005. The European spot price is around $10 per million B.T.U.'s, and the Asian price around $15; contract prices, often linked to oil, may be higher.
And because it burns much cleaner than either coal or oil, it will very likely stay in favor because its use can help lower the greenhouse gas emissions that are blamed for causing global warming.
To Mr. Brown's frustration, not everyone gets the message. That is one reason Shell's big L.N.G. bet is no sure thing.
The United States has wholeheartedly embraced gas. But Europe, mired in economic doldrums, has turned to coal, which is less expensive. This has driven down demand for gas in the region, which in recent decades had been one of the world's biggest markets for natural gas via pipelines and L.N.G.
Europe does not have ''the right balance'' in terms of promoting gas, Mr. Brown said. About 75 percent of Shell's L.N.G. goes to Asia.
As much as anyone, Mr. Brown is responsible for making Shell a gas broker to the world. Before taking his current job, Mr. Brown presided over more than $20 billion in investments in gargantuan installations for turning the extensive gas deposits in Qatar's North Field into exports in the form of L.N.G. and liquid fuels like diesel.
To build on its lead, Shell agreed in February to buy the L.N.G. business of the Spanish company Repsol for about $6.7 billion. Some industry analysts considered the price too high. But according to Repsol, Shell had to outbid more than dozen competing offers.
The impact of Shell's L.N.G. investments on the company's financial performance will, of course, fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The first-quarter results on Thursday are expected to be hurt by a shutdown at a Nigerian L.N.G. plant caused by sabotage. And yet, Shell's quarter was probably helped by high L.N.G. prices in Japan, which continues to import large quantities of gas since the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in 2011.
Analysts' consensus forecast anticipates that Shell will report adjusted net profit of $6 billion for the quarter, an 8 percent gain over the preceding quarter, but an 18 percent decline from a year earlier, according to Peter Hutton of RBC Capital Markets in London.
On Tuesday, one of Shell's main rivals, BP, reported a first-quarter profit of $4.2 billion after adjusting for inventory changes and one-time items, which handily beat analysts' forecasts. BP, though, continues to emphasize its oil business.
Over the longer run, being a big player in L.N.G. is likely to help Shell outearn its peers, predicted Martijn Rats, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. The huge upfront investments of several billion dollars per gas liquefaction plant might seem prohibitive, Mr. Rats said, but those projects ''generate large amounts of operating cash flow over two or three decades.''
While L.N.G. projects may not have as high potential returns as some oil fields, it is less risky to build giant gas installations because much of the output is sold in advance and the plants require relatively little capital expenditure once up and running. The steady cash from L.N.G., which at current prices produces profit margins of 10 percent to 15 percent, can be used to finance riskier activities.
One risk for Shell is that an anticipated export surge from North America leads to a plunge in the much higher prices for gas in Europe and Asia.
''Assuming that there are large volumes of L.N.G. exports from North America, the price differences between U.S. and Asia and especially U.S. and European gas are likely to be substantially reduced,'' said Christopher Goncalves, an analyst at the Berkeley Research Group in Washington. But Mr. Goncalves said the differences would probably not disappear, because shipping and liquefaction added several dollars to the cost of L.N.G.
Shell is trying to further stoke demand for L.N.G. by making it easier to use the chilled gas as a transportation fuel. In Europe, the company recently chartered two L.N.G.-powered tanker barges to ply the busy Rhine waterway. It appears to be a first step in trying to persuade shippers to shift to L.N.G.-powered craft to transport diesel fuel or gasoline. According to the barges' maker, Peters Shipyards in the Netherlands, they emit 25 percent less carbon dioxide than their oil-powered counterparts, while running much quieter.
Europe is tightening regulations on emissions from shipping, particularly in inland waterways, Mr. Rats said, and L.N.G.-powered ships are an economically sound means of complying. Last year Shell bought a Norwegian company, Gasnor, that supplies L.N.G. fuel to ships as a fuel. Shell is also building operations to provide fuel for L.N.G.-powered trucks along a route in western Canada and has plans to do the same in the United States.
So far the use of L.N.G. in transportation is negligible; about 16 million cars and trucks are powered by gas, which is just 1.5 percent of the world's road vehicles. Morgan Stanley calculates that the gas now used by these cars and trucks replaces about 1.2 million barrels per day of oil products. Under optimistic forecasts, that use in 10 years could rise to 5.6 million barrels a day, or around 7 percent of 2012 oil supplies.
Meanwhile, Shell is trying to lower the capital cost of L.N.G. to make it feasible in even more remote offshore locations, by building liquefaction plants on what amount to enormous barges, bigger than aircraft carriers. The first such vessel destined for an offshore field in Western Australia is being built in a South Korean shipyard, where Mr. Brown says it can be done ''cost effectively'' -- compared with Australia, where labor and other costs have recently risen sharply.
Shell wants to come up with a standard design for these floating L.N.G. plants and gradually introduce them around the world. A candidate for one of the vessels is a field called Abadi in Indonesia, where Shell has a 30 percent stake.
This week Shell and Woodside, an Australian company in which it owns a 24 percent stake, agreed to work on a floating L.N.G. plant for Woodside's estimated $45 billion Browse offshore gas project in Australia.
And where is the L.N.G.-liquefaction building boom likely to be after Qatar and Australia? North America, Mr. Brown says.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Orville Slutzky, 96; Founded a Ski Resort

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Orville Slutzky, who with his brother founded the Hunter Mountain ski resort in upstate New York, known in the 1960s for its celebrity clientele and in the 1970s and '80s for its unmatched number of snow-making cannons, died on April 18 in Hudson, N.Y. He was 96.
Mr. Slutzky's death was confirmed by his son Paul, who operates the family business with a sister and a brother. 
Mr. Slutzky and his brother, Israel, a civil engineer known as Izzy, had been partners in a construction company when, in the late 1950s, they began bulldozing a ragged mountainside that a state engineering study had found unsuitable for skiing. But the proximity of a 4,000-foot-high mountain to New York City made it worth the extra engineering, Orville Slutzky later told interviewers. About 125 miles from Midtown, the mountain is one of the tallest within a desultory conversation's drive of the city.
The brothers, who were known for working prodigious hours well into their last years (Izzy Slutzky died in 2006 at 92), seized on ideas that later became standard practice in their industry. They were among the first to heavily invest in snow-making equipment in the 1960s, when the technology was fairly new, and were widely credited as the first to install enough of it -- there are currently 1,200 snow cannons -- to coat a mountain from top to bottom. (There are about 240 skiable acres at Hunter, from its highest trail head, at 3,200 feet, to the base, which is 1,600 feet above sea level.)
The Slutzkys were also among the first to build condominium apartments at a ski resort and to offer floodlit night skiing; summer skiing on lubricated plastic chips instead of snow (which never caught on); free lift passes for skiers over 70 (which did); and discount deals for singles, families and corporate groups. The deals filled the place to capacity for years, leading some ski writers to complain of a Times Square rush-hour ambience.
Mr. Slutzky and his brother grew up poor, working on the family dairy farm in Hunter, and in the guest lodge their parents had operated to make ends meet. The brothers started their construction company in 1939. They had built many of the areas' roads and schools by the mid-1950s, when they conceived of the ski mountain idea as a way of bolstering the local resort economy after years of decline.
Having grown up in a region dependent on tourism, they knew their venture would depend on people from New York City.
They retained a former Broadway publicist, Paul Pepe, who helped them gather investors, among them Jimmy Hammerstein, the son of the Broadway lyricist and producer Oscar Hammerstein II. Whether or not Jimmy Hammerstein secured financial backing from Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Kim Novak and Christopher Plummer, as the New York tabloids reported at the time, mattered less than the fact that the appearance of those names in the same paragraph as Hunter Mountain gave the resort an aura of glamour.
Among the celebrities there when the resort opened on Jan. 9, 1960, were the playwright Moss Hart and his wife, the actress Kitty Carlisle, who did not ski but were photographed riding the chair lift.
The Slutzkys bought out their investors a few years later but retained the patronage of celebrities like Mr. Newman, Ms. Novak and Mr. Plummer, who were photographed skiing there, as were Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York, Robert F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr., in the days before Vail and Aspen became the more popular destinations.
In a 1992 interview with Ski magazine, the blunt, sometimes impish Mr. Slutzky articulated the brothers' basic business plan. ''The ski industry is about advertising, promotion and constantly saying, 'We're the best,' '' he said. It was, he added, not that different from ''a mouthwash campaign.''
Orville Andrew Slutzky was born in Hudson on Feb. 13, 1917. He was the youngest of four children of Isaac and Ella Miller Slutzky, both Jewish refugees -- he from Russia, she from Lithuania -- who had lived on the Lower East Side but met in Hudson. Isaac had settled there to try his hand at farming, and Ella met him on a visit several years later. As was common among aspiring immigrant families, Orville, his parents and his two older sisters put Izzy, the older brother, through college; he graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
Mr. Slutzky is survived by two sons, Paul and Gary; a daughter, Carol Slutzky-Tenerowicz; and nine grandchildren. Mr. Slutzky's wife, Ethel Mildred, died in 2010.
In 1964, a reporter for The New York Times was among the members of the press assembled for the grand opening of the Slutzkys' new base lodge. In an interview that day, Orville Slutzky wistfully recalled another time.
''My brother and I began skiing here 35 years ago,'' he said. ''In those days we climbed the mountain with skis in hand, and then slid down as best we could.'' For skis, he added, ''we used barrel staves.''

HEADLINE: The Case for Megabanks Fails

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The best defense yet of megabanks is still not persuasive, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
The megabank lobby has finally put its best arguments on the table. After years of silly Twitter posts, weak research papers and other forms of unimpressive public relations, those opposed to further financial reform now have serious representation in the debate about what to do regarding too-big-to-fail banks.
On April 30, the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell issued "Brown-Vitter Bill: Commentary and Analysis," confronting head-on the proposal from Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, that would require bigger banks to fund themselves with more equity (and less debt, relative to their total balance sheet). 
The Davis Polk document, well written and with clear footnotes to its sources, provides transparency and style, a great improvement over most pro-megabank writing that I have reviewed here over the years. On substance, however, Davis Polk is completely wrong.
We can break down the problems with its analysis into five dimensions of banking: law, economics, markets, politics and history.

On key points of law, the Davis Polk analysis is less than complete. This might seem surprising, given that Davis Polk is one of the country's best-known law firms, but if it accurately described the full legal situation, all is lost for its case. The heart of the problem is cross-border resolution, in other words, the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to manage the government-supervised approach to handling the failure of a global megabank.
Davis Polk makes a big deal out of Title II of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation, which granted new powers to the F.D.I.C. And it is right that under some circumstances it could be helpful to use the proposed "single point of entry" approach by the F.D.I.C. - meaning that this agency would recapitalize a failing financial company solely through liquidating the holding company, wiping out equity and converting debt into equity.
Davis Polk, however, is wrong to imply (see the top of Page 7) that bankruptcy courts could not already handle the precedence of claims; it's the extension of F.D.I.C. power to bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies that is new here.
But this resolution authority does not apply across borders. It needs to be supplemented by a network of agreements with other countries, which would agree in advance exactly how to handle various assets and liabilities (as the F.D.I.C. is committed to do in the United States). Citigroup, for example, does business in more than 100 countries. So far, the F.D.I.C. has an agreement with the Bank of England, which could be helpful, although it remains to be seen how it holds up in a crisis (and the requisite legislation in Britain is not in place yet). But where is the agreement with the euro zone or Asia or any other market where Citi (or our other largest five banks) have their global presence? There is none, and there is no prospect for such an agreement.
Davis Polk refers to a resolution simulation run by the Clearing House (see the top of Page 8). But this simulation assumed a very simple cross-border structure and also that the British cooperated fully with the American authorities. If you are willing to assume that the world will be such an easy place to work, then why worry about anything? This is not a smart public policy approach.
On economics, Davis Polk cites Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig's new book, "The Bankers' New Clothes" (the first time I have seen the megabank side acknowledge that the book exists). Unfortunately, its staff members show no sign of having read it. Professors Admati and Hellwig have already refuted all the points about economics that Davis Polk tries to make.
Davis Polk is very taken with the idea that Professors Admati and Hellwig's argument rests entirely on theory developed by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (and they also mention me as following this approach). Davis Polk then makes a big deal about how this theory does not entirely match the real world.
But nobody asserts that it does match for banks or for any other company. It only provides a starting point for thinking about issues that do matter in the real world.
Professors Modigliani and Miller made an important point - an increase in leverage, by itself (i.e., more debt relative to equity in the funding of a firm) does not create value. Banks, however, love leverage more than other companies because it allows them to exploit guarantees and subsidies from taxpayers.The heart of today's economic argument is much more about the nature of the subsidies provided to very large financial institutions and how these distort incentives. The people running these companies are encouraged to take on more debt because this allows them to get more of the upside when things go well, while the downside is someone else's problem.
In effect, global megabanks are creating a very high level of systemic risk, a form of pollution. They should at least pay a fee. That we subsidize and therefore encourage this financial pollution makes no sense. This is all well explained by Professors Admati and Hellwig in Chapter 9 of their book.
Davis Polk is also impressed with some recent working papers that assert that banks play an important role in the economy, including by issuing debt. That may be the case, although you might question how much weight you want to put on working papers and speeches dated April 11 and April 12, 2013 (see Footnotes 17 and 18).
But these arguments are largely irrelevant to the issues at hand - again, see Professors Admati and Hellwig (Chapter 10). The downside risks associated with highly leveraged large banks are many; look around as we stumble out of the deepest and longest recession since the 1930s. By all means, allow big banks to issue debt. The point is to require that it be backed by a lot more equity than is currently the case (i.e., the precise proposal of Brown-Vitter). If these activities are truly valuable, they will continue when the subsidies are curtailed.
On markets, Davis Polk takes the current megabank line that there is no proven too-big-to-fail subsidy. This is a weak and inadvisable position. There is a debate about the precise size of this subsidy, but there are similar debates for any interesting economic variable, including gross domestic product, inflation or unemployment. Davis Polk cites Mary Miller, the Treasury under secretary (Page 10), on the idea that there is no subsidy. John Parsons and I took her positions apart here last week, and unfortunately Davis Polk does not engage with any of the main points we made.
And on the topic of recent working papers (from Sept. 1, 2012), I recommend that Davis Polk read "The Value of Implicit Guarantees" by Zoe Tsesmelidakis and Robert C. Merton, which makes the strong case that too-big-to-fail companies receive cheaper funding during crises.
The general question is simple. Does a global megabank borrow more cheaply because creditors expect, with some positive probability, that they will receive downside insurance from the government or the associated central bank under some circumstances?
Talk to people in the credit markets who do not work for big banks. Talk off the record and behind closed doors (so there are no potential repercussions from the too-bit-to-fail crowd) about how they (the actual and potential creditors) perceive the credit of Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase or Deutsche Bank. Creditors understand clearly the value of implicit protection that still exists.
On politics, Davis Polk insists that the government and the Federal Reserve cannot provide further bailouts or any form of subsidies during a crisis. This is naïve.
Henry Paulson, the former head of Goldman Sachs, is not a man you would have picked as likely to want more government intervention. Yet he appeared, as Treasury secretary, with cap in hand before Congress in September 2008, pleading that some form of enormous bailout for the financial system was needed to avert Armageddon.
You might agree or disagree with that assessment by Mr. Paulson and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, but there is no question that this will long remain a country in which Congress trusts our senior officials to tell it to them straight in a crisis. If the secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the Federal Reserve say they need new legislation to authorize various forms of government subsidy, then this is substantially what they will get -along with a lot of discretion on how to implement it.
The "no future bailout" promises (and legal commitments) in which Davis Polk sets such store are not credible. Congress cannot prevent any future Congress from acting. This is a fundamental principle of our democracy and, in many instances, it has served us well.
The real issue remains: what are the threats and the real policy alternatives in the next crisis? If Citi is on the brink of failure again (and it has been close to failure three times in recent decades), what would the consequences be for the real economy - both in the United States and around the world?
On history (see Pages 11-13), Davis Polk is weak. There are fewer footnotes and more assertions, including points that are plainly wrong (for instance the bizarre idea that "too much common equity and cash reserves" caused persistent deflation at the end of the 19th century (see the last paragraph on Page 12). The firm's entire discussion of the 19th century neglects to mention that the United States was on a version of the gold standard (without a central bank) that had very particular implications for the dynamics of banking over the business cycle. The analysis also confuses the academic work of Milton Friedman (who focused on the money supply) with that of Mr. Bernanke (who emphasized the role of credit and bank failures in the Great Depression).
It also appears (see Pages 12-13) to confuse the provision of "lender of last resort" liquidity with equity capital requirements. If you want to make our central bank stronger politically and therefore better able to deal with unexpected liquidity crises, you should be on the side of higher equity capital.
And Davis Polk consistently misses the most important point about small banks, in history and today. These companies ought to compete, to succeed and to fail, based on their own actions, when we have a relatively even playing field in our financial sector. We had this for a long time and it worked well. Small banks are willing and able to step up again, once we remove the excessive subsidies from their too-big-to-fail competitors.
Davis Polk ultimately put its cards on the table on Page 13, suggesting that the Fed's lender-of-last-resort lending - the ultimate backstop - should be available to "all financial institutions engaged in the socially beneficial function of maturity transformation," meaning the entire financial system.
The term "moral hazard" does not appear in the Davis Polk document, but that is what this is all about. Davis Polk is advocating a continuation of the present distorted incentives or an expansion of these incentives. The firm declined to comment on my critique of its report.
Powerful people on Wall Street will get the upside when things go well; you and I get stuck with the downside. Why is this a good arrangement for anyone other than a few well-placed executives and their lawyers?

The Obama administration plans to contest a judge's order for the Food and Drug Administration to make a morning-after birth control pill available to girls under 15 without a prescription, the administration's current age limit. The appeal reaffirms the administration's election-year decision to block such sales, "and puts the White House back into the politically charged issue of access to emergency contraception," Pam Belluck and Michael D. Shear explain.
 

        
Americans overwhelmingly agree on the need for background checks for gun buyers and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, but split on partisan lines on whether President Obama or Congressional Republicans are better suited to make the best decisions on those and other domestic issues, Ashley Parker and Allison Kopicki write, summing up the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. They add that the gap could explain why Mr. Obama and Democrats "are still struggling to translate public support into tangible political backing for their initiatives."

        
Immigration is on President Obama's agenda on Thursday as he begins a three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica to meet with Latin American leaders. Michael D. Shear and Randal C. Archibold write that discussions between Mr. Obama and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico on Thursday, which will also encompass economic and trade matters as well as the drug war, come as lawmakers in Washington are considering an immigration overhaul that would affect millions of Mexicans who are in the United States illegally.

        
The death of gun legislation in Congress last month hangs over efforts on Capitol Hill to overhaul immigration laws, portending a bumpy ride, Jennifer Steinhauer writes.

HEADLINE: In China, Iron Man's Muscle Is Fed by Inner Mongolian Milk

BYLINE: JOYCE LAU


HIGHLIGHT: It&#8217;s not uncommon for China to ask for editing changes in movies to fit its ideological framework, but in the case of &#8220;Iron Man 3,&#8221; the movie actually added four minutes of product placements. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - When it comes to pop culture, Hong Kong and mainland China follow two sets of rules.
Audiences here got the Andy Warhol retrospective complete with the Mao portraits that were removed in Beijing and Shanghai. We got to see a fully naked Tony Leung in "Lust, Caution," and heard what was whispered in the twist ending. The blood in our "Django Unchained" was a normal red. (Though why artificially darkened blood is considered less disturbing is a mystery to me.)
Mainland Chinese audiences are used to getting their foreign culture with bits missing. A fight scene in New York's Chinatown was deleted from "Men in Black 3" because, as we all know, nobody ever fights in Chinatown. The unsightly image of laundry hanging in Shanghai was snipped out of "Mission: Impossible 3," presumably because the authorities want to present a view of a modern China - one with an electric washer/ dryer in every laundry room. 
 "Iron Man 3," which stars Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow, opened Wednesday in mainland China andbroke opening-day box office records. In that film there were additions rather than cuts: four more minutes of footage. 
The government usually offers justifications for most cuts: Scenes are too violent or sexually charged for a country that has no ratings like PG-13 or R. There are political reasons why they do not want Chinese bad guys or sensitive topics. But the "Iron Man" additions were basically advertisements for Chinese products and stars. Whose decision it was to make those additions is unclear. 
In a sign that Hong Kong still has some autonomy, audiences here are spared the Chinese version. That means that - along with viewers in America, where the film opens Friday - we miss the first scene that asks, "What does Iron Man rely on to revitalize his energy?"
The answer, for trivia-seeking fans, is Gu Li Duo, a "milk drink" from Yili, an Inner Mongolia-based dairy. This is more than just product placement, given that the Chinese government has been trying to calm parents who are jittery over the safety of domestic milk. Consumers - along with black-market traders - have been flocking to buy out milk powder from Hong Kong, causing the city to impose a two-tin export limit on baby formula. Last year, Yili had to withdraw some of its baby formula because of high levels of mercury.
None of that seems to bother Dr. Wu (played by Wang Xueqi), who drinks from a carton of Gu Li Duo in the Chinese version of the film. Dr. Wu also uses Chinese medicine to help Iron Man, and is aided by his pretty assistant, the doe-eyed Chinese star, Fan Bingbing. Perhaps her job is to make sure there's always Gu Li Duo in the fridge to keep Dr. Wu and Iron Man strong. 
The extra scenes were quickly panned by Chinese netizens. The additions also included product placements by the Chinese electronics maker TCL, a mention of heavy industry giant Zoomlion and a group of perfect cheering Chinese schoolchildren.
Japan got its own version of "Iron Man 3." Some reports said that the "4DX" Japanese screenings would also involve smells. There are many movies I would have loved to smell - "Chocolat," "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman," even "Ratatouille" - but probably not this one. What would Iron Man smell like? Manly sweat? Burning metal? 
According to a review by Wired, the seats vibrated, lights flashed, gusts of wind blew around the theater, and water was sprayed into moviegoers' faces - but no interesting smells were recorded. The reviewer, Daniel Feit in Nagoya, called it "a drag." 
The Los Angeles Times writes that " 'Iron Man 3's' efforts to appeal to Chinese audiences fall flat." But was that ever the point? 
 Do you find it strange that different versions of the same movie play in different countries? Do product placements and special effects ruin a film? Should Hollywood studios bend to the interests of the Chinese government?

HEADLINE: Use of Mortgage Interest Deduction Depends on Where You Live

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Claims of the home mortgage interest deduction vary widely by state and ZIP code. 

 BODY:
An analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts finds that the use of the mortgage interest deduction varies widely across the country, with concentrations on the East Coast and in the West, and in areas with higher property values. The average size of the deduction varies, too. 
Less populated areas use it less, the report found, so any change in the deduction is likely to be felt differently in various geographic areas. The analysis uses Internal Revenue Service state-level data from 2010 and ZIP code data from 2007 on the number of tax returns, the number of mortgage interest deduction claims, the amount of interest deducted and federal income taxes paid.
As the federal government looks for ways to reduce the deficit, the mortgage interest deduction - along with other tax deductions and exemptions - is coming under scrutiny.
Tax filers who own a home and itemize deductions are allowed to subtract interest paid on a mortgage from their income. In 2011, filers deducted about $360 billion in interest, resulting in about $72 billion in lost federal tax revenue, the report says.
Fewer than half of all homeowners, and about a quarter of tax filers, claim the mortgage interest deduction, the report said. The benefit of the deduction increases with the size of the mortgage: the bigger the mortgage, the greater the tax benefit. (Currently, the amount of mortgage debt eligible for the interest rate deduction is capped at $1 million.)
The percentage of filers using the deduction varies widely by state. In Maryland, for instance, the percentage was about 37 percent, while in North Dakota and West Virginia, it's about 15 percent.
The average deduction among all filers nationally (including those who don't take the deduction) was $2,713 in 2010. But the average amounts ranged from a high of $4,580 in Maryland to a low of $1,192 in North Dakota. (The average is calculated over all tax filers, so the amounts can be compared geographically.)
Pew's Web site features an interactive mapthat lets you see the average deduction in your state and ZIP code.
The report didn't make any recommendations, but said the data shows that changes to federal tax policy could have varying results in the states.
Do you claim the home mortgage interest deduction? How important is it to you?
An earlier version of this post misstated the amount of federal tax revenue forgone in 2011 because of the mortgage interest deduction. It was $72 billion, not $72 million.

HEADLINE: Venture Capital's Rocky Road for Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: New data point to higher failure rates among start-ups that take venture capital and even fewer chances for the founders of companies to earn anything in an exit. 

 BODY:
In my previous Deal Professor column, I wrote about a Delaware lawsuit involving a venture capital company, Bloodhound Technologies, and how it exposed venture capital's dirty little secret: in a sale, the founders are often left with nothing even if the venture capitalists profit.
Based on further data supplied by Susan Woodward at Sand Hill Econometrics, it is a worse picture than I had painted. 
Sand Hill Econometrics, based in Silicon Valley, tracks and compiles data on venture capital investments. The firm is best known for creating and compiling the Dow Jones index of venture capital, which tracks, among other metrics, the annual rate of return and value of venture capital investments. The index is based on information about venture capital returns and investments going back several decades.
 In preparing the index, Sand Hill Econometrics has also compiled one of the more exhaustive databases of venture capital returns and exits. Their database includes roughly 6,700 venture capital exits since 2003. Sand Hill claims that this is essentially the universe of venture capital.
Using this data, we can look deeper into whether founders do indeed often lose out when venture capitalists exit a company.
According to the data provided by Sand Hill, since 2003 only 6 percent of venture capital exits have been through an initial public offering. This rate is far below rates from earlier periods, and shows why the death of the small initial public offering has hit venture capital so hard. An additional 1 percent of venture capital deals also went public through reverse mergers.
In my column, I had stated that the rule of thumb for venture capital was that two to three out of 10 investments fail completely. But according to Sand Hill, that is a dream. Instead, 41 percent of venture capital companies fail and are worthless.
Subtracting out these I.P.O. and failure figures, the bare majority of venture capital exits, 52 percent, are through a sale.
Here is where the figures get even worse.
For the 52 percent acquired, or roughly 3,500 companies, Sand Hill reports that only about half sell for an amount that is above the total amount they raise.
If you add up the I.P.O. figures and the sale figures, this means about 33 percent of venture capital exits are in a position for the founders to earn a dime.
But it is probably lower than that. According to Sand Hill, 7.5 percent of the venture capital I.P.O.'s had exit values that were below the total venture capital investment. As for sales, the venture capital investors still need to be paid back their 8 percent accrued dividend. This probably puts the number of deals where the founder receives anything in the 20 percentile range. These numbers also do not take into account management or other fees paid to the venture capital firms.
And these figures are an improvement over earlier periods, which include the mass destruction yielded by the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000. Fully 87 percent of entrepreneurs backed by venture capital firms during that bubble received nothing, according to Sand Hill.
In defense of venture capital, there are things that we do not know about this data that might change our views.
First, we cannot tell how these companies would have fared without venture capital money. Venture capitalists are not only quite experienced, they can provide the financing necessary to make companies survive.
Second, it may very well be that serial entrepreneurs - those that know the game and can negotiate better outcomes - do better.
And finally, it may also be that certain venture capital firms return more to founders. But venture capital is like private equity and very guarded in the information it reveals, so we do not have definitive answers about these last two questions.
But no matter how you slice it, this all means that entrepreneurs are taking a huge risk with venture capital, even if it is a smaller risk than going it alone. In a paper based on this data, Ms. Woodward and the Stanford economist Robert E. Hall calculated that when adjusted for risk, the payoff for an entrepreneur taking venture capital money was really no better, on average, than taking a salaried job for a person of similar background.
But venture capital's attraction is the 2.3 percent of deals where the payout is greater than $100 million and the 0.18 percent of deals where it is greater than $1 billion. These riches prove too attractive and lure those who want to take risk.
Those who study entrepreneurship would not be surprised at this. Sometimes taking almost foolhardy risk is the mantra of the entrepreneur. After all, who wouldn't want to be a billionaire?
I asked Mrs. Woodward about the type of people who would go into entrepreneurship and take venture capital knowing these odds. She said entrepreneurs who took venture capital were either serial entrepreneurs who knew the game or "those who wanted to shoot the moon."
It you are the latter, I wish you good luck.

HEADLINE: Finding the Right Words to Confront a 'Showroomer'

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Is it possible to &#8220;shame&#8221; people who research products with local retailers and then buy online? 

 BODY:
Two years ago, as Charles Kuhn struggled to steer Kopp's Cycle, the bicycle shop he owns in Princeton, N.J., through a tenuous economic recovery, he noticed that fewer and fewer of the nominal "customers" in his shop were actually buying anything. Instead, he told The Agenda at the time, "People come in with their smartphone and scan a bar code on a product that I have in my showroom, and what comes up on the phone is the three closest places and their price and then also what it is on Amazon." 
The practice is called "showrooming," and if you're a retailer, you're probably familiar with the phenomenon. It is one of the reasons, according to an article in The New York Times published over the weekend, that the bill now making its way through Congress to allow states to force online retailers to collect sales tax from customers may be too late to help many small businesses. But when Ron Lieber, the Your Money columnist for The Times, read the article, he had an idea: why not create a script that retailers can use when they spot showroomers scanning the aisles? 
Ron's proposed script goes like this:
I appreciate the value of your dollar, but we are a local retailer bringing vibrancy to this district. If everyone did what you did, we could no longer afford the Main Street rent that those Web retailers do not have to pay, and we'd be out of business. Then this space becomes another chain drugstore or branch of a megabank. Is that what you want?
We also ran the idea by Jay Goltz, our colleague at You're the Boss and the owner of a picture-frame shop, and he came up with a milder rebuke:
I appreciate the fact that everyone wants to save money; so do I. But I have to tell you, if everyone starts buying everything online, everyone but the online sellers will lose. The local stores will go broke, the online prices will go up, the customers will no longer have anywhere to see the merchandise, and the local neighborhood will be in bad shape. It is a heavy cost for maybe saving a few dollars. Just something to consider.
Something to consider, indeed. But after considering it for a few minutes, Jay decided that he didn't think "shaming" would work. "It will lead to some really ugly confrontations: 'You should lower your prices!' 'If local retailers weren't so greedy, it wouldn't be a problem!' 'I can't afford to spend more!' I can't see anything good coming out of it," he said.
What do you think? We think it's a worthwhile experiment, and we'd like you to help write the script. Should it provoke guilt? Sympathy? Something else? Please send us your suggestions. We will publish the best of your ideas in a future post.

HEADLINE: Brantley, Isherwood Answer Readers' Questions About the Theater Season

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The theater critics for The New York Times answer readers&#8217; questions about musical adaptations, their biggest disappointments of the season and what awards season means. 

 BODY:
This week Ben Brantley and Charles Isherwood, theater critics for The New York Times, took readers' questions about the Broadway season and this week's announcement of the Tony Award nominations. Below are their answers to selected questions.
 Q. 
 For Mr. Brantley, I was surprised by his lukewarm reviews for both "The Testament of Mary" and "The Nance." Would he like to further talk about his responses to both plays? Did Mr. Isherwood also see these plays and respond similarly? - drjp1025, Los Angeles
 A. 
 Ben Brantley: I said pretty much what I wanted to say in those reviews, though you can always expatiate, I suppose. There was much I liked about the production of "The Nance," especially Nathan Lane's performance and the gritty sense the production conveyed of burlesque in its final days. But the script turned preachy and conventional, and in doing so, I think, betrayed its title character, who became more of a mouthpiece than any actor should have to be. 
"Mary," I felt, was betrayed by its production. It's an excellent script, and in Ms. Shaw, it has a most compelling star. But the busy staging, by Deborah Warner, undercut as well as underlined the play's insights and moments of revelation. I think I said all this in the original reviews, but we critics are always happy to elucidate.
 Charles Isherwood: Unfortunately I can't express much enthusiasm for those productions either. "The Testament of Mary" struck me as an unhappy match between talents. Having read Colm Toibin's text in its published from, as a novella, I was transfixed by the dispassionate beauty of the writing. It seems to me the material drew its strength from the emotional restraint that was the keynote of Mary's reflections - she seemed all but hollowed out by horror of what she had witnessed. Fiona Shaw's performance had moments of intense quiet but these were overpowered by the general ferocity, not to mention the general busy-ness of Deborah Warner's production. (I do find it bizarre, however, that the Tony nominating committee included "Mary" in the best play category without recognizing Ms. Shaw's performance; take away the performance and the production consists of a vulture and an odd assortment of props. Go figure.) 
As for "The Nance," I wish Douglas Carter Beane had dug more deeply into the psyche of the main character, and that his young love interest had not been such a blandly idealized character. Also, I have to admit that I didn't find any of that whiskered burlesque comedy even remotely funny. 
 Q. 
 Do you have any comments on why all nominated new musicals are adaptations? - Bethynyc, Massachusetts
 A. 
 Brantley: I could do a riff on the culture of recycling here. But for many years, many classic book musicals have been adaptations. "The Book of Mormon" is an most obvious recent exception. But think of the Rodgers and Hammerstein canon: "Oklahoma!" and "Carousel" are adapted from plays, and "South Pacific" from a novel. More recently, musicals are more likely to look to movies for inspiration, as "Kinky Boots" did this season and hits like "Hairspray," "The Producers" and "Once" did in seasons past. Even Stephen Sondheim, whom one thinks of as conceiving shows out of air with his collaborators, has looked to the movies for his "Passion" and "A Little Night Music." And "Merrily We Roll Along" was a latter-day variation on a Kaufman and Hart play.
 Isherwood: Throughout their history Broadway musicals have been drawing on other sources for inspiration. Many of the classics - from "Show Boat" and "Oklahoma!" to "Sweeney Todd" - have found their origins in other mediums, so in a sense it's nothing new. What is new is the tendency these days to simply musicalize movies, a sign I suppose of film's dominance in our culture (and our decreasing literacy, perhaps). Three of the four nominated new musicals were based on movies. There's no inherent reason why films shouldn't make for fine musicals - I quite liked "Hairspray" - but the track record of the last decade or so is not inspiring. 
 Q. 
"Hands on a Hardbody" was one of my favorite entries this season. I recall the reviews were mostly on the positive side of neutral, and remember discussing with friends my fear that NYC audiences wouldn't "get it," and that tourists would eschew it in favor of in-your-face blockbusters. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the show, and if you think anything could have been done to give it a longer life. - Chris, Orlando, Fla.
 A. 
 Brantley: I am sad to say that I missed "Hands on a Hardbody," though I had every intention of seeing it, honest. I'll leave it to Charles to speak of why it didn't survive and how it might have been able to.
 Isherwood: "Hands on a Hardbody" was human-scaled and, despite measures of comedy, fundamentally serious in its consideration of how economic hardship had pushed its characters to the edge of desperation. Broadway musicals mostly traffic in splashy theatrics, happy fantasies and "feel-good" stories - all the nominated musicals certainly did. (I am glad, at least, that "Hardbody" won a nomination for Trey Anastasio and Amanda Green's eclectic, appealing roots-rock score.) I don't think the show really belonged on Broadway, but unfortunately there really isn't a viable marketplace for musicals Off Broadway - they are so expensive to produce. I would hope the show might have an extended life in regional theaters. It deserves it. 
 Q. 
 Which annual theater awards (e.g., Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk, Tony Awards, etc.) have you found over time to best reflect critical excellence? - Ed B., New York
 A. 
 Brantley: All awards are arrived at by compromise, which means they seldom reflect true originality or excellence. 
 Isherwood: We are certainly awash in theater awards these days, and I cannot claim to keep track of how the chips fall from year to year. Even the most esteemed award, which is probably the Pulitzer Prize for drama, has a far from perfect record in terms of selecting plays that, with time, have proven their enduring worth. Laurel-bestowing makes the award-givers and the award-getters feel good, but I'm not sure we should look to awards tallies for measures of true artistic merit. Maybe only history can give that verdict (and, heck, even history probably gets things wrong now and then). 
 Q. 
 I know how Mr. Isherwood felt about "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?", but how did Mr. Brantley feel about the show? - Monica Reida, Chicago
 A. 
 Brantley: I am always happy to see a solid production of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," one of my favorite plays. If I was less enamored of this version than Charles was, it was because I felt that Tracy Letts's George overpowered Amy Morton's Martha, and that the marital battle needs to be evenly matched for maximum impact. Mr. Letts was superb, though, and his performance offered me new and provoking insights into George. This alone made the production worth attending, and it had much more to offer than that.
 Q. 
 Do you feel that, with the majority of performance nominees being first-time nominees or being simply younger than typical, and that, with a lot of older, previous Tony nominees being passed over, that a new era of Broadway performers has been ushered in, and that we may be seeing more new works featuring new or younger actors?- Phil, Philadelphia
 A. 
 Brantley: Broadway, like any creative vampire, always needs new blood, so I'm glad if the Tony nominations reflect a fresh infusion of talent. Experience has taught me to ruminate, though, that many of the brightest young talents, having used the stage to announce their presence, are likely to be lost in the mills of television and film making, rather than develop into theater stars.
 Isherwood: I wasn't particularly struck by the preponderance of youth among the acting nominees, actually. Perhaps in the musical categories there were more fresh faces or at least new-ish names, from Stark Sands and Billy Porter to Santino Fontana and Laura Osnes. I hope for the sake of Broadway's future that these performers and others can continue to develop their careers, but the business has contracted over the decades, and great musical theater roles are harder to come by. I do think there's something a mite cheering in the fact that the nominators didn't seem to factor in celebrity quite as much as they normally do, including the likes of Tracy Letts and Amy Morton, theater stalwarts whose show had closed. (That said, Bette Midler was robbed!) 
 Q. 
 What have been the shows that most pleasantly surprised you this year? Alternatively, have there been any shows you were eagerly anticipating that disappointed you? - Ali, New York
 A. 
 Brantley: I went with limited expectations to Richard Greenberg's "Assembled Parties" (and, please, can somebody change that title, which is impossible to remember). I hadn't thought much of his adaptation of "Breakfast at Tiffany's," which had opened on Broadway not long before. But this was a return to top form for Mr. Greenberg, with a production full of eloquence and stylized wit. This sort of comedy of manners is much harder to pull off than it appears - it needs to create the illusion of an effortlessness that is in fact very hard-won. And I was sorry that neither its superb leading lady, Jessica Hecht, nor its director, Lynne Meadow, were nominated for Tonys. On the other hand, not really. If it weren't part of my job, I wouldn't even look to see what was nominated.
 Isherwood: I was most pleasantly cheered by the excellent revival of Clifford Odets's "Golden Boy." Although its director, Bartlett Sher, had done a wonderful job with another Odets play, "Awake and Sing!," I was nevertheless impressed by how vibrant and alive the play felt (and was glad the Tony nominators gave it plenty of love: 8 nominations, more than any other production of a play, old or new). Maybe that's why the biggest disappointment of the season - among quite a few, alas - was the less effective revival of Odets's "Big Knife." The play considers some of the same themes (the corrupting influence of money on the soul, etc.) but hasn't weathered the years as well, and I'm not even sure the sympathetic touch of Mr. Sher could have made a powerful case for it. 
 Q. 
 Why so much talk about awards? Why isn't there more conversation about differences of opinion? Why the persistent avoidance of conversation about actual artistic content? - Craig Lucas, Putnam Valley, N.Y.
 A. 
 Brantley: If I had a choice, I would ignore all award ceremonies (except the Grammys, which are a hoot). I find them embarrassing to the point of excruciation. They are not, and cannot be, objective measures of worth. It's not just that it takes time to uncover lasting merit, but most awards are arrived at by a kind of horse-swapping procedure wherein nobody's true favorite is likely to win. But people, being people, have a hunger for lists and prizes that quantify merit. It makes the world seem a little more manageable, I suppose. Newspapers are necessarily in the business of giving the public what it wants to read, and I work for a newspaper. Hence I try to write with some enthusiasm about awards in which I personally have little interest. 
 Isherwood: We live in a culture that's obsessed with competition, like it or not, and seems to become only more so. Witness the huge popularity and proliferation of talent contests on television, not to mention the multibillion-dollar industries that are major league sports. (And even college sports.) And nothing brings out differences of opinion more than the hoopla surrounding who did and who didn't get nominated! I can tell you writing about matters Tony-related is not, ahem, one of the most appealing aspects of the job. But it's also unavoidable.

HEADLINE: Mapping Unwed Motherhood

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: In 2011, of the women who reported having had a birth in the previous 12 months, 35.7 percent were unmarried. 

 BODY:
The share of births to unmarried mothers is up, according to a new report from the Census Bureau.
In 2011, of the women who reported having had a birth in the previous 12 months, 35.7 percent were unmarried. That number has been tracked in the American Community Survey since 2005, when 30.6 percent of recent births were to unmarried women. 
"Nonmarital fertility has been climbing steadily since the 1940s and has risen even more markedly in recent years," Rose Kreider, a family demographer with the Census Bureau and one of the report's authors, said in a news release accompanying the report.
Rates of out-of-wedlock births vary tremendously by demographics like age and education. Among women 20 to 24 years old, for example, 62 percent of those who gave birth in the previous 12 months were unmarried. Among those 35 to 39, the share was 17 percent. The rate of births out of marriage were also lower for women with higher income and more education.
The numbers varied by race as well. Among black women who had a birth in the last year, more than two-thirds (68 percent) were not married. The share for Asians was 11 percent; for non-Hispanic whites, 26 percent; and for Hispanics, 43 percent.
Here's a map showing the rates by state/district:
Washington, D.C. had the highest percentage of women with a birth in the previous year who were unmarried (51 percent), followed closely by Louisiana (49 percent), Mississippi (48 percent) and New Mexico (48 percent). The states with the lowest percentages were Utah (15 percent) and New Hampshire (20 percent).
The metro areas with the highest rates of births to unmarried women were Flagstaff, Ariz. (74.6 percent); Greenville, N.C. (69.4 percent); Lima, Ohio (67.5 percent); Myrtle Beach-North Myrtle Beach-Conway, S.C. (67.4 percent); Danville, Va. (67.3 percent). At the other end of the spectrum were Provo-Orem, Utah (8.2 percent); Kennewick-Pasco-Richland, Wash.(12.2 percent); Bremerton-Silverdale, Wash. (12.5 percent); and Lake Havasu City-Kingman, Ariz. (12.7 percent).
The broader New York City metro area, which is the site of a controversial new ad campaign trying to discourage teenagers from having children, has a rate slightly lower than that for the country as a whole (31.4 percent).

HEADLINE: Perelman Pledges $100 Million to Columbia Business School

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Ronald Perelman, a billionaire and longtime deal maker, has pledged $100 million to Columbia Business School, the university announced on Thursday. 

 BODY:
Years from now, students at Columbia Business School will go about their studies in a pair of buildings named for two Wall Street giants. One is Henry R. Kravis. The other is now Ronald O. Perelman. 
Mr. Perelman, a billionaire and longtime deal maker, has pledged $100 million to Columbia Business School, the university announced on Thursday. The donation ties the record for the biggest gift ever to the school, which was set in 2010 by Mr. Kravis, a co-founder of K.K.R.
The money will go toward the construction of new facilities at the planned Manhattanville campus, a $6.3 billion project that is expected to be completed within the next two decades. With Mr. Perelman's donation, the business school has raised $455 million of a $600 million goal.
One of the new buildings, expected to open within the next decade, will be called the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation.
"Columbia Business School has its finger on the pulse of the changing nature of business education," Mr. Perelman, the chairman and chief executive of MacAndrews & Forbes, said in a statement released by the university. "The school's commitment to developing transformative business thinkers is unparalleled."
Mr. Perelman, who received a masters degree in business from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, is a longtime member of Columbia Business School's board of overseers. Three of his children went to business school at Columbia, according to Christine Taylor, a spokeswoman.
"Ronald O. Perelman has long valued and supported business education and innovation in New York City," R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School, said in a release. "We are extremely grateful for his vision and generosity, and this gift will allow us to reach a new phase in the School's expansion into Manhattanville." 
In addition to the gifts from Mr. Perelman and Mr. Kravis, the business school has received $25 million from Leon G. Cooperman, chairman and chief executive of Omega Advisors.
In February, Mr. Perelman gave $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to build a new facility called the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Political Science and Economics.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Gives Sept. 11 Museum a $15 Million Loan

BYLINE: CHARLES V. BAGLI


HIGHLIGHT: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who serves as chairman of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, is giving a personal loan to help cover expenses until the institution opens a year from now. 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has personally lent the Sept. 11 museum $15 million to help cover expenses until the institution opens at ground zero a year from now.
Mr. Bloomberg, who serves as chairman of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the former World Trade Center site, is charging the lowest possible interest rate - less than 0.3 percent - so that the transaction would qualify under federal rules as a loan rather than a gift. 
The cost of building the 100,000-square-foot underground museum has grown to more than $700 million.
The private foundation has received over $425 million from state and federal governments and the Port Authority for New York and New Jersey for construction. It has also raised more than $450 million in private donations from individuals and corporations, including $15 million from Mr. Bloomberg himself.
But the largest donors often contribute their money over time, occasionally creating a cash-flow problem for the foundation. Delays have also driven up the cost of the project.
"The fact our chairman was able to extend a loan on such favorable terms is something we all recognize as something tremendously generous," said Joseph Daniels, president of the foundation.
Mr. Bloomberg is making the loan through a corporate entity of which he is the only shareholder. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why the money is being proffered as a loan rather than a gift.
The foundation had sought to borrow the money from a bank, but most lenders were reluctant to make a loan against donation pledges. One bank, JPMorgan Chase, did offer to provide a loan, but the interest rate and fees would have cost four percentage points more than the loan from Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Daniels said.
He said the foundation would start drawing down the Bloomberg loan sometime in the fall. 
At its board meeting last week, the foundation also formally voted to charge an entry fee to the museum when it opens. The museum expects to open next April. The board members did not set the fee, but it is expected to be between $20 and $25, despite the large dollop of public funds. The foundation expects that the museum will attract about 2.5 million annual visitors. 
The memorial itself is free, although the foundation recently adopted a $2 service fee for online reservations.

HEADLINE: Where the Raises Are: Trucking and Academia

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Compensation growth has been relatively flat across the board in recent years. The biggest raises have been in transportation and higher education. 

 BODY:
I spoke today withDiane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, who mentioned that she has been keeping an eye on which industries and occupations are giving raises. Unfortunately, not many fall under that category.
As of March, the Labor Department's index for the cost of total compensation for all civilian workers was just 0.3 percent higher than a year earlier, after adjusting for inflation. To give some context, the year-over-year change in this index - which includes wages and salaries as well as benefits - has averaged 0.7 percent since 1982, the first year these data became available.
Inflation has been very low in recent years, but it has still been substantial enough to mostly wipe out the meager raises that American workers have been receiving in nominal terms. (Before adjusting for inflation, compensation rose 1.8 percent year-over-year in March, compared with a long-term average of 3.7 percent.) Workers' raises are also slightly lower if you strip out the cost of benefits, particularly since the rise in health care costs has generally outpaced the rise in wages. That's probably not a coincidence; growing health care costs are eating up other forms of compensation that employers might otherwise provide. 
The lack of major wage gains across the board seems to contradict the idea that the economy is suffering from a major bout of skills mismatch. I have no doubt that employers in some industries are having trouble finding workers with relevant skills, but if skills mismatch were the primary driver of the country's lackluster hiring in recent years, then we would expect to see many more businesses bidding up wages in pursuit of those rare skilled workers who are available.
The two categories that have shown the biggest year-over-year increases in total compensation are (1) occupations in transportation and material moving and (2) employees at junior colleges, colleges, universities and professional schools.
So what do truckers and professors have in common? Ms. Swonk observes that their jobs are both hard to either outsource or automate, unlike a lot of other occupations.
That is becoming less true for professors, though, in the age of massive open online courses, or MOOCs. MOOCs help schools cut down on labor costs by scaling up the number of students who can be taught by a single professor - in some cases, a professor they don't even directly employ. And professors are worrying about being displaced. As The Chronicle of Higher Education reported Thursday, faculty members in the philosophy department at San Jose State University released an open letter saying they refuse to adopt a MOOC with lectures from a Harvard professor because they don't want to enable efforts to "replace professors, dismantle departments, and provide a diminished education for students in public universities."
On the other hand, MOOCs could still push up the overall level of wages for people employed at colleges by changing the composition of workers on those payrolls; the superstar professors whose lectures are featured in large-scale online courses will continue to be paid a lot, while the lower-wage professor jobs at community colleges and other strapped schools could be eliminated altogether, stripping out the bottom part of the pay distribution in higher education.

HEADLINE: House of Un-Representatives

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: This Republican House is almost like a parallel government, sitting in for some fantasy nation created in talk-radio land. 

 BODY:
Not long ago, the congressman from northeast Texas, Louie Gohmert, was talking about how the trans-Alaska oil pipeline improved the sex lives of certain wild animals - in his mind, the big tube was an industrial-strength aphrodisiac. "When the caribou want to go on a date," he told a House hearing, "they invite each other to head over to the pipeline."
Gohmert, consistently on the short list for the most off-plumb member of Congress, has said so many crazy things that this assertion passed with little comment. Last year, he blamed a breakdown of Judeo-Christian values for the gun slaughter at a cinema in Colorado. Last week, he claimed the Muslim Brotherhood had deep influence in the Obama administration, and that the attorney general - the nation's highest law enforcer - sympathized with terrorists. 
You may wonder how he gets away with this. You may also wonder how Gohmert can run virtually unopposed in recent elections. The answer explains why we have an insular, aggressively ignorant House of Representatives that is not at all representative of the public will, let alone the makeup of the country.

Much has been said about how the great gerrymander of the people's House - part of a brilliant, $30 million Republican action plan at the state level - has now produced a clot of retrograde politicians who are comically out of step with a majority of Americans. It's not just that they oppose things like immigration reform and simple gun background checks for violent felons, while huge majorities support them. 
Or that, in the aggregate, Democrats got 1.4 million more votes for all House positions in 2012 but Republicans still won control with a cushion of 33 seats. 
Or that they won despite having the lowest approval rating in modern polling, around 10 percent in some surveys. Richard Nixon during Watergate and B.P.'s initial handling of a catastrophic oil spill had higher approval ratings.
But just look at how different this Republican House is from the country they are supposed to represent. It's almost like a parallel government, sitting in for some fantasy nation created in talk-radio land.
As a whole, Congress has never been more diverse, except the House majority. There are 41 black members of the House, but all of them are Democrats. There are 10 Asian-Americans, but all of them are Democrats. There are 34 Latinos, a record - and all but 7 are Democrats. There are 7 openly gay or lesbian members, all of them Democrats. 
 Only 63 percent of the United States population is white. But in the House Republican majority, it's 96 percent white. Women are 51 percent of the nation, but among the ruling members of the House, they make up just 8 percent. (It's 30 percent on the Democratic side.)
 It's a stretch, by any means, to call the current House an example of representative democracy. Now let's look at how the members govern:
 To date, seven bills have been enacted. Let's see, there was the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship act - "ensuring the stability of the helium market." The Violence Against Women Act was renewed, but only after a majority of Republicans voted against it, a rare instance of letting the full House decide on something that the public favors. Just recently, they rushed through a change to help frequent air travelers - i.e., themselves - by fixing a small part of the blunt budget cuts that are the result of their inability to compromise. Meal assistance to the elderly, Head Start for kids and other programs will continue to fall under the knife of sequestration.
On the economy, the Republican majority has been consciously trying to derail a fragile recovery. Their first big salvo was the debt ceiling debacle, which resulted in the lowering of the credit rating for the United States. With sequestration - which President Obama foolishly agreed to, thinking Congress would never go this far - the government has put a wheel-lock on a car that keeps trying to get some traction.
 Meanwhile, not a day passes without some member of this ruling majority saying something outrageous. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, for example, has endorsed the far-side-of-the-moon conspiracy theory that the government is buying up all the bullets to keep gun owners from stocking their home arms depots. As for Gohmert, earlier this year he nominated Allen West, a man who isn't even a member of Congress (he lost in November) to be Speaker of the House. Harvey, the invisible rabbit, was not available.
Gohmert, like others in the House crazy caucus, has benefited from a gerrymandered district. He can do anything short of denouncing Jesus and get re-elected.
The Beltway chorus of the moment blames President Obama for his inability to move his proposals through a dunderheaded Congress. They wonder how Republicans would be treating a silken-tongued charmer like Bill Clinton if he were still in the White House. We already know: not a single Republican voted for Clinton's tax-raising budget, the one that led to our last federal surplus. Plus, they impeached him; his presidency was saved only in the Senate.
Obama may be doomed to be a reactive president in his second term, with even the most common-sense proposals swatted down because, well - if he's for it, Republicans will have to be against it. What could be a signature achievement, immigration reform, faces quicksand in the House. But a gerrymander is good for only a decade or so. Eventually, demography and destiny will catch up with a Congress that refuses to do the people's bidding.

HEADLINE: Handpicked Skeptic to Pitch Hardball Questions at Warren Buffett

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Warren Buffett wanted tougher questions at this year&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; meeting, so he chose a hedge fund founder who has bet against Berkshire. 

 BODY:
Most years, shareholders have asked a wide range of largely softball questions, from the billionaire's thoughts on the global economy to his religious beliefs.
But Mr. Buffett has tried to toughen up the questioning at the annual meeting, a 180-degree turn from what the majority of publicly traded companies seek to do. He has asked reporters, including one from The New York Times, and analysts to ask tougher questions.
Inviting Mr. Kass, 64, is perhaps the boldest move yet. The hedge fund manager is best known for his frequently contrarian positions, often on display in appearances on television shows about business and in his column on TheStreet.com. Mr. Kass has also pointed to his time working for Ralph Nader while a student. 
"See if you can drive the stock down 10 percent," Mr. Buffett teased his new foil during a CNBC interview in March.
Mr. Kass has repeatedly explored Berkshire's weaknesses over the years, including a 2008 article on TheStreet.com. Among his arguments at the time were Mr. Buffett's advanced age and the company's slowing growth.
Mr. Kass maintains a short position on Berkshire's shares, whose size he declined to disclose other than to describe it as average-size for him. But he spent the last month reading up on Mr. Buffett and his company, and as of Thursday was winnowing 25 potential questions down to six.
Two, he contended, would generate big news if Mr. Buffett answers them. The others have not been asked before, he said.
All the while, Mr. Kass said, he has remained an admirer of Mr. Buffett, sometimes referred to as the Oracle of Omaha. Since beginning his research, manager Mr. Kass has found a number of similarities with Mr. Buffett. For example, both have been treated for prostate cancer, and both once collected discarded horse-racing tickets at tracks in their younger days.
For his first trip to the Berkshire meeting, Mr. Kass is bringing his son and a group of friends.
"I'm psyched," he said. "It's like the financial World Series to me."
Apart from Mr. Kass, many elements of previous Berkshire meetings will be in place again this year. Mr. Buffett, 82, is likely to reiterate that his company - a huge conglomerate that counts railroads, private jets and running shoes among its holdings - has a succession plan in place for when he finally hangs up his investor's hat. (He's unlikely to say who will succeed him as chief executive.)
He will also most likely discuss his hunger to strike more big deals, one of his signature corporate moves. Neither of his acquisitions this year appears to qualify for the giant takeovers he craves: Berkshire teamed up with a Brazilian investment firm to buy H. J. Heinz for $23 billion, and it bought the 20 percent of the Israeli tool maker IMC that it did not already own for about $2 billion.
"It's back to work; Charlie and I have again donned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants," Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual investor letter, referring to his longtime investing partner, Charles T. Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman.
He is also expected to discuss his recent newspaper buying spree, having bought 28 dailies over the last year and a half for $344 million. While the acquisition campaign is not the most expensive he has ever conducted, Mr. Buffett has described himself as an addict who sees value in local news.
It is unclear whether he will be asked about another new move: into social media. On Thursday at 11:20 a.m. Omaha time, Mr. Buffett overcame a famous aversion to technology by posting his first message on Twitter. "Warren is in the house," he wrote as a camera for Fortune magazine hovered over his shoulder, capturing every tap.
By late afternoon, his post had been reposted more than 25,000 times, and his nascent Twitter account had drawn 176,000 followers. Among them is Mr. Kass, a prolific user of Twitter who has been documenting his passage to Omaha.
The foray was a surprise, given that Mr. Buffett once claimed he missed an important message about Lehman Brothers because he did not know how to check his phone's voice mail.
"I guess he's not as much of a Luddite as he professes," Mr. Kass said.
Mr. Buffett dryly hinted that Twitter had a little more in its favor than other platforms.
"The co-founder came from Nebraska," he said, in an apparent reference to a Twitter co-founder, Evan Williams. "So it can't all be bad."

HEADLINE: How the Public Sees Obama

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Majorities agree with his policy positions, but give him tepid marks overall. 

 BODY:
David Firestone wrote on this blog yesterday that Republicans in Congress want to deny the president anything he might want. They're driven by a desire to block him at every pass. Meanwhile, Maureen Dowd has been dissecting Mr. Obama's weaknesses, arguing that the president "hates selling." (Read her two recent columns here and here). 
Which explains the continuing paralysis in Washington - Mr. Obama's weakness or the Republicans' malicious obstructionism? A new poll by The New York Times and CBS News sheds some light on how the public approaches that question.
Mr. Obama's overall approval rating is fairly low - 47 percent positive and 45 percent negative. (It's amazing that 8 percent of Americans have no opinion about Mr. Obama.)

Mr. Obama is in the low 40s when it comes to his handling of immigration issues. People are split on whether they trust Republicans in Congress or Mr. Obama more to solve a variety of problems - the economy, the budget deficit, immigration, gun laws. Just three months ago, 50 percent said they trusted Mr. Obama more than the Republicans on the economy and the deficit. Now he's in the low 40s.
But, and here's where it gets interesting, Americans actually agree with Mr. Obama on every one of those issues.
A majority of Americans thinks gun control laws should be more strict - 88 percent think there should be background checks on every gun purchase, 50 percent think semi-automatic weapons should be banned, and 59 percent were either disappointed or angry that the background checks bill failed.
Eighty percent said there should be a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants if they meet requirements like paying fines and back taxes, and 56 percent say we should not wait until after the border is strengthened to start that process. Seventy-four percent said illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay - either to apply for citizenship (43 percent) or as guest workers (21 percent).
The majority also thinks that the right way to address the budget deficit is to both increase taxes and cut spending.
Why is it that most Americans agree with Mr. Obama on the issues, but give him so-so marks overall? One possibility is that they think he deserves at least part of the blame for failing to achieve his (popular) policy goals.
Basic disappointment might have something to do with this disconnect. No one has ever expected much of Congress (which is far more unpopular than the president, with a disapproval rating of 75 percent). But Mr. Obama came into office promising change, and he has not always fought for his agenda early enough or hard enough. The president is often remote and professorial in his public appearances. He also has gone back on some big campaign promises - including his pledge to bring transparency to Washington. (On national security issues, he's as secretive as his predecessor).
Congressional Republicans block what the president, and the people, want. But the people seem to think that the president should be able to find a way around the impasse.

HEADLINE: Senior S.E.C. Officials Depart

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Thursday that Carlo V. di Florio, head of the agency&#8217;s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, and David P. Bergers, the interim No. 2 enforcement official, will step down. 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has a new look to it. 
First, Mary Jo White joined the agency as its chairwoman last month. Then, she went about filling key roles, naming co-leaders of the agency's enforcement unit last week and hiring a general counsel, Anne Small, who rejoined the S.E.C. from the White House. 
On Thursday, she had some fresh spots to fill.
The S.E.C. announced that Carlo V. di Florio, head of the agency's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, will depart the agency and be replaced by his deputy. Mr. di Florio is heading to Wall Street's self-regulatory group, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, where he will become an executive vice president for risk and strategy.
David P. Bergers, the interim No. 2 enforcement official at the S.E.C., will also leave soon. Mr. Bergers, a 13-year employee of the agency, ran the S.E.C.'s Boston office in addition to his role in enforcement. 
The continued departures are common amid a transition period. And others are expected to follow as Ms. White shuffles the staff and sets her own roster. 
But the turnover could pose a challenge to the S.E.C. as it sheds top officials with a rich vein of knowledge about the markets and the agency itself. 
Ms. White on Thursday described Mr. Bergers as "a tremendous asset to the agency." In a statement about Mr. di Florio, who overhauled the agency's exam program in the aftermath of the financial crisis, she said that he "has been an outstanding leader of the National Exam Program and has made a lasting impact on the S.E.C."
Ms. White appointed Andrew J. Bowden, Mr. di Florio's deputy, to succeed him. "His dedication, judgment, and leadership will serve him well as he takes on his new post leading an aggressive, effective examination program," Ms. White said. 
The changes come at an already difficult time for the agency, which has fallen far behind its rule-making responsibilities. Nearly three years after Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, the overhaul of Wall Street regulation, the S.E.C. has not carried out many of the changes.
The enforcement unit faces its own challenges. The unit, which also received a makeover after the crisis, is on pace to file the lowest number of enforcement cases in a decade, according to S.E.C. figures provided to The New York Times. Some longtime enforcement officials attribute the decline to low morale at the Washington office.
Mr. Bergers took on the deputy enforcement role early this year, but it was on an interim basis. When Ms. White announced last week that Andrew J. Ceresney and George Canellos would share the top role, it signaled that a broader shake-up could be at hand.
For Mr. Bergers, it appeared the time was right to move on. "I have been incredibly fortunate to serve alongside the agency's talented and dedicated staff working hard every day to protect investors," he said on Thursday.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Caught in Swirl of Regulatory Woes

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The nation&#8217;s biggest bank, which faces several federal investigations, was warned by energy regulators about &#8220;manipulative schemes&#8221; it used in California and Michigan. 

 BODY:
Government investigators have found that JPMorgan Chase devised "manipulative schemes" that transformed "money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers," and that one of its most senior executives gave "false and misleading statements" under oath.
The findings appear in a confidential government document, reviewed by The New York Times, that was sent to the bank in March, warning of a potential crackdown by the regulator of the nation's energy markets.
 The possible action comes amid showdowns with other agencies. One of the bank's chief regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is weighing new enforcement actions against JPMorgan over the way the bank collected credit card debt and its possible failure to alert authorities to suspicions about Bernard L. Madoff, according to people who were not authorized to discuss the cases publicly.
In a meeting last month at the bank's Park Avenue headquarters, the comptroller's office delivered an unusually stark message to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive and chairman: the nation's biggest bank was quickly losing credibility in Washington. The bank's top lawyers, including Stephen M. Cutler, the general counsel, have also cautioned executives about the bank's regulatory problems, employees say. 
Mr. Dimon acknowledged in a recent letter to shareholders that "unfortunately, we expect we will have more" enforcement actions in "the coming months." He apologized for letting "our regulators down" and vowed to "do all the work necessary to complete the needed improvements."
Still, the broad regulatory scrutiny - at least eight federal agencies are investigating the bank - presents a threat to JPMorgan at a time when it is raking in record profits.
For executives, the bank's transition from model citizen to problem child in the eyes of the government has been jarring. It has helped drive top managers out of the bank, and it could make a coming shareholder vote on whether to split the roles of chairman and chief executive an anxious test for Mr. Dimon, long the country's most influential banker.
Given the bank's strong earnings, investors are unlikely to pull out. Yet a growing number of shareholders say they are concerned about the regulatory problems.
In the energy market investigation, the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, intends to recommend that the agency pursue an action against JPMorgan over its trading in California and Michigan electric markets.
The 70-page document also took aim at a top bank executive, Blythe Masters. A seminal Wall Street figure, Ms. Masters is known for helping expand the boundaries of finance, including the development of credit default swaps, a derivative that played a role in the financial crisis.
The regulatory document cites her supposed "knowledge and approval of schemes" carried out by a group of energy traders in Houston. The agency's investigators claimed that Ms. Masters had "falsely" denied under oath her awareness of the problems and said that JPMorgan had made "scores of false and misleading statements and material omissions" to authorities, the document shows.
It is unclear whether the agency will file an action against JPMorgan based on the investigators' findings. A majority of the five-member commission must first endorse the case. If the regulator does proceed, it could fine the bank and Ms. Masters.
"We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees in this matter," said Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the bank. "We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter."
JPMorgan has until at least mid-May to respond to the accusations in the document.
As the bank fights the energy investigation, it says it is trying to rectify other lingering compliance woes.
Recent departures from the bank, however, could complicate that effort. Frank J. Bisignano, the co-chief operating officer known for cleaning up JPMorgan's troubled mortgage division after the 2008 financial crisis, announced his departure this week. Barry Koch, a senior lawyer with strong ties to law enforcement, is also expected to soon leave the bank, people close to Mr. Koch say.
Mr. Dimon's meeting with the comptroller's office last month further highlighted the bank's challenges with regulators.
In the credit card investigation, people briefed on the case said the comptroller's office had discovered that JPMorgan was relying on faulty documents when pursuing lawsuits against delinquent customers. The accusations, which are expected to prompt an enforcement action later this year, echo complaints that JPMorgan and rivals plowed through home foreclosures with little regard for accuracy.
In a separate investigation into JPMorgan's relationship with Mr. Madoff, the comptroller's office raised concerns that the company may have violated a federal law that requires banks to report suspicious transactions. Eventually, the people said, the agency could reprimand the bank for the potential oversight failures.
"We believe that the personnel who dealt with the Madoff issue acted in good faith," Ms. Lemkau, the bank spokeswoman, said.
Some bank analysts also note that JPMorgan's strong earnings could ameliorate concerns among its investors.
"As long as you're making money, investors don't care," said Paul Miller, a managing director at FBR.
Regulators, however, increasingly do care. When the comptroller's office sought documents in the Madoff case from JPMorgan, the bank declined, citing attorney-client privilege, according to bank employees. The dispute was then elevated to the Treasury Department's inspector general, which oversees the comptroller's office.
"The matter is pending," said Richard Delmar, a counsel to the inspector general.
The Madoff case, authorities say, exposed a recurring problem at JPMorgan - what they say is its sometimes combative stance with regulators. In a recent report examining a $6 billion trading loss at the bank, Senate investigators faulted JPMorgan for briefly withholding documents from regulators. The trading loss has spawned several law enforcement investigations into the traders who created the faulty wager.
Mr. Dimon, who is not suspected of any wrongdoing, met this week with prosecutors and the F.B.I. to discuss the case, two people briefed on the investigation said.
A day before the Senate subcommittee released its report on the trading loss, JPMorgan received another ominous dispatch from Washington. On March 13, enforcement officials at FERC notified the bank that it planned to recommend an action over the power plant investigation.
JPMorgan is the latest big bank to face scrutiny from the energy regulator, which recently pursued actions against Barclays and Deutsche Bank. The cases reflect how the regulator has kept a more vigilant watch over the energy markets ever since the Enron fraud.
But Wall Street is fighting back against the new approach, casting the agency's enforcement unit as overzealous and overreaching.
The JPMorgan case arose, according to the document, after the bank's 2008 takeover of Bear Stearns gave the bank the rights to sell electricity from power plants in California and Michigan. It was a losing business that relied on "inefficient" and outdated technology, or as JPMorgan called it, "an unprofitable asset."
Yet under "pressure to generate large profits," the agency's investigators said, traders in Houston devised a workaround. Adopting eight different "schemes" between September 2010 and June 2011, the traders offered the energy at prices "calculated to falsely appear attractive" to state energy authorities. The effort prompted authorities in California and Michigan to dole out about $83 million in "excessive" payments to JPMorgan, the investigators said. The behavior had "harmful effects" on the markets, according to the document.
JPMorgan disputes the claims, arguing that its trading was legal.
"The staff is challenging a bidding strategy that was transparent and was in full compliance with the applicable rules," said Ms. Lemkau, the bank's spokeswoman. "We strongly disagree with the staff's conclusions."
For now, according to the document, the enforcement officials plan to recommend that the commission hold the traders and Ms. Masters "individually liable." While Ms. Masters was "less involved in the day-to-day decisions," investigators nonetheless noted that she received PowerPoint presentations and e-mails outlining the energy trading strategies.
The bank, investigators said, then "planned and executed a systematic cover-up" of documents that exposed the strategy, including profit and loss statements.
In the March document, the government investigators also complained about what they said was obstruction by Ms. Masters. After the state authorities began to object to the strategy, Ms. Masters "personally participated in JPMorgan's efforts to block" the state authorities "from understanding the reasons behind JPMorgan's bidding schemes," the document said.
The investigators also referenced an April 2011 e-mail in which Ms. Masters ordered a "rewrite" of an internal document that raised questions about whether the bank had run afoul of the law. The new wording stated that "JPMorgan does not believe that it violated FERC's policies."

HEADLINE: Using the 'Old-School Method' to Choose Between Amherst and Yale

BYLINE: LEOBARDO ESPINOZA JR.


HIGHLIGHT: When choosing between Yale and Amherst, Leobardo Espinoza Jr. resorted to the &#8220;old-school method of deciding where I felt the most comfortable.&#8221; 

 BODY:
The hardest part about choosing a college was making sure a school's brand name did not become a factor in my decision.
When I left the Yale University campus in Connecticut, I knew where I was going to be spending the next four years of my life. Then I flew back home to Kansas and started to think about everything I had experienced at Amherst College in Massachusetts.
The more I thought about it, the harder it was for me to commit to Yale. I was leaning toward Amherst, mainly because of financial aid. I was a bit surprised when Amherst offered more aid than Yale. So I appealed Yale's initial offer, and the Ivy League school ended up reconsidering and matching Amherst's financial aid package. 
With finances no longer a factor, I continued down my list of things to look for in a college.
I thought my decision would be much tougher to make, but as time went on and I began to ask students about their experiences at both colleges, the decision became clearer.
I looked at class sizes and how easy it was for students to get to know professors. I sent e-mails to one faculty member from each school to test response times and depth of their responses.
Unsurprisingly, the professor at Amherst responded to my e-mail within two minutes after I had sent it. (Honestly, that freaked me out a little - I felt as if he was expecting it because it came a bit too fast, even for my own expectations.)
The response from Yale was delayed, but it was far greater in length and much more in depth.
Since that didn't help in the decision process, I asked several students at Yale how easy it was for students to access professors. "Really easy," they all responded. They explained that at smaller schools, professors often initiated the conversations with students. A student who doesn't start conversations with professors would have problems getting to know them at a large university like Yale, but if that same student has initiative, then he won't have a problem.
I consider myself a go-getter type, so I feel as if I wouldn't have a problem getting to know professors, even if classes are larger at Yale than they would be at Amherst.
So, when that, too, turned out to be useless when comparing both schools, I had to resort to the old-school method of deciding where I felt the most comfortable.
And with that, the verdict is in: I will be joining Yale's class of 2017!
College, to me, has often been described as a place where students are forced to choose two categories among sleep, good grades and a social life. At Yale, though, I felt that students there managed to do all three without a problem.
That's what is most attractive about the school: the ability for its students to maintain balanced lives. Also, Yale's residential college system gives me a smaller community to work with while still being at a large research university.
It's perfect.
Time and time again it's been said that a college experience isn't dependent on where we go, but rather what we make of it. For me, though, it's been even more important to remember that college is only a stop in the journey. It's not the final destination.
With that in mind, I know that I have four wonderful years in New Haven to look forward to, before, once again, it's time to decide in what direction I want my life to head. 
But for now, I can finally breathe normally once more. Whew.

HEADLINE: Former Hedge Fund Trader Sentenced in Insider Case

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Todd Newman, a onetime hedge fund trader at Diamondback Capital who was convicted of insider trading, was sentenced as part of the government&#8217;s widespread crackdown. 

 BODY:
It is a scene that has played out over and over at the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan.
A once high-flying hedge fund trader stands before a judge, often apologizing for his misdeeds. A high-priced defense lawyer asks for leniency, arguing that the client has lived - outside of his insider trading crimes - an otherwise admirable life. After listening intently, the judge rejects those pleas and sends the defendant to prison.
 Todd Newman became the latest to join the parade of Wall Street traders - along with a smattering of business executives, management consultants and corporate lawyers - who went through this routine and had their lives upended by the government's crackdown on insider trading. 
In his almost five years of trading technology stocks at Diamondback Capital Management, Mr. Newman, 48, earned more than $10 million.
On Thursday, he received a prison sentence of four and a half years.
"This is a crime that has an impact across an economy and across a society," said Judge Richard J. Sullivan, who presided over Mr. Newman's trial and handed down the sentence. "This was a stark crossing of the line, engaging in criminal conduct, and that's just wrong."
Last December, a jury convicted Mr. Newman and another former hedge fund trader, Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors, of a conspiring with six others to earn about $70 million illegally trading technology stocks. The charges centered on trading in shares of Dell and Nvidia based on secret financial information obtained from insiders at the companies.
The case is one of several insider trading prosecutions that has ensnared SAC Capital Advisors, the giant $14 billion hedge fund run by the investor Steven A. Cohen that has become a focus of the government's inquiry.
Federal prosecutors have charged two former SAC employees with participating in the conspiracy involving Mr. Newman. Jon Horvath, a former SAC technology stock analyst, admitted to being a part of the ring last year. In March, Mr. Horvath's boss, Michael S. Steinberg, was also charged. Mr. Steinberg has pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Cohen has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has said that he behaved appropriately at all times. On Thursday, SAC announced several measures to beef up its legal and compliance effort, including clawing back pay for employees who break the law.
The case involving Mr. Newman has another connection to SAC: both Diamondback and Level Global, which are now defunct, were started by SAC alumni.
Diamondback, a hedge fund based in Stamford, Conn., that shut down last year, is seeking millions of dollars in restitution from Mr. Newman, characterizing itself as a victim of his crimes. A divorced father with a 12-year-old daughter, Mr. Newman lives in Needham, Mass., a low-key Boston suburb. He built a successful career specializing in investing in technology stocks. Before joining Diamondback in 2006, he worked at Tudor Investment, one of the world's most prominent hedge funds.
Describing him as a "good, honorable and decent human being," Mr. Newman's lawyer made his case for a light sentence. "This is not who he is," said the lawyer, John A. Nathanson. "His reputation has been decimated."
The sentence was less than the six and a half years that federal prosecutors had sought. Judge Sullivan also imposed about $1.75 million in fines and forfeiture.
Mr. Newman is one of 81 individuals charged by the United States attorney in Manhattan since 2009. Of those, 73 have either pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury, and 48 of those have already been sentenced.
A large majority of the insider trading defendants have confessed instead of fighting the charges. Just 10 have taken their cases to trial, and all of them have been found guilty.
Mr. Steinberg and another former SAC portfolio manager, Mathew Martoma, could test the government's perfect trial record. Mr. Martoma was indicted in December on charges that he corrupted a doctor to leak secret data about a clinical drug trial, allowing SAC to earn profits and avoid losses of $276 million.
Both Mr. Martoma and Mr. Steinberg have refused to cooperate with the government in helping them build a potential case against their former boss, Mr. Cohen. Their trials are not yet set, but are not likely to start until at least early 2014.
SAC has settled a pair of civil lawsuits - one for $602 million, another for $14 million - that were brought against the firm by securities regulators related to Mr. Martoma's and Mr. Steinberg's cases.
During the sentencing of Mr. Newman on Thursday, Judge Sullivan, who has presided over a number of the insider trading cases, said he grappled with why so many Wall Street executives had committed this crime. He compared Mr. Newman and others to less fortunate defendants, like one he had recently sentenced who grew up in dire poverty in the Dominican Republic and turned to a life of crime.
"I'm not excusing that, but one could see how those circumstances would push one to the dangers of criminal activity," the judge said. "But it is hard to understand why someone who has reached the pinnacle of success would risk all that for more."
A picture caption on Friday with an article about the sentencing of the former hedge fund trader Todd Newman for insider trading, using information from Reuters, misidentified a lawyer shown with Mr. Newman. He is John A. Nathanson - not Stephen Fishbein, another of Mr. Newman's lawyers.

HEADLINE: Obama Can't Go It Alone in Syria

BYLINE: By DANIEL C. KURTZER. 
Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former United States ambassador to Egypt and to Israel, is a professor of Middle Eastern policy studies at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton.

 BODY:
THE Obama administration is awash in advice about what to do in Syria. With the administration's having declared chemical weapons use by the government of Bashar al-Assad a ''game changer,'' many are advising the president to intervene militarily. The stakes are high: every day that Mr. Assad remains in power brings death and destruction to more Syrians; but after more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the prospect of American military intervention is daunting.
Before making a momentous decision on intervention -- especially if the president is considering unilateral intervention -- we ought to first do serious diplomacy to see whether an international consensus can be reached on the question of intervention, and then ask the Arab League, the United Nations Security Council and Congress to vote on whether and what kind of intervention is acceptable. Public votes will mean shared responsibility and accountability for whatever action -- or inaction -- results. Indeed, the Syria crisis presents an opportunity to turn away from unilateralism and to adopt instead a more strategic, multilateral approach to resolving international crises. 
To make this process credible, the United States should take the lead in trying to shape consensus positions in the three bodies. The diplomatic strategy would need to start with Russia which, together with China, has been blocking Security Council action on Syria. The Russians are motivated by large strategic and narrow economic interests. They are most concerned about the possibility of a jihadist victory in Syria that could spill over into their own backyard -- the Muslim-majority Caucasus region of southern Russia.
Russia is also keen to maintain its longest-standing ally in the Middle East. For the Russians, the starting point for any discussion of possible intervention will be how to manage the transition if Mr. Assad falls. This would probably involve transferring power to military officers strong enough to maintain stability (Russia's interest) but also willing enough to oversee a gradual opening up of the political system (America's interest). Concerns about chemical weapons -- of as much concern to Moscow as to Washington -- and continuing American-Russian engagement concerning the Boston terrorist attack may give this diplomatic mission some traction.
High-level talks between the United States and Russia will be noticed in Damascus. If the possibility of an American-Russian understanding is seen as credible, it could convince Mr. Assad that time is running out. Until now, he has banked on a Russian veto in the Security Council and Iranian support in the region to help shore up his government. A crack in that edifice could bring down the Syrian regime even without intervention.
The United States should also engage urgently with three Arab states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt -- all of whom are playing their own games on the ground in Syria, supporting various opposition groups as counterweights to Iranian influence. The Qataris have supported Islamist opposition forces, including reportedly funneling arms clandestinely, much to the consternation of the Saudis, who are distrustful of the Muslim Brotherhood's intentions in the region. Egypt is caught in the middle: the Egyptian military knows Syria's army well and is inclined to support former Syrian Army officers who have defected to the opposition but promise stability; Egypt's Islamist leaders, on the other hand, are more sympathetic to their Muslim Brotherhood colleagues in Syria.
These three Arab states hold the key to Arab League action or inaction. While a broad consensus exists that the Assad regime must go, there is no consensus on whether or how outside intervention should play a role at this stage. For the Arab states, the stakes ought to be laid out clearly: they need to bring the Arab League to a yes-or-no vote on military intervention with a clearly defined mission; and in the unlikely event that the vote is yes, they will be expected to provide tangible support to whatever mode of intervention is decided.
At home, while our diplomats are negotiating with Russia and the Arab League, we need to see partisan politics replaced with a reasoned and serious debate about American interests in Syria and possible courses of action.
Sunday morning talk show chatter should give way to a full discussion in both houses of Congress, focusing on at least three policy options: continuing on the present course of providing ''nonlethal'' training and assistance; establishing no-fly zones to neutralize the aerial advantage currently enjoyed by the Assad regime; or engaging in full-scale military intervention with the goal of regime change. Americans deserve to know where their president and elected representatives stand on these important issues.
Developing and negotiating resolutions in these three bodies will not be easy or quick, and each day of deliberation means a day of continued tragedy in Syria. It will take political courage on the part of the international community and our own legislators to vote on intervention -- courage from many who would clearly rather avoid accountability by burying their heads in the sand.
Constructing an international coalition of willing states -- especially Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar -- is the only strategically wise option for the United States. Without such a coalition, intervention won't work. And without such a coalition, America must reject unilateral military intervention in Syria.

HEADLINE: Afghans Are Said to Face A Large Budget Shortfall

BYLINE: By MATTHEW ROSENBERG; Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Afghan government is supposed to cover less than half its own bills this year, yet achieving even that modest goal is proving an unexpected challenge, Afghan and Western officials said.
A confidential assessment of Afghan finances by the International Monetary Fund said the potentially severe cash crunch was caused by widespread tax evasion abetted by government officials, the increasing theft of customs revenues by provincial governors and softening economic growth.
The I.M.F. assessment, which has not been publicly released but was described by American and European diplomats who were recently briefed on its findings, estimated that Afghan revenue in the first quarter of the year was roughly 20 percent to 30 percent short of an informal target the fund had set for the government. 
After a decade of steadily growing tax and customs revenue, the budget shortfall has caught Afghanistan's international backers by surprise. Diplomats portrayed it as an unwelcome reminder that the Afghan government remains weak and corrupt -- and years away from being able to pay its own expenses.
If the trend is not reversed, diplomats said, the Afghan government will be unable to pay salaries by midsummer, though Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal disputed that assessment. He put the shortfall at no more than 20 percent.
No one here expects the Afghan government to actually run out of money. It is supposed to cover about 40 percent of its nonsecurity spending this year, projected to total roughly $5 billion, and it could raise money by cracking down on tax evaders or imposing new fees for services.
As a last resort, international donors could always fill the gap. They already pay nearly the entire cost of Afghanistan's police force and army, and have agreed to cover roughly 60 percent of the government's other spending this year.
For now, fear of instability still trumps the desire for good governance among Western donors, and aid commitments are likely to hold through the end of the NATO combat mission in 2014, diplomats said.
But the looming cash crunch comes at a delicate time. Kabul is negotiating a long-term security deal with the United States and is looking for other Western countries to make good on aid pledges that amount to tens of billions of dollars after 2014.
Smaller countries with little or no military commitment here are especially likely to reassess their aid spending at that point, diplomats said.
If Afghan officials ''don't have the confidence in their own country to find a way to pay for it themselves, then why should we?'' said a European diplomat from one of those smaller countries. The diplomat and others spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Afghan officials.
For President Hamid Karzai, who has been pushing for greater control of Afghanistan's affairs, the revenue problem strikes at a more fundamental issue: a country that cannot pay for itself is not its own master.
''Let us be honest,'' Bernard Bajolet, the recently departed French ambassador, said at a farewell cocktail party. ''Sovereignty won't be effective as long as Afghanistan won't be fully self-reliant financially.''
Afghanistan, to be sure, has made huge economic strides since 2001, and the signs of growing prosperity abound. Dozens of international flights a week arrive in Kabul, late-model cars crowd the congested streets of the capital, and cellphones have largely replaced the hand-held satellite phones that just over a decade ago were the sole way to make a call.
But the country will nonetheless need billions in financial aid through 2032 to cover its nonsecurity spending, never mind to pay for its army and police force, according to another I.M.F. review that was released in February.
American and European officials rarely speak of horizons that long. The current aid pledges for nonsecurity spending, which are contingent on the Afghan government combating corruption, run only through 2016 -- it is 2018 for security spending -- with only vague assurances of what will come afterward.
''I'm not sure that Mr. Karzai or Mr. Zakhilwal should be walking into a bank with promises, not if Afghans aren't going to pay,'' said another European official who deals with financial matters. ''This matters to us.''
Mr. Zakhilwal, the finance minister, said he was confident the government would get its finances in order. In an e-mail, he attributed the shortfall largely to a shift in the start of the Afghan fiscal year to Dec. 21 from March 21, which resulted in people overpaying taxes last year.
The shifting fiscal year also accounts for why Afghan and European officials are measuring revenue against a target rather than comparing the numbers with the same quarter from previous years.
Slowing economic growth contributed to the revenue shortfall as well, Mr. Zakhilwal said, blaming the international news media for offering a ''negative analysis'' of what will happen after 2014.
That coverage, reflected in the Afghan news media, ''has caused nervousness and has affected trade and business activities,'' he said.
American and European officials said the shifting fiscal year and weakening confidence are certainly part of the problem.
But the economy grew by 12 percent last year, and many Afghans who should be paying large tax bills, especially wealthy businessmen, are closely linked to senior officials and political figures. An American official described them as the ''untouchables,'' saying they rarely pay their full tax bill.
The presidential election slated for next April further complicates matters. Cracking down on tax evasion is that much tougher in an election year; the business elite, for instance, finances campaigns.
Then there are customs revenues, which account for about half of Afghan government revenues. They ''are declining, not increasing, due to the diversion of part of them,'' said Mr. Bajolet, the former French ambassador. He did not elaborate.
But American and European officials said it was because of election year political jockeying. Some governors of provinces with lucrative border crossings are positioning themselves for presidential runs, and others are looking to help finance top contenders, they said. Customs revenues are an easy way to fill their war chests.
In his e-mail, Mr. Zakhilwal tacitly acknowledged the corruption, and called the revenue numbers a ''blessing in disguise'' that has allowed him to take politically perilous corrective measures.
He said 34 customs officials have been replaced ''with more reputable, reform-minded and serious individuals. This is the biggest change in any single Afghan ministry in the past 12 years.''
He also said Finance Ministry officials were under orders to more strictly enforce tax and customs rules, and the cabinet decided last month to fire any official caught abetting tax evasion or stealing customs duties.
A senior official has yet to be fired.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Pays Tribute to The Financial Times, Reigniting Speculation on a Bid

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Wednesday night stoked speculation about his interest in acquiring The Financial Times at a breezy Upper East Side reception celebrating the newspaper's 125th anniversary. 
In a speech for the occasion, Mr. Bloomberg said he was there ''to celebrate my second favorite financial news outlet,'' which he said has ''always been on the cutting edge of financial journalism.''
Mr. Bloomberg has a standard response these days to inquiries about his interest in adding The F.T., currently owned by British company Pearson, to the financial media company that bears his name: ''In fact, people are always telling me I should buy the F.T.,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. He paused for comic affect, adding: ''I buy it everyday.''
The Empire State Building glowed in a pink hue to celebrate the bisque-colored paper that got its start in Britain on May 1, 1888. The TV host Charlie Rose and the British advertising executive Martin Sorrell were among the guests who sipped pink champagne and vodka-spiked pink lemonade in the airy courtyard of the Academy Mansion near Central Park, a live jazz band playing in the background.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bloomberg faulted The New York Times for failing to report on the victims of gun violence while its editorial page criticizes the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy. A day later, he seemed somewhat apologetic, fondly recounting The Times' founding and counting the paper among the ''three great newspapers'' including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal. ''You have to read all three and I do,'' he said. ''And then I read the papers that really matter, The New York Post and The Daily News.'' (Also a day later, The Times reported on the crime that the mayor complained the paper had ignored: the shooting death of Alphonza Bryant III, 17, in the South Bronx.)
Mr. Bloomberg has talked to aides about whether he should purchase The Financial Times Group, according to people close to the mayor. One sticking point is that the division includes a half interest in The Economist, which Mr. Bloomberg has long coveted. Under the co-ownership agreement, however, The Financial Times Group, has no editorial control over the magazine.
''Why would you buy it if you can't control it?'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a party in Washington on Saturday. When asked whether he wants to buy The F.T., he said: ''What do I know about newspapers?''
Marjorie Scardino, Pearson's longtime chief executive who once said the paper would be sold ''over my dead body,'' left the company on Dec. 31. John Fallon, a longtime executive on the education side of Pearson's global business, took over in January, sparking speculation that the ''go-to paper for the respectable broker and honest financier'' (in Mr. Bloomberg's words on Wednesday), would be put on the block. A company spokesman previously said Pearson was not exploring a sale of The F.T.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed' (through May 26) William Matthew Prior (1806-73), the subject of this fascinating exhibition, painted portraits in the ''American primitive'' mode. His paintings of solemn, pie-faced tots, stiffly posed yet animated by some inner mystery, are especially compelling. But he had the chops to paint like a well-trained academician too. He was also an abolitionist who, at some risk to his reputation, painted portraits of black people; they are among his best works. And he was into spiritualism, and was a savvy entrepreneur as well. He was, altogether, a most remarkable character. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Asia Society: 'The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry, and Politics in 17th-Century China' (through June 2) With the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, China's intellectual elite, many of them artists who worked in the imperial government, were thrown into a tailspin. Confucian ethics demanded filial devotion to the old regime. But how were they to demonstrate it? One way was to remove themselves from active life and signal their resistance through art. How they did so is the subject of this compellingly fine-grained painting show. Some artists sacrificed their lives for principles; others used recluse status as a career move. The emotional weight, psychological depth and intellectual complexity of the work of this time is what comes through here. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Fine Lines: American Drawings From the Brooklyn Museum' (through May 26) Although marred by the tone-deaf exhibition design usual to this museum, the first large display of American drawings from its collection spans over 150 years with more than 100 sheets and six sketchbooks. Well-known artists like Winslow Homer, Ralph Blakelock and Louise Nevelson are well represented, but less familiar figures like Joseph Frank Currier, Louis Bouché and Chaim Gross contribute equally to its excellence. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'John Singer Sargent Watercolors' (through July 28) Sargent fans and watercolor hobbyists will be in heaven with this exhibition's more than 90 watercolors from the first decade of the 20th century, all from the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and all representing picturesque scenes in Europe. Sargent pioneered the kind of loosely gestural yet clearly representational watercolor painting that today's popular culture adores. He has his detractors, though, who may profit from re-examining their prejudices in light of this beautiful show. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria, where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes many of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
The Frick Collection: 'Piero della Francesca in America' (through May 19) Reuniting six panels from an altarpiece by Piero, this ravishing show approximates an intimate quattrocento chapel in the Frick's grand Oval Room. At the center of the installation is a seventh painting, the Clark Art Institute's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels,'' which comes from a different altarpiece in the painter's hometown, Sansepolcro, and exemplifies Piero's uncanny orchestration of figures, architecture and religious symbolism. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2012: Danh Vo' (through May 27) Known mostly for attenuated, elliptical works, this year's Hugo Boss recipient opts for density and robustness with a display of some 4,000 items that once belonged to the artist Martin Wong (1946-99). Installed wonder-cabinet style in a shelf-lined gallery, the items range from art to artifact to tchotchkes; leap across cultures; and trickle from high to low, where racial stereotypes and kitsch frequently take over. It gives us an artist who has decided to function as a curator and an archaeologist and to keep the honor of his prize in motion. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia' (through May 22) American museums are increasingly collecting contemporary art from outside the Western Hemisphere, and the Guggenheim, supported by the financial corporation UBS, is leading the pack. This inaugural show in the acquisitions campaign highlights work from South and Southeast Asia. Certain artists -- like Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand -- have international reputations. Others, like the sculptor Tang Da Wu, from Singapore, and the painter Aung Myint, from Myanmar, both born in 1940s, are less familiar. Nearly all the work of the roughly two dozen artists refers in partisan, political and personal ways to specific histories. The inclusion of those histories in our art museums is long, long overdue. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints' (through June 9) Contemporary provocateurs could learn a thing or two from the venerable artists in ''Edo Pop,'' who mixed high and low culture in arch and urbane ways. In this show's 100 or so ukiyo-e, or color woodblock prints (drawn from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts), valiant samurai turn out to be Kabuki actors in costume; refined landscapes depict well-trodden tourist sites; and images of classical beauties accompanied by poems are more often than not portraits of courtesans. These spirited images bring to life Edo Japan's ''floating world,'' a sort of Renaissance of popular entertainment. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'James Nares: Street' (through May 27) Far from pedestrian, this show revolves around a ravishing, 61-minute video projection by the artist James Nares. Called ''Street,'' it consists of long, slow-motion pans of people going about their business on the sidewalks and streets of New York City. To go with it, Mr. Nares combed through the museum's permanent collection and came up with a fascinating array of thematically related photographs, prints, paintings and drawings having largely to do with human and vehicular traffic. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Velázquez's Portrait of Duke Francesco I d'Este: A Masterpiece from the Galleria Estense, Modena' (through July 14) This single-painting exhibition highlights a portrait made at a delicate diplomatic moment during the Thirty Years' War; the painting is on loan to the Met in part because the museum that normally houses it, the Galleria Estense in Modena, is repairing damage from a 2012 earthquake. It's a chance to see another commanding Velázquez at this already well-stocked museum, and to appreciate that this artist's politically savvy portraits are more than just tools of statesmanship. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity' (through May 27) The title may suggest a double-dose of pandering, but the show itself is a stunning combination of great paintings, ravishing gowns, historical clarity and pitch-perfect contextualizing. Demonstrating how the Impressionists and more conservative painters alike used the latest fashions to define their sitters as real people, it builds fascinating webs of new information and viewpoints around some of the best-known, most beloved paintings of all time, quite a few of which don't often travel to this country. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Degas, Miss La La and the Cirque Fernando' (through May 12) Viewers catching their first glimpse of ''Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando'' will tend to agree with an early Degas biographer who called the painting ''one of his most surprising canvases.'' But after a close look at this curious 1879 picture of an aerialist hanging from a rope by her teeth (on loan from the National Gallery in London, and displayed with related studies, sketchbooks, circus programs and other ephemera), they will recognize Degas's skeptical eye and classical perspective on modern entertainment. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store' and 'Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum, Ray Gun Wing' (through Aug. 5) Pop Art is based on two things: ordinariness and eating. It's about daily consumption; the democratic appetite, ravenous for meat, sweets, life on the street, and getting more of everything, cheap. No artist cooked up a tastier version of the primal Pop recipe than Claes Oldenburg did in New York in the late 1950s and early '60s. The art he made in that brief, fecund time is the focus of a two-meals-for-the-price-of-one MoMA feast. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' (through May 26) History is written by the winners, which in contemporary art usually means the market. It's often also written by people who weren't on the scene and have to take the winners' word for what happened and what mattered. Such is the case with this retrospective show that too often favors the currently best-selling survivors of a fraught era over many now less well-known on-the-ground players. There's good art here, but the spirit of a furiously skeptical utopian moment -- very high, very low -- rarely breaks through the institutional nostalgia. And the chance to probe some market myths -- exactly how political was that 1993 ''political'' Whitney Biennial? -- is lost. Like all surveys of the immediate past, ''NYC 1993'' will get everyone kvetching, and it's a must-see, if only to find ways to bring the story into the present differently. Nari Ward's 1993 installation ''Amazing Grace'' in the New Museum's next-door space is for the ages. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (through June 2) This American artist, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on for eight years, even after it had been extracted from her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says no. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivot point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular work, work flowed toward it and from it.

Mary Grigoriadis: 'Strokescapes: 1970s-1980s' (through May 18) This splendid little exhibition showcases early warning signs of the Pattern and Decoration movement of the early 1970s, which signaled that American painting could be other than abstract and minimal. Their bright symmetrical designs draw on a host of multicultural sources while exploring still-current concerns with the materials and methods of paintings. They are seen here with later, more free-form and spatially active paintings from the 1980s, forming a group that packs a visual punch.

Peter Piller: 'Umschläge' (through May 18) This metaphorically charged installation of photographic works could be titled ''Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.'' Colored diptychs copied from an East German military magazine picture an attractive woman on one side and some kind of impressive military weaponry like tanks, cannons and rockets on the other. Grainy black-and-white photographs of ocean waves and devastated World War I battlefields expand the mythic implications. Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com.

One room contains objects made of lead, rubber, wood and stone produced by basic procedures like cutting, folding and tearing. A second gallery features works made by propping up four-by-four-foot lead panels and a single slab of hot-rolled steel, eight feet tall and 24 feet long, that juts from a corner into the room with grand implacability.

Giosetta Fioroni: 'L'Argento' (through June 3) This first American survey of Giosetta Fioroni reveals that we still have much to learn about postwar Italian art, despite recent gallery exhibitions of Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni, Giorgio Griffa, Gianni Colombo and Luigi Ghirri and museum shows of Michelangelo Pistoletto and Alighiero Boetti. In the silvery, evanescent paintings, drawings and films of Ms. Fioroni, who was born in Rome in 1932, we see how American Pop's celebrities and commodities took on new meanings in a post-Fascist society.

Jane Alexander: 'Surveys (From the Cape of Good Hope)' (through July 29) The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is an occupied zone this spring, with a transient population of unearthly beings camped out in its chapels and aisles. Neither angels nor devils, though suggesting both, the figures in the sculptural tableaus and related photographs were all created by the South African artist Jane Alexander. And while haunted by her country's history of apartheid, the work has no single meaning, no sum-upable content. Instead, painstakingly calibrated ambiguity leaves this strange and wonderful show open to political speculation and spiritual interpretation.

Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

'Albrecht Dürer: Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints from the Albertina' (through June 9) Albrecht Dürer had it all: the eye of a Raphael, the brains of a Leonardo, the looks of a cleaned-up Kurt Cobain. Traditionally, the category of great artist implies great painter, and Dürer was that, though there's reason to think that he was at his most inventive, involved and expansive in his works on paper. Evidence for that argument is in this startlingly generous loan exhibition of more than 100 works on paper that includes some of his best known images. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Montclair Art Museum: 'Oscar Bluemner's America: Picturing Paterson, New Jersey' (through June 16) This lovely, small show presents works dating from 1910 to 1917 when the American Modernist Bluemner was catching up on European avant-garde developments. He combined realism and Cubism in paintings of farm buildings in rural landscapes and the industrial architecture of Paterson, his hometown. Favoring glowing reds and blues and opaque blacks, he painted images that seem illuminated from within like modern stained-glass windows. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Montclair Art Museum: 'The New Spirit: American Art in the Armory Show, 1913' (through June 16) One hundred years ago the Armory Show opened in Manhattan, introducing to Americans the shocking works of van Gogh, Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse and Duchamp and other European avant-gardists along with less adventurous efforts by hundreds of homegrown artists. This much more modest, centennial show presents a selection of works by artists who were included, most of them Americans. Paintings by Edward Hopper, Marsden Hartley and John Sloan stand out, but a small, vibrant pastoral scene by Matisse shows how far behind the avant-garde curve the Americans lagged. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org.

&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Great and Mighty Things: Outsider Art From the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection' (through June 9) One good turn generates another: the gift of a beloved, finely calibrated collection of American outsider art to a major encyclopedic museum is celebrated with an equally excellent exhibition of same. It displays around 200 paintings, sculptures, drawings and assemblages, made mostly from the 1930s to the '80s by 27 outsiders, both renowned and less prominent. All are seen here at or close to their best, pressing against the increasingly unjustifiable division between outsider and inside. 2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
'Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Art and Design, 1848-1900' (through May 19) A large and well-done survey of paintings, drawings, books, furnishings, textiles and even stained glass includes such classics as John Everett Millais's ''Ophelia'' and Henry Wallis's ''Chatterton.'' It also enables a clear assessment of England's ever-popular mid-19th-century art movement, whose legacy is fittingly full of contradictions. Using brazenly modern colors, the brotherhood nonetheless turned toward the past, fashioning a nostalgic, literary, costume-heavy, clichéd style that demeaned women. The best works here are the landscapes, which are unfortunately in short supply.

It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos.

Last Chance
'Engines of War' (closes on Saturday) War doesn't suddenly happen; it never stops. That's the premise of ''Engines of War,'' a strong, carefully shaped group exhibition about American militarism. Made up primarily of photographs, the show comes across less as outright polemic than as a gathering of data for a complex argument, with viewpoints that constantly shift.

&#x2605; Yael Bartana: 'And Europe Will Be Stunned' (closes on Saturday) A hit at the last Venice Biennale, this video trilogy now forms an impressive New York gallery for its Israel creator. Superbly carried out, it presents a strangely perfect, perfectly disturbing, yet ineffably wry confusion of ideology, geography, propaganda and history. Its narrative concerns a kind of reverse Zionism intended to return Jews to Poland, includes a young leader, his funeral and a 1930s-style kibbutz, built by wholesome-looking youths on ground where the Warsaw ghetto once stood.

&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Gutai: Splendid Playground' (closes on Wednesday) The first large, in-depth examination of Japan's best-known postwar art movement is a mind-shifting event that brings together all the mediums it encompassed, brilliantly interwoven. The eccentrically made paintings suggest that Japan produced Abstract Expressionism's strongest second generation, the artists who most convincingly and directly extended Pollock's innovative drip technique. But the show reveals little-known precedents for Happenings, Minimalism and various strains of Post-Minimalism. It should permanently dislodge any notion of postwar modernism as a strictly Western phenomenon. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
International Center of Photography: 'Roman Vishniac Rediscovered' (closes on Sunday) After World War II, Roman Vishniac's widely published photographs of Orthodox Jews living in Eastern Europe in the 1930s came to signify in popular imagination the human essence of what the Nazis' genocidal program destroyed. Drawn from an archive of more than 30,000 items donated to the museum over the past two decades by his daughter, Mara Vishniac Kohn, this exhibition rounds out and fills in Vishniac's story. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; William Leavitt: 'Space Junk' (closes on Saturday) With paintings that conflate images of Zion National Park and Best Western motel décor, and sculptures that look like outtakes from 1950s and '60s Southern California domestic interiors and ''Star Trek'' sets, William Leavitt gives a new twist to the notion of the Last Frontier. This Los Angeles-based artist last had a New York solo in 1981. It's nice to have him back. His theater piece, ''Habitat,'' will be performed at the Kitchen on May 24 and May 25.

&#x2605; Joshua Marsh: 'As If' and Johannes DeYoung: 'Ego Loser' (closes on Saturday) Mr. Marsh makes uncommonly beautiful paintings of ordinary objects. With an exquisitely sensuous touch and using luminous colors, he isolates, simplifies and flattens things like pitchers, brooms and dustpans to the brink of pure yet sumptuous abstraction. Mr. DeYoung's ''Ego Loser'' is a darkly comical, claymation-style video projection in which a hideous man utters self-help mantras from low-end sources. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-0156, baileygallery.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Scott Olson' (closes on Saturday) Scott Olson's abstract paintings look fragile and ethereal, even though they can be traced back to vigorous physical processes. Mr. Olson, who is based in Ohio, builds his own frames from local trees, and works in a combination of oil, wax and marble dust on wood. He strips down his surfaces as often as he builds them up, painting in brightly colored, irregular shapes and then sanding into near oblivion. This split personality adds intrigue to what would otherwise be modest little throwbacks to early modernism. Wallspace, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 594-9478, wallspacegallery.com. (Rosenberg)
'Open Work in Latin America, New York & Beyond: Conceptualism Reconsidered, 1967-1978' (closes on Sunday) Conceptual Art of the 1960s and '70s was an international phenomenon, with particularly rich developments in the Western Hemisphere. This show, organized by Harper Montgomery, professor of modern and contemporary Latin American art at Hunter College, with a group of graduate students, focuses on Latin American exemplars of the dematerializing impulse. Some of them settled in New York City; others, like Clemente Padin, Artur Barrio and the Brazilian collagist Anna Bella Geiger, stayed at home and are only beginning to get the attention they deserve.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Profit Falls 14% As It Speaks of Progress

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors said on Thursday that its net income declined 14 percent to $865 million in the first quarter, as it earned less money than a year ago in the surging North American car market.
G.M., the nation's largest automaker, said global revenue dropped 2 percent during the quarter to $36.9 billion, despite a concerted effort to introduce new models in the United States and Europe.
The automaker's core North American operations achieved a pretax profit of $1.4 billion, a 14 percent decline from the year-ago period. 
But the company beat analysts' earnings expectations and said it had narrowed losses in Europe during the quarter. G.M. shares rose 3 percent to close at $31.16 on Thursday.
G.M. has struggled to rebuild its business since the recession, when it needed a $49.5 billion government bailout and bankruptcy to survive. The automaker has since cut brands, models and thousands of jobs to bring costs more in line with production and sales.
The company's chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, said the decline in earnings and revenue did not reflect the progress G.M. was making with new models in the marketplace.
''The year is off to a strong start as we increased our global share with strong new products that are attracting customers around the world,'' Mr. Akerson said in a statement.
G.M. lost market share in the United States last year to competitors like Chrysler and Toyota. Mr. Akerson has vowed to reverse that trend this year with vehicles like the new Cadillac ATS sedan and restyled versions of its big pickup trucks.
Comparisons between G.M. and Ford offer a stark contrast in how the two biggest Detroit automakers are managing their global business. Ford, the smaller of the two, has surpassed G.M. in growth and profitability at home, while the situation is reversed in Europe.
In the first quarter, Ford earned an average of $3,200 in pretax profit on each of the 761,000 vehicles it sold in North America, while G.M. earned about $1,700 on the 829,000 cars and trucks it sold in the region.
But in Europe, Ford's loss widened in the first quarter to $462 million. G.M. reduced its European losses by 40 percent to $175 million.
The hottest competition between the companies is in the expanding pickup market in the United States.
Ford said on Thursday that it would add 2,000 jobs this year at its truck plant in Kansas City, Mo., and add a third shift of workers to build its industry-leading F-series pickup.
G.M. is transitioning to new versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups. But G.M. executives said on Thursday that there were no plans to increase truck production because a pickup plant in Texas was already operating at less than capacity.
Mr. Akerson said G.M. had improved its accounting and regional framework to focus on more profitable vehicles and markets. The company is building more plants in China and is making a big push to increase sales of its Cadillac luxury brand.
''We're a very healthy company that's getting stronger each quarter,'' he said in a call with analysts Thursday.
In Asia, the company said pretax profits were about $495 million, slightly less than a year ago. South American operations had a pretax loss of $38 million, in contrast to a profit of $153 million last year.

HEADLINE: The Corporate Tax Game

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats in Washington rarely agree on anything these days. But in recent months almost everyone seems to have coalesced around the notion that the corporate tax system is broken and needs to be fixed.
President Obama is for it. So are the two leaders of the tax-writing committees in Congress: the House Ways and Means chairman, Dave Camp, a Republican, and Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who plans to retire next year and may be seeking a capstone for his career. The country's biggest companies have declared loudly that they are in favor of revising the nation's business tax system, too.
Despite the widespread support, the campaign for an overhaul is exposing deep fault lines within the business world that suggest it may fall apart. The problem is how to pay for everything lawmakers and businesses want without adding to the deficit.
The main goal of the advocates on both sides of the aisle is to lower the official corporate top rate from 35 percent, the highest among industrialized nations. Republican leaders and a large number of giant companies also want to end what they regard as the noxious practice of taxing the profits that multinational corporations earn abroad. The United States is one of the few countries to do so. 
The only way to tackle such goals without losing revenue, however, is to close specific corporate tax preferences intended to promote various activities considered worthwhile by their supporters. There is plenty of money to be found: a Government Accountability Office study in March estimated the 80 or so business tax exemptions added up to about $181 billion in 2011, roughly the same size as total corporate tax revenue.
Yet each of these corporate tax breaks is worth a fortune to the industries they benefit -- and fierce campaigning is under way, employing teams of lobbyists in Washington, to keep them in place.
''It is going to be practically impossible to get the rate down,'' said Howard Gleckman, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ''No one wants to cut their preferences.''
Since the last reduction in United States corporate tax rates, in 1986, other nations have reduced their own business rates; corporations complain this is putting them at a sharp competitive disadvantage. In reality, though, few companies pay the official rate.
Many pay at a much lower effective rate, taking advantage of numerous tax breaks and loopholes and using aggressive tax strategies to shift profits to more generous tax territories abroad. Among the companies benefiting from lower effective rates is General Electric, which has paid total corporate taxes -- federal, state, local and foreign -- equal to 17.9 percent of its cumulative $81 billion in earnings over the last five years, according to an analysis by S&P Capital IQ.
FedEx paid 20.1 percent, Amazon.com 6.6 percent and Ford Motor 4.2 percent. G.E. said its tax rate was unusually low over this period because it had big losses during the financial crisis. FedEx said it took advantage of temporary incentives to make new investments.
Congress, under relentless pressure from business interests, has allowed corporate taxes to dwindle as a source of revenue. In 2012, they amounted to about 1.6 percent of gross domestic product, half the level collected in 1970. By comparison, the individual income tax generated 7.3 percent of G.D.P. last year.
Many industrialized countries collect more than that percentage, although they, too, have to contend with a competitive globalized world where multinational companies can shift profits beyond the reach of local tax authorities.
''Income is increasingly difficult to nail down,'' said Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University. ''It is like nailing jelly to the wall. And the problem is only going to get worse rather than better.''
The two biggest corporate tax breaks are for accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment, which saved corporations an estimated $76 billion in 2011, and deferral of foreign source income.
Deferral allows big multinational corporations to postpone paying United States taxes on foreign earnings until they bring those profits home. It saved them $41 billion in 2011. American corporations had amassed about $1.7 trillion in offshore profits by last year, analysts at JPMorgan Chase estimated, a figure that is now believed to be almost $2 trillion.
Mr. Obama wants to claw some of this back by imposing a minimum tax on foreign earnings.
A new coalition called LIFT America started a campaign last month to prevent that from happening. They want the United States to adopt what is called a territorial system, in which companies pay taxes on profits only in the country where they were earned, in line with the practice in many other nations.
''It is not a tax that our competitors pay when they bring profits home to their countries,'' said Claire Buchan Parker, a spokeswoman for LIFT America, which includes international powerhouses like Coca-Cola and Hewlett-Packard.
Last month, the Business Roundtable, which represents mostly big businesses, started a separate lobbying campaign, called Home Court Advantage, to adopt a territorial tax system as well as a lower rate.
Another coalition, called Reforming America's Taxes Equitably, or Rate, which includes more domestic-oriented companies like AT&T and Macy's, is less interested in getting rid of the United States' worldwide tax system. Instead, it is concentrating on lowering the corporate tax rate, proposing to pay for it by ending many domestic tax breaks. But it will not say yet exactly which loopholes its members would surrender to make up the lost tax revenue.
To make the numbers work, economists say, Rate's plan would inevitably need tax revenue from the multinationals' foreign earnings -- revenue that the multinationals are eager to save for themselves, of course.
''We have different coalitions with different interests,'' said Edward D. Kleinbard, former chief of staff of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. ''That makes it difficult for the coalitions to speak with one voice.''
In Congress, Mr. Camp, the Michigan Republican who runs the Ways and Means Committee, favors a 25 percent corporate tax rate and elimination of the worldwide system. He wants to pass a bill out of the committee this year, and Speaker John A. Boehner says he will give priority to any debate about rewriting the tax code.
''Companies have testified before the committee that they are willing to put everything on the table in tax reform,'' Mr. Camp said in an e-mailed response to questions, suggesting there would indeed be enough revenue generated by closing loopholes and generally tidying up the tax code. But companies and trade groups are bombarding the committee with outside comments, underlining the difficulties of getting everyone to agree on a formula for change.
For example, the Retail Industry Leaders Association wants to eliminate all loopholes, because retailers benefit from few tax breaks. But the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers are fighting to preserve many of them, including the research and development tax credit, which yielded $8.3 billion in tax savings in 2011, according to the G.A.O.
The National Association of Water Companies wants to protect the tax deduction on borrowing, another preference that saves companies billions. And a trade association for oil and gas suppliers, Western Energy Alliance, is defending tax subsidies for fossil fuels against Mr. Obama's budget proposal to end them, potentially raising $44 billion over 10 years.
Another powerful constituency -- made up of businesses that are not organized as corporations -- is preparing to fight for its turf, adding to the opposition to an overhaul. After the previous tax reform in 1986, thousands of companies shifted to this status; these pass-through entities still benefit from many corporate tax breaks but often pay a lower personal rate of taxation. Their numbers have increased so much that they now account for more than half of net business profits, according to the Tax Policy Center.
They are now worried that they will be singled out to help pay for a corporate tax overhaul.
According to a study last year by the Joint Committee on Taxation, even if Congress eliminated many corporate tax deductions, it could not push the official rate below 28 percent. (At the time, Mr. Camp described the study as incomplete, and some analysts say there may be loopholes to close beyond the official list.) Still, given corporations' opposition to getting rid of their panoply of cherished tax breaks, any rate cut could be vanishingly thin, undermining the whole point of the exercise.
Robert S. McIntyre, director of the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice, says he thinks most of the interest in changing the corporate tax system is actually being driven by entrepreneurial lobbyists who sense an opportunity to generate extra business from various interest groups. If any bill managed to get through Congress, he argues, it would happen only because lawmakers had ignored the prescription to keep the overhaul from losing revenue.
''They don't care about the deficit,'' he said. ''They just care about their own corporate taxes.''

HEADLINE: Handpicked Skeptic to Pitch Hardball Questions at Buffett

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
In most years, Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting is a weekend-long ode to capitalism and generally a lovefest for Warren E. Buffett.
But on Saturday, a hedge fund manager handpicked by the billionaire himself will try to add some skepticism to the proceedings.
''It's fair to say that I'm Daniel in the lion's den,'' Douglas A. Kass, the head of Seabreeze Partners Management, said on Thursday in the middle of his trip to Nebraska. ''But I've prepared intensely.'' 
The addition of Mr. Kass, who is Berkshire's first credentialed bear and is betting that the company's stock will fall, is the latest adjustment to a formula that has been in place for decades. More than 18,000 shareholders flock to Omaha in early May every year, hoping to listen to what one of the country's most celebrated investors has to say.
Most years, shareholders have asked a wide range of largely softball questions, from the billionaire's thoughts on the global economy to his religious beliefs.
But Mr. Buffett has tried to toughen up the questioning at the annual meeting, a 180-degree turn from what the majority of publicly traded companies seek to do. He has asked reporters, including one from The New York Times, and analysts to ask tougher questions.
Inviting Mr. Kass, 64, is perhaps the boldest move yet. The hedge fund manager is best known for his frequently contrarian positions, often on display in appearances on television shows about business and in his column on TheStreet.com. Mr. Kass has also pointed to his time working for Ralph Nader while a student.
''See if you can drive the stock down 10 percent,'' Mr. Buffett teased his new foil during a CNBC interview in March.
Mr. Kass has repeatedly explored Berkshire's weaknesses over the years, including a 2008 article on TheStreet.com. Among his arguments at the time were Mr. Buffett's advanced age and the company's slowing growth.
Mr. Kass maintains a short position on Berkshire's shares, whose size he declined to disclose other than to describe it as average-size for him. But he spent the last month reading up on Mr. Buffett and his company, and as of Thursday was winnowing 25 potential questions down to six.
Two, he contended, would generate big news if Mr. Buffett answers them. The others have not been asked before, he said.
All the while, Mr. Kass said, he has remained an admirer of Mr. Buffett, sometimes referred to as the Oracle of Omaha. Since beginning his research, manager Mr. Kass has found a number of similarities with Mr. Buffett. For example, both have been treated for prostate cancer, and both once collected discarded horse-racing tickets at tracks in their younger days.
For his first trip to the Berkshire meeting, Mr. Kass is bringing his son and a group of friends.
''I'm psyched,'' he said. ''It's like the financial World Series to me.''
Apart from Mr. Kass, many elements of previous Berkshire meetings will be in place again this year. Mr. Buffett, 82, is likely to reiterate that his company -- a huge conglomerate that counts railroads, private jets and running shoes among its holdings -- has a succession plan in place for when he finally hangs up his investor's hat. (He's unlikely to say who will succeed him as chief executive.)
He will also most likely discuss his hunger to strike more big deals, one of his signature corporate moves. Neither of his acquisitions this year appears to qualify for the giant takeovers he craves: Berkshire teamed up with a Brazilian investment firm to buy H. J. Heinz for $23 billion, and it bought the 20 percent of the Israeli tool maker IMC that it did not already own for about $2 billion.
''It's back to work; Charlie and I have again donned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants,'' Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual investor letter, referring to his longtime investing partner, Charles T. Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman.
He is also expected to discuss his recent newspaper buying spree, having bought 28 dailies over the last year and a half for $344 million. While the acquisition campaign is not the most expensive he has ever conducted, Mr. Buffett has described himself as an addict who sees value in local news.
It is unclear whether he will be asked about another new move: into social media. On Thursday at 11:20 a.m. Omaha time, Mr. Buffett overcame a famous aversion to technology by posting his first message on Twitter. ''Warren is in the house,'' he wrote as a camera for Fortune magazine hovered over his shoulder, capturing every tap.
By late afternoon, his post had been reposted more than 25,000 times, and his nascent Twitter account had drawn 176,000 followers. Among them is Mr. Kass, a prolific user of Twitter who has been documenting his passage to Omaha.
The foray was a surprise, given that Mr. Buffett once claimed he missed an important message about Lehman Brothers because he did not know how to check his phone's voice mail.
''I guess he's not as much of a Luddite as he professes,'' Mr. Kass said.
Mr. Buffett dryly hinted that Twitter had a little more in its favor than other platforms.
''The co-founder came from Nebraska,'' he said, in an apparent reference to a Twitter co-founder, Evan Williams. ''So it can't all be bad.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lifts Ban on Visas for Burmese Officials

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration lifted a sweeping ban on visas for officials from Myanmar on Thursday, further easing sanctions against the country despite growing fears that ethnic violence is threatening its nascent steps toward democracy. 
Lifting the ban, first imposed in 1996, is the latest effort by the administration to reward Myanmar after its president, Thein Sein, began to open its political system and economy in 2011 after decades of military rule.
The State Department said in a statement that the move was intended ''to strengthen and encourage further reform'' in Myanmar, also known as a matter of American policy by its former name, Burma. The United States last year lifted most sanctions that limited trade between the two countries, though military commanders and companies affiliated with the military still face sanctions targeting human-rights abuses, drug trafficking and arms sales. Although the State Department never published the names of those banned, the restrictions on traveling to the United States applied to hundreds of military officers and other officials who were part of the country's military dictatorship, as well as their families.
Mr. Thein Sein, removed from the list of banned officials last year, is scheduled to meet Mr. Obama during his first visit to Washington this month, according to administration and Congressional officials. He has been traveling extensively to encourage investment, but continues to face questions about the depth of changes. A United Nations envoy in Geneva warned in March that while Myanmar had made significant progress, the eruption of mob violence against Muslims and continuing civil wars were undermining its transition to democracy. In central Myanmar, a man was killed Wednesday in a new outbreak of sectarian violence, in which Buddhist mobs destroyed property owned by Muslims, Reuters reported.
The euphoria that has greeted the release of political prisoners, most prominently Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who now serves in Parliament, and the lifting of many draconian laws on unions and the media over the last two years has increasingly faded. State Department officials declined to discuss publicly those concerns or the reasons for lifting the travel ban now.
The European Union lifted most of its sanctions against Myanmar last month, a move that was criticized as premature by Human Rights Watch. In Washington, human rights advocates and lawmakers have supported the administration's strategy to ease sanctions step by step, but some worry that Myanmar was no longer doing enough to merit more rewards. ''While I'm still waiting to hear details of these and other potential moves,'' Representative Joseph Crowley, a Democrat from New York, said in a statement, ''I urge the administration to stick to its policy of action for action.''

HEADLINE: Obama Picks Nominees for Commerce Dept. and Trade Representative

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama rounded out his second-term cabinet choices on Thursday, nominating Penny Pritzker, his longtime financial backer and an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, to be commerce secretary, and Michael Froman, a law school friend and White House adviser on international economics, as trade representative.
Mr. Obama introduced his two friends in a Rose Garden announcement just before departing for a three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica, along with Mr. Froman. With Mr. Obama's nomination on Monday of Anthony R. Foxx, the mayor of Charlotte, N.C., to be transportation secretary, he has now completed his selections for a cabinet depleted by departures after his first term. 
Several nominees, including the new ones, still need Senate confirmation. Republicans will closely scrutinize Ms. Pritzker's financial record, as Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa made plain in a statement after the announcement.
''Every nominee's offshore tax avoidance activities should be examined as part of the nomination process,'' he said, suggesting that Ms. Pritzker is ''associated with the kind of tax avoidance activity that the president dismisses as fat cat shenanigans for others.''
Ms. Pritzker, a longtime Chicago donor and fund-raiser for Mr. Obama, had been expected to be his pick for the long-vacant Commerce Department post, but vetting of her substantial financial assets and ties delayed a formal announcement, administration aides have said. She was a leading candidate for commerce secretary after Mr. Obama's election in 2008, but withdrew from contention amid the public scrutiny at the time.
On Thursday the president signaled confidence that Ms. Pritzker would be confirmed by joking about it. Noting that Ms. Pritzker's nomination coincided with her 54th birthday, he quipped, ''For your birthday present you get to go through confirmation.'' After a comedic pause, he added with a chuckle, ''It's going to be great.''
With Ms. Pritzker, Mr. Obama would bring a woman and a voice for business interests into a cabinet that has been criticized in the past as having too few of either. Even so, the president of the National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill, issued a statement immediately after the announcement saying that ''the numbers are good, but not great,'' since women are 51 percent of the population but about one-third of the cabinet.
''NOW is particularly concerned that the main group of advisers who have the president's ear not just on occasion, but three, four, five times a day, is still overwhelmingly male,'' she added.
Ms. Pritzker, a longtime business and civic leader in Chicago, would head perhaps the most eclectic department in the government, with wide-ranging responsibility that includes federal business programs, oceans policy, weather forecasting and travel and tourism. In Democratic and Republican administrations, the commerce secretary is often best known as a president's emissary to the business community and political donors.
The commerce post had been vacant for nearly a year, since the businessman John E. Bryson resigned for medical reasons in June; his deputy, Rebecca M. Blank, has been acting secretary since then. Ms. Blank, an academic, is leaving to become chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
Ms. Pritzker is chairwoman and chief executive of PSP Capital Partners and its affiliate, Pritzker Realty Group, and chairwoman of Artemis Real Estate Partners. During Mr. Obama's first term, she served on his Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and on his Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Mr. Obama credited her on Thursday as ''the driving force'' behind his Skills for America's Future initiative to connect businesses and community colleges to develop a work force with the skills employers need.
Mr. Froman, who is 50, has served in the White House as the deputy national security adviser for international economics since Mr. Obama first took office. Although the post was not a cabinet position, Mr. Froman had proximity to the president and a portfolio thicker than that of the cabinet-rank trade representative, encompassing not only trade but also international development and climate change issues.
Mr. Froman had planned to keep his White House post in the second term, and Mr. Obama initially intended to nominate Jeffrey D. Zients, a businessman who had been the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, to be trade representative. But opposition to Mr. Zients from Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which would handle his nomination, scuttled it. Mr. Baucus objected to Mr. Zients's oversight of a government-reorganization study that recommended changes that would have affected the committee's jurisdiction, according to administration and Congressional aides.
Mr. Froman's inclusion with Mr. Obama for the trip to Mexico and Costa Rica reflects his current leading role in international economic affairs. He has been the president's ''sherpa,'' making preparations for past and coming global economic summit meetings. He also oversees economic relations with Europe, Japan and the developing BRIC bloc -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- and development policies for Africa and the Middle East.
Administration officials said Mr. Froman would retain some of those responsibilities.
On Thursday, Mr. Obama gave Mr. Froman credit, along with the man he would succeed as trade representative, Ron Kirk, for finishing free trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, all of which were begun in the Bush administration. The foremost issues for the new trade representative will be to negotiate trade liberalization deals with Europe and the Pacific Rim region.
''He has won the respect of our trading partners around the world,'' Mr. Obama said of Mr. Froman. ''He has also won a reputation as being an extraordinarily tough negotiator while doing it.''
Labor groups generally have had good if occasionally testy relations with Mr. Froman, but a liberal group, Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, assailed his ''corporate agenda.'' Business groups issued statements praising him and Ms. Pritzker.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Caught in Swirl of Regulatory Woes

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Government investigators have found that JPMorgan Chase devised ''manipulative schemes'' that transformed ''money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers,'' and that one of its most senior executives gave ''false and misleading statements'' under oath.
The findings appear in a confidential government document, reviewed by The New York Times, that was sent to the bank in March, warning of a potential crackdown by the regulator of the nation's energy markets.
The possible action comes amid showdowns with other agencies. One of the bank's chief regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is weighing new enforcement actions against JPMorgan over the way the bank collected credit card debt and its possible failure to alert authorities to suspicions about Bernard L. Madoff, according to people who were not authorized to discuss the cases publicly.
In a meeting last month at the bank's Park Avenue headquarters, the comptroller's office delivered an unusually stark message to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive and chairman: the nation's biggest bank was quickly losing credibility in Washington. The bank's top lawyers, including Stephen M. Cutler, the general counsel, have also cautioned executives about the bank's regulatory problems, employees say. 
Mr. Dimon acknowledged in a recent letter to shareholders that ''unfortunately, we expect we will have more'' enforcement actions in ''the coming months.'' He apologized for letting ''our regulators down'' and vowed to ''do all the work necessary to complete the needed improvements.''
Still, the broad regulatory scrutiny -- at least eight federal agencies are investigating the bank -- presents a threat to JPMorgan at a time when it is raking in record profits.
For executives, the bank's transition from model citizen to problem child in the eyes of the government has been jarring. It has helped drive top managers out of the bank, and it could make a coming shareholder vote on whether to split the roles of chairman and chief executive an anxious test for Mr. Dimon, long the country's most influential banker.
Given the bank's strong earnings, investors are unlikely to pull out. Yet a growing number of shareholders say they are concerned about the regulatory problems.
In the energy market investigation, the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, intends to recommend that the agency pursue an action against JPMorgan over its trading in California and Michigan electric markets.
The 70-page document also took aim at a top bank executive, Blythe Masters. A seminal Wall Street figure, Ms. Masters is known for helping expand the boundaries of finance, including the development of credit default swaps, a derivative that played a role in the financial crisis.
The regulatory document cites her supposed ''knowledge and approval of schemes'' carried out by a group of energy traders in Houston. The agency's investigators claimed that Ms. Masters had ''falsely'' denied under oath her awareness of the problems and said that JPMorgan had made ''scores of false and misleading statements and material omissions'' to authorities, the document shows.
It is unclear whether the agency will file an action against JPMorgan based on the investigators' findings. A majority of the five-member commission must first endorse the case. If the regulator does proceed, it could fine the bank and Ms. Masters.
''We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees in this matter,'' said Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the bank. ''We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter.''
JPMorgan has until at least mid-May to respond to the accusations in the document.
As the bank fights the energy investigation, it says it is trying to rectify other lingering compliance woes.
Recent departures from the bank, however, could complicate that effort. Frank J. Bisignano, the co-chief operating officer known for cleaning up JPMorgan's troubled mortgage division after the 2008 financial crisis, announced his departure this week. Barry Koch, a senior lawyer with strong ties to law enforcement, is also expected to soon leave the bank, people close to Mr. Koch say.
Mr. Dimon's meeting with the comptroller's office last month further highlighted the bank's challenges with regulators.
In the credit card investigation, people briefed on the case said the comptroller's office had discovered that JPMorgan was relying on faulty documents when pursuing lawsuits against delinquent customers. The accusations, which are expected to prompt an enforcement action later this year, echo complaints that JPMorgan and rivals plowed through home foreclosures with little regard for accuracy.
In a separate investigation into JPMorgan's relationship with Mr. Madoff, the comptroller's office raised concerns that the company may have violated a federal law that requires banks to report suspicious transactions. Eventually, the people said, the agency could reprimand the bank for the potential oversight failures.
''We believe that the personnel who dealt with the Madoff issue acted in good faith,'' Ms. Lemkau, the bank spokeswoman, said.
Some bank analysts also note that JPMorgan's strong earnings could ameliorate concerns among its investors.
''As long as you're making money, investors don't care,'' said Paul Miller, a managing director at FBR.
Regulators, however, increasingly do care. When the comptroller's office sought documents in the Madoff case from JPMorgan, the bank declined, citing attorney-client privilege, according to bank employees. The dispute was then elevated to the Treasury Department's inspector general, which oversees the comptroller's office.
''The matter is pending,'' said Richard Delmar, a counsel to the inspector general.
The Madoff case, authorities say, exposed a recurring problem at JPMorgan -- what they say is its sometimes combative stance with regulators. In a recent report examining a $6 billion trading loss at the bank, Senate investigators faulted JPMorgan for briefly withholding documents from regulators. The trading loss has spawned several law enforcement investigations into the traders who created the faulty wager.
Mr. Dimon, who is not suspected of any wrongdoing, met this week with prosecutors and the F.B.I. to discuss the case, two people briefed on the investigation said.
A day before the Senate subcommittee released its report on the trading loss, JPMorgan received another ominous dispatch from Washington. On March 13, enforcement officials at FERC notified the bank that it planned to recommend an action over the power plant investigation.
JPMorgan is the latest big bank to face scrutiny from the energy regulator, which recently pursued actions against Barclays and Deutsche Bank. The cases reflect how the regulator has kept a more vigilant watch over the energy markets ever since the Enron fraud.
But Wall Street is fighting back against the new approach, casting the agency's enforcement unit as overzealous and overreaching.
The JPMorgan case arose, according to the document, after the bank's 2008 takeover of Bear Stearns gave the bank the rights to sell electricity from power plants in California and Michigan. It was a losing business that relied on ''inefficient'' and outdated technology, or as JPMorgan called it, ''an unprofitable asset.''
Yet under ''pressure to generate large profits,'' the agency's investigators said, traders in Houston devised a workaround. Adopting eight different ''schemes'' between September 2010 and June 2011, the traders offered the energy at prices ''calculated to falsely appear attractive'' to state energy authorities. The effort prompted authorities in California and Michigan to dole out about $83 million in ''excessive'' payments to JPMorgan, the investigators said. The behavior had ''harmful effects'' on the markets, according to the document.
JPMorgan disputes the claims, arguing that its trading was legal.
''The staff is challenging a bidding strategy that was transparent and was in full compliance with the applicable rules,'' said Ms. Lemkau, the bank's spokeswoman. ''We strongly disagree with the staff's conclusions.''
For now, according to the document, the enforcement officials plan to recommend that the commission hold the traders and Ms. Masters ''individually liable.'' While Ms. Masters was ''less involved in the day-to-day decisions,'' investigators nonetheless noted that she received PowerPoint presentations and e-mails outlining the energy trading strategies.
The bank, investigators said, then ''planned and executed a systematic cover-up'' of documents that exposed the strategy, including profit and loss statements.
In the March document, the government investigators also complained about what they said was obstruction by Ms. Masters. After the state authorities began to object to the strategy, Ms. Masters ''personally participated in JPMorgan's efforts to block'' the state authorities ''from understanding the reasons behind JPMorgan's bidding schemes,'' the document said.
The investigators also referenced an April 2011 e-mail in which Ms. Masters ordered a ''rewrite'' of an internal document that raised questions about whether the bank had run afoul of the law. The new wording stated that ''JPMorgan does not believe that it violated FERC's policies.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Narrows on Lower Oil Imports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States trade deficit narrowed in March for a second month as the daily flow of imported crude oil dropped to the lowest level in 17 years. 
The deficit with China hit a three-year low.
The overall trade deficit decreased to $38.83 billion, an 11 percent drop from $43.6 billion in February, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
Exports fell 0.9 percent, to $184.3 billion as sales of machinery, autos and farm products all declined.
Imports fell 2.8 percent, to $223.1 billion, led by a 4.4 percent drop in foreign petroleum. Crude oil imports averaged just seven million barrels a day, the lowest since March 1996.
A smaller trade gap can increase overall economic growth as American companies earn more from overseas sales while American consumers and businesses spend less on foreign products.
For the first three months of this year, the trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $507.7 billion, 5.9 percent below last year's deficit of $539.5 billion. Economists are looking for the deficit to narrow slightly this year, in part because they expect continued gains in American exports.
Analysts said the lower-than-expected deficit in March will most likely give a slight boost to overall economic growth for the January-March quarter. The government's first estimate put economic growth at 2.5 percent in the first quarter but some analysts said that could be revised up to perhaps 2.7 percent because of the lower trade deficit in March.
The politically vulnerable deficit with China shrank 23.6 percent in March, to $17.9 billion, still far above the imbalance with any other country.
Separately, the Labor Department reported Thursday that the productivity of American workers barely grew from January through March after shrinking in the final three months of 2012. Weak productivity growth could prompt employers to hire more if consumers and businesses continue to increase spending.
Worker productivity rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.7 percent in the first quarter, after shrinking 1.7 percent in the previous quarter.
Labor costs increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.5 percent, below the fourth quarter's 4.4 percent gain.
Productivity is the amount of output per hour of work. It increased because output rose at a faster pace than hours worked.
The trend in productivity has been fairly weak in recent years. For all of 2012, productivity rose just 0.7 percent, after an even smaller 0.6 percent rise in 2011.

HEADLINE: Egypt's Birthrate Rises as Population Control Policies Vanish

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM; Mayy El Sheikh and Asmaa Al Zohairy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- More than two years after the Egyptian uprising, the country's new Islamist government has struggled to confront a drop in tourism and the faltering economy. But the leadership has remained silent about another crucial indicator that has surged to a 20-year high: the country's birthrate.
In fact, officials have avoided public discussion about population and dropped the awareness campaigns of the past, in an early indication of how the Islamist leadership is approaching social policy in the most populous Arab state.
After two decades of steady declines and modest increases, the birthrate in 2012 reached about 32 for every 1,000 people -- surpassing a level last seen in 1991, shortly before the government of the longtime president, Hosni Mubarak, expanded family planning programs and publicity campaigns to curtail population growth that he blamed for crippling Egypt's development. Last year, there were 2.6 million births, bringing the population to about 84 million, according to preliminary government figures. 
The new government of President Mohamed Morsi has continued financing for family planning programs. But health officials have taken a starkly different view of climbing birthrates, presenting the problem as one of economic management -- not the size of the population. Population experts are increasingly alarmed by the government's silence and its lack of focus on the issue.
''The birthrate is important. It is not right to ignore the population problem,'' said Hassan Zaky, a demographer who teaches at Cairo University and the American University in Cairo. ''Before, there was a clear policy. Now, we don't know where we are going. We don't know the view of the state.''
Government officials blame Egypt's chaotic transition for the lack of public discourse. But the shift in priorities also reflects a longstanding critique by Islamists of Mr. Mubarak's population policies. For decades, the Muslim Brotherhood and ultraconservatives chafed at Mr. Mubarak's almost single-minded focus on contraception and two-child families as a core component of public policy. Mr. Mubarak used family planning -- a foreign imposition -- to mask the government's failed strategies, some Islamists said.
''The real problem is with us, as an administration,'' said Hamid al-Daly, a representative of the ultraconservative Nour Party and a member of the health committee in Egypt's upper house of Parliament. ''The population in China is over a billion, but there is good management and good utilization of resources. The population is a blessing if we use it well, and a curse if we mismanage the crisis.''
Many public health workers agree that Mr. Mubarak's approach, which was backed by international aid donors, was never a solution on its own. But they said the current government's silence on the population threatens only to make the situation worse.
''No one is saying we should concentrate only on family planning, or only on development,'' Mr. Zaky said. ''We need a mix. We don't want the new regime to focus on one thing.''
Over decades, Egypt's climbing birthrates have helped choke its cities. Fertile land along the Nile disappeared under new buildings, as Egyptians crowded ever more tightly together on the tiny percentage of the country that the government bothered to develop. Egyptians chastised their leaders with taunts that illustrated the crisis: While presidents dressed in the latest fashions, ''we live seven to a room,'' a chant went.
The state's formal role in family planning began in the 1960s under President Gamal Abdel Nasser. In the late 1970s, the United States Agency for International Development became the main supporter of family planning programs in Egypt, spending about $1.5 billion on population and other health programs over several decades. Efforts to rein in the birthrate intensified after 1994, when Egypt hosted an international conference on population and development.
Thousands of primary clinics were built around the country, providing family planning and other health services that were credited with decreasing the fertility rate as well as maternal and infant mortality rates. The outreach efforts of that period included advertisements on state television and banners on Cairo streets -- with slogans like, ''Before you have another baby, secure its needs.''
Dr. Nahla Abdel-Tawab, the Egypt director of the nonprofit Population Council, said of the Mubarak years: ''The president himself used to talk about population increases. It was in the newspapers, in the prime minister's speeches.''
Now, population has seemed to vanish from public discussion. Health workers said they were stunned when Dr. Abeer Barakat, an assistant minister for health who is responsible for family planning, made no explicit mention at a United Nations conference in December of population or family planning in describing the Health Ministry's priorities.
In an interview on Thursday, Dr. Barakat said she had simply been trying to inject balance into the debate about population and planning, to reflect the new government's priorities. ''What was shocking for them was that I talked about family health, and family planning as part of family health,'' she said.
Dr. Barakat, a former official in the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing before joining the Health Ministry, said she was seeking to redress imbalances in the previous government's approach to health care. Mr. Mubarak, she said, ''was biased'' toward family planning and ignored urgent concerns like cancer and hepatitis C.
And while she said that family planning programs would continue to be a part of health policy, she also said the government should play no role in encouraging families to limit the number of children they have. ''Assigning a number is against reproductive freedoms, and against human rights,'' she said.
''They are not rabbits, to stop giving birth,'' she said. ''Manpower is a treasure.''
Among the members of a large family in Greater Cairo, the new government's approach is more popular than Mr. Mubarak's.
Mohamed Rabia Ali, 62, a construction worker who lives with seven members of his family in a cramped apartment, said that Mr. Morsi could establish new communities in the desert to alleviate the housing crisis, and focus on providing more jobs for young people. The government does not need to tell Egyptians how many children to have. ''The creator takes care of the created,'' he said.
But for the moment, grand development plans that could alleviate overpopulation have taken a back seat as the beleaguered government focuses on keeping the lights on and feeding its citizens. ''The primary issues are food and security,'' said Dr. Atef El Shitany of the state-run National Population Council. As a result, he said, the political commitment to population issues ''is decreasing.''
In the meantime, experts are trying to determine whether the latest birthrate spikes represent a reversal of Egypt's long-term trends, including declining fertility rates. They are working in the dark because the uprising delayed Egypt's most comprehensive demographic survey. The birthrate had started to creep up during the last five years of Mr. Mubarak's rule, as fertility rates held steady.
The latest population spikes could represent behavioral shifts resulting from the revolution, ''because people are under pressure,'' said Hisham Makhlouf, who teaches demography at Cairo University.
''That's one theory,'' he said. ''The other is that it's because no one talks about the population problem like before.''

HEADLINE: British Group Condemns a Proposed European Financial Transaction Tax

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- A European tax on financial transactions would fall disproportionately on London firms, a business lobbying group said Thursday, highlighting growing tensions between Britain and its continental allies over banking regulation.
The British government started legal action last month to try to block the European Union's so-called Robin Hood tax on the grounds that it could ensnare banks from countries that do not adopt the law, including Britain and even the United States. At issue is a clause in the proposal under which the tax would be applied to trades by banks from European countries that sign on to the law, like Germany or France, regardless of where the transaction actually takes place.
The British Treasury says that, for example, were an American bank to trade a British government bond with the London branch of a German bank, then both the U.S. and German banks could be liable for the tax. 
A report published Thursday by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry identified the tax as a problem area of European Union policy, along with employment regulation.
In a survey of 130 London businesses of different sizes and from various sectors, 52 percent said they believed that it was not desirable for Britain to remain in the union under the current terms. But 60 percent favored staying if powers could be transferred from Brussels back to national governments. That is broadly the policy preferred by Prime Minister David Cameron, who has promised to hold a referendum on European Union membership.
The report Thursday said the union's drive to strengthen the regulation of financial services after the crash had produced ''legislative proposals that are particularly damaging for London's financial services industry.''
The proposed transaction tax ''would affect London disproportionally as it is a major hub for euro trading,'' it added.
The tax has joined a growing list of financial issues dividing the Continent and the British government. Britain says the country needs a looser relationship with the bloc if it is to stay a member.
Under the proposal, a tax would be imposed of at least one-tenth of 1 percent of the value of all transactions between financial institutions. Derivatives contracts would be taxed at the rate of one-hundredth of 1 percent. The European Commission has estimated the tax could raise 30 billion euros to 35 billion euros, or $39 billion to $46 billion, a year.
Britain refused to sign on to the proposal. But 11 other European Union nations agreed to go ahead: France, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Slovenia, Portugal, Greece, Slovakia, Italy, Spain and Estonia. Transactions would be taxed if there were ''an established economic link'' between a financial institution and the group of 11 nations -- the so-called Financial Transaction Tax-zone, or F.T.T. That would include branches of banks operating outside the zone.
Last month, the British government decided to challenge the tax in Europe's highest court, the European Court of Justice, even though no detailed agreement was in place among those countries that wanted to implement it.
Emer Traynor, spokeswoman for the European commissioner for taxation, Algirdas Semeta, said she was ''fully confident that the F.T.T. as proposed is legally robust. It is fully in line with international tax laws and broad principles already widely used.''
The tax is just one of several disputes between Britain and the European Union about financial services. Earlier this year Britain found itself isolated over moves to cap bankers' bonuses. Britain has a separate legal challenge against the European Central Bank over its plans to prevent some euro-denominated securities from being cleared outside the 17 European Union countries that share the euro -- in that way excluding Britain, which has kept its own currency.
The British government is also resisting new rules to rehabilitate troubled banks, which would mean creating national funds to pay for bank resolution costs. And a long-standing plan to harmonize the base on which corporate tax is levied in Europe is also a point of contention between Britain and Brussels.
Tension with Brussels has grown during an economic crisis seen by many continental Europeans as the product of freewheeling financial services. The result was pressure for tougher regulation and, in the case of the Robin Hood tax, measures to recoup cash from the industry. The euro zone's debt crisis is also forcing the 17 European Union countries that use the currency to integrate more closely in areas like banking, raising issues for member states outside the monetary union.
''On the one hand it shows the dangers of disengaging from the E.U.,'' said Philip Whyte, senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform, a research institute in London, who argues that Britain feels increasingly beleaguered on issues related to financial services.
''At the same time, it gives a lot of ammunition to those saying that the E.U. is a hostile force to Britain. 'Let's get out and develop closer links with faster-developing parts of the world economy.' ''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Rate Cut In Europe, And a Hint Of Limits

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
BRATISLAVA, Slovakia -- The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low on Thursday. But its president, Mario Draghi, indicated that his promise last year to do ''whatever it takes'' to save the euro had limits.
For now, at least, the bank remains unwilling or unable to wield the more powerful weapons that many economists say are needed to jolt the Continent out of recession. Although the big fear last year that the euro zone might break apart has receded, the danger now could be prolonged stagnation like that which has plagued Japan for most of the last two decades.
Even the traditionally conservative Bank of Japan has become bolder lately, aggressively buying government bonds to try to double the supply of money in circulation and spur growth. Such a step would be unthinkable for Mr. Draghi, who is hemmed in by the bank's narrower mandate and the historically rooted inflation fears of Germany, the euro zone's wealthiest and most politically powerful member.
The bank's Governing Council, meeting in Bratislava, reduced its benchmark interest rate to 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent. But that move was widely seen as mostly symbolic, to avoid the impression that the bank and Mr. Draghi were doing nothing as the euro zone recession threatens to engulf countries, like Germany, that have previously been spared. 
The central bank also extended its promise to provide banks with as much cheap cash as they need through 2014, and said it was exploring ways to use the European Union's house bank to stimulate lending to small businesses.
Intriguingly, Mr. Draghi raised the possibility of imposing a ''negative rate'' on the deposits that banks routinely park at the central bank, essentially charging banks to store their money. That might discourage lenders from hoarding cash rather than lending. But it could have unintended consequences. For example, banks might store huge amounts of paper bills as a low-risk alternative to central bank vaults.
Mr. Draghi insisted that the rate cut, which takes effect May 8, would stimulate growth, especially now that the economic slump that has afflicted Spain and Italy for more than a year is spreading north to countries like Germany, Austria and Finland. Anticipating skepticism, he urged reporters ''not to underestimate the impact'' of the rate cut and other measures at his news conference on Thursday, under a crystal chandelier in an ornate building that houses the Slovak Philharmonic. It was one of the central bank's twice-a-year meetings in the capital of one of its member countries.
Not only is the central bank avoiding Japanese-style shock therapy, but it remains far from pursuing any equivalent of the so-called quantitative easing that the United States Federal Reserve Board and the Bank of England have used to stimulate their economies.
''The bright minds in the Eurotower are still working hard to come up with a new magic bullet,'' Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients, referring to the central bank's headquarters in Frankfurt. ''In the meantime, the only thing Draghi found in his tool kit was an old tool and a chill pill to keep markets happy in the waiting room.''
Under the euro zone's political structure as a loose confederation, the European Central Bank does not have the monolithic power of the Fed, Bank of England or Bank of Japan. Even if Mr. Draghi and some others on the 23-member Governing Council wanted to do more to spur growth, they are hamstrung by a charter that obliges the bank to defend price stability above all else and forbids it from providing financing to governments.
Mr. Draghi has at times been willing to stretch that mandate. Last summer, for example, he promised to buy government bonds in unlimited amounts to control borrowing costs. His expression of resolve has been enough to keep speculators at bay and tamp down the interest rates on Spanish and Italian debt, without any actual bond purchases.
Mr. Draghi also must contend with the politics of the central bank's Governing Council, which includes the heads of all 17 national central banks in the euro zone. Germany, in particular, remains staunchly opposed to bond buying or other aggressive measures to stimulate growth, for fear of inflation.
''There are 17 governors of 17 member states with completely opposing views,'' said Zsolt Darvas, a research fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. ''There are major disagreements.'' The need to promote consensus breeds caution, he said.
Mr. Darvas also noted that the European Union lacked a central treasury that would stand ready to provide financial backup if central bank investments went wrong, as the United States Treasury implicitly backs the Fed. ''That probably makes the E.C.B. more reluctant to take risks,'' Mr. Darvas said.
Mr. Draghi promised on Thursday to continue letting banks borrow as much as they wanted at the benchmark rate for ''as long as needed,'' and at least until mid-2014. That was a longer time commitment than the E.C.B. has offered in the past.
Bank loans are still readily available in the northern countries, so it is easier for an official rate cut to reach borrowers. In the latest sign of trouble in Europe's core, two stalwarts of corporate Germany, BMW and Siemens, warned on Thursday of lower profits for 2013 because of the weakness in European markets.
While acknowledging that the slowdown was spreading to Germany, Mr. Draghi listed several indicators that he said signaled that the euro zone was healing, including big gains in the Italian and Spanish stock markets and lower market interest rates on their government bonds. Some economists argue that the central bank can do little to force-feed credit to small businesses in countries like Greece and Portugal that are having prolonged downturns. Banks' reluctance to lend reflects the fact that many businesses and consumers are poor credit risks.
The rate cut, Mr. Draghi said, ''is going to be more effective today than it would have been a few months ago.''
Even at its new low of 0.5 percent, though, the central bank benchmark rate remains higher than the 0.25 percent rate the Federal Reserve has had in place since late 2008.
In another disturbing parallel to Japan, inflation in the euro zone was just 1.2 percent in April, well below the European Central Bank's target of about 2 percent. Mr. Draghi gave no indication Thursday that the bank was worried that the euro zone was edging toward deflation, the growth-sapping decline in wages and prices that vexed Japan. But a few analysts have begun to warn of the danger of such a price spiral, which could be more destructive than runaway inflation because it is so difficult to reverse.

HEADLINE: Proposal for Changes in Food Aid Sets Off Infighting in Congress

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A proposal by the Obama administration to overhaul the international food aid program has set off a jurisdictional fight among members of several House and Senate committees, threatening to derail the most significant change to the program since it was created nearly 60 years ago.
The $1.4 billion annual program provides emergency food supplies to disaster-stricken regions across the globe. The United States provides over half of the world's food aid. 
The food aid money is currently part of the Agriculture Department's budget, but President Obama's proposal would transfer it to the foreign affairs budget, where it would be overseen by the Agency for International Development. The reorganization would also mean that Congressional oversight of the program would shift from the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees on agriculture to the appropriations subcommittees on foreign operations.
Administration officials say the current program is costly and inefficient, and does not get food quickly enough to the people who need it. By law, the food must be bought from American farmers and shipped on vessels flying American flags, which can sometimes take weeks, with food arriving after a crisis is over, administration officials and development experts say.
Also, because of rising shipping costs, the amount of food the United States sends abroad has fallen, to 1.8 million cubic tons annually from 5 million cubic tons, according to figures from the development agency.
Under the new proposal the agency, or charities working in partnership with it, would use money to buy some food locally, closer to the disaster areas. Fifty-five percent of the food would still be purchased from American farmers.
''This new reform would give us the flexible tools we need to get food to people who need it now, not weeks later,'' said Rajiv Shah, the agency's administrator. ''We would still buy from U.S. farmers.''
He added, ''But this way we can help feed two to four million more people without additional costs.''
But members of the House and Senate agriculture subcommittees are skeptical.
During hearings last week, Representative Robert B. Aderholt, Republican of Alabama, the chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee, said he was concerned that removing food aid from the agriculture budget would hurt American farmers.
Representative Sam Farr of California, the committee's ranking Democrat, also questioned the transfer, raising concerns about the subcommittee losing oversight of the program.
''I'm not endorsing the transfer -- the realignment -- until there are assurances that the program will remain intact and not be raided by other foreign ops interest,'' Mr. Farr said at the hearing.
Mr. Farr expressed doubts about the proposal's chances of success. ''I don't think it will happen this year,'' he said. ''That's the politics.''
There has been a similar response from members of the Senate agriculture subcommittee. Senator Mark Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, the chairman of the subcommittee, along with Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the ranking Republican, both said that they were opposed to transferring food aid dollars out of the agriculture budget.
In February, they joined 19 other senators in sending a letter to the president opposing the measure.
Representative Kay Granger, Republican of Texas, the chairwoman of the House foreign operations subcommittee, which oversees the foreign aid budget, has not said if she will support the Obama administration's proposal.
But Nita M. Lowey of New York, the subcommittee's ranking Democrat, has endorsed the plan to move food aid, as have members of the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees.
Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has criticized the administration's overall budget proposal, but he supports the food aid change.
''The president's budget proposal to reform the international food program -- helping more at less cost -- is a bright spot in the budget request,'' Mr. Royce said.
Budget experts say Mr. Obama's proposal will be a tough sell in Congress, where committee members can be parochial and rarely want to give up control of programs.
While it is common for committees to allow agencies to move money from one account to another, experts said it was rare for Congressional appropriators to move money and oversight of a program from one agency to another.
''This is a classic jurisdictional battle among committees,'' said Edward A. Brigham, a consultant and former staff member at the White House Office of Management and Budget and at the House Budget Committee. ''No one wants to give up their area of control.''
Mr. Brigham said lawmakers could vote to move the money through the appropriations process or just to authorize the change in the next farm bill, which falls under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. Members of those committees have already voiced their opposition to the proposal.
''Food aid is in need of reform for all the hungry people in the world who depend on it,'' said David Beckmann, president of Bread for the World, a Christian antihunger group that supports the Obama administration's proposal. ''But it's going to be difficult to get anything through Congress, particularly because of the jurisdictional issues.''

HEADLINE: Tunisia's Theocratic Temptation

BYLINE: By RADIA HENNESSEY

 BODY:
IN 2011, for the first time in my life, I voted in a free democratic Tunisian election. After our momentous revolution, my fellow Tunisians and I elected an assembly to draft a new constitution within a year. We proudly displayed our blue-inked indexes. But a stain remains on our revolution -- and strains our democratic aspirations.
Two years ago, the news coverage was so hopeful. Now not a day goes by without headline-grabbing Salafis violently imposing their intolerant views on the rest of us. These Salafis were invisible and unheard of during Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali's two decades of dictatorship. Nor did they have a role in the revolution that toppled him. But now, under the protection of the things they detest -- democracy, human rights and free speech -- they act with the same impunity that Ben Ali's police enjoyed. The populace is afraid to protest and the government silently approves. 
As part of the million-strong diaspora, I had wanted to resettle in Tunisia and share my cultural heritage with my two daughters, who are half-American. The Salafis burned down the school my girls would have attended. They assassinated a secular politician, smashed cinemas, harassed women and artists.
These extremists exploit a widespread ignorance of human rights.
My cousins, who are doctors, nurses or bankers, misunderstood the concept of secularism. They equated it with atheism. It took hours of conversation to convince them that secularism protects the right to practice religion by ensuring no one has the right to tell you how to worship. And the few who do know what a secular state means are terrified to advocate for it because there is the threat of Salafist extremists.
Despite the economic challenges Tunisia faces, especially debilitating unemployment, the place of religion in governance has emerged as a major obstacle in preparing a constitution.
Two renowned Tunisian constitutionalists have wisely declined to be part of the panel appointed to review the draft constitution. Both Yadh Ben Achour and Kais Saied realize that the text is rife with impossible contradictions (a state religion and Tunisia as a civil state), severe omissions (the universality of human rights) and that highlighting these deficits could endanger their safety.
The text keeps some articles of the 1959 Constitution, which proclaimed that Tunisia's religion is Islam, its language is Arabic and that the president must be Muslim. With 98 percent of Tunisians professing Islam, it's unlikely a Buddhist would be found to run, much less win a presidential election. But the duty of the majority is to protect the rights and opportunities of the minority. That's a basic tenet of human rights and Islam. That Jews, Christians or Baha'i exist in small numbers is no basis for explicit discrimination. Tunisian is a nationality -- not a religion.
But have the 98 percent thought about who gets to decide if the candidate is a good enough Muslim? Will evidence be required? Religious tests? Will Tunisia end up looking like Iran, where the ayatollah vets candidates to ensure they are his type of Muslim?
And have 100 percent of the people forgotten that the requirements to speak Arabic and be a Muslim did nothing to safeguard Tunisians from decades of dictatorship? Ben Ali was a Muslim and we Tunisians spoke Arabic and believed in Islam. The problem then was that the government appointed imams. But the solution now isn't to have imams appoint governments.
We need a Constitution that protects us from what we've suffered under previous regimes, safeguarding against infringements on our freedom of religion, speech and human rights. Already, Tunisians are calling the text the Constitution of Shame.
It is a constitution that paves the way for a Shariah-based theocratic state with no checks and balances -- and immune from future change or amendment. The obsession with religion has so derailed the work of the Constitutional Assembly that the nature of government is not even well established in the draft text.
The separation of mosque and state, as a way to ensure the freedom of religion, is an urgent imperative if this so-called Arab Spring is not to dry up.

HEADLINE: Aligning With the Greater Good

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- In recent months, people and their politicians around the world have been astonished to learn that big companies and billionaires will go to extraordinary lengths to pay lower taxes.
Thanks to the work of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based in Washington, we have discovered that some of the most prominent public figures in the world have banked their fortunes in international tax havens, beyond the scrutiny of their national treasuries.
Meanwhile, Tom Bergin, my Reuters colleague, has become the scourge of the top U.S. multinationals by revealing their low effective tax rate in Britain. Mr. Bergin has found that between 1998 and 2012, Starbucks paid less than £9 million, or about $14 million, in British taxes while registering sales of more than £3 billion. According to statutory filings, Google made $18 billion in revenue in Britain from 2006 to 2011, and paid just $16 million in taxes. 
Open the door to the top executives' suite and you will hear howls of rage over the backlash these revelations have provoked. There is, from the corporate point of view, something a little disingenuous happening here. After all, countries, states and cities have spent the past several decades openly competing to set the lowest corporate tax rates in an effort to attract business. The fact that multinationals would respond to these incentives and turbo-charge them with some international tax arbitrage is about as shocking as the discovery of gambling in Casablanca.
After all, as Lord Clyde observed, in a 1929 British tax case: ''No man in the country is under the smallest obligation, moral or other, so to arrange his legal relations to his business or property as to enable the Inland Revenue to put the largest possible shovel in his stores.''
This principle -- that you should seek to make the most money you can, provided you do not break the law -- is the operating software of modern capitalism. As Milton Friedman put it: ''There is one and only one social responsibility of business -- to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.''
In the hypercompetitive 21st century, where every Apple is only one algorithm away from becoming a BlackBerry, paying the lowest possible taxes is not the exceptional policy of one particularly greedy chief executive -- it is what every executive seeks to do to keep his job. That was what Andrew Kassoy, a former private equity investor, explained at a recent panel discussion at the Stern School of Business at New York University (disclosure alert: I was the moderator).
Mr. Kassoy, who now leads a nongovernmental organization working to transform corporate behavior, argued that current publicly traded U.S. companies were ''actually obliged to maximize their externalities'' -- economist-speak for behavior that harms the wider community -- if that would increase their bottom line. Mr. Kassoy does not think that is a good thing, and, increasingly, neither do a lot of other people -- the grim title of the session was ''Can American Capitalism be Saved?''
He's not the only one who is worried. In a recent interview, I asked Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, about the ability of rich people and big companies to avoid taxes in a world of global capital flows.
''It is demonstrably a problem,'' said Mr. Carney, who will take over as the governor of the Bank of England on July 1. ''If there's an ability to fundamentally, whether on a personal or a corporate level, persistently avoid tax, the consequence of that is that the burden of fiscal adjustments that are happening in virtually every advanced economy falls more heavily on those who pay their fair share. And they end up paying more than their fair share as a consequence.''
Closing the tax loopholes or tightening the lax tax enforcement that have deprived European treasuries of so much multinational corporate tax revenue is politically difficult and technically complicated. But what is even harder is figuring out how to better align the behaviors of the business titans with the greater good of the community as a whole.
After all, the companies that have been minimizing their European tax bills are ones we are accustomed to thinking of as the good guys. These are not the bailed-out fat cats of Wall Street or the crony capitalists of the emerging markets. These are the inventive entrepreneurs of the West Coast, who brought cappuccinos and search capabilities to the global masses. Starbucks energetically associates its brand with all manner of ethical causes, and Google's motto is ''Don't be evil.''
In a new book, a University of Michigan business professor, Mark S. Mizruchi, contends that the forsaking of responsibility for the wider community is a big shift in the behavior of U.S. business and a central reason for the country's political and economic malaise.
''The current American corporate elite seems to be leading us toward the fate of the earlier Roman, Dutch and Habsburg Spanish empires, starving the treasury and accumulating vast resources for itself,'' Dr. Mizruchi writes. He concludes his book with the hope that the corporate elite will rediscover ''enlightened self-interest'' and reform themselves.
Speaking at the N.Y.U. conference, Clay Christensen, one of the leading thinkers about the disruptive impact of the technology revolution, suggested that belief in a God who holds us accountable in the afterlife would make captains of industry more civically responsible today.
Mr. Christensen is right that to change behaviors we need to change incentives. Hellfire and damnation is one option; another is rewriting the rules of engagement between companies, countries and shareholders.

HEADLINE: U.S. Spending Cuts Seen As Key in Slowing Growth

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Michael Kelly let go of another employee last month.
As chief executive of a small Michigan military contractor, Nanocerox, he had already cut his work force by one-third. But it was not enough. And if the government spending cuts mandated by Congress continue, he said, more people will go in the coming months.
The squeeze Mr. Kelly is facing is one reason markets are jittery about what the Labor Department's latest report on unemployment and job creation will reveal about the economy on Friday. After a strong start to the year, several economic indicators beginning in March have pointed to much slower growth, largely because of the fiscal headwinds from Washington, economists say. 
Job cuts like the kind at Nanocerox remain the exception, rather than the rule. On Thursday, the government said weekly unemployment claims were at a five-year low.
The problem is that companies have not been hiring. This week, a survey of private sector hiring in April came in well below expectations, while indications for everything from retail sales to manufacturing have also been soft recently.
Whatever the data ultimately show for April, economists like Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial in Chicago, say the economy would be showing much more momentum if it were not for the combination of higher payroll taxes that went into effect in January, as well as the process of automatic spending cuts known as sequestration that began to bite last month.
''What's the biggest drag on the economy? The government,'' Ms. Swonk said. ''If the government simply did no harm, we could be at escape velocity.''
Without the impact of federal cuts and higher taxes, Ms. Swonk estimates, annual economic growth would be close to 4 percent, above the 2.5 percent pace she is expecting in 2013.
Like most economists, Ms. Swonk says she does not think the economy will fall back into recession or experience a pronounced rise in unemployment. Instead, economists on Wall Street are looking for the economy to have created 140,000 jobs in April, below average compared with the monthly rate of 168,000 jobs added in the first quarter but better than the 88,000 jobs created in March. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 7.6 percent.
That's down considerably from the 10 percent peak in unemployment recorded in October 2009, but still well above where levels for joblessness should be this far into a recovery. Nearly 12 million Americans are unemployed and looking for work, according to the Labor Department, and almost 40 percent of them have been jobless for more than six months.
As long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, the Federal Reserve has vowed to keep buying tens of billions of dollars worth of bonds each month to help stimulate growth. That has buoyed Wall Street, and helped the stock market reach record highs, but it has yet to translate into the kind of job gains the Fed wants to see.
Other central banks have been getting into the act, too. The European Central Bank cut rates on Thursday in a bid to restore growth, and the Bank of Japan recently started an aggressive stimulus effort.
In particular, economists will be watching Friday's report to see if the manufacturing sector shed more jobs in April. The government is generally furloughing employees rather than laying them off, but private contractors that supply the Pentagon have been trimming their work forces outright.
Julia Coronado, chief North American economist at BNP Paribas, predicted the impact of the sequester would increase in the months ahead. ''We've seen orders for defense-related goods really slow down,'' she said. ''There are definitely signs of a cooling.''
''We're not in a free fall,'' she added, ''but it highlights the difficult nature of this recovery.''
Although sequestration did not officially go into effect until March, the Pentagon and some other agencies began cutting back last year. At Mr. Kelly's company, Nanocerox, that has meant a sharp slowdown in orders for powder derived from rare-earth minerals that is used in a wide range of high-technology products, like advanced lasers and air-to-air missiles. With just $2.5 million in revenue, the company, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., had to react quickly as demand from the Pentagon and big contractors like Raytheon evaporated.
''It's a tough, tough environment,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''We're trying to sell the company. It's sad because our technology is the next generation for the military.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wants North Korea To Release American

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and RICK GLADSTONE; Choe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The United States said Thursday that North Korea should immediately release an American citizen who was sentenced this week to 15 years of hard labor, setting up a potential new source of confrontation between the two countries that could aggravate tensions that are still high over North Korea's nuclear war threats.
A State Department spokesman, Patrick Ventrell, said the Obama administration had ''longstanding concerns about the lack of transparency and due process in the North Korean legal system.'' Mr. Ventrell said that the administration wanted the convicted American, Kenneth Bae, who was sentenced on Tuesday on charges of committing hostile acts, to be granted ''amnesty and immediate release.'' 
Mr. Ventrell's statement signaled the administration was not prepared, at least not now, to seek Mr. Bae's release through a high-profile mission to North Korea, as it has done twice in the past when Americans were held by North Korean authorities essentially as hostages to gain concessions from the United States.
Asked at a briefing if such a mission to free Mr. Bae were an option, Mr. Ventrell said, ''I'm not aware one way or another.'' While he acknowledged such previous missions, he said, the administration was urging North Korea ''to grant him amnesty and to allow for his immediate release, full stop.''
Analysts of North Korea's behavior said an American diplomatic mission to secure Mr. Bae's release could easily be used by the country's young leader, Kim Jong-un, as an example of Washington's capitulation and an opportunity to burnish his profile as a tough anti-American strategist.
But by taking the tougher approach, the Obama administration is assuming the risk that one of its citizens will be incarcerated indefinitely.
The sentencing comes at a time of high tension between the North and the United States over the North's nuclear program, and it was handed down the same day that joint American-South Korean military drills ended. With the end of the drills, some analysts have said, North Korea might tone down its bellicosity and shift its focus toward drawing Washington back to the negotiating table -- using, among other things, the plight of Mr. Bae as bait.
''The timing of the sentencing makes us think that the North is again playing its old card,'' said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University in Seoul. ''But will the Americans play the same game? If Washington sends a former president whenever North Korea holds an American captive, they say it will run out of former presidents.''
Mr. Bae, 44, a Korean-American from Washington State who ran a tour business out of China, was arrested in the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea in November after leading a group of businessmen there from Yanji, China.
Like several other Americans detained in the North in recent years, Mr. Bae is a Christian, according to rights advocates. While North Korea's Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, in practice it cracks down on religious activities, according to human rights groups, and is wary of all Christians who visit.
The North said Saturday that it was indicting Mr. Bae on charges that he tried to overthrow the government, a crime that called for a punishment as severe as the death penalty. But on Tuesday, its Supreme Court convicted him of ''hostile acts,'' a charge less grave than the original, the North said.
Mr. Bae is at least the sixth American detained in North Korea since 2009, and his punishment was the most severe. The others eventually were deported or released. Two were released in 2009 when President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang and met with Kim Jong-il, the leader at the time. Another was released when former President Jimmy Carter visited Pyongyang.
Americans recently held prisoner in the North were kept in special facilities, away from domestic inmates, possibly out of fear that when released, they would testify about the condition of prison camps where the State Department says starvation and forced labor remain rampant.

HEADLINE: Not Enough Inflation

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Ever since the financial crisis struck, and the Federal Reserve began ''printing money'' in an attempt to contain the damage, there have been dire warnings about inflation -- and not just from the Ron Paul/Glenn Beck types.
Thus, in 2009, the influential conservative monetary economist Allan Meltzer warned that we would soon become ''inflation nation.'' In 2010, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged the Fed to raise interest rates to head off inflation risks (even though its own models showed no such risk). In 2011, Representative Paul Ryan, then the newly installed chairman of the House Budget Committee, raked Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, over the coals, warning of looming inflation and intoning solemnly that it was a terrible thing to ''debase'' the dollar. 
And now, sure enough, the Fed really is worried about inflation. You see, it's getting too low.
Before I get to the trouble with low inflation, however, let's talk about what we should have learned so far.
It's not hard to see where inflation fears were coming from. In its efforts to prop up the economy, the Fed has bought more than $2 trillion of stuff -- private debts, housing agency debts, government bonds. It has paid for these purchases by crediting funds to the reserves of private banks, which isn't exactly printing money, but is close enough for government work. Here comes hyperinflation!
Or, actually, not. From the beginning, it was or at least should have been obvious that the financial crisis had plunged us into a ''liquidity trap,'' a situation in which many people figure that they might just as well sit on cash. America spent most of the 1930s in a liquidity trap; Japan has been in one since the mid-1990s. And we're in one now.
Economists who had studied such traps -- a group that included Ben Bernanke and, well, me -- knew that some of the usual rules of economics are in abeyance as long as the trap lasts. Budget deficits, for example, don't drive up interest rates; printing money isn't inflationary; slashing government spending has really destructive effects on incomes and employment.
The usual suspects dismissed all this analysis; it was ''liquidity claptrap,'' declared Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute. But that was four years ago, and the liquidity trappers seem to have been right, after all.
And it's worth mentioning another issue on which the inflation non-worriers have been vindicated: how to measure inflation trends. The Fed relies on a measure that excludes food and energy prices, which fluctuate widely from month to month. Many commentators ridiculed this focus on ''core'' inflation, especially in early 2011, when rising food and energy prices briefly sent ''headline'' inflation above 4 percent even as the core stayed low. But, sure enough, inflation came back down.
So all those inflation fears were wrong, and those who fanned those fears proved, in case you were wondering, that their economic doctrine is completely wrong -- not that any of them will ever admit such a thing.
And, at this point, inflation -- at barely above 1 percent by the Fed's favored measure -- is dangerously low.
Why is low inflation a problem? One answer is that it discourages borrowing and spending and encourages sitting on cash. Since our biggest economic problem is an overall lack of demand, falling inflation makes that problem worse.
Low inflation also makes it harder to pay down debt, worsening the private-sector debt troubles that are a main reason overall demand is too low.
So why is inflation falling? The answer is the economy's persistent weakness, which keeps workers from bargaining for higher wages and forces many businesses to cut prices. And if you think about it for a minute, you realize that this is a vicious circle, in which a weak economy leads to too-low inflation, which perpetuates the economy's weakness.
And this brings us to a broader point: the utter folly of not acting to boost the economy, now.
Whenever anyone talks about the need for more stimulus, monetary and fiscal, to reduce unemployment, the response from people who imagine themselves wise is always that we should focus on the long run, not on short-run fixes. The truth, however, is that by failing to deal with our short-run mess, we're turning it into a long-run, chronic economic malaise.
I wrote recently about how, by allowing long-term unemployment to persist, we're creating a permanent class of unemployed Americans. The problem of too-low inflation is very different in detail, but similar in its implications: here, too, by letting short-run economic problems fester we're setting ourselves up for a long-run, perhaps permanent, pattern of economic failure.
The point is that we are failing miserably in responding to our economic challenge -- and we will be paying for that failure for many years to come.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Report Helps Lift Market

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market rose Thursday after weekly applications for unemployment benefits fell to a five-year low, raising investor hopes that the labor market is improving.
The report came a day before the government is to issue its report on April employment. 
''Everyone is looking to the April jobs numbers,'' said Tyler Vernon, chief investment officer at Biltmore Capital. ''People are more confident that it was an anomaly last month and are looking for some bigger numbers.''
Economists forecast that employers added 160,000 jobs last month. Stocks slumped when the government said just 88,000 jobs were added in March, less than half the number forecast.
Signs of increased hiring have supported this year's surge in stocks and pushed the market to record highs. The run-up has started to falter in recent weeks on concerns that the global economy is slowing.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 130.63 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 14,831.58 on Thursday. The Dow lost 138 points a day earlier on signs that the government's employment report might turn out to be weak.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 14.89 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,597.59, also recovering almost all of its losses from a day earlier.
Gains for technology companies helped push the Nasdaq composite index higher, as it advanced 41.49 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,340.62.
Applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to 324,000, the fewest since January 2008, the Labor Department reported.
The outlook for global growth was bolstered after the European Central Bank cuts its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point to 0.5 percent. That contributed to the improved investor sentiment.
Higher profits from CBS, Facebook and other companies also lifted stocks on Thursday.
CBS reported a 22 percent jump in first-quarter earnings as big events like the Super Bowl pushed advertising revenue higher. Its stock rose 95 cents, or 2 percent, to $47.35.
General Motors rose 98 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $31.16 after it lost less money in Europe and beat Wall Street's expectations for first-quarter profit.
Facebook gained $1.54, or 5.6 percent, to $28.97 after its first-quarter revenue rose 38 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The social networking site bucked the trend for companies reporting in the first quarter. Most are exceeding analysts' expectations on earnings, but falling short on revenue.
''If we continue to see several more quarters like this, investors would start to get nervous,'' said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments. He said growth needed to pick up in the major export markets, like China and Europe, for American companies to maintain earnings growth.
Technology stocks have surged in the past two weeks, after lagging the S.& P. 500 in the first three months of the year. Their 5.7 percent increase in 2013 still trails the 18.5 percent gain for health care companies, the best-performing industry in the index.
In the bond market, interest rates were stable. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32, to 103 13/32, while its yield fell to 1.62 percent, its low for the year, from 1.63 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Joins States That Allow Gay Marriage

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Jen McCaffery contributed reporting from Providence, R.I.

 BODY:
Overcoming years of resistance, Rhode Island on Thursday became the 10th state in the country and the last in New England to approve same-sex marriage.
The measure passed a final vote in the legislature in the afternoon. Just before 7 p.m., Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent who had long advocated for its passage, signed it into law in a jubilant ceremony on the steps of the Statehouse in Providence, where hundreds of people, including many state and local officials, joined the celebration.
''I know that you have been waiting for this day to come,'' Mr. Chafee said at the celebration. ''I know that you have loved ones who dreamed this would happen and did not live to see it. But I am proud to say that now, at long last, you are free to marry the person you love.'' 
Same-sex unions will be legal in the state starting Aug. 1.
''It is an incredibly historic day for Rhode Island and the country,'' said Julia Harvey, a Brown University student who is gay.
Approval in Rhode Island followed a 16-year struggle in the heavily Roman Catholic state, with intense opposition from clerics and many Republicans. But in a sign of the changing times, all five Republicans in the 38-member State Senate supported the measure -- the only time in any state where the entire caucus of either party has approved such a measure unanimously -- making Rhode Island the latest indication of growing acceptance of same-sex marriage across the country.
Delaware is likely to be next, perhaps as soon as next week. Illinois and Minnesota are also on track for passage.
Governor Chafee has long maintained that legalizing same-sex unions is not only fair, but good for business because it would help the state attract young people, who support gay marriage overwhelmingly.
''The talented workers who are driving the new economy -- young, educated and forward-looking -- want to live in a place that reflects their values,'' he wrote this week in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times.
Supporters have been introducing same-sex marriage bills in Rhode Island since 1997, but none had been voted out of committee until this year. The House passed the measure overwhelmingly in January, in large part because the speaker, Gordon D. Fox, is openly gay.
The higher hurdle was in the State Senate. But with an intense broad-based advocacy campaign that included the governor, business leaders and religious leaders, the Senate considered the measure for the first time. It modified the House version by expanding religious protections for those who do not approve of same-sex marriage, and then passed it last week.
The measure went back to the House, where its final passage on Thursday was a foregone conclusion. On the final vote, the standing-room-only crowd of observers burst into song, with ''My Country 'Tis of Thee.''
During the day, Thomas J. Tobin, the bishop of Providence, said in a pastoral letter that he was ''profoundly disappointed'' that Rhode Island was likely to legalize same-sex marriage and warned Catholics to think carefully before attending any gay or lesbian weddings.
''Catholics should examine their consciences very carefully before deciding whether or not to endorse same-sex relationships or attend same-sex ceremonies, realizing that to do so might harm their relationship with God and cause significant scandal to others,'' Bishop Tobin wrote.
Other opponents said they did not see Rhode Island's action as part of any groundswell.
''I don't see momentum for redefining marriage,'' said Christopher Plante, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of the National Organization for Marriage, who noted that 30 states have constitutional provisions limiting marriage to a man and a woman.
''Rhode Island is not that big a deal,'' he said. ''It's a deep blue state and one of the least religious in the union, despite its high Catholic population.''
But for the crowd at the ceremony, it was a very big deal indeed. Chase Bolling, 26, who had worked on behalf of the new law, said he was inspired to do so because his older brother is gay.
''My homophobia ruined our relationship,'' he said. ''And when I found out my brother had AIDS, I promised him I'd do everything I could to make sure he had the same rights I had.''

HEADLINE: Apple's Move Keeps Profit Out of Reach Of Taxes

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Why would a company with billions of dollars in the bank -- and no plans for a large investment -- decide to borrow billions more?
A decade ago, that was a question some short-sellers were asking about Parmalat, the Italian food company that had seemed to be coining money.
It turned out that the answer was not a happy one: The cash was not real. The auditors had been fooled. A huge fraud was being perpetrated.
Now it is a question that could be asked about Apple. Its March 30 balance sheet shows $145 billion in cash and marketable securities. But this week it borrowed $17 billion in the largest corporate bond offering ever. 
The answer for Apple is a more comforting one for investors, if not for those of us who pay taxes. The cash is real. But Apple has been a pioneer in tactics to avoid paying taxes to Uncle Sam. To distribute the cash to its owners would force it to pay taxes. So it borrows instead to buy back shares and increase its stock dividend.
The borrowings were at incredibly low interest rates, as low as 0.51 percent for three-year notes and topping out at 3.88 percent for 30-year bonds. And those interest payments will be tax-deductible.
Isn't that nice of the government? Borrow money to avoid paying taxes, and reduce your tax bill even further.
Could this become the incident that brings on public outrage over our inequitable corporate tax system? Some companies actually pay something close to the nominal 35 percent United States corporate income tax rate. Those unfortunate companies tend to be in businesses like retailing. But companies with a lot of intellectual property -- notably technology and pharmaceutical companies -- get away with paying a fraction of that amount, if they pay any taxes at all.
Anger at such tax avoidance -- we're talking about presumably legal tax strategies, by the way -- has been boiling in Europe, particularly in Britain.
It got so bad that late last year Starbucks promised to pay an extra £10 million -- about $16 million -- in 2013 and 2014 above what it would normally have had to pay in British income taxes. What it would normally have paid is zero, because Starbucks claims its British subsidiary loses money. Of course, that subsidiary pays a lot for coffee sold to it by a profitable Starbucks subsidiary in Switzerland, and pays a large royalty for the right to use the company's intellectual property to another subsidiary in the Netherlands. Starbucks said it understood that its customers were angry that it paid no taxes in Britain.
Starbucks could get away with paying no taxes in Britain, and Apple can get away with paying little in the United States relative to the profits it makes, thanks to what Edward D. Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff at the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, calls ''stateless income,'' in which multinational companies arrange to direct the bulk of their profits to low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions in which they may actually have only minimal operations.
Transfer pricing is an issue in all multinational companies and can be used to move profits from one country to another, but it is especially hard for countries to monitor prices on intellectual property, like patents and copyrights. There is unlikely to be a real market for that information, so challenging a company's pricing is difficult.
''It is easy to transfer the intellectual property to tax havens at a low price,'' said Martin A. Sullivan, the chief economist of Tax Analysts, the publisher of Tax Notes. ''When a foreign subsidiary pays a low price for this property, and collects royalties, it will have big profits.''
The United States, at least theoretically, taxes companies on their global profits. But taxes on overseas income are deferred until the profits are sent back to the United States.
The company makes no secret of the fact it has not paid taxes on a large part of its profits. ''We are continuing to generate significant cash offshore and repatriating this cash will result in significant tax consequences under current U.S. tax law,'' the company's chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, said last week.
A company spokesman says the company paid $6 billion in federal income taxes last year, and ''several billion dollars in income taxes within the U.S. in 2011.'' It is a testament to how profitable the company is that it would still face ''significant tax consequences'' if it used the cash it has to buy back stock.
There is something ridiculous about a tax system that encourages an American company to invest abroad rather than in the United States. But that is what we have.
''The fundamental problem we have in trying to tax corporations is that corporations are global,'' says Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington. ''It is very, very hard for national entities to tax entities that are global, particularly when it is hard to know where their income originates.''
In principle, there are two ways the United States could get out of the current mess. The first, proposed by President John F. Kennedy more than 50 years ago, is to end the deferral. Companies would owe taxes on profits when they made them. There would be, of course, credits for taxes paid overseas, but if a company made money and did not otherwise pay taxes on it, it would owe them to the United States. After it paid the taxes, it could move the money wherever it wished without tax consequences.
President Obama has not gone that far, but he has suggested immediate taxation of foreign profits earned in tax havens, defined as countries with very low tax rates.
Some international companies hate that idea, of course. They warn that we would risk making American multinational corporations uncompetitive with other multinationals, and perhaps encourage some of them to change nationality.
The other way is to move to what is called a territorial system, one in which countries tax only profits earned in those countries. Apple would then be free to bring the money home whenever it wanted, tax-free. But without doing something about the ease with which companies manage to claim profits are made wherever it is most convenient, that would simply be a recipe for giving up on collecting tax revenue. Companies around the world have done a good job of persuading countries to lower tax rates. Back in the 1980s, the American corporate tax rate of 34 percent was among the lowest in the world. Now the 35 percent United States tax rate on corporate income is among the highest. In this country, notwithstanding the high rate, the corporate income tax now brings in about 18 percent of all income tax revenue, with individuals paying the rest. That is half the share corporations paid when Dwight Eisenhower was president.
There seems to be something of a consensus developing around the idea that the United States rate should be lowered. Both President Obama and Representative Dave Camp, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, say they want to do that without reducing government revenue, but they disagree on most details. Mr. Camp likes the territorial idea, but he concedes that we would have to do something about the ease with which companies move income from country to country.
In fact, the need for such a rate reduction is not as clear as it might be. Reuven Avi-Yonah, a tax law professor at the University of Michigan, studied the taxes paid by the 100 largest American and European multinationals and found that, on average, the Americans paid lower rates.
Professor Avi-Yonah says he thinks that the developed countries should cooperate and enact similar rules. He compares that to the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal for American companies to bribe foreign governments. American companies used to say that was unfair, but now most developed countries have similar laws.
Something like that may be growing a little more likely. At the request of the Group of 20 governments, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is doing a study called BEPS, for Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.
In Europe, where budget problems have grown drastically, there seems to be a growing understanding that governments must raise a certain amount of revenue and a belief that if one sector manages to avoid paying taxes, that means other sectors must pay more. That led to the anti-Starbucks demonstrations in Britain. In this country, there is little sign of similar attitudes, let alone a belief that those who find ways to twist the laws to avoid paying taxes are being unpatriotic.
If that belief were to become widespread, Apple and similar companies might find that their success in avoiding taxes was making them unpopular with other taxpayers -- people whom Apple wants to be its customers.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Unveils Budget Amid Race to Succeed Him

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
After racing through yet another PowerPoint presentation filled with numerous bar graphs and small-font economic data, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Thursday took a minidetour during his final budget address to praise someone's record: His own.
''Virtually every agency has done a spectacular job,'' he said at one point. ''I don't think there's anyone that's had an administration of competent people like that.'' 
It was a fitting capstone, perhaps, for a supremely confident leader who, despite the volume of criticism that came later from several people hoping to succeed him, repeatedly suggested on Thursday that he would leave New York City in sound fiscal shape by the time he departs.
Over all, Mr. Bloomberg's $69.8 billion budget proposal, which is slightly leaner than last year's, hews closely to his original blueprint from January that would keep spending flat and eschew raising taxes.
And even though Mr. Bloomberg announced that the city would gain an unexpected infusion of $800 million in capital gains taxes, because of a change in federal tax laws, and an extra $200 million from audits of corporate taxes, he cautioned that much of that money would be consumed by additional expenses. He also said the infusion would be offset by lower revenues from a plan to sell new taxi medallions which remains bogged down in court.
As a result, Mr. Bloomberg said there would be no change to his proposals to close 20 firehouses and to reduce thousands of city-financed child care slots. Nor did he let up in his criticism of two of his favorite targets: state lawmakers and labor, especially the United Federation of Teachers.
''Even with our fiscal discipline, the costs we cannot control without help from our partners in labor and in Albany continue to siphon money away from services and remain a long-term challenge,'' cautioned Mr. Bloomberg, an independent, who spent a good part of his hourlong presentation criticizing the mechanics of the state teacher evaluation system.
In practice, Mr. Bloomberg's proposal is the official start of an often intense period of negotiations with the City Council to come up with a balanced budget, as required by law, before the 2014 fiscal year starts on July 1.
But this year's budget merits an asterisk because it is being conducted against the backdrop of a spirited contest among a large group of Democrats and Republicans to succeed him. So whatever budget deals are struck now -- or avoided -- will quite likely have consequences on the next mayor's decision-making.
The person who may have the most at stake is Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker and a front-runner in the mayoral race. Long perceived as Mr. Bloomberg's preferred choice, she issued a cautious joint statement with a key ally, Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr. of Brooklyn, chairman of the Finance Committee.
While they said they ''remain troubled'' by proposed cuts to programs for children, libraries and firehouses, ''the city's overall fiscal outlook'' was ''solid and steady.'' The statement also noted that the Bloomberg administration and the Council had worked in concert, for the last seven years under Ms. Quinn's watch, ''to consistently deliver on-time and balanced budgets.''
Ms. Quinn's fellow Democratic mayoral candidates were more critical. Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, attacked the budget as failing to do enough to invest in early education and after-school programs, in a nod to his own proposal to increase taxes on the wealthiest.
William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller, criticized Mr. Bloomberg's comments about the teachers' union. ''The mayor basically took the budget football and fumbled it on purpose,'' he said, ''blaming everybody else, starting with the teachers.''
John C. Liu, the current comptroller, said Mr. Bloomberg's ''holding pattern budget'' contained ''unwarranted assumptions,'' like a freeze on any raises in labor contracts that expired after 2010 and an optimistic view of the amount of taxi medallion money the city would receive.
Only Joseph J. Lhota, a Republican mayoral candidate and former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was unabashedly enthusiastic, saying ''the budget is straightforward, includes no tricks and provides the next mayor an opportunity for transformative change.''
For his part, Mr. Bloomberg seemed reflective about his three terms in office. And he said New Yorkers should be thankful that his administration had sought to diversify the city's economy in all five boroughs, rather than rely chiefly on Wall Street.
''Thank God we did that because we would be in real trouble if we didn't,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tiptoeing As Leader Of Mexico Meets Obama

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Damien Cave contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- President Obama and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico labored Thursday to avoid engaging each other on the two most delicate, contentious issues between their countries: immigration overhaul in the United States and Mexican efforts to confront drug violence.
In an hourlong news conference after a private meeting, Mr. Obama and Mr. Peña Nieto repeatedly sought to shift their public conversation away from security and border issues that have long dominated such high-level visits, to focus instead on the vast economic relationship between the two nations. 
A joint communiqué between the two men mentioned security cooperation only at the end of a lengthy discussion of commercial and educational initiatives. During the news conference, both leaders waved aside reports of the unraveling of cross-border ties between security agencies.
''We will interact with them in ways that are appropriate,'' Mr. Obama said. Recent reports have indicated that changes by the Mexican government might diminish years of cooperation aimed at drugs and violence. But Mr. Obama dismissed that concern. ''We are very much looking forward to cooperation in any ways we can to battle organized crime,'' he said. On immigration, Mr. Obama repeated his optimism about a bipartisan overhaul plan but avoided drawing his counterpart into the delicate political debate he is having back home. Mr. Peña Nieto answered an immigration question with barely more than a sentence.
''We wish you the best in this push that you are giving to immigration,'' Mr. Peña Nieto said.
Mr. Obama's three-day trip to Latin America is to include a speech to Mexican college students on Friday before meetings with Central American leaders in Costa Rica later in the day and on Saturday. White House officials said the president intended to keep the trip focused on the benefits of closer cooperation.
Even so, domestic issues followed him south of the border, where he expressed support for the Federal Drug Administration's decision to allow over-the-counter access to the morning-after pill to girls as young as 15.
On gun control -- an issue of keen interest in Mexico because of the steady flow of weapons across the border from the United States -- Mr. Obama vowed to continue his fight. ''This is just the first round,'' he said of the defeat of a background check bill in the Senate last month. ''One thing I am is persistent.''
At the news conference, both men emphasized the need for greater commercial integration and more educational cooperation and cultural exchanges. They announced that a new group of high-level officials from the United States and Mexico, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., would work to enhance the nations' economic cooperation. ''The U.S. and Mexico have one of the largest economic relationships in the world,'' Mr. Obama told Mr. Peña Nieto. ''As Mexico works to become more competitive, you've got a strong partner in the United States because our success is shared.''
The Mexican government, which has made economic improvements a central promise, is eager to highlight commercial successes that have kept the growth rate there higher than that of the United States in the last several years, analysts said.
Still, the security concerns in Mexico are serious. Thousands of people have been killed in the last several years as violence among the drug cartels has increased. The lack of security hinders the country's economic prospects as investors remain wary about the risks of doing business there.
Mr. Peña Nieto, who took office in December, has made steps in recent months to centralize his country's fight against violence, rethinking some longstanding cooperative agreements with Washington.
Latin America analysts noted the lack of any agreement or formation of a special group to discuss security. They also said it was significant that Mr. Obama referred to Mexico as still forming its security agenda with the United States, despite the fact that 10 months have passed since Mr. Peña Nieto's election.
''On security, the fact that there were no new announcements underscores the fact that the Peña Nieto government does not have a detailed security strategy,'' said Maureen Meyer, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group.

HEADLINE: Scientists Divide Over Threat to Pacific Northwest Salmon

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- Like mariners scanning the horizon from the crow's nest, scientists have for years been on the lookout in the Pacific Northwest for signs that a dreaded salmon-killing disease, scourge to farmed salmon in other parts of the world, has arrived here, threatening some of the world's richest wild salmon habitats. Most say there is no evidence.
But for years, a biologist in Canada named Alexandra Morton -- regarded by some as a visionary Cassandra, by others as a misguided prophet of doom -- has said definitively and unquestionably that they are wrong. Wild Pacific salmon, she has said, are testing positive for a European strain of the virus that causes the disease, infectious salmon anemia, or I.S.A.
The virus, which has struck farmed salmon populations in Chile, among other places, is not harmful to humans who eat the fish, but could potentially pose grave threats in a part of the world where salmon plays a huge role in local economies and ecosystems. If the virus, which is in the influenza family, mutates into a virulent Pacific strain in the crowded fish farms in British Columbia, where wild and farmed salmon are sometimes in proximity, fish populations on both sides of the farm/wild divide, Ms. Morton believes, could be devastated. 
''It's an uncomfortable truth,'' she said.
But scientists and government testing groups in Canada and the United States have said repeatedly over several years that Ms. Morton's findings were not sufficient to sound an alarm, and that the risks to wild salmon, even in the event of a fish-farm outbreak, are unclear. After rounds of government hearings and millions of dollars spent on research, the two sides are in an increasingly bitter standoff.
''We're trying to re-create the situation that she's saying is out there, and to date we cannot re-create the results,'' said Dr. Penny Greenwood, national manager of the domestic disease control program at Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
Now, Ms. Morton has new test results that she said are positive for the infectious salmon anemia virus -- though not necessarily the disease -- in farmed salmon she bought at a fish market in Vancouver late last year. At the same time, the biggest effort ever on the American side of the border to find the virus is shifting into high gear, with fish samples arriving in labs in Idaho, Alaska and here in Washington State.
''I think we're probably pretty close to having a definitive answer,'' said Martin Krkosek, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Toronto.
The stakes are enormous, and not least for reputations. Salmon, in all their varied and usually pink-hued glory, have been an ecological anchor from Alaska to Oregon, intertwined with the region's culture and economy since long before the arrival of Lewis and Clark.
The search for the virus raises questions that have swirled through commercial fishing and oceanography: Has the growth of open-ocean fish farming over the last three decades and the vast netted pens of Atlantic salmon from Chile to Maine and Norway to Canada created a reliable source of sustainable, inexpensive protein? Or, as critics contend, are the farms unsustainable because they pollute the seabed and because the close confinement of the fish raises the risk of disease?
Salmon farmers say that the broader controversy over aquatic farming has informed the narrower discussion of the salmon disease, and that Ms. Morton in particular has been out to get them, whether a virus is involved or not.
Adding further fuel -- or at least, smoke -- to the fire is a new documentary that accuses the Canadian government of deliberately covering up evidence that would support Ms. Morton's conclusions. A Web site has since emerged that tries to debunk to the documentary.
''She says one thing, everybody else says something different, and therefore, in her view they're all in collusion, and not doing a good job,'' Ian Roberts, a spokesman for Marine Harvest Canada, the biggest salmon farming operation in British Columbia, said of Ms. Morton. He said his industry had sent upward of 8,000 samples for testing in recent years, without a single confirmed finding of the I.S.A. And he said the survival rate at his company's salmon farms was better than 90 percent.
There is no doubt that the disease can wreak havoc. First described in Norway in the mid-1980s, it has flared on fish farms from Maine and the eastern coast of Canada to Scotland and Chile, which reported a new outbreak last month. The virus is also capable of mutating rapidly, which scientists on all sides of the issue say increases the need to keep an eye on it. Its victims can be seen gasping at the surface, lethargic and often swollen with fluids; mortality can reach 90 percent.
The global seafood industry, meanwhile, has become harder than ever for researchers to monitor, with well-established problems of labeling and provenance. A recent study, for example, of fish purchased in markets and restaurants around the nation by a nonprofit ocean protection group, Oceana, found that about a third of the samples tested were mislabeled.
Dr. Greenwood, of the Canadian food agency, said that research to determine where one of Ms. Morton's market-purchased samples came from produced conflicting accounts from people in the supply chain. Without a clear chain of custody, she said, there was no point testing the fish at all. She said there had been no attempt to cover up anything.
''We couldn't even verify that that fish was in fact Canadian in origin,'' she said.
Wild fish coming into proximity with farmed fish is partly what raised disease concerns in British Columbia in the first place. Some fish pens, notably near the Fraser River, straddle the very corridor through which millions of sockeye salmon pass each year, both during their juvenile outmigration to the ocean and upon their return as adults to breed.
Those anxieties skyrocketed in 2009, when the salmon run on the Fraser suddenly collapsed, leading to a government inquiry in which infectious salmon anemia was discussed but never definitively implicated as a factor. (The Fraser's sockeye salmon bounced back in 2010 with one of the biggest runs ever recorded, and have hovered around their long-term averages since then.)
James Winton, chief of the Fish Health Section at the United States Geological Survey's Western Fisheries Research Center in Seattle, one of the labs involved in the new wave of tests, said that assessing disease risks to wild salmon went far beyond how close they get to their farmed cousins. Climate change, habitat loss, contaminants, variability of food supplies and ocean acidification, among other factors, may also play roles in affecting the susceptibility of wild salmon to diseases, he said.
Wild salmon remains a popular choice among diners, in part for its omega-3 fatty acids, which studies have shown are important for heart and brain health. The Washington State Department of Health sums up its advice in three succinct words and a bit of pro-wild caveat: ''Keep eating salmon!'' the agency says in its Web site. ''Wild salmon is a great choice and farmed salmon is a good alternative.''

HEADLINE: Corporate Jet Center Exposes Silicon Valley's Class Divide

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The approval of a new corporate jet center at this city's struggling airport might have been just another losing skirmish in the battle between Silicon Valley billionaires and middle-class neighborhoods worried about noise pollution. Instead, it is becoming the latest symbol for the rapidly growing gap between the region's haves, with their private jets and untold wealth, and the have-nots, clinging to more modest lives in the dwindling number of communities they can afford.
Google, which is responsible for many of the jets that will use the new $82 million center, is helping bring badly needed cash to Mineta San Jose International Airport, just as the tech industry is creating jobs and wealth in Silicon Valley. But the tech boom is also sharpening income inequality and fueling a housing boom that is squeezing families out of many Silicon Valley communities.
Whether it is the possibility of private jets' disturbing the sleep of San Jose homeowners, or the transformation of Palo Alto's last mobile home park into luxury apartments, local developments throughout Silicon Valley highlight how the tech boom is leaving many behind. Local officials worry about the trend, which experts say will only accelerate, and its effects on the valley's work force and diversity. 
''We're very focused on being a progressive and fair community in terms of those issues,'' Gregory Scharff, mayor of Palo Alto, said of efforts to provide affordable housing while recognizing the ''national treasure'' that is Silicon Valley. ''We actually innovate and create huge wealth for the United States. If you look at the companies that have just come out of Palo Alto, I would make you a bet that it would be one of the largest G.N.P.'s -- it could be a country.''
In the past, the tech industry created middle-class jobs and lifted the overall economy of Silicon Valley. But as tech companies have shifted manufacturing and midlevel jobs overseas over the years, highly paid workers have increasingly clustered here. Per-capita incomes have been rising even as median incomes have decreased for five years in a row, according to Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a private organization that co-publishes an annual report on the region.
''We're getting more high earners, and they're skewing the averages completely off,'' said Russell Hancock, chief executive of Joint Venture. ''We are becoming a community where our teachers, our police, our firefighters, our nurses, they can't live with us. They have to come in from other places. Healthy communities have all these people living together.''
Sales figures for single-family homes in Santa Clara and San Mateo, the two main counties in Silicon Valley, show median prices have risen about 30 percent in the past year while the inventory of available homes has fallen by roughly half, according to an analysis of local multiple listing service data by the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors. The median prices for March -- $735,000 in Santa Clara and $925,000 in San Mateo -- only hint at the current market's frenzy.
Each property now typically attracts between 10 and 30 offers, eventually selling from 5 percent to 25 percent above the asking price, said Moise Nahouraii, the owner of Referral Realty in Cupertino. Jeff Barnett, a former president of the association and a regional vice president at Alain Pinel Realtors, said 30 percent to 40 percent of sales were paid in cash.
''Last year, the market came up,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''This year, it's on fire; it's just unreal.''
In Palo Alto, one of the hottest markets, the longtime owner of the Buena Vista Mobile Home Park has moved to sell the property to a developer planning to build a complex with amenities that include a pool, a spa, a business center, a chef's demonstration kitchen and a pet grooming station. A local ordinance would guarantee the park's 400 residents -- more than a quarter of whom are children and 85 percent are Hispanic -- some compensation and possible relocation within Palo Alto.
But the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, a private group that provides free legal services on housing and other issues, is pressing the city to reject the conversion. With the waiting lists for affordable housing getting longer by the day, the group argues, the park's residents will be forced to leave Palo Alto, away from jobs and schools.
One resident, Mary Kear, 55, grew up in Mountain View, where her father owned a hardware store and was a farmer, and where Google has its headquarters. Ms. Kear, who worked in sales for more than three decades and is now a part-time school custodian, said she had to move a dozen times over the years because of rising rents, eventually gravitating to the park eight years ago. She hoped the city would reject the conversion.
''But I'm also going to try to talk to the guy at Facebook,'' she said in the living room of her tidy two-room trailer, adding that she had read that the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had recently established a political action committee for immigration reform. ''He's trying to help immigrants, and immigrants are here.''
Here in San Jose, many residents worry that the new corporate jet center will lead to a spike in overnight flights. Because of the airport's proximity to the downtown area and neighborhoods, aircraft generating more than 89 decibels, like commercial jets, are restricted from flying between 11:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m.; most corporate jets, though, are exempt from this curfew.
Signature Flight Support, the company that will build the center, said its main tenant would be Blue City Holdings, which manages airplanes belonging to Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and its executive chairman, Eric Schmidt. Maria Sastre, Signature's president, said her tenants would abide by the curfew and use a ''wide range of aircraft.''
Members of Citizens Against Airport Pollution are proud of their 23-year fight against noise and growth at the San Jose airport. Without them, they believe, the nighttime curfew on certain flights would have vanished long ago.
There were, of course, defeats along the way, including one, in a skirmish over decibels and aircraft weight, to Larry Ellison, the billionaire chief executive of Oracle. But the approval of the corporate jet center last month was a particularly major loss.
Jim Lynch, a 20-year member of Citizens Against Airport Pollution, stood in a parking lot at the airport recently, listening to the familiar sound of jets taking off and landing every few minutes. Though Google's executives are the only future customers named so far, he was worried about all the other tech barons.
''We're sticking up for the little people,'' he said. ''We may get bruised. We may get hit in the arm.''
Ed Hodges, co-chairman of Citizens Against Airport Pollution and a retired junior high school science teacher, said that behind the corporate jet center's approval, he saw the ascendancy of the tech elite at the expense of the middle class in Silicon Valley.
He and his wife, a retired nurse, bought their home here 38 years ago. ''We have a funny saying in our family: we could not afford to buy our own house today,'' he said. ''This is an example of what's happened to the middle class in Silicon Valley.''

HEADLINE: Suicide Rates In Middle Age Soared in U.S.

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE

 BODY:
Suicide rates among middle-aged Americans have risen sharply in the past decade, prompting concern that a generation of baby boomers who have faced years of economic worry and easy access to prescription painkillers may be particularly vulnerable to self-inflicted harm.
More people now die of suicide than in car accidents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which published the findings in Friday's issue of its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In 2010 there were 33,687 deaths from motor vehicle crashes and 38,364 suicides. 
Suicide has typically been viewed as a problem of teenagers and the elderly, and the surge in suicide rates among middle-aged Americans is surprising.
From 1999 to 2010, the suicide rate among Americans ages 35 to 64 rose by nearly 30 percent, to 17.6 deaths per 100,000 people, up from 13.7. Although suicide rates are growing among both middle-aged men and women, far more men take their own lives. The suicide rate for middle-aged men was 27.3 deaths per 100,000, while for women it was 8.1 deaths per 100,000.
The most pronounced increases were seen among men in their 50s, a group in which suicide rates jumped by nearly 50 percent, to about 30 per 100,000. For women, the largest increase was seen in those ages 60 to 64, among whom rates increased by nearly 60 percent, to 7.0 per 100,000.
Suicide rates can be difficult to interpret because of variations in the way local officials report causes of death. But C.D.C. and academic researchers said they were confident that the data documented an actual increase in deaths by suicide and not a statistical anomaly. While reporting of suicides is not always consistent around the country, the current numbers are, if anything, too low.
''It's vastly underreported,'' said Julie Phillips, an associate professor of sociology at Rutgers University who has published research on rising suicide rates. ''We know we're not counting all suicides.''
The reasons for suicide are often complex, and officials and researchers acknowledge that no one can explain with certainty what is behind the rise. But C.D.C. officials cited a number of possible explanations, including that as adolescents people in this generation also posted higher rates of suicide compared with other cohorts.
''It is the baby boomer group where we see the highest rates of suicide,'' said the C.D.C.'s deputy director, Ileana Arias. ''There may be something about that group, and how they think about life issues and their life choices that may make a difference.''
The rise in suicides may also stem from the economic downturn over the past decade. Historically, suicide rates rise during times of financial stress and economic setbacks. ''The increase does coincide with a decrease in financial standing for a lot of families over the same time period,'' Dr. Arias said.
Another factor may be the widespread availability of opioid drugs like OxyContin and oxycodone, which can be particularly deadly in large doses.
Although most suicides are still committed using firearms, officials said there was a marked increase in poisoning deaths, which include intentional overdoses of prescription drugs, and hangings. Poisoning deaths were up 24 percent over all during the 10-year period and hangings were up 81 percent.
Dr. Arias noted that the higher suicide rates might be due to a series of life and financial circumstances that are unique to the baby boomer generation. Men and women in that age group are often coping with the stress of caring for aging parents while still providing financial and emotional support to adult children.
''Their lives are configured a little differently than it has been in the past for that age group,'' Dr. Arias said. ''It may not be that they are more sensitive or that they have a predisposition to suicide, but that they may be dealing with more.''
Preliminary research at Rutgers suggests that the risk for suicide is unlikely to abate for future generations. Changes in marriage, social isolation and family roles mean many of the pressures faced by baby boomers will continue in the next generation, Dr. Phillips said.
''The boomers had great expectations for what their life might look like, but I think perhaps it hasn't panned out that way,'' she said. ''All these conditions the boomers are facing, future cohorts are going to be facing many of these conditions as well.''
Nancy Berliner, a Boston historian, lost her 58-year-old husband to suicide nearly two years ago. She said that while the reasons for his suicide were complex, she would like to see more attention paid to prevention and support for family members who lose someone to suicide.
''One suicide can inspire other people, unfortunately, to view suicide as an option,'' Ms. Berliner said. ''It's important that society becomes more comfortable with discussing it. Then the people left behind will not have this stigma.''

Previews and Openings
'Bunty Berman Presents...' (in previews; opens on Thursday) The New Group had a hit in 2008 with Ayub Khan Din's ''Rafta, Rafta...,'' a delightful comedy about Indian families in England's working-class North West. The same playwright returns with another ellipsis, this time attached to a Bollywood-style musical about a 1950s Bombay film producer (Mr. Din) whose star is fading, along with that of his once adored leading man. Mr. Din wrote the book and lyrics, and shared composing duties with Paul Bogaev. After doing a bang-up job on the earlier work, Scott Elliott again directs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney) 
'The Caucasian Chalk Circle' (previews start on Friday; opens on May 30) Once you've turned Wedekind into an alt-pop juggernaut, Brecht should be a snap, right? Duncan Sheik, whose ''Spring Awakening'' score earned him a Tony Award, has contributed a new score to this 1940s parable about goodness in a diabolical world. Christopher Lloyd heads a cast that includes the dependable supporting performers Mary Testa, Tom Riis Farrell and Elizabeth A. Davis. The director, Brian Kulick, did right by Brecht's play ''Galileo'' last year. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Eric Grode)
'City Council Meeting' (opens on Thursday) The three creators -- Mallory Catlett, Jim Findlay and Aaron Landsman -- have a combined résumé that includes stints with the Wooster Group, Elevator Repair Service, Banana Bag & Bodice, Collapsable Giraffe and a dozen other downtown theater institutions. But here they step outside the (black) box with a roaming participatory gloss on the titular civic event. Audience members can play councilors, speakers, supporters or bystanders, supported along the way by a combination of actual government transcripts, scripted material and live video. 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Performances will also take place at La Guardia Performing Arts Center, in Long Island City, Queens, and El Museo del Barrio.) (Grode)
'Core Values' (in previews; opens on Monday) Is there anyone working right now who projects working-stiff pathos better than Reed Birney? His sad-sack nobility, seen to such stirring effect in ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' and ''Uncle Vanya,'' seems ideally suited to this new workplace drama by Steven Levenson (''The Language of Tree''). It seems safe to assume that the setting -- a weekend staff retreat for a small travel agency -- won't offer much in the way of respite for the workaday stresses. Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, arsnovanyc.com. (Grode)
'A Family for All Occasions' (in previews; opens on May 12) The Labyrinth Theater looks to two of its leading lights, Philip Seymour Hoffman and the playwright Bob Glaudini, for this latest look into familial dysfunction. Mr. Hoffman starred in Mr. Glaudini's ''Jack Goes Boating'' in 2007, and now he's directing a group of other Labyrinth stalwarts (including Deirdre O'Connell and Jeffrey DeMunn) in this look at the upheavals that happen when a recent retiree's daughter brings her new boyfriend home. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Grode)
'Far From Heaven' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on June 2) It's been a busy spring for Richard Greenberg, who has opened two new Broadway plays, ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' which has already closed, and ''The Assembled Parties.'' Here he has joined the ''Grey Gardens'' creative team for the musicalization of a movie -- the lush 2002 homage to Douglas Sirk's febrile melodramas, in which racial and sexual taboos topple in a seemingly idyllic Connecticut town in 1957. Kelli O'Hara and Steven Pasquale lead the whopping cast of 18 -- the largest Playwrights Horizons has ever fielded. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'The Golden Dragon' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on May 15) For those trying to keep abreast of the more exciting playwriting voices beyond the United States and Britain, the Play Company has become an invaluable resource. The acclaimed German playwright Roland Schimmelpfennig, little seen on these shores, presents a dark comedy about all hell breaking loose in a pan-Asian restaurant. With the rising director Ed Sylvanus Iskandar (''These Seven Sicknesses'') at the helm, the production shouldn't be hurting for ambition. New Ohio Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, playco.org. (Grode)
'The Hotel Colors' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Wednesday) The Bushwick Starr has benefited from the off-kilter onstage presence of Eliza Bent in plays like ''In the Pony Palace/Football.'' Now she takes a turn on the other side of the footlights, or what pass for footlights in a gritty space like the Starr. Her new piece, set in a beat-up hostel on the periphery of Rome, features six travelers trying -- with mixed success -- to communicate. The script is made up of direct (as in quirkily convoluted) English translations of Italian. Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, between Irving and Wyckoff Avenues, Brooklyn, (800) 836-3006, thebushwickstarr.org. (Grode)
'Murder Ballad' (previews begin on Tuesday; reopens on May 22) A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman. Staged last fall at Manhattan Theater Club's Studio at Stage II, the show returns with most of its original cast (John Ellison Conlee, Will Swenson and Rebecca Naomi Jones) and an addition: Caissie Levy, who is taking over for Karen Olivo. Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Nikolai and the Others' (in previews; opens on Monday) The always inventive David Cromer directs a large cast that includes Blair Brown, Michael Cerveris, Alvin Epstein, Kathryn Erbe, John Glover and Stephen Kunken in this latest excursion into history from Richard Nelson. Set in Westport, Conn., during a spring weekend in 1948, the play considers the questionable ways in which American art was financed at the start of the cold war. It focuses on a gathering of Russian émigrés, including George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky, retracing the roots of their collaboration on the ballet ''Orpheus.'' Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'The Notebook of Trigorin' (previews start on Friday; opens on Wednesday) What? Another New York premiere of another late-career Tennessee Williams play? (''In Masks Outrageous and Austere'' popped up just last year.) Williams, a longtime admirer of Chekhov, took a stab at adapting ''The Seagull'' for a Vancouver theater company in 1981, and the Attic Theater Company is now giving the work its New York debut. (Classic Stage Company did a one-night staged reading a few years ago.) Even though the names remain the same, this is apparently a rather free adaptation, newly set in the Deep South. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Grode)
'Old-Fashioned Prostitutes (A True Romance)' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) He's baaaaaa-aack! Richard Foreman seems to have come out of retirement more times than Michael Jordan, Jay-Z and Brett Favre combined, and this time this enigmatic writer-director-designer has returned to one of his original stamping grounds. Plot synopses can always be a little dodgy with Mr. Foreman, but emotional heartbreak, an elusive coquette and an ''enigmatic fairy tale'' are among the promised bits. Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Grode)
'On Your Toes' (opens on Wednesday) City Center's Encores! series tackles this ambitious 1936 Rodgers and Hart musical, the first Broadway effort to throw classical dance and jazz music into the mix. The director-choreographer Warren Carlyle (''Chaplin'') has the unenviable assignment of tackling the ''Slaughter on Tenth Avenue'' jazz ballet, originally choreographed by George Balanchine -- and in the compressed timetable of Encores! rehearsals. Note to balletomanes: Irina Dvorovenko, one of the lead ''Slaughter'' dancers, is set to make her final appearance with American Ballet Theater on May 18. Might these seven performances signal a change of profession? City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)
'A Public Reading of an Unproduced Screenplay About the Death of Walt Disney' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) If you ever thought Epcot Center represented the cutting edge of futuristic coolness, fasten your seat belts. Walt Disney had far more ambitious plans for the city of the future, and the playwright Lucas Hnath has turned these world-changing ambitions into a heady mix of fact, fiction and oddness. Starring Larry Pine, a character actor beloved by both Wes Anderson and André Gregory, in the title role. Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, sohorep.org. (Grode)
'This Side of Neverland' (in previews; opens on Sunday) One of the Mint Theater's earliest resuscitation efforts came with a pair of plays by A.A. Milne, showing a creative world beyond the Hundred Acre Wood and its four-legged inhabitants. Now the Pearl Theater looks for similar success with J.M. Barrie of ''Peter Pan'' fame, with the help of two lesser-known one-act plays -- ''Rosalind'' (1914) and ''The Twelve-Pound Look'' (1921) -- that have very much grown up. Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Grode)
'White Hot' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Let's hope the Flea Theater has a grief counselor on hand. In recent years the enterprising theater has subjected its acting ensemble of Bats, as they're known, to racism (''I Hate ____ Mexicans''), sword-and-sorcery shenanigans (''She Kills Monsters'') and far worse (''Job''). Judging from the promotional materials, Tommy Smith's ''brutal comedy'' should settle in perfectly (un)comfortably alongside these offerings. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Assembled Parties' Richard Greenberg's play about the decline of an affluent family is a throwback to a time when Charm -- with a capital C -- was a cardinal virtue in theater. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. Lynn Meadow directs a fine cast led by a singularly Charming Jessica Hecht (2:35). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Big Knife' Bobby Cannavale stars in the first (and last?) Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's 1949 drama about a movie star in a moral bind: to knuckle under to studio blackmail and sign his life and artistic aspirations away, or leave behind the corrupt system and risk reprisals. Doug Hughes's sluggish production doesn't make a case for the play's enduring merits; Odets handled similar themes with more urgency and cogency in ''Golden Boy,'' seen earlier this season in a superior revival (2:20). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' Bette Midler gives the most lusciously entertaining performance of the Broadway season in John Logan's soufflé of a solo show in which she depicts the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers, dishing great piles of dirt as she awaits word from her great friend -- and ex-client -- Barbra Streisand (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Jekyll & Hyde' Frank Wildhorn musicals are the crab grass of Broadway, and this gothic musical from 1997, with a cliché-riddled book and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, started the scourge. Constantine Maroulis (''Rock of Ages''), as the titular duo, and the disco diva Deborah Cox, as the hooker with lungs of steel to match a heart of gold, sing the throat-thrashing score with impressive ease (2:20). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Macbeth' Alan Cumming portrays the Scottish general who would be king, and all the other significant roles, in this one-man race through Shakespeare's tragedy, set in a mental institution. Mr. Cumming's virtuosity and the gothic inventions of the directors, John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg, impress, but while the actor effectively differentiates the roles, he never fully inhabits any of them (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Nance' Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Orphans' In Lyle Kessler's 1983 play about motherless thugs, knives, guns, rope and fists are deployed to violent ends. Yet Daniel Sullivan's limp revival somehow plays like a sentimental sitcom, perhaps a low-rent ''Modern Family.'' Alec Baldwin, in slippery mode, plays the avuncular gangster, held hostage by two brothers: Ben Foster and the remarkably hyperkinetic Tom Sturridge (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, and in a lovely low-key performance, Condola Rashad (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin's production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'The Call' Tanya Barfield's thoughtful, absorbing drama explores the tensions that arise when a white couple (the terrific Kerry Butler and Kelly AuCoin) decide to adopt an African baby. Their African-American friends, a lesbian couple well played by Eisa Davis and Crystal A. Dickinson, have different perspectives on their choice. Leigh Silverman directs (1:50). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Collapse' This manic comedy follows four characters, each dealing with anxiety (1:30). New York City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'The Drawer Boy' The Oberon Theater Ensemble does a fine job with this lovely play by Michael Healey about two farmers, one with a brain injury, and the writer who comes to observe them for the purposes of writing a play about farming. The humor is left wry and dry, and when it comes time to reveal the story of how the two men arrived at their present state, heartstrings are tugged expertly (2:00).

&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; '_______ Up Everything' The unprintable title of this winsome rock musical is trying way too hard to shock and awe. But then, so are all the show's characters, who are Brooklyn faux-hemians desperately trying to prove their anti-establishment bona fides. Poking fun at the pasty-white underbelly of Brooklyn's hipster crowd is like shooting free-range ducks in an artisanal barrel, but with catchy music and a talented cast, this show still does so exquisitely well (1:35). Elektra Theater, 669 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, fueonstage.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Fuenteovejuna' Sometimes, when your boss starts raping and pillaging in the office, the grunts just have to beat him to death with a calculator. If that premise is confusing, so is the rest of a new adaptation of this 17th-century classic play, about a gallant Spanish town that rose up and killed its tyrannical overlord but refused to implicate anyone in his death. The production retains its original Spanish (with English subtitles) but has been poorly grafted onto a modern-day office setting (1:20). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9999, repertorio.org. (Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Here Lies Love' An invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, that sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world's a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'The Last Five Years' Jason Robert Brown has mounted a stylish production of his two-character musical about the waxing and waning of young love. Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe play aspiring artists whose paths diverge. Their story is told in songs that are skillfully written but, like his characters, are on the generic side (1:25). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'The Megile of Itzak Manger' In this Yiddish-language production inspired by the old scenery-chewing Purim spiels of Eastern Europe, a Polish circus troupe retells the story of the Book of Esther. Klezmer-style musical numbers are supplemented by some novice-level juggling, aerial silks and cartwheels, as well as craft-project-like puppets. The show does not really invest enough resources in any of these circus acts to deliver much that is striking or memorable, though, and the result looks a lot like a community theater production designed for children (1:30). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Ave.; (646) 312-5073, nationalyiddishtheatre.org. (Rampell)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812' When Dave Malloy's improbably wonderful electro-pop opera based on ''War & Peace'' opened in the fall, audience members were crowded together with Tolstoy's characters in an intimate setting: Ars Nova's theater, which had been transformed into a kind of basement nightclub, chockablock with tables and complete with vodka and pierogis. Singing about their loves and woes, the introspective, emotional, impetuous characters somehow felt like old friends -- and drinking buddies. Can that spirit be retained when the show moves to a new home in the meatpacking district, a Russian supper club built specifically for the production? Rachel Chavkin, who made marvelous use of her space and cast in the original staging, directs again (2:30). Kazino, West 13th Street, at Washington Street, thegreatcometof1812.com. (Saltz)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'Old Hats' Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit ''Fool Moon,'' have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines. The pixie-ish singer-songwriter Nellie McKay makes for a perfect musical foil in this ebullient, thoroughly charming variety show (1:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Scrambled Eggs: It's Not Always Over Easy' This warm but unchallenging play follows a woman who looks back on her uneventful life (1:20). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, scrambledeggstheplay.com. (Jaworowski)
&#x2605; 'Talley's Folly' Danny Burstein and Sarah Paulson give performances of translucent feeling in this loving Roundabout Theater Company revival of Lanford Wilson's 1979 romantic pas de deux about two misfits in 1944 Missouri trying to find a mutual rhythm. Directed with sympathy and insight by Michael Wilson (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Wanda's Monster' Making Books Sing, which turns children's books into musicals, has adapted Eileen Spinelli's 2002 picture book about Wanda, a little girl who knows that a monster lives in her closet. Barbara Zinn Krieger, who wrote the script, has transformed Wanda's Granny -- the only adult who acknowledges the truth of Wanda's perception -- from a sensible soul into a kick-out-the-jams rocker. This characterization works beautifully with the show's upbeat score and lyrics by the children's pop star Laurie Berkner. This charming hourlong production brings home a point worth considering at any age: embrace what you fear, and you just may find a friend (1:00). Theater 3, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (646) 250-1178, makingbookssing.org. (Laurel Graeber)
'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30).

Off Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'La Ruta' The theater is a tractor-trailer, and inside are cardboard boxes for playgoers to sit on while making the journey with immigrants being smuggled into Texas. This site-specific Working Theater production of Ed Cardona Jr.'s drama cannot fail to humanize the individuals trying to come to America, and the menace they face in doing so (1:10). Friday through Sunday, IBEW Local 3 Headquarters, 158-11 Harry Van Arsdale Jr. Avenue, Flushing, Queens. Wednesday through May 12, Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (212) 244-3300, theworkingtheater.com. (Daniel M. Gold)
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00). Return engagement starts on Saturday. The Kingsland Ward at St. John's, 195 Maujer Street, near Humboldt Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 374-5196, thenshefell.com. (Brantley)
'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

&#x2605; 'Finks' (closes on Sunday) The subject matter, the blacklist of the 1950s, may have been visited before, but this bracing production by the Ensemble Studio Theater gets your blood boiling all over again thanks to lively performances by Aaron Serotsky and especially Miriam Silverman. They play a couple who are caught up in the witch hunt, and the playwright, Joe Gilford, drew on the experiences of his own parents, actors who were blacklisted, to create the story (2:15).

'Futurology the Musical' (closes on Sunday) A lot of Anthony J. Dixon and Sandra J.

'A Marriage: 1 (Suburbia)' (closes on Saturday) It takes a building to examine a marriage: Nick Vaughan and Jake Margolin have taken over all of Here in mild but thorough fashion, the better to probe the tender spots of an institution that is, for better or worse, no longer for heterosexuals alone (1:30).

'Mayday Mayday' (closes on Sunday) In this amiable if insubstantial solo show, the British actor Tristan Sturrock, who starred on Broadway in ''Brief Encounter,'' recounts his recovery from a harrowing accident in which he broke his neck. Directed by Mr. Sturrock's wife, Katy Carmichael (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Isherwood)
'Plenty of Time' (closes on Sunday) John Shévin Foster's comic drama, set on Martha's Vineyard between 1968 and 2011, is just a pleasant, lightweight update of ''Same Time, Next Year,'' this time with an aspiring Black Panther and an Oak Bluffs debutante. Likable cast, though (1:45). Castillo Theater, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 941-5800, castillo.org. (Gates)
'The Testament of Mary' (closes on Sunday) A great actress, Fiona Shaw, and a fine, trenchant script by Colm Toibin struggle to assert themselves in this one-woman show about the mother of Jesus, directed with far too many flourishes by Deborah Warner. Though Ms. Shaw is as commanding as ever, she is ultimately overwhelmed by hysterical stagecraft (1:25). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)

HEADLINE: Paramount Hopes New 'Star Trek' Is a Global Crowd-Pleaser

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- For ''Star Trek Into Darkness,'' the coming $190 million movie from J. J. Abrams, the mission is to boldly go where no Star Trek film has gone before -- and get audiences overseas to care.
''Star Trek'' may be one of the biggest franchises in Hollywood history, but it has one surprising flaw: Captain Kirk doesn't travel well. Foreign moviegoers for one reason or another have never fully embraced the swaggering Starfleet captain and his oddball crew. That is a major problem for Paramount Pictures now that international ticket sales account for up to 80 percent of a movie's total gross. 
A 2009 effort to revive the Star Trek movie series was a smash hit in North America, taking in about $280 million, after adjusting for inflation. But box-office analysts were deeply disappointed by the film's foreign box office total of $139 million.
So Paramount has revved up its engines to warp speed for ''Into Darkness,'' which is already playing in some countries and will arrive in the United States on May 17. The Viacom-owned studio has increased its international marketing budget for the film by 35 percent over that for the 2009 film, asked stars to do an unusual amount of globetrotting and staggered the release dates to shield ''Into Darkness'' from competition.
Paramount's bid to draw in more foreign ticket buyers even extended to casting decisions and the script, which turns on a more terrestrial story. ''Into Darkness'' finds the Enterprise crew called back home, where a terror force has infiltrated the Starfleet organization.
''The team has really been in the weeds, so to speak, going country by country and looking at every possible opportunity,'' Brad Grey, Paramount's chairman, said of the studio's marketers in particular. ''On a profit level, focusing on your shareholders, this is now how detailed you have to be on pictures of this scope and scale.''
Mr. Grey added, ''Between J. J. outdoing himself and our efforts to build up our global distribution system, I'm very, very confident that the franchise is finally going to live up to its potential.'' In 2009, ''Star Trek'' may have been a disappointment outside North America, but it also represented enormous progress. The preceding film in the franchise, ''Star Trek: Nemesis'' in 2002, took in a grand total of $31 million overseas.
But Paramount and its financing and producing partner, Skydance Productions, are counting on ''Into Darkness'' to do much better -- perhaps delivering a 100 percent increase over the 2009 movie's overseas gross. The studio has little room for error. Hollywood's major studios will release as many as eight movies each over the summer, but Paramount will issue only two: ''Into Darkness'' and the risky ''World War Z,'' an intense zombie thriller starring Brad Pitt.
Pure science fiction has long been a difficult sell overseas, where audiences generally prefer space movies that have more fantasy elements, like ''Star Wars.'' The Star Trek movies, at least until Mr. Abrams came along to direct the 2009 version, also lacked eye-popping visual effects, leaning more on makeup tricks and drama on the bridge of the Enterprise.
Six ''Star Trek'' television shows, all notable for their kitsch, have been dubbed and distributed overseas, creating a solid (albeit older) fan base. But the TV show also hurts Paramount's big-screen efforts, adding to a perception that the franchise is an impenetrable universe of characters and story lines.
The 2009 film, which featured a young cast but no proven stars, was in some ways torpedoed by Paramount's own distribution decisions. Four other big releases -- ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine,'' ''Angels & Demons,'' ''Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian'' and ''Terminator Salvation'' -- all opened in the same period, giving ''Star Trek'' little time to find its way.
This time, Paramount has decided on a staggered rollout, releasing ''Into Darkness'' in Australia, Germany, Britain and Mexico before the United States and Canada, and holding the movie back elsewhere. It will not arrive in Japan until August, for instance. Unlike the 2009 chapter, ''Into Darkness'' is planned for distribution in China. All told, Paramount will stage red carpet premieres in seven countries.
Cast members and producers have been crisscrossing the globe for months as part of advance marketing efforts. Chris Pine, who plays Capt. James Kirk, was dispatched to Tokyo in December to unveil a nine-minute trailer. More recently, Bryan Burk, an ''Into Darkness'' producer, went on an 11-city foreign tour -- South America, Asia, Europe -- to show 35 minutes of the movie, almost a third of it, to journalists and exhibitors.
Paramount went out of its way to cast foreign actors, in particular adding the British star Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain. And writers tried to produce a self-contained plot that would be exciting to loyal Star Trek fans but not put off people who know nothing about the franchise, which now includes 12 movies. (Research showed that foreign ticket buyers viewed the 2009 film as ''too Trekkie and too sci-fi,'' in the words of one Paramount executive.)
''Classically people think that it's a space film, but this one is a very earthbound story,'' Mr. Pine recently said at a convention for theater owners.
Judging by advance excerpts Paramount has shown, the studio has added some superhero touches; Mr. Pine, for instance, dons a space suit and zooms through an asteroid field in a sequence that resembles an ''Iron Man'' moment.
The ''Iron Man'' movies, as Paramount knows, having distributed the first two, are enormously popular overseas.

BYLINE: By MAURICE CHAMMAH.

 BODY:
Although the crowd of clubs and concert halls on Sixth Street, the famed Austin thoroughfare, is just a few blocks from the State Capitol, the worlds of live music and policy making seldom meet. But this session, lawmakers are considering subsidizing live music. 
House Bill 3095, by Representative Mark Strama, Democrat of Austin, would cut in half the tax on mixed beverages for businesses that stage live music at least four nights a week for 45 weeks a year, provided they prove that they will spend the savings putting on concerts.
Mr. Strama proposed the bill with his hometown in mind. ''Music is as much a part of the Austin economy as oil and gas are part of the Texas economy,'' he said.
Some club owners and performers say the bill would help at a time when the music industry is suffering. But organizations representing cities and counties around Texas disagree, saying that the decreased tax would rob them of needed revenue, and that there is no proof that the savings would be passed on to musicians.
Nearly 200 Texas sites -- roughly a third of them in Austin -- would probably meet the tax-cut requirements, according to the Texas Music Office, an agency financed by the governor's office.
The Legislative Budget Board, which studies the economic impact of potential legislation, estimated that the measure could cost the state, cities and counties $60 million to $80 million a year.
Mr. Strama said that projection was too high for the estimated number of eligible clubs and halls. He said he was working to get a lower figure before taking the bill back to a House committee, where it is pending.
In a letter to music professionals urging support for the bill, Terry Lickona, the producer of the nationally syndicated live music show ''Austin City Limits,'' wrote that with the downturn in profits for recorded music, ''the industry's primary business driver'' is now live music. But club owners, he said, face ''high start-up costs, high taxes and copyright fees,'' so they need more incentives to book live acts.
''It's hard to have a live music venue make money,'' said Travis Newman, who books music for the Parish, a downtown Austin bar that regularly presents live music. ''Musicians end up being squeezed.''
But the tax break would be ''such a cost to the cities,'' said Shanna Igo, the deputy executive director of the Texas Municipal League, an advocate for cities. (The Texas Municipal League is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
Donald Lee, the director of the Texas Conference of Urban Counties, said the tax breaks would be pocketed by the clubs and would not go to musicians. ''We just can't reconcile ourselves to the idea that live music venues in Texas are threatened by the current tax on alcohol, which there seems to be an insatiable appetite for, no matter what the price,'' Mr. Lee said.
Mr. Newman acknowledged that some clubs would probably pocket the tax break. ''But the cream rises to the top,'' he said, ''and bands will know which venues treat musicians well and pass on the savings.''

HEADLINE: Trading Blame As U.S. Posts Stay Unfilled

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- John Kerry is practically home alone at the State Department, toiling without permanent assistant secretaries of state for the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Africa. At the Pentagon, a temporary personnel chief is managing furloughs for 800,000 civilian employees. There has not been a director of the Internal Revenue Service since last November, and it was only on Thursday that President Obama announced a nomination for commerce secretary after the job was open for nearly a year.
As the White House races this week to plug holes in the cabinet, the lights remain off in essential offices across the administration. The vacancies, attributed to partisan politics and lengthy White House vetting, are slowing policy making in a capital already known for inaction, and embarrassing a president who has had more than five months since his re-election to fill many of the jobs.
''I don't think it's ever been this bad,'' said Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, who recently wrote a letter urging Mr. Obama to act swiftly to fill top vacancies. 
One of the worst backlogs is at the State Department, where nearly a quarter of the most senior posts are not filled, including those in charge of embassy security and counterterrorism. The Treasury Department is searching for a new No. 2, the Department of Homeland Security is missing its top two cybersecurity officials and about 30 percent of the top jobs at the Commerce Department are still vacant, including that of chief economist.
At the Pentagon, which is helping to lead the administration's pivot to a greater focus on Asia, the assistant secretary of defense for Asia is about to leave his job.
Mr. Kerry expressed frustration about the State Department vacancies in recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying he was ''still waiting for the vetting to move'' at the White House for people he recommended for jobs ''way back in February.''
But in a statement to The New York Times, Mr. Kerry said, ''I have a new appreciation for how much the confirmation process has become a political football in recent years and what that forces on the vetting process required to announce nominees.''
Although Mr. Kerry said that ''the White House and the administration make the very best out of a tough situation,'' who is to blame is a matter of intense debate.
The White House faults an increasingly partisan confirmation process in the Senate and what officials say are over-the-top demands for information about every corner of a nominee's life. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew received 444 questions from senators before his confirmation, more than the seven previous Treasury nominees combined, according to data compiled by the White House. Gina McCarthy, Mr. Obama's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, got 1,000 questions from the Senate, White House officials said.
''Current Congressional Republicans have made no secret of the extraordinary lengths they will go to to obstruct the confirmation process,'' said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. ''That unprecedented evasiveness, often about matters decades old or unrelated to the post, slows down the process from beginning to end.''
But members of Congress and a number of agency officials say the bottleneck is at the White House, where nominees remain unannounced as the legal and personnel offices conduct time-consuming background checks aimed at discovering the slightest potential problem that could hold up a confirmation. People who have gone through the vetting in Mr. Obama's White House describe a grueling process, lasting weeks or months, in which lawyers and political operatives search for anything that might hint at scandal.
Administration officials, members of Congress and scholars of the federal appointment process say it is difficult to determine -- short of a six-month-long study -- if Mr. Obama has filled fewer of the roughly 1,200 federal jobs that require Senate confirmation than George W. Bush or Bill Clinton had at this point in their second terms. But there is widespread agreement that an alarming number of important posts in the government's most senior ranks are vacant or filled with acting deputies with little authority to make decisions.
''It's a weakening of accountability down the chain of command,'' said Paul Light, a professor at New York University who has done extensive research on the appointment process. ''You don't have someone there who has full authority to say 'yes' or 'no.' The whole system tends to grind down to a very slow crawl.''
The vetting process varies in the Obama White House, but it typically begins with a brief conversation with a lawyer from the White House counsel's office on basic questions: drug use, taxes, criminal convictions. Next are financial disclosure forms seeking information about transactions as far back as a decade: home purchases, investments, income, employment. That is followed by questions from the Office of Government Ethics, which scours the answers for inconsistencies.
In the security check that follows, potential nominees are asked to disclose all travel and meetings with foreign governments during the past 10 years or more. That is followed by a request for everything the nominee has ever written -- papers, speeches, articles -- and the official questions from members of Congress.
''The basic premise was that it was better to over-vet, to get everything on the table early and not give something that could end up becoming a scandal,'' said one former administration official, who underwent his own examination and requested anonymity to discuss internal White House procedures.
At the State Department, the top official for arms control is waiting for Senate confirmation, and there is no permanent ambassador at large for global women's issues. Mr. Kerry is also missing one of his two primary deputies. White House officials say that the vacancies are the result of departures when Hillary Rodham Clinton left the top post after the November election. Several came open just a few weeks ago.
The Commerce Department vacancies have emerged since John E. Bryson abruptly left the secretary's post last June after an accident in which he had a seizure while driving. On Thursday, Mr. Obama nominated Penny Pritzker, his longtime financial backer and an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, to lead the agency.
Mr. Wolf, the Virginia Republican, who has long focused attention on the war in Darfur, said the lack of a top State Department official for Africa meant that ''you don't have the decision makers there.'' In a letter to Rebecca M. Blank, the deputy commerce secretary, he wrote that he was also concerned about the vacancies in her department.
''I urge you to prompt the White House to expeditiously appoint persons to these important positions,'' Mr. Wolf wrote. In thick black ink, he underlined the words ''prompt'' and ''expeditiously,'' and added ''This is important'' under his signature.
William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was a co-author of an article titled ''A Half-Empty Government Can't Govern,'' said he was especially taken aback by the State Department vacancies.
''John Kerry won't be able to function very long as his own assistant secretary for the Near East,'' he said.

As of the beginning of May, 16 of the department's 59 top jobs were vacant or filled with men and women performing the duties in an ''acting'' capacity. In most cases, the White House has yet to announce nominees to fill the positions permanently. (A14)

HEADLINE: From Garden State To Vineyard State

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
GO ahead, make the jokes about New Jersey wine. They're so easy.
But consider this: While you're sniggering about Tony Soprano and Snooki sipping spumante with notes of petroleum, people with more sophisticated taste -- or maybe just those willing to think ''outer coastal plain'' instead of ''New Jersey'' -- are leaning against a copper bar tasting an inviting Vidal Blanc. Or enjoying a cabernet sauvignon and the views of Sourland Mountain on a stone terrace, wondering what excuse they have to hold a party there. They are stopped at a roadside tasting room with a hint of ocean breeze outside, while inside, a knowledgeable young sommelier pours a rosé that she declares ''pretty.'' And they have to agree.
How would you rather spend your time? Snooki or pretty? 
True, it is hard to find a state now that isn't trying to capitalize on some sort of wine trail.But New Jersey offers several reasons for excitement. Last year the legislature bucked the state's powerful liquor wholesalers lobby to pass a direct shipping law, which benefited New Jersey residents who until then could not send wine back home from wineries in other states, and also opened up a market for New Jersey winemakers to ship their products. Several wineries have opened since the passage of the law; there are now nearly 50 wineries statewide, and with $35 million in annual sales, New Jersey is now the seventh-largest wine-producing state.
For perspective, that's close behind Kentucky. But unlike Kentucky, New Jersey -- particularly the southern half -- features ideal conditions for growing wine, with sandy soil, mild winters and a long growing season. As you drive south of Trenton, the scrub pines along the road will remind you more of Cape Cod than of, say, Elizabeth.
New Jersey winegrowers are confident that they have something people will pay to ship. Their wines have won many awards, but the most buzzed-about was the so-called Judgment of Princeton last June. Organized by the American Association of Wine Economists, it was modeled on the Judgment of Paris in 1976, when the upstart Californians edged out the establishment French in a blind taste test. This time a New Jersey red came in third out of 10, following only a Mouton-Rothschild and an Haut-Brion. Among 10 whites, a New Jersey wine produced an hour's drive from Manhattan came in second, with two other Jersey wines straight behind it. The two French judges (the others were Belgian and American) chose New Jersey wines over their own nation's Bordeaux.
New Jersey had a prodigious wine industry before Prohibition, but has produced mostly fruit wine. The newer vintners are planting European varieties -- some adamantly refuse to grow even blueberries, once the state's bumper crop.
The move to wine is an attempt to make more money where produce farms are no longer profitable: as you drive the various spurs of the wine trail, it can sometimes seem as if housing subdivisions and vineyards were battling for control of farmland.
I first discovered New Jersey wine country last spring on a tour of South Jersey with the State Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, shortly after I began writing about the state. An ironworker who doesn't drink much wine (''I'm a vodka guy''), Mr. Sweeney had pushed for direct shipping as a boon to tourism, particularly for the less wealthy southern part of the state.
He looked proud as a grape set to burst as he introduced me to Scott Donnini, who left his life as a lawyer for the Philadelphia stock exchange to start Auburn Road Vineyard and Winery with his wife and four friends in 2006. At the end of a winding dirt road, the vineyard reminded me of something I'd find on the North Fork of Long Island. Discovering a wine bar here was proof of the surprises within the state. (We'd also just come from a rodeo around the corner.) Southern and Northern New Jersey are like two different countries: the South is more conservative and far more rural; ''the city'' is Philadelphia, not New York. But even farther north, there is far more open land than in the caricature of the most densely populated state in the nation. I easily imagined coming back to Auburn Road, and became curious about other wineries.
To get recommendations, I consulted Gary Pavlis, of the Rutgers Agricultural Experiment Station, who has run state wine competitions for years, as well as the Garden State Wine Growers Association. I also made a point to visit all the wineries that performed best at Princeton.
Not all of them can transport you to Bordeaux or Tuscany. Along the trail, I found a tasting room across the street from a car detailing shop, and tasted chocolate wine. (It actually wasn't bad, but you have to wonder if it's the best ambassador for a state trying to establish itself as a serious wine-producing region. By the same measure, a vineyard aspiring to evoke the Italian countryside might rethink its decision to offer pretzels and Chex Mix as palate cleansers.)
But in visits to nine wineries, I found lovely wines and breathtaking scenery. And more often than expected, a combination of both.
Mr. Pavlis divides New Jersey vintners into two strains: those who bailed on more corporate careers to try their hand at winemaking, and those whose land was farmed for fruit and other crops, now hoping that wine will be more lucrative. Heritage Vineyards in Mullica Hill falls into the second category, having long been a peach and apple farm -- the rule of thumb, Mr. Pavlis says, is that cabernet grapes thrive where apple trees do; both need long growing seasons and well-drained soil.
Walking into the tasting room, in a small building on a busy rural road, you are overwhelmed by the aromas from the bakery counter in the back, a remnant of its past life as a farm stand.
The fifth generation of the Heritage family turned the farm over to grapes in 1999, bringing in a well-regarded winemaker to consult. Its wines performed best overall at the Princeton tastings: BDX, its homage to Bordeaux, took third place, and the chardonnay was third among the whites.
There are encroaching subdivisions across the street and alongside the vineyards, yet the tasting room, with wood paneling and plates of Gouda set out on the bar, invites you to relax. There are more tables outside on a gravel patio -- the vineyard gets most of its visitors in the summer, including traffic from the Jersey Shore, about an hour away.
The young woman behind the bar, unpretentious, friendly and smart, introduced us to Chambourcin, wine made from a hybrid grape that was developed in France specifically for planting in the northern regions of the United States. It makes several appearances at New Jersey vineyards.
My husband and I left with a bottle of that, and the pretty rosé, and headed through the Mullica Hill Historic District to Auburn Road, in Pilesgrove.
In the small enoteca Mr. Donnini and his co-founders built next to their winemaking room, there are intimate tables, a woodstove, Mason jar candles and a wall of windows overlooking the vineyard. Chalkboards advertise the wines and a menu for Friday night dinners. It hosts open mike night on Wednesdays and local musicians every Saturday. The emphasis on music extends to the wines: the blush is named Rosalita, the blueberry wine Kind of Blue.
Set among wide fields, Auburn Road is a half-hour from Philadelphia and around the corner from Cowtown, the longest-running weekly rodeo in the country -- look for the 20-foot-high fiberglass cowboy statue out front. Many winery visitors wander over from Saturday shows there in the summer, and Auburn Road also sells at the flea market held in the rodeo parking lots on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The biggest seller: the Blessington, which the woman behind the counter described as ''Welch's for grown-ups.'' (She suggested mixing it with club soda for instant sangria -- no need to add fruit.)
We had come expecting to have lunch here -- the Web site said food was served ''daily'' -- but when we arrived, we were told it was only on weekends. We ate at a diner instead (this is New Jersey) then drove into the Pinelands to Bellview Winery.
At the end of a sandy, secluded lane, this land was bought by an Italian immigrant in 1914 and became a bok choy farm dealing mostly to New York's Chinatown. The owner made wine in his basement, and in 2000 his great-grandson, Jim Quarella, decided to make a genuine venture of it, turning all the fields over to grapes. His success won it the winery of the year award in the state competition last year. The tasting room -- in a building where Mr. Quarella's great-grandfather made his wine -- is simple, with tables and a tile floor. The real charm is outside, with picnic tables and fire pits, where you can spend a lazy afternoon overlooking the vineyards.
The staff was setting up for an event the next day, but obligingly guided us through the tasting menu -- my husband later declared the Petit Verdot the best of the wines we tasted along the trail. We finished with two versions of dandelion wine that Mr. Quarella's great-aunts taught him how to make.
We ended the day at Tomasello, one of the oldest wineries in the state. It has four tasting rooms in addition to this main one in Hammonton, which looks like a function hall from the entrance. You get a glimpse of the vineyards as you walk in, but the window in the tasting room faces the other direction, onto a busy commercial strip.
''Can we help you?'' a woman behind the bar asked, or rather, accused. She and a colleague were busy helping customers there on a Groupon offer. Her colleague moved over to pour for our tasting, and told us that their best-selling wine was Ranier Red, which, as she said cheerfully, ''tastes like jelly.'' Another couple arrived seeking the Red Raspberry wine, which they had heard good things about. If you want a taste of New Jersey's past as a destination for fruit wine, this is your place.
We set out again on a Sunday a few weeks later with our kids, 4 and 6, in tow. I was not sure this was as wise as it was economical, but I was quickly reassured as we arrived at Silver Decoy, in the farmlands east of Trenton. The tasting room is not elaborate: a concrete bunker that served as a storage area when the land was a sod farm. But inside there was a wood stove to warm up the space, and the kids quickly found their way to the patio that opens up to the vineyards. They tossed a ball and chased a dog, which chased a tractor preparing the fields for planting, as we tasted wine and talked to Mark Carduner, who started Silver Decoy with seven friends in 2001, planting chardonnay and cabernet franc grapes -- the chardonnay took fourth place at Princeton, beating three out of four French wines tested.
Like other vineyards, this one often hosts festivals and musicians. (Check the wineries' Web sites for dates.) And it welcomes lacrosse sticks and soccer balls, making it a great picnic place.
If you care more about hosting a wedding than drinking wine, you could check out Laurita Winery in New Egypt, which was described to me as the prettiest winery in the state. Its enormous, barnlike building rises off a hill of manicured fields, with a two-story tasting room and gift shop, a dining space with a wall of windows and a porch overlooking the vineyards, and a cafe where you can buy light food. It offers lots of events -- a girls' night out with ''guidance readings,'' an ''awesome '80s dance night.'' But to me it felt like a rest stop, with a stretch limo in the parking lot. Its big-selling wine: Chocolate Therapy, a vintner's version of a White Russian, combining Chambourcin grapes, chocolate and milk.
We departed quickly, despite an enticing playground, and headed to Hopewell Valley Vineyards, about 40 minutes north.
Turning off a rural main road north of Princeton, we followed a family on bicycles down a gravel driveway to a tasting room with terra cotta floors and a copper bar. Every table was full, and soon a jazz band began to play; the kids danced while we tasted (and ate pretzels).
The family of the owner, Sergio Neri, has long owned vineyards in Italy, and he wants to recreate a taste of Italy at his vineyard. His brother ships over Sangiovese grapes, and Mr. Neri has begun planting Barbera; this was the only place we found that variety of wine along our trail.
Up here is horse country. The vineyards are all about a 20-minute drive from the antiques markets of Lambertville and New Hope, and you could easily combine stops.
We headed instead along a roller coaster road into the Sourland Mountain range, to Unionville Vineyards. The tasting room is up a steep staircase into a red barn, with a big window where you can look down on the big stainless-steel tanks in the production room. The tasting menu is appealing, but even better, get a full glass and sit outside at one of the tables in the sunshine. (If you want the wedding and good wine, the patio here would be the place.) Our kids jumped over stones in a trickling stream and onto a path into the fields, where we tracked horseshoe prints and found a groundhog hole.
We pulled up to Old York Cellars, five minutes away, just before closing time at 5 -- and were immediately glad we had not decided to skip it. The tasting room is small -- there are plans to expand it -- but the views of rolling farmland from the stone terrace are stunning. You can combine a wine and chocolate tasting -- we gave the chocolate to our kids, which satisfied them until they decided to climb trees, which did not seem to bother the owner, David Wolin, who chatted with us. A real estate lawyer in Manhattan, he bought the land in 2008 (it had been Amwell Valley Vineyards) and opened in 2010. ''The biggest compliment we get is that this doesn't look like New Jersey,'' he said.
On Yelp, some visitors complain about lines out the door on weekends, but we had attentive service and no line. And -- was it the end of the day? -- we raved about almost every wine we tasted. We had been buying a bottle or two from each vineyard, but from here, we took home three: a Vidal Blanc, a cabernet sauvignon and a port called Southpaw Red.
No joke.

HEADLINE: Subsidy Gone, States Must Pay The Freight to Keep Rail Routes

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
HUNTINGDON, Pa. -- The unmistakable wail of a locomotive horn and screeching steel wheels signal the arrival of the evening Amtrak train in this central Pennsylvania town just over an hour west of Harrisburg, the state capital. The train is one of two that stop here daily, a vital link to Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and the entire Northeast Corridor.
''There is no bus service or airports nearby,'' said Dee Dee Brown, the mayor of this town of 7,000, who often rides the train to Philadelphia. ''It's just the train, and, quite frankly, we would be a ghost town without it.'' 
But after years of financial losses on the route for Amtrak, Pennsylvania was faced with either picking up the tab or losing it altogether by Oct. 1. Under pressure from Congress to reduce its dependence on federal subsidies, Amtrak is looking at either closing 28 short-haul routes or getting 19 states to cover the costs. Most of the states have already agreed to pick up the costs.
The railroad has traditionally subsidized some local routes, while leaving others up to the states to support, but now state governments will have to pay for all local routes of less than 750 miles in a state. The Northeast line, Amtrak's moneymaker, is not included.
If all the states chip in, Amtrak officials expect revenue to increase by about $85 million a year, which would shrink its chronic deficit.
Pennsylvania and Virginia are among the states that have already agreed to pay for service, citing the need to ease road congestion, spur economic development and remain connected to the Northeast line. But other states, like Indiana, are still debating what to do. In most cases, the routes run at a loss, say state officials, who view them more as an infrastructure investment like a highway.
The cost-sharing arrangement between Amtrak and the states, mandated by a 2008 law, is designed to reduce federal support for Amtrak, which has received nearly $40 billion in taxpayer subsidies since its founding in 1971, and has never made a profit. Last year, the railroad got about $1.4 billion in federal money for its operations, rail maintenance and equipment purchases.
Last year, Amtrak -- which says ticket prices and fees cover about 88 percent of its operating costs -- lost more than $450 million, mostly a result of constant maintenance of tracks and bridges that are decades old. Its long-distance routes also contribute to the losses, but they are not included in the cost-sharing program because they cross so many states.
Joseph H. Boardman, Amtrak's president, said sharing costs with states would reduce the need to ask Congress to cover operating expenses and make financing for rail service more uniform. He said the federal operating subsidy last year of $466 million was down from a peak of $755 million in 2004, a result of cost sharing with some states, as well as record ridership and revenues.
''It's what Congress has been doing for years, that is to push costs down to the state and local level,'' Mr. Boardman said. ''It's not going to be a windfall for Amtrak, but it will help reduce our costs.''
The Brookings Institution, the Washington policy research group, attributed some of the improvement in the railroad's finances to its partnership with 15 states that pay at least part of the expenses on 21 train routes. Last year, states paid Amtrak about $180 million to operate trains.
Virginia, which began contracting with Amtrak for a train between Lynchburg and Washington in 2009, recently added a route to Norfolk from Richmond and passed legislation to finance it.
''We see good rail service as part of our overall transportation plans to reduce congestion on the highways, and the routes add to the economic vitality of our communities,'' said Kevin B. Page, the chief operating officer of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation.
Virginia officials said Amtrak spent over $100 million on goods and services in the state last year. The railroad also employed 864 residents, adding $73 million in wages.
Pennsylvania, which spends about $9 million a year for Amtrak service connecting Harrisburg and Philadelphia, recently agreed to pay an additional $3.8 million a year for the Pittsburgh-to-Harrisburg service. State officials worried about picking up the cost for the line, which averages about 400 riders a day. But they agreed to pay the cost after local officials like Huntingdon's mayor staged rallies to support the route and Amtrak lowered its cost estimates.
''We always saw the line as important to the communities along the route and an integral cog in the regional transportation system. It was just a matter of cost, " said Erin Waters-Trasatt, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. ''We feel comfortable with the agreement we've reached with Amtrak.''
In Indiana, state officials are studying whether to kick in $4 million to $5 million a year to continue the Hoosier State train between Indianapolis and Chicago.
Will Wingfield, a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Transportation, said the state was in the process of hiring a consultant to evaluate the service.
In California, officials are weighing whether to pay an additional $20 million to $25 million a year to keep service between San Diego and San Luis Obispo.
Transportation experts like Robert Puentes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was a co-author of its Amtrak study, said he expected all the states to eventually agree to the cost-sharing arrangement, which will provide more money to upgrade tracks and improve stations.
''The larger implication is that it will have a positive impact on Amtrak's budget and improve passenger rail service,'' Mr. Puentes said.
He said Congress, Amtrak and the states should consider developing a cost-sharing plan for the money-losing long-distance routes, on which the railroad loses about $614 million a year. Cost sharing on longer routes could reduce Amtrak's dependence on federal subsidies by $800 million a year, Mr. Puentes said.
Amtrak officials disagree.
''It's not something we would endorse,'' said Mr. Boardman, the Amtrak president. ''Some states might pay, while others might not. That would leave gaps in the network and impact overall service.''

HEADLINE: Former Hedge Fund Trader Sentenced in Insider Case

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
It is a scene that has played out over and over at the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan.
A once high-flying hedge fund trader stands before a judge, often apologizing for his misdeeds. A high-priced defense lawyer asks for leniency, arguing that the client has lived -- outside of his insider trading crimes -- an otherwise admirable life. After listening intently, the judge rejects those pleas and sends the defendant to prison.
Todd Newman became the latest to join the parade of Wall Street traders -- along with a smattering of business executives, management consultants and corporate lawyers -- who went through this routine and had their lives upended by the government's crackdown on insider trading. 
In his almost five years of trading technology stocks at Diamondback Capital Management, Mr. Newman, 48, earned more than $10 million.
On Thursday, he received a prison sentence of four and a half years.
''This is a crime that has an impact across an economy and across a society,'' said Judge Richard J. Sullivan, who presided over Mr. Newman's trial and handed down the sentence. ''This was a stark crossing of the line, engaging in criminal conduct, and that's just wrong.''
Last December, a jury convicted Mr. Newman and another former hedge fund trader, Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors, of a conspiring with six others to earn about $70 million illegally trading technology stocks. The charges centered on trading in shares of Dell and Nvidia based on secret financial information obtained from insiders at the companies.
The case is one of several insider trading prosecutions that has ensnared SAC Capital Advisors, the giant $14 billion hedge fund run by the investor Steven A. Cohen that has become a focus of the government's inquiry.
Federal prosecutors have charged two former SAC employees with participating in the conspiracy involving Mr. Newman. Jon Horvath, a former SAC technology stock analyst, admitted to being a part of the ring last year. In March, Mr. Horvath's boss, Michael S. Steinberg, was also charged. Mr. Steinberg has pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Cohen has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has said that he behaved appropriately at all times. On Thursday, SAC announced several measures to beef up its legal and compliance effort, including clawing back pay for employees who break the law.
The case involving Mr. Newman has another connection to SAC: both Diamondback and Level Global, which are now defunct, were started by SAC alumni.
Diamondback, a hedge fund based in Stamford, Conn., that shut down last year, is seeking millions of dollars in restitution from Mr. Newman, characterizing itself as a victim of his crimes. A divorced father with a 12-year-old daughter, Mr. Newman lives in Needham, Mass., a low-key Boston suburb. He built a successful career specializing in investing in technology stocks. Before joining Diamondback in 2006, he worked at Tudor Investment, one of the world's most prominent hedge funds.
Describing him as a ''good, honorable and decent human being,'' Mr. Newman's lawyer made his case for a light sentence. ''This is not who he is,'' said the lawyer, John A. Nathanson. ''His reputation has been decimated.''
The sentence was less than the six and a half years that federal prosecutors had sought. Judge Sullivan also imposed about $1.75 million in fines and forfeiture.
Mr. Newman is one of 81 individuals charged by the United States attorney in Manhattan since 2009. Of those, 73 have either pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury, and 48 of those have already been sentenced.
A large majority of the insider trading defendants have confessed instead of fighting the charges. Just 10 have taken their cases to trial, and all of them have been found guilty.
Mr. Steinberg and another former SAC portfolio manager, Mathew Martoma, could test the government's perfect trial record. Mr. Martoma was indicted in December on charges that he corrupted a doctor to leak secret data about a clinical drug trial, allowing SAC to earn profits and avoid losses of $276 million.
Both Mr. Martoma and Mr. Steinberg have refused to cooperate with the government in helping them build a potential case against their former boss, Mr. Cohen. Their trials are not yet set, but are not likely to start until at least early 2014.
SAC has settled a pair of civil lawsuits -- one for $602 million, another for $14 million -- that were brought against the firm by securities regulators related to Mr. Martoma's and Mr. Steinberg's cases.
During the sentencing of Mr. Newman on Thursday, Judge Sullivan, who has presided over a number of the insider trading cases, said he grappled with why so many Wall Street executives had committed this crime. He compared Mr. Newman and others to less fortunate defendants, like one he had recently sentenced who grew up in dire poverty in the Dominican Republic and turned to a life of crime.
''I'm not excusing that, but one could see how those circumstances would push one to the dangers of criminal activity,'' the judge said. ''But it is hard to understand why someone who has reached the pinnacle of success would risk all that for more.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HIGHLIGHT: Boston Marathon bombings suspect tells of considering Fourth of July attack; Egypt&#8217;s birthrate rises; the European Central Bank cuts its interest rate; two popes in the Vatican; and the fate of Venice&#8217;s boy and frog. 

 BODY:
 NEWS The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings told F.B.I. interrogators that he and his brother had considered suicide attacks and striking on the Fourth of July as they planned their assault, according to two law enforcement officials. Eric Schmitt, Mark Mazzetti, Michael S. Schmidt and Scott Shane report. 
More than two years after the Egyptian uprising, the country's new Islamist government has struggled to confront a drop in tourism and the faltering economy. But the leadership has remained silent about another crucial indicator that has surged to a 20-year high: the country's birthrate. Kareem Fahim reports from Cairo.
The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low on Thursday. But its president, Mario Draghi, indicated that his promise last year to do "whatever it takes" to save the euro had limits. Jack Ewing reports.
 In an unexpected turn in the investigation into the collapse of the Rana Plaza building, the Bangladeshi police on Thursday arrested the engineer who warned a day before the disaster that the building was unsafe. Jim Yardley and Julfikar Ali Manik report from Savar, Bangladesh.
An elderly British television and radio personality has admitted to 14 counts of sexually abusing girls ages 9 to 17 that were committed decades ago, it emerged on Thursday. The broadcaster, Stuart Hall, 83, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, but the news media had been prohibited from reporting the plea until now. Sarah Lyall reports from London.
With Benedict's return to Vatican City, the pope emeritus inaugurates a living arrangement as unusual as it may be unpredictable: a former pope and a current pope both living within the Vatican walls. Elisabetta Povoledo reports.
 ARTS The sculpture of a boy holding a squirming frog was commissioned to sit at the tip of the Punta della Dogana, between the Grand and the Guidecca canals in Venice. The work, by the California artist Charles Ray, is a much-loved landmark, photographed daily by scores of tourists, and was to have celebrated its fourth anniversary there next month. But the city, which controls the spot, plans to remove it on Tuesday and replace it with a reproduction of the 19th-century lamppost that formerly stood there. Carol Vogel reports.
It's not uncommon for China to ask for editing changes in movies to fit its ideological framework, but in the case of "Iron Man 3," the movie actually added four minutes of product placements. Joyce Lau writes from Hong Kong.
 SPORTS In a city full of soccer clubs, including 6 of the 20 in the Premier League, the team you support can say a lot about you.This Saturday alone, six London teams - four from the Premier League and two from the Championship - will play home games, meaning that in a single afternoon as many as 150,000 fans will attend matches taking place in stadiums that are all less than 10 miles from Westminster Abbey. Sam Borden writes from London.

HEADLINE: The Chinese Dream

BYLINE: CLARISSA SEBAG-MONTEFIORE


HIGHLIGHT: President Xi Jinping is promoting the &#8220;Chinese Dream.&#8221; But what is it? 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Deng Xiaoping had "reform and opening up" and Hu Jintao had "harmonious society." Now Xi Jinping has the "Chinese Dream."
China's new president coined the slogan last November, within weeks of taking power, at an exhibition called "The Road Toward Renewal" at Beijing's National Museum of China about the century of humiliations China suffered at the hands of the West and Japan. In repurposing the better-known concept of the American Dream, Xi was stamping his mark on China's aspirations to become a superpower.
Since then the notion has gained traction. In a single week recently, People's Daily, the party mouthpiece, mentioned the Chinese Dream on its the front page no fewer than 24 times. And there has been a fierce debate online. 
What, exactly, is this dream?
According to Xi, it is about "realizing a prosperous and strong country, the rejuvenation of the nation and the well-being of the people." According to the state-run news agency Xinhua, it means that all workers should "combine their personal dreams ... with the national dream and fulfill their obligations to the country."
For much of the past three decades, the personal dreams of the workers were largely material. Chinese people hoped to buy a bicycle or a television, move from the countryside to the city and provide their only child with a good education.
Today the millions who belong to the urban middle class hope for more than just basic economic goods. They think about the environment and having a political say and cultivating their spirituality. Buddhism is in vogue; Christianity is growing fast - so fast that, by some accounts, there are now more Christians in China than members of the Communist Party.
But never mind all that. If Xi's Chinese Dream is a deliberately vague notion, designed to mean anything anyone wants, the limits of its ambiguity must nonetheless be determined from the top down.
Some of my Chinese friends call it an ineffectual magic wand (wield it but nothing happens), and on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter - over which the state holds less control than it would like - many mock it as Communist Party propaganda nonsense. But even a concept that is largely empty is worthy of censorship.
The Communist Party won't tolerate interpretations of the Chinese Dream that cut against its agenda. Last month the nationalist Global Times published an article entitled "Debunking 10 Misconceptions of the Ideal of the Chinese Dream." The piece said that the Chinese Dream was not about China trying to increase its soft power, that it was not about abandoning the communist ideal and that it was not a fantasy about constitutionalism, human rights or democracy.
The American Dream celebrates individualism: work hard and you will reap the rewards. But the Chinese Dream seems to celebrate the collective state: work hard and China will reap the benefits. 
Beware those who disagree with that interpretation. In January the envelope-pushing Chinese newspaper Southern Weekend planned to publish an article entitled "The Chinese Dream: A Dream of Constitutionalism" that advocated a separation of powers. Censors cut the parts referring to constitutionalism and changed the title to "The Chinese Dream Is Nearer to Us Than Ever Before." The Communist Party already controls much of the reality in China; now it wants to control its people's dreams.
The people can tell. And in discussions about state meddling, Internet users have started to adapt their vocabulary to Xi's. According to the China Media Project, the word "harmonized," a sarcastic euphemism for censorship, is being supplanted. For example: If this post were published in China, it would very likely be "dreamed away."

HEADLINE: Lessons on Fiscal Policy Since the Recession

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: Both job creation and deficit reduction are imperiled by current American fiscal policy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
In late 2008, the United States economy was caught in the midst of what proved to be its longest and deepest recession since the end of World War II. Frightened by steep and self-reinforcing declines in output and employment, both the Federal Reserve and the federal government responded quickly and boldly. The Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds rate to near zero, where it remains today, and began its controversial "quantitative easing" purchases of long-term government securities to contain long-term interest rates.
Fueled by the 2009 federal stimulus package, discretionary fiscal policy was also expansionary in 2009-10, adding to growth during the first year of the recovery at roughly the same pace that fiscal policy had achieved during previous recoveries.
Then, in a sharp break with history, fiscal policy became a drag on growth in the second year of recovery, and since then the drag has intensified. What explains the premature and counterproductive turn toward fiscal austerity despite the high unemployment rate and the large gap between actual and potential output? 
Before the Great Recession, there was a near consensus among economists that monetary policy alone could stabilize aggregate demand and keep the economy on its potential growth path. Under normal economic conditions, countercyclical fiscal policy was thought to be unnecessary. It was also thought to be both ill timed, because of lags in Congressional decision-making, and wasteful, because choices among fiscal measures were driven by politics and rent-seeking rather than cost-benefit considerations.
Most economists also believed that changes in discretionary fiscal policy would have small effects on aggregate demand and output - that the multipliers for such changes were small - and this belief was supported by empirical research based on "normal economic conditions."

But the conditions confronting fiscal policy in late 2008 were anything but normal. Output, employment and stock values were falling at a faster pace than before the Great Depression, and short-term interest rates had fallen to their zero lower bound. At least in the short term, conventional monetary policy alone could not stabilize the economy, so over dire warnings from some macroeconomists, in early 2009 Congress answered President Obama's request for a large temporary stimulus package to end in 2011, by which time it was hoped or expected that a strong recovery would be under way.
Subsequent empirical analysis indicates that the stimulus worked. New researchconfirms that the multipliers for fiscal policy are significantly larger during downturns when there is considerable excess capacity and when interest rates are at or near their lower bound. They are also larger when private actors are credit-constrained, so their spending depends more on current income than on future expected income. These were the conditions in 2010-11. Even using a range of lower multiplier estimates consistent with more normal conditions, the Congressional Budget Office found that the effects of the stimulus on output and employment were in the predicted range.
But the depth of the recession and the sluggishness of the recovery had been underestimated. Foreclosures and excess housing inventory constrained residential investment, and high unemployment, falling wages and deleveraging constrained household consumption. In 2011, as the stimulus came to an end, private spending was recovering but at an anemic and fitful pace.
And two years of short-term interest rates near zero and quantitative easing had exposed the limits of conventional monetary policy and raised anxieties about the risks of unconventional monetary policy.
There was a strong case for additional fiscal stimulus in 2011, and that is what President Obama proposed. But this time Congress rebuffed most of his recommendations, and since then fiscal policy has shifted to even more contraction in the form of strict caps on discretionary federal spending, increases in taxes and the sequester. According to the International Monetary Fund, fiscal policy will reduce gross domestic product in the United States by 1.8 percent this year.
Since 2011, proponents of fiscal austerity have repeatedly raised concerns that the large increases in the government deficit caused by both the recession itself and discretionary fiscal stimulus would lead to a spike in long-term interest rates. Bill Gross, the bond-market savant and influential chief executive of Pimco, warned that a spike would occur by the late summer of 2011. The downgrading of United States government debt in August 2011 after the Congressional showdown over the debt limit amplified these concerns.
But long-term interest rates did not spike; instead, they fell to historic lows in 2012 and are currently less than 2 percent, despite further increases in government debt. The experience of the last four years demonstrates that there is no simple predictable relationship between the government deficit and long-term interest rates. The relationship depends on economic conditions. Under current conditions, as long as the recovery remains weak, with considerable slack between actual and potential output, subdued inflationary expectations and highly accommodative monetary policy, long-term interest rates are likely to remain low.
As Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, noted in a recent speech, the behavior of long-term interest rates during the last several years has few precedents, but it is not puzzling: it follows from the weakness of the recovery and the implications for monetary policy.
In an effort to avoid the kind of surprise that rocked the bond market in 1994 when the Federal Reserve suddenly and significantly increased short-term rates, driving long-term interest rates sharply higher and imposing sizable losses on bond holders, the Federal Reserve has been transparent about its strategy: as long as current and expected inflation remains near 2 percent, the Fed will keep short-term interest rates where they are until the unemployment rate falls to around 6.5 percent.
When not fixated on bond-market anxieties, proponents of fiscal austerity have focused on variants of the "crowding out" argument that a high and rising government debt crowds out private investment and reduces economic growth. But this argument does not apply under current conditions, when there is significant excess capacity and when the private sector is running a financial surplus, with saving to spare to cover the government's borrowing requirements.
But what about evidence of a possible negative relationship between the ratio of public debt to G.D.P. and economic growth - evidence that burst into fiscal debates in 2010 with the publication of the paper by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff purporting to show that over the long term, growth declines sharply when public debt tops 90 percent or more of G.D.P.?
As the authors themselves acknowledge, the relationship between public debt and growth is one of correlation, not causality. Over time, slow growth is as much a cause of high public debt as high public debt is a cause of slow growth.
In our recent paper for the International Monetary Fund, Brad DeLong and I (with assistance from Owen Zidar) find a negative relationship between public debt burden and growth, but the effects are modest: raising the public debt-to-G.D.P. ratio from 50 percent to 150 percent for five years is associated with a growth reduction on the order of 0.6 percentage points per year over the next five years, and controlling for country and decade effects reduces the negative effect on growth by more than half.
Like others, we also find that there is no threshold debt ratio beyond which growth drops precipitously. Despite the warnings of fiscal austerians, Mr. Bernanke is right: "Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability."
In recent months, the lessons learned about fiscal policy over the last several years have begun to shift the policy debate. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the I.M.F. raised alarms about excessive and counterproductive fiscal austerity in the United States, Britain and Germany.
A growing number of European political and business leaders are warning that harsh fiscal contraction is consigning Europe to prolonged stagnation or worse. Even Mr. Gross is now asserting that bond markets do not want severe belt-tightening and that austerity is not the way to promote growth.
Unfortunately, Congress is not listening. As William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, observed in a recent speech, the United States has the opposite of the fiscal policy we need: too much fiscal contraction in a still-vulnerable economy now, without a credible plan to reduce the federal budget deficit in the long run.

HIGHLIGHT: The American economy continues to add jobs in proportion to population growth. Nothing less, nothing more. 

 BODY:
The American economy continues to add jobs in proportion to population growth. Nothing less, nothing more.
The share of American adults with jobs has barely changed since 2010, hovering between 58.2 percent and 58.7 percent. This employment-to-population ratio stood at 58.6 percent in April. That is about four percentage points lower than the employment rate before the recession, a difference of roughly 10 million jobs. In other words, the United States economy is not getting any closer to recreating the jobs lost during the recession. 
This lack of progress has been obscured by the steady decline of the high-profile unemployment rate, which continued in April. But the unemployment rate is easily misunderstood. The government counts as unemployed only those who are actively looking for new jobs. As people have given up, the unemployment rate has declined - not because more people are working, but because more people have stopped looking for work.
The share of adults looking for work peaked at 6.4 percent of the population in 2010. It fell to 4.7 percent in April. But recall that over the same period, the share of adults with jobs did not change. What grew instead is the share of adults no longer counted as part of the labor force. 
(The unemployment rate also uses a different denominator than the employment rate: Workers plus searchers, rather than the entire population. For the sake of consistency and clarity, the figures in the previous paragraph show "unemployment" as a share of the entire population.)
And the decline of labor force participation - the technical term for the share of adults working or searching - is primarily the result of a bad economy.
Baby boomers are aging into retirement. Even before the recession, the government projected in 2007 that participation would decline to 65.5 percent by 2016, from 66 percent. But the April rate of 63.3 percent means the labor force has lost roughly five million additional workers.
Furthermore, the projections were wrong. Participation has actually risen among people older than 55. The decline is entirely driven by younger dropouts.
The federal government counts 11.7 million Americans as unemployed. The real number, it follows, is more like 17 million.
There is always some unemployment. Millions of Americans are out of work at any given moment even in the best of times. But the economy is still roughly 10 million jobs short of returning to normal levels of unemployment and labor force participation. That's a lot of missing jobs.
Some of those losses may be permanent. The number of Americans receiving disability benefits has increased by 1.8 million since the recession began, and people on disability rarely return to the work force, even if they would have preferred to keep working in the first place.
And as the economy improves, it is likely that labor force participation among older workers will finally begin to decline.
But the evidence suggests that the majority of the 10 million are just waiting for a decent chance.

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Agreement: Blame Washington

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Partisans on both sides focused on the negative in the better-than-expected jobs report, with the left blaming sequestration and the right citing regulation. 

 BODY:
 10:45 a.m. | Updated 
Though the April jobs report was better than expected, partisans on both sides in Washington were determined to see the negative - and to blame Washington. 
Remarkably, initial reactions on Twitter from the major political parties were different in degree, but not substance. 
Today's job numbers are extremely encouraging, but there's still more work to do. 
- The Democrats (@TheDemocrats)3 May 13
Today's #jobs report brings good news for those who found jobs, but 7.5% unemployment is not nearly good enough.
- RNC (@GOP)3 May 13
The White House's reaction was more positive than those of both its enemies and its allies. 
"While more work remains to be done," said Alan B. Krueger, chairman of the president's Council on Economic Advisers, "today's employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression." 
Mr. Krueger, in a statement, added, "Now is not the time for Washington to impose self-inflicted wounds on the economy," and urged Congress to replace a series of automatic budget cuts, known as sequestration, with "balanced deficit reduction."
Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority whip, named a different set of culprits for an economy that "continues to struggle." 
In a statement, he said, "Our tax code is broken, onerous regulations make it more difficult to achieve all-American energy independence and small businesses and families across the country are filled with confusion and anxiety over the implementation of ObamaCare."
However, other leading Republicans acknowledged "some signs of hope," as Representative Eric Cantor, the No. 2 in the House, put it, and "some good news," in the words of House Speaker John A. Boehner. But Mr. Boehner also said that "repealing the president's sequester" would be crucial to growing the economy.
Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, also agrees that across-the-board cuts are problematic, but he had a different take on the source of the problem: "Our job growth would be even stronger if our economy were not hampered by the meat-ax austerity Republicans have insisted upon for the past two years, instead of working with Democrats to forge a balanced approach to deficit reduction."
Indeed, many had thought April's might be the first monthly report to reflect the sequestration and the resulting furloughs for federal workers, and Adam Hersh, an economist at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group, stuck to that downbeat message:
At this pace, we will not reach full employment until June 2021. The labor market seems to be moving ahead slowly but not steadily, while automatic spending cuts mandated by the sequester have barely only begun to bite on jobs and economic growth. If we continue down the path of spending cuts and fiscal contraction demanded by sequestration, next month it will be much more than furloughed FAA workers and snarled air travelers feeling the pinch of unnecessary austerity.
Economists on the right also saw bad signs for the economy in the long term. Daniel Alpert, a managing partner at Westwood Capital known for more conservative commentary, posted on Twitter:
#BLS In sum, the April report describes a part time employment economy, with new jobs part time and in service sector. Wages/hours declining
- Dan Alpert (@DanielAlpert)3 May 13
Jim Pethokoukis of the conservative American Enterprise Institute noted Mr. Obama's overall failure to meet employment goals. 
Just two more jobs report to go until we are back at full employment - at least according to Obama 2009 stimulus forecast
- James Pethokoukis (@JimPethokoukis)3 May 13

HEADLINE: Comparing Jobs in Recessions and Recoveries

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: For the 31st consecutive month, the country added jobs: 165,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in January, to be more precise. But employment still has a long way to go before returning to its prerecession level. 

 BODY:
For the 31st consecutive month, the country added jobs: 165,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in April, to be more precise.
But employment still has a long way to go before returning to its prerecession level. 
The chart above shows economic job changes in this last recession and recovery compared with other recent ones; the red line represents the current cycle. Since the downturn began in December 2007, the economy has had a net decline of about 1.9 percent in its nonfarm payroll jobs. And that does not account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy there should be more jobs today than there were before the recession. 
Let's assume we eventually return to prerecession employment levels while absorbing all the new people who enter the labor force each month. To get there within seven years, we need job creation averaging 208,000 jobs per month, which was the average monthly rate for the best year of job growth in the 2000s, according to the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. 
There are now 11.7 million workers looking for work who cannot find it. The tally of those who are underemployed - that is, adding in those workers who are part-time but want to be employed full time, and workers who want to work but are not looking - brings the total up to 21.9 million.
As bad as all these figures are, it's worth remembering that job markets in the decade after a financial crisis are always terrible. In fact, layoffs were far worse and lasted much longer in the aftermath of the financial crises that struck, for example, Finland and Sweden in 1991 and Spain in 1977, not to mention the United States during the Great Depression.

HEADLINE: Neither a Swoon Nor a Surge

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Even with the strength of the April employment report, activity in the job market still does not seem to be accelerating. 

 BODY:
 The April jobs report came as welcome news, largely because it showed that job growth had been stronger in February and March than initial estimates showed. The evidence for a so-called spring swoon no longer looks very good. 
But it would be a mistake to overstate the strength of the report. Activity in the job market still does not seem to be accelerating. 
Binyamin Appelbaum points out in another post that the share of Americans with jobs has remained largely unchanged. Those numbers are based on the survey of households that the Labor Department conducts each month. A second Labor Department survey - of businesses, which is larger and covers more jobs - carries the same message.
 For the last year and a half, average 12-month employment growth has hovered around 1.6 percent, precisely where it was in the 12 months ending in April. That's faster than most of the last 12 years, which included two recessions and a mediocre recovery. But it's far cry from the growth rates of between 2 percent and 3 percent, and briefly above 3 percent, in the mid- to late 1990s.

HEADLINE: The Missing Construction Workers

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: The number of housing starts has surged &#8211; nearly doubling in the last two years &#8211; but employment in residential construction has barely budged. 

 BODY:
While the number of housing starts has surged - nearly doubling in the last two years - employment in residential construction has barely budged. And construction employment tracked down ever so slightly to 5.79 million workers in April, according to the preliminary data. 
What gives? Where are the missing construction workers?
Those are questions that economists have been puzzling over for the last year or so, as the housing market has started to normalize, with low inventory and new demand causing prices to rise in markets across the country and builders eagerly breaking ground on new developments from Florida to California.
Over time that should lead to rising employment in the sector, especially given pent-up demand for projects. But not yet. Construction employment is starting to turn up, but from a very low level: There are about as many construction workers now as there were in 1997. And construction employment in the residential sector remains essentially flat, gaining about 2.5 percent in the last year. 
There seem to be a few components to the answer. The first is that housing starts tend to tell us where the market for construction workers is going, not where it is right now. So even as starts have surged as builders have begun new projects, the overall number of units under construction remains relatively low - meaning relatively few available jobs. (See Trulia's chief economist, Jed Kolko, on this point.)
Second, it seems that builders in some markets may be having trouble recruiting skilled workers, as my colleague Catherine Rampell recently reported. That has not yet led to much of a surge in compensation in the sector, as you might expect. But perhaps the businesses are paying workers under the table, or making do with fewer of them, in part by increasing their hours.
Moreover, builders will eventually need to hire employees to work on new projects. (As far as I know, there have not been any great productivity advances in home building in the past few years, and nobody's outsourcing the work to robots.) That would be a good thing for an economy still desperately in need of jobs, despite the better numbers.

HEADLINE: The Big Problem Is Long-Term Unemployment

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Short-term unemployment is back down to pre-Great Recession levels. But long-term joblessness remains high. 

 BODY:
Short-term unemployment in the United States has fallen below where it was in late 2007, before the Great Recession began. 
And medium-term unemployment is not much above the pre-downturn level.
But long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high, although the current figure, 4.1 percent, at least has dipped below what had been (before the Great Recession) the post World War II high of 4.2 percent reached in early 1983. More than half of the unemployed workers have been out of work for at least 15 weeks.
There are still 4.4 million workers who have been unemployed for at least six months. That is down from the peak of 6.7 million, but it is still very high. And that number does not include people who have given up looking for work.
Fed policy is not well suited to deal with this problem. But it does not look as if fiscal policy, which would have a chance, will be used anytime soon.

HEADLINE: The Old vs. the Young

BYLINE: EDUARDO PORTER


HIGHLIGHT: The Great Recession has been a disaster for the employment prospects of the young, but the story is quite different at the other end of the life cycle. 

 BODY:
The Great Recession has been a disaster for the employment prospects of the young. Almost one in four teenagers looking for a job still can't find one. 
Americans 16 to 24 years old suffered the sharpest drop in employment between 2008 and 2010, and jobs for young workers have barely ticked up since then. 
Today, only 45 percent of young Americans in that age group have a job, almost 6 percentage points less than when the recession started in December 2007. 
The story is quite different at the other end of the life cycle. Eighteen percent of Americans of retirement age hold a job, some 2 percentage points more than when the recession started. The employment rate of these elderly workers is at its highest since May 1965 - before the enactment of Medicare. They are filling the largest share of jobs since 1956. 
So what's going on? Older Americans may have a more pressing need for a job. The homes of many are probably still underwater. Though the stock market has recovered the ground lost during the downturn, interest rates remain near all-time lows - crimping the elderly's income from savings.
And we should expect the employment rate of the elderly to continue rising. The structure of Social Security benefits is one of the most important determinants of employment among the elderly. And Social Security is getting stingier over time. 
The age of full retirement rose by two months for many workers entering retirement at the beginning of the recession. It has remained constant since then, but is expected to start rising again for workers born in 1955 and after, who will reach full retirement age in a few years. 
Over the long term, this might be a good thing for the economy, raising the nation's sustainable growth rate - the growth manageable without inflation - above the 2.25 percent forecast by the Congressional Budget Office. But in the next few years, young workers would probably prefer older workers to retire.

HEADLINE: Sessions Says Immigration Bill Is a Threat to U.S. Workers

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a determined opponent of immigration overhaul, said on Friday that the legislation is &#8220;dangerous&#8221; for American workers, and he vowed to work to slow the bill&#8217;s progress. 

 BODY:
 Senator Jeff Sessions, the Republican from Alabama who may be the most determined and energetic opponent of an immigration overhaul bill now before the Senate, said on Friday that the legislation is "dangerous" for American workers, and he vowed to offer amendments in coming weeks to "confront the fundamentals of the bill" and slow its progress. 
On a conference call with reporters, Mr. Sessions made it clear that he hopes to reprise the leading role he played in 2007, when he helped rally popular resistance that defeated a similarly sweeping immigration bill by President George W. Bush. 
 The senator warned that the bill would bring "explosive growth" in immigration, providing work authorization and legal status to more than 30 million immigrants over the next 10 years. Mr. Sessions said it would also "drastically increase low-skill chain migration."
 He pointed to a fast-track, five-year path to citizenship in the legislation for more than 2 million young immigrants brought here without authorization as children, who call themselves Dreamers. Mr. Sessions said that after they gained permanent legal status, those immigrants would be able to bring any of their family members, adding as many as 2 million more immigrants in future years. He also warned about the future impact of new guest worker programs for farm laborers and other low-wage migrants. 
 "This large flow of workers will impact working Americans significantly," Mr. Sessions said, adding that the immigrants would lower salaries and compete for jobs. "These numbers give a real warning to the American people of what is about to occur." 
 The bill introduced last month by a bipartisan group of eight senators provides a 13-year path to citizenship for most immigrants here illegally, tightens border security, clears backlogs in the immigration system, creates new guest worker programs and expands visas for high-skilled immigrants. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has said the process of adding amendments would begin next week. 
 "There are so many problems with this bill, it is hard to know where to start," Mr. Sessions said. He said he planned amendments to increase local and federal immigration enforcement, curb future immigration and tighten visa background checks. 
 The senator, who was in Alabama for the Congressional recess, acknowledged that supporters of the bill appeared to have the initiative so far. But as its details emerge, he said, "I do feel there is a change in this momentum." 
 A demographer on the conference call, Steven A. Camarota from the Center for Immigration Studies, a study group in Washington that advocates lower immigration, estimated the American economy would have to create 35 million new jobs over the next 10 years to absorb new Americans in the labor force and new immigrants under the bill. 
 "The coming decade would have to be the biggest job bonanza in American history," Mr. Camarota said. 
 The senators sponsoring the bill have predicted far lower numbers of new immigrants. They note that most parents and many other family members of young Dreamers, for example, are already in the United States, most of them illegally but some with legal papers.

HEADLINE: Star Power at a Global Women's Conference

BYLINE: LUISITA LOPEZ TORREGROSA


HIGHLIGHT: The Global Women&#8217;s Fund has given $100 million in grants. The biggest challenges facing women, its leaders say: sexual violence, economic inequality and reproductive and sexual rights. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - As the season peaked for international women's conferences, with corporate sponsors, rich donors and celebrity supporters filling well-appointed halls, the Global Fund for Women celebrated its 25th anniversary at a gala dinner at Cipriani 42nd Street restaurant in New York. 
After a calendar crammed with global women's conferences in the United States and Europe, it could have been tricky to pack Cipriani, but the Global Fund affair sold out (a seat went for $500, a table for five $5,000 and up). 
No wonder the high-profile lineup was topped by Hillary Rodham Clinton, a longtime ally of the Global Fund and this spring's most sought-after speaker. 
The fund, a multimillion-dollar nonprofit based in San Francisco, has given millions away in grants to women.
"It's the largest fund for women around the world," Musimbi Kanyoro, the fund's president and chief executive, said on the phone from New York. "We have given $100 million in grants to 5,000 women's organizations in 174 countries. That large amount of money is rarely targeted for women."
Ms. Kanyoro, who was born in Kenya and is the daughter of a midwife, has a doctorate in linguistics from the University of Texas, Austin, and a degree in ministry and feminist theology from San Francisco Theological Seminary. She was a student when she joined the movement against apartheid, which led to her fight for women and girls.
"Our goal is the dignity of women, and that is achieved through human rights,'' she said. "But we also believe that women need financial resources. We are especially effective reaching women who have no other donors, women in developing countries who are fighting for religious rights and fundamental sex and property rights."
Shortly before the gala, I spoke with the activist and teacher Charlotte Bunch, founder of the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University in New Jersey, in whose name the fund started the Women's Human Rights Defender Award.
Ms. Bunch, who has been on the front line of the fight against violence against women, said that sexual violence continues to be the biggest problem.
"Violence is horrific everywhere," she said.
The next big challenge, she said, is economic inequality between high-earning women and poor women who are left behind in large part because of unfair policies. And the third big problem is the continuing struggle for reproductive and sexual rights.
Few know those issues as closely as Monica Roa, a recipient of a Women's Human Rights Defender Award for her fight for judicial reform in her native Colombia. The founder of Women's Link Worldwide, the 37-year-old lawyer broke ground when she figured out a way to navigate the legal system to help women and bring about social change.
"I saw in the law a tool for the liberation of women," she told me.
Her uphill battles in the courts in Bogotá nearly killed her. Shots were fired and shards of glass fell on her head when she and colleagues were attacked for their efforts in an abortion case. That was seven years ago. She has since lived with death threats and bodyguards.
But she continues to press the courts, digging up unenforced laws and bringing them to judicial light. Now her work is followed in places like Peru and the Dominican Republic.
Women's issues in South America and the Caribbean are a bit off the beaten path of international women's groups, which tend to focus on the situations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and in the Middle East and Africa, places where women and girls are fighting for their most basic rights. Horrors like the rapes of young girls and other abuses and brutality in patriarchal fundamentalist countries overshadow the relatively more progressive situation in Latin America.
Yet, there's plenty of sexual violence and slavery, human trafficking and other crimes against women and girls in Latin America, and reproductive rights are negligible. Abortion is illegal in most countries.
"People think that the struggle is over," Ms. Roa said. "There's a gap between what we have achieved on paper and the reality. Sexism is much more subtle. We need to develop strategies that work. In Latin America, there is a clear offensive against the rights of women."
Fighting that war on women worldwide is what Mrs. Clinton calls "the great unfinished business of the 21st century: advancing the rights and the opportunities of girls and women." It is the engine driving the multiplying star-studded women's conclaves from Davos to London to São Paulo to New York. For these donor-supported and corporate-sponsored global organizations, there's no turning back.

HEADLINE: Scrutiny Falls on a Pioneer at JPMorgan

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Blythe Masters, who helped pioneer the use of credit derivatives, is cited in a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission document looking at the bank&#8217;s trading in the California and Michigan electricity markets. 

 BODY:
It started with a summer internship in London in 1987, when Blythe Masters first encountered derivatives. In the years since, she rose through the ranks at JPMorgan Chase to become one of the most powerful executives on Wall Street.
But today, Ms. Masters, 44, faces a possible regulatory crackdown. The enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the nation's energy markets, has found that Ms. Masters gave "false and misleading statements" under oath about her awareness of problematic activities by a group of energy traders in Houston, The New York Times reported on Friday.
If the regulator proceeds with an action based on the findings, it could fine JPMorgan and Ms. Masters, the article said. A spokesman for the bank, Kristin Lemkau, said: "We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter." 
Ms. Masters, the head of JPMorgan's commodities business, is known as a pioneer in the use of credit derivatives, financial products that played a starring role in the 2008 financial crisis. Her success at JPMorgan stemmed from her vision in the 1990s that these products could transform the banking industry.
Growing up in Kent, England, Ms. Masters was fond of horseback riding and "displayed a stubborn, driven streak," according to "Fool's Gold," a 2009 book by Gillian Tett of The Financial Times. She went on to study economics at Cambridge University.
Rather than take vacation, Ms. Masters spent her summers working in JPMorgan's London office, according to the book. She joined the commodities desk after graduating in 1991, and eventually moved to New York.
Some colleagues expected Ms. Masters to leave the bank when she became pregnant at 23, the book says. But that wasn't her personality. When she went to the hospital to have her baby, Ms. Masters brought along a device to track market prices.
She became a managing director at 28, then the youngest woman in the bank's history to reach that rank.
Derivatives seemed "creative" and also appealed to Ms. Masters because of her quantitative background, she once said. By separating certain risks from an underlying asset, derivatives seemed to offer a way for a bank to make more loans than it otherwise would be able to.
These products were being developed at rival firms. At JPMorgan, Ms. Masters was determined to apply them on a large scale.
She made a breakthrough when Exxon, a longtime client, asked for a credit line, according to "Fool's Gold." To offload the risk without actually selling the loan, Ms. Masters arranged a deal with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, in which the bank would get fees in exchange for assuming the risk of default.
The deal was known as a credit default swap.
Soon, the team at JPMorgan began talking to regulators about the new product. In 1996, the Federal Reserve essentially gave its blessing with a statement suggesting that banks could use credit derivatives to reduce their capital reserves.
But the grand promise of derivatives came undone in the financial crisis. The contracts ended up making embattled institutions even more vulnerable to mounting losses.
Warren E. Buffett called derivatives "financial weapons of mass destruction." And that made Ms. Masters a "destroyer of worlds," a September 2008 article in The Guardian declared.
"Unfortunately, tools that transfer risk can also increase systemic risk if major counterparties fail to manage their own risk exposures properly," Ms. Masters said in a speech that year before the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
But she added, "It is important to distinguish between tools and their users. It is also important to distinguish between disfunctionality in a product per se and disfunctionality in the underlying to which it is applied."
Since the crisis, Ms. Masters worked on reviving JPMorgan's commodities business, a division she was credited with building. "I will not give up on you and your vision," James E. Staley, a longtime JPMorgan executive, wrote to Ms. Masters in 2010, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal. (Mr. Staley left the bank this year.)
Ms. Masters has had various senior roles at JPMorgan, serving as the chief financial officer of the investment bank from 2004 to 2007. She became head of commodities after that, and last year was given additional regulatory responsibilities.
In an interview with PBS in 2009, Ms. Masters looked back on her pioneering work.
"It was amazing feeling to be able to be involved in invention - but not just invention, the creating of a marketplace that had real value to add," she said. "The irony is that credit became too loose."

HEADLINE: A New Fed Thought for 'Too Big to Fail' Banks: Shrink Them

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Daniel K. Tarullo, a governor at the Federal Reserve, described a measure aimed at requiring the biggest banks to hold extra capital. Many might prefer to become smaller banks instead. 

 BODY:
A nagging sense seems to pervade the public's mind that the nation's biggest banks still pose a risk to the wider economy, despite all that has been done since the 2008 financial crisis. 
It seems that disquiet persists even at the heart of the regulatory establishment. The latest call to action came on Friday from Daniel K. Tarullo, a governor at the Federal Reserve, an agency that plays a crucial role in shaping new banking rules.
 In a speech before the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, he described a tough, new measure that could be squarely aimed at large Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. 
Mr. Tarullo may have chosen an opportune time to make his case. 
His speech comes amid increasing calls to do more to deal with the so-called too-big-to-fail issue. This holds that some financial institutions are so big that, if they were to collapse, they would damage the rest of the financial system, and weigh on the economy. 
Mr. Tarullo said much had been done to make the financial system safer, through the two main overhauls that came after the crisis. Those are the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010, and the internationally agreed bank regulations known as Basel III. In particular, these initiatives have made banks hold more capital, a part of a bank's balance sheet that can serve as a buffer against losses. Before the crash of 2008, banks had insufficient capital, which stoked the fears that swept the global financial system. Taxpayers had to step in and provide new capital as part of efforts to restore confidence. 
Still, Mr. Tarullo sees remaining areas of concern. He focused on the markets where Wall Street banks borrow huge sums of money for short periods. They use their borrowings in these so-called wholesale markets to then buy assets. But in times of stress, like 2008, these markets can dry up. Deprived of their lifeblood, banks rush to sell off the assets they bought with their wholesale borrowings, which can set off a wider collapse. 
 "Relatively little has been done to change the structure of wholesale funding markets so as to make them less susceptible to damaging runs," he said in the speech.
To make the system safer, Mr. Tarullo floated an idea that could affect banks that make heavy use of wholesale markets. His idea is to require such banks to hold extra capital. How much extra would depend on how flush a bank's balance sheet is. Such a program is more aimed at the major Wall Street institutions, while leaving regional lenders and even large consumer-oriented banks like Wells Fargo largely unscathed.
Under the current rules, large banks have to hold a pool of assets they can theoretically sell quickly to cover any outflows that occur in a turbulent period in the markets. Under Mr. Tarullo's idea, the larger this pool, the less extra capital they would have to hold to cover the risk present in wholesale markets.
 In reality, however, banks would probably do less wholesale borrowing to avoid the tougher capital requirements. In turn, that might prompt them to shrink their overall size, and therefore, not be so big as to require a government bailout if they failed. 
"We would do the American public a fundamental disservice were we to declare victory without tackling the structural weaknesses of short-term wholesale funding markets, both in general and as they affect the 'too big to fail' problem," Mr. Tarullo said.
The speech, which called for other changes to toughen regulation, follows a recently introduced bill that took aim at large banks. 
The legislation, from Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, would subject the biggest banks to much higher capital requirements than smaller banks. If the bill is passed, many large banks would probably choose to divest themselves of assets to shrink to a size where they would not be required to hold higher amounts of capital.
The bill has already generated fierce objections from the financial industry. Its critics said the capital increases would force banks to cut back on their lending, and they argued that large banks provide unique benefits to the economy.
Political analysts have said that the Brown-Vitter bill has little chance of passing, but the measure has reignited a conversation about what to do about banks whose failure could weaken the broader financial system.
Regulators like the Federal Reserve, however, do not have to wait for Congress to pass legislation to introduce new measures. The Dodd-Frank Act gave regulators substantial freedom to impose measures to strengthen the system on their own.
Mr. Tarullo mentioned that leeway in this speech on Friday. The Fed could use that authority to push forward on the measure to raise capital requirements for firms that make big use of wholesale debt markets. And it could impose another notable measure mentioned by Mr. Tarullo.
It involves something called the leverage ratio. This measures capital as a percentage of assets. It differs from other regulatory capital ratios in that it doesn't adjust the assets for their perceived riskiness. Some analysts say they believe the "risk-based" approach is flawed and can lead a bank to hold too little capital. 
They say the leverage ratio is a safer measure of capital because it doesn't treat some assets as less risky than others. Mr. Tarullo said the Fed might set a higher leverage ratio. 
Despite this call, some analysts said that Mr. Tarullo did not appear to be advocating for the much higher capital levels envisioned in the Brown-Vitter bill. The legislation requires banks with over $500 billion to have capital that is equivalent to 15 percent of their assets.
"He's definitely not calling for a 15 percent leverage ratio like Brown-Vitter," said Patrick Sims, a director at Hamilton Place Strategies, a policy firm that has aired objections to some of the contents in the senators' bill.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Directors Feel Heat in a Vote

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: As the bank grapples with regulatory battles, some shareholders are taking public aim at individual directors who hold crucial positions on the bank&#8217;s audit and risk committees. 

 BODY:
As JPMorgan Chase's annual meeting nears, much of the tension surrounds a critical vote to split the chairman and chief executive roles - a decision that could strip Jamie Dimon, the bank's influential leader, of the dual titles he has held since 2006. Behind the scenes, though, another battle is brewing.
Some JPMorgan shareholders are taking public aim at individual directors who hold crucial positions on the bank's audit and risk committees as the bank grapples with an onslaught of regulatory challenges. 
 On Friday, the CtW Investment Group, which represents union pension funds and owns six million shares in JPMorgan, said it planned to vote against the three directors on the risk policy committee and the head of the audit committee. While it is not known how other shareholders are voting on directors, big stakeholders like BlackRock, T. Rowe Price and TIAA-CREF have increasingly taken aim at boards, voting against directors they think are performing poorly.
JPMorgan, once the darling of Washington after emerging from the financial crisis in far better shape than its rivals, suffered a multibillion-dollar trading loss last year. Since then it has increasingly found itself under regulatory scrutiny for potential risk and compliance lapses.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the bank's chief regulators, is deciding whether to bring new enforcement actions, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. One action the agency is considering, these people said, focuses on whether JPMorgan used faulty documents in lawsuits to collect overdue credit card debt.
In one of the latest regulatory crackdowns, investigators from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sent a scathing message to the bank in March that warned of a potential action over accusations of manipulation in the energy markets. The confidential government document, reviewed by The New York Times, also took aim at a top executive, Blythe Masters, contending she gave "false and misleading statements" under oath.
"We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees in this matter," said Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the bank, which is the nation's largest. "We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter."
While Mr. Dimon apologized in a recent letter to shareholders for disappointing "our regulators," vowing to bolster controls and "do all the work necessary to complete needed improvements," some shareholders are not satisfied and are now considering how to cast their votes. Some shareholders are reluctant to vote to split the role of chairman and chief executive, saying the right way to send a message is to vote against certain directors, a move they think will result in positive change at the board level.
JPMorgan's annual meeting is scheduled for May 21 in Tampa, Fla., and the results of shareholders' votes on all the proposals will be announced then. Directors and senior executives at the bank have been contacting major shareholders in recent weeks, hoping to ease any concerns they might have. They hope to persuade investors not only to back the board but also to vote against a proposal calling for the separation of the chairman and chief executive role. Last year, 40 percent of shareholders supported the proposal.
Shareholders like CtW are singling out members of the risk committee because they think the board failed to police the bank in important areas, contributing to the trading loss in 2012.
"What we have learned over the past year is that the performance of the risk committee is even worse than we thought," said Richard Clayton, CtW's research director. "Their behavior is a combination of being out at sea and asleep at the wheel. Both are bad and together they are disastrous."
James S. Crown, who has been a director of JPMorgan or one of its predecessor companies since 1991, is chairman of the risk policy committee. The other members are David M. Cote, the head of Honeywell International; Timothy P. Flynn, a former KPMG executive; and Ellen V. Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural History. Mr. Flynn was appointed to the risk policy committee in August 2012.
CtW also plans to vote against Laban P. Jackson, chairman of the audit committee, which shares responsibility for oversight.
CtW voted against all four directors last year but went public only about its displeasure with Ms. Futter, contending she lacked banking experience. Last year, 86 percent of shareholders voted for Ms. Futter, the lowest amount of support for any director. A person close to JPMorgan who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss board matters publicly, said that while Ms. Futter was not a career banker, she was well steeped in issues like reputational risk, bringing value to the committee.
Failing to receive a majority of shareholder votes does not necessitate a resignation, but such a vote might prompt a director to leave.
In 2011, before the big trading loss, CtW met with senior bank executives, warning that risk controls needed to be improved. It felt its concerns fell on deaf ears.
At a recent meeting with bank management, including the chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, and the general counsel, Stephen M. Cutler, the company owned up to its recent risk lapses, CtW said, but it has failed to devise any significant changes to improve the risk committee's operations.
"We realize there was a management failure," said Dieter Waizenegger, CtW's executive director. "But it is as if the board didn't do anything wrong and that is puzzling."
Ms. Lemkau, the bank spokeswoman, said, "We disagree with CtW on the points they have raised but continue to engage with them."
CtW's six million shares are worth about $285 million. In contrast, the company's biggest shareholders own more than 100 million JPMorgan shares each.
Since the trading loss last year, JPMorgan and its board have worked to fortify controls. JPMorgan's board reduced Mr. Dimon's pay this year by more than 50 percent, to $11.5 million, and issued a public report on the trading misstep. With the approval of the board, JPMorgan also clawed back more than $100 million in pay from the employees at the center of the soured wagers.
Last year, the board met 15 times, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the bank's proxy filing, the 11-member board said that Mr. Dimon should continue to hold the dual top posts.
"The board has determined that the most effective leadership model for the firm currently is that Mr. Dimon serves as both," the filing said.

HEADLINE: Where Have All the Jobs Gone?

BYLINE: By JARED BERNSTEIN. 
Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, was economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
THOUGH yesterday's employment report revealed a slowly improving job market, the jobless rate is still elevated, at 7.5 percent, with 11.7 million people looking for work, including 4.4 million who have been doing so for at least half a year. About eight million more were stuck in underemployment (''involuntary'' part-timers) last month, unable to find the hours of work they sought.
These measures persist amid an economic expansion continuing since mid-2009, a roaring stock market and a housing market that's now reliably in recovery. 
While the high jobless numbers are partly a legacy of the Great Recession, the fact is that our economy has generated too few jobs for most of the last 30 years and is likely to continue to do so. The only viable response is a return to an idea that once animated domestic policy making: full employment, the notion that everyone who wants to work should be able to find a job, and if the market isn't up to the task, then the government must fill the gap.
For decades in postwar America, the maintenance of full employment, defined as an unemployment rate below 5 percent, was enshrined in law, beginning with the Employment Act of 1946 and revisited in 1978 in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. It was a central goal of the Democratic Party, labor unions and advocates of social and racial justice.
And it usually worked. While conservatives and businesses pushed back -- tight labor markets meant more worker bargaining power, higher wages and less profitability -- between 1949 and 1979 the market was at full employment over two-thirds of the time. Since then, it has been at that level just a third of the time.
How did this happen? Both the politics and economics are implicated.
Politically, as union power declined, the concerns of Democratic policy makers shifted from working-class issues like jobs and toward the concerns of upper-income constituents, like inflation, taxes and budget balancing.
Economically, a number of trends have created persistent, upward pressure on the jobless rate. Since 2000 -- the last time the market was at full employment -- productivity is up about 30 percent, while employment has been flat. And that's not just because of the recession; the same pattern prevailed during the 2000s expansion.
One explanation may be that capital investment has become, to put it politely, more ''labor saving.'' Yes, this process has been going on forever, but robotics and other ways of automating tasks may be accelerating it.
Second, our large and persistent trade deficits have exported too much demand. There's nothing wrong, and a lot right, with increased global trade. The problem comes when it stays out of balance for so long, as it has in America, with trade deficits averaging 5 percent of G.D.P. in the 2000s, compared with 1 percent in the 1990s. That's millions of net jobs lost.
Third, a growing number of economists believe that our very high levels of inequality are not just whacking the incomes of the ''have-nots'' but are slowing job growth as well. Part of this works through the demand channel: with so much spending power in the hands of so few, consumer demand is becoming bifurcated. Walmart will do well on one end, Neiman Marcus on the other, with too little in between. Another part works through misallocation: too much economic activity devoted to ''innovative'' finance and too little to sectors more germane to middle-class jobs and incomes.
What would it take to reverse these trends? For one thing, in the near term, do no harm. Austerity, including sequestration, is the economic version of medieval leeching. The Federal Reserve continues to apply high doses of monetary stimulus, and that's supporting low interest rates, which in turn are linked to the improving housing market. But it can't do it alone, and Congress is counteracting such tailwinds with fiscal headwinds.
We also need a significant, permanent program to absorb excess labor (an explicit part of the Humphrey-Hawkins law). We should consider restarting and rescaling a subsidized jobs program from the 2009 Recovery Act that, though relatively small, made jobs possible for hundreds of thousands of workers.
And we have to reassess our manufacturing policy, including reducing the trade deficit. That means both reshaping our dollar policy -- going after competitors who suppress their currencies' value to get an edge on net exports -- and public investments in areas where clean energy intersects with production.
Finally, financial deregulation has become the enemy of full employment: it funnels capital to unproductive parts of the economy, and plays a key role in the ''shampoo cycle'' of bubble, bust, repeat. Less volatile capital markets mean fewer shocks to the job market.
If that is too interventionist, there's another approach. Like many European countries, we could ask less of our people in terms of work, and hold them harmless by broadly redistributing our productivity gains. But I don't see that in our future. What I do see is a growing disconnection between growth and jobs. Setting a path to full employment is the best way to alter that dark vision.

HEADLINE: A New Fed Thought for 'Too Big to Fail' Banks: Shrink Them

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
A nagging sense seems to pervade the public's mind that the nation's biggest banks still pose a risk to the wider economy, despite all that has been done since the 2008 financial crisis.
It seems that disquiet persists even at the heart of the regulatory establishment. The latest call to action came on Friday from Daniel K. Tarullo, a governor at the Federal Reserve, an agency that plays a crucial role in shaping new banking rules.
In a speech before the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, he described a tough, new measure that could be squarely aimed at large Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. 
Mr. Tarullo may have chosen an opportune time to make his case.
His speech comes amid increasing calls to do more to deal with the so-called too-big-to-fail issue. This holds that some financial institutions are so big that, if they were to collapse, they would damage the rest of the financial system, and weigh on the economy.
Mr. Tarullo said much had been done to make the financial system safer, through the two main overhauls that came after the crisis. Those are the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010, and the internationally agreed bank regulations known as Basel III. In particular, these initiatives have made banks hold more capital, a part of a bank's balance sheet that can serve as a buffer against losses. Before the crash of 2008, banks had insufficient capital, which stoked the fears that swept the global financial system. Taxpayers had to step in and provide new capital as part of efforts to restore confidence.
Still, Mr. Tarullo sees remaining areas of concern. He focused on the markets where Wall Street banks borrow huge sums of money for short periods. They use their borrowings in these so-called wholesale markets to then buy assets. But in times of stress, like 2008, these markets can dry up. Deprived of their lifeblood, banks rush to sell off the assets they bought with their wholesale borrowings, which can set off a wider collapse.
''Relatively little has been done to change the structure of wholesale funding markets so as to make them less susceptible to damaging runs,'' he said in the speech.
To make the system safer, Mr. Tarullo floated an idea that could affect banks that make heavy use of wholesale markets. His idea is to require such banks to hold extra capital. How much extra would depend on how flush a bank's balance sheet is. Such a program is more aimed at the major Wall Street institutions, while leaving regional lenders and even large consumer-oriented banks like Wells Fargo largely unscathed.
Under the current rules, large banks have to hold a pool of assets they can theoretically sell quickly to cover any outflows that occur in a turbulent period in the markets. Under Mr. Tarullo's idea, the larger this pool, the less extra capital they would have to hold to cover the risk present in wholesale markets.
In reality, however, banks would probably do less wholesale borrowing to avoid the tougher capital requirements. In turn, that might prompt them to shrink their overall size, and therefore, not be so big as to require a government bailout if they failed.
''We would do the American public a fundamental disservice were we to declare victory without tackling the structural weaknesses of short-term wholesale funding markets, both in general and as they affect the 'too big to fail' problem,'' Mr. Tarullo said.
The speech, which called for other changes to toughen regulation, follows a recently introduced bill that took aim at large banks.
The legislation, from Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, would subject the biggest banks to much higher capital requirements than smaller banks. If the bill is passed, many large banks would probably choose to divest themselves of assets to shrink to a size where they would not be required to hold higher amounts of capital.
The bill has already generated fierce objections from the financial industry. Its critics said the capital increases would force banks to cut back on their lending, and they argued that large banks provide unique benefits to the economy.
Political analysts have said that the Brown-Vitter bill has little chance of passing, but the measure has reignited a conversation about what to do about banks whose failure could weaken the broader financial system.
Regulators like the Federal Reserve, however, do not have to wait for Congress to pass legislation to introduce new measures. The Dodd-Frank Act gave regulators substantial freedom to impose measures to strengthen the system on their own.
Mr. Tarullo mentioned that leeway in this speech on Friday. The Fed could use that authority to push forward on the measure to raise capital requirements for firms that make big use of wholesale debt markets. And it could impose another notable measure mentioned by Mr. Tarullo.
It involves something called the leverage ratio. This measures capital as a percentage of assets. It differs from other regulatory capital ratios in that it doesn't adjust the assets for their perceived riskiness. Some analysts say they believe the ''risk-based'' approach is flawed and can lead a bank to hold too little capital.
They say the leverage ratio is a safer measure of capital because it doesn't treat some assets as less risky than others. Mr. Tarullo said the Fed might set a higher leverage ratio.
Despite this call, some analysts said that Mr. Tarullo did not appear to be advocating for the much higher capital levels envisioned in the Brown-Vitter bill. The legislation requires banks with over $500 billion to have capital that is equivalent to 15 percent of their assets.
''He's definitely not calling for a 15 percent leverage ratio like Brown-Vitter,'' said Patrick Sims, a director at Hamilton Place Strategies, a policy firm that has aired objections to some of the contents in the senators' bill.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Dear College Graduates...

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
I'm scheduled to deliver the commencement address Friday at my alma mater, Grambling State University in Louisiana, so I've been giving quite a bit of thought to the America into which these students are graduating.
I must admit that finding hopeful, encouraging things to say has been exceedingly difficult, in part because the landscape at the moment -- particularly for young adults -- is so bleak.
Here are some of the facts that I'm up against rhetorically and that these students will be up against more literally. 
1. Being a college graduate is becoming less exceptional. As the Pew Research Center pointed out in November, ''Record shares of young adults are completing high school, going to college and finishing college.'' College graduation rates are growing even more in other countries. And Anya Kamenetz noted in The Atlantic magazine in December, ''During the past three decades, the United States has slipped from first among nations to 10th in the percentage of people holding a college degree, even as the job market has eroded for Americans without one.''
2. Graduates are emerging with staggering amounts of debt and entering a still-sluggish job market. This is causing them to delay major life decisions, like marriage or buying a home or even moving out of their parents' home.
A Pew report from February 2012 found that:
''Since 2010, the share of young adults ages 18 to 24 currently employed (54 percent) has been its lowest since the government began collecting these data in 1948. And the gap in employment between the young and all working-age adults -- roughly 15 percentage points -- is the widest in recorded history. In addition, young adults employed full time have experienced a greater drop in weekly earnings (down 6 percent) than any other age group over the past four years.''
3. Emerging markets, like China and India, have become major competitors for exportable jobs.
4. Income inequality between top earners and the rest of America has risen. And the recovery since the Great Recession has essentially been a recovery of the rich. A recent study by Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, found that:
''From 2009 to 2011, average real income per family grew modestly by 1.7 percent but the gains were very uneven. Top 1 percent incomes grew by 11.2 percent while bottom 99 percent incomes shrunk by 0.4 percent. Hence, the top 1 percent captured 121 percent of the income gains in the first two years of the recovery.''
This was similar to a finding by the Pew Research Center last month:
''During the first two years of the nation's economic recovery, the mean net worth of households in the upper 7 percent of the wealth distribution rose by an estimated 28 percent, while the mean net worth of households in the lower 93 percent dropped by 4 percent.''
5. At the same time, the cost of basic goods has soared. For example, when I graduated from college the average price of a gallon of gas was about $1 (adjusted for inflation, that would still be less than $2), and it's currently nearing $4. Some people now have to make desperate choices: a tank of gas, a bag of groceries or a bottle of medicine.
6. Our politics have become polarized to the point of paralysis. A Pew poll last June found that Americans' ''values and basic beliefs are more polarized along partisan lines than at any point in the past 25 years.''
What gives me hope is that despite this dire environment, young people remain more optimistic than anyone else. Some of that may simply be the intrinsic glow of youth, but I believe that with this generation, something more is afoot.
This is a generation of people who have come of age in an era of overlapping traumas -- terrorism and wars and recession. They have also come of age in changing times, and are more tolerant and less punitive in their social view. They see this country, and the world, differently than we older folks do. Theirs is an America waiting to be made better, not one that is simply, and irreversibly, getting worse.
According to a CNN/ORC poll released last month, young adults (those 18 to 34) were the most likely to think that things were going well in this country.
I plan to tap into that optimism on Friday, and I hope to reflect some of it back at those beaming faces under square hats.
Dear college graduates, this is your moment and your America. Both need your vision and demand your efforts. Keep your head up and your hopes rising. Congratulations and good luck. You'll need it, and I'll be rooting for you. (Flip tassels.)

HEADLINE: The Geography Of a Deduction

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
An analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts finds that the use of the mortgage interest deduction varies widely across the country, with concentrations on the East Coast and in the West, and in areas with higher property values. The average size of the deduction varies, too. 
Less populated areas use it less, the report found, so any change in the deduction is likely to be felt differently in various geographic areas. The analysis uses Internal Revenue Service state-level data from 2010 and ZIP code data from 2007 on the number of tax returns, the number of mortgage interest deduction claims, the amount of interest deducted and federal income taxes paid.
As the federal government looks for ways to reduce the deficit, the mortgage interest deduction -- along with other tax deductions and exemptions -- is coming under scrutiny.
Tax filers who own a home and itemize deductions are allowed to subtract interest paid on a mortgage from their income. In 2011, filers deducted about $360 billion in interest, resulting in about $72 billion in lost federal tax revenue, the report says.
Fewer than half of all homeowners, and about a quarter of tax filers, claim the mortgage interest deduction, the report said. The benefit of the deduction increases with the size of the mortgage: the bigger the mortgage, the greater the tax benefit. (Currently, the amount of mortgage debt eligible for the interest rate deduction is capped at $1 million.)
The percentage of filers using the deduction varies widely by state. In Maryland, for instance, the percentage was about 37 percent, while in North Dakota and West Virginia, it's about 15 percent.
The average deduction among all filers nationally (including those who don't take the deduction) was $2,713 in 2010. But the average amounts ranged from a high of $4,580 in Maryland to a low of $1,192 in North Dakota. (The average is calculated over all tax filers, so the amounts can be compared geographically.)
Pew's Web site features an interactive map that lets you see the average deduction in your state and ZIP code.
The report didn't make any recommendations, but said the data shows that changes to federal tax policy could have varying results in the states.
Do you claim the home mortgage interest deduction? How important is it to you?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Business Investment Rebounds Even as Recovery Drags

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE economic recovery from the recession that officially ended in 2009 has been extremely disappointing for American consumers. But for business, it has been the best recovery in decades.
The government's estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product last week indicated the overall economy was only 8.3 percent higher than it was in the second quarter of 2009, the quarter the recession ended. That is significantly weaker than the recoveries that followed the recessions that ended in 1982, 1991 or 2001. 
After this much time, the economy had grown at least 11.4 percent (after the 2001 downturn) and as much as 21.3 percent (following the 1982 low).
That subpar performance can be traced to two of the three pillars of the American economy -- consumers and the government. But the third, business, has made an impressive bounceback.
The accompanying charts cut the economy into three sectors, and show how each of them performed in comparable periods after the previous recessions, as well as this one. All start at the level during the quarter that the National Bureau of Economic Research determined the downturn ended. Together, the three exclude only two contributors to G.D.P. growth -- changes in the trade balance and in business inventories.
The business segment consists of private fixed investment in everything from buildings to computers, but excludes residential construction. That is included in the consumer category, which also includes personal consumption expenditures. The government category includes spending by all three levels of government, federal, state and local.
Business investment in the first quarter of this year was 21 percent higher than it had been in the quarter when the economy bottomed.
That was not quite as large an increase as followed the 1991 bottom, but it is more rapid than the increases that occurred during the recoveries that began in 1982 and 2001.
Corporations as a group are doing well. Corporate profits, as a percent of G.D.P., rose to record post-World War II levels in 2012, and the effective income tax rate on those profits remains lower than it was in any of the past recoveries, according to government estimates.
The government has not yet estimated first-quarter corporate profits.
After past recessions, there has often been an immediate explosion in consumer spending as pent-up demand comes to the fore, and as the housing industry rebounds rapidly. That did not happen this time, in large part because of the nature of the boom in the 2000s, which included excessive investment in houses and consumers taking on debt to support their consumption. The resulting hangover has depressed the recovery in consumer spending to just 8.6 percent after 15 quarters, well below the pace of any of the previous three rebounds.
That is starting to change, however. The pace of growth in nonresidential investment is slowing, but residential investment is starting to take off. And personal consumption expenditures climbed at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in more than two years.
Whether those gains can continue, as the payroll tax increase and the federal government sequester increase their impact, remains to be seen.
The government sector has been shrinking almost continually since the end of the recession. The decline in state and local government seems to have begun to slow down, but the decline in federal spending appears to be picking up and is likely to continue to be a drag on the American economy.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: For Business, a Strong Recovery: The recovery since the recession that ended in 2009 has been the weakest in decades, as measured by the change in gross domestic product. That is mainly because of a shrinking government sector and relatively slow growth in consumer spending. But business investment has risen at an impressive rate. Corporate profits are higher than in three previous recoveries, and taxes on those profits are lower. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, via Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: JPMorgan's Directors Feel Heat In a Vote

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
As JPMorgan Chase's annual meeting nears, much of the tension surrounds a critical vote to split the chairman and chief executive roles -- a decision that could strip Jamie Dimon, the bank's influential leader, of the dual titles he has held since 2006. Behind the scenes, though, another battle is brewing.
Some JPMorgan shareholders are taking public aim at individual directors who hold crucial positions on the bank's audit and risk committees as the bank grapples with an onslaught of regulatory challenges. 
On Friday, the CtW Investment Group, which represents union pension funds and owns six million shares in JPMorgan, said it planned to vote against the three directors on the risk policy committee and the head of the audit committee. While it is not known how other shareholders are voting on directors, big stakeholders like BlackRock, T. Rowe Price and TIAA-CREF have increasingly taken aim at boards, voting against directors they think are performing poorly.
JPMorgan, once the darling of Washington after emerging from the financial crisis in far better shape than its rivals, suffered a multibillion-dollar trading loss last year. Since then it has increasingly found itself under regulatory scrutiny for potential risk and compliance lapses.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the bank's chief regulators, is deciding whether to bring new enforcement actions, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. One action the agency is considering, these people said, focuses on whether JPMorgan used faulty documents in lawsuits to collect overdue credit card debt.
In one of the latest regulatory crackdowns, investigators from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sent a scathing message to the bank in March that warned of a potential action over accusations of manipulation in the energy markets. The confidential government document, reviewed by The New York Times, also took aim at a top executive, Blythe Masters, contending she gave ''false and misleading statements'' under oath.
''We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees in this matter,'' said Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the bank, which is the nation's largest. ''We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter.''
While Mr. Dimon apologized in a recent letter to shareholders for disappointing ''our regulators,'' vowing to bolster controls and ''do all the work necessary to complete needed improvements,'' some shareholders are not satisfied and are now considering how to cast their votes. Some shareholders are reluctant to vote to split the role of chairman and chief executive, saying the right way to send a message is to vote against certain directors, a move they think will result in positive change at the board level.
JPMorgan's annual meeting is scheduled for May 21 in Tampa, Fla., and the results of shareholders' votes on all the proposals will be announced then. Directors and senior executives at the bank have been contacting major shareholders in recent weeks, hoping to ease any concerns they might have. They hope to persuade investors not only to back the board but also to vote against a proposal calling for the separation of the chairman and chief executive role. Last year, 40 percent of shareholders supported the proposal.
Shareholders like CtW are singling out members of the risk committee because they think the board failed to police the bank in important areas, contributing to the trading loss in 2012.
''What we have learned over the past year is that the performance of the risk committee is even worse than we thought,'' said Richard Clayton, CtW's research director. ''Their behavior is a combination of being out at sea and asleep at the wheel. Both are bad and together they are disastrous.''
James S. Crown, who has been a director of JPMorgan or one of its predecessor companies since 1991, is chairman of the risk policy committee. The other members are David M. Cote, the head of Honeywell International; Timothy P. Flynn, a former KPMG executive; and Ellen V. Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural History. Mr. Flynn was appointed to the risk policy committee in August 2012.
CtW also plans to vote against Laban P. Jackson, chairman of the audit committee, which shares responsibility for oversight.
CtW voted against all four directors last year but went public only about its displeasure with Ms. Futter, contending she lacked banking experience. Last year, 86 percent of shareholders voted for Ms. Futter, the lowest amount of support for any director. A person close to JPMorgan who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss board matters publicly, said that while Ms. Futter was not a career banker, she was well steeped in issues like reputational risk, bringing value to the committee.
Failing to receive a majority of shareholder votes does not necessitate a resignation, but such a vote might prompt a director to leave.
In 2011, before the big trading loss, CtW met with senior bank executives, warning that risk controls needed to be improved. It felt its concerns fell on deaf ears.
At a recent meeting with bank management, including the chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, and the general counsel, Stephen M. Cutler, the company owned up to its recent risk lapses, CtW said, but it has failed to devise any significant changes to improve the risk committee's operations.
''We realize there was a management failure,'' said Dieter Waizenegger, CtW's executive director. ''But it is as if the board didn't do anything wrong and that is puzzling.''
Ms. Lemkau, the bank spokeswoman, said, ''We disagree with CtW on the points they have raised but continue to engage with them.''
CtW's six million shares are worth about $285 million. In contrast, the company's biggest shareholders own more than 100 million JPMorgan shares each.
Since the trading loss last year, JPMorgan and its board have worked to fortify controls. JPMorgan's board reduced Mr. Dimon's pay this year by more than 50 percent, to $11.5 million, and issued a public report on the trading misstep. With the approval of the board, JPMorgan also clawed back more than $100 million in pay from the employees at the center of the soured wagers.
Last year, the board met 15 times, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the bank's proxy filing, the 11-member board said that Mr. Dimon should continue to hold the dual top posts.
''The board has determined that the most effective leadership model for the firm currently is that Mr. Dimon serves as both,'' the filing said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: To Race's Owner, Track Is No Longer at Center of the Business Universe

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Last year, Churchill Downs Inc., the company that runs the most famous track in horse racing, moved its corporate headquarters from beneath the track's iconic twin spires to the top floor of a glass office building 15 miles away. Robert L. Evans, the company's chairman and chief executive, has frequently assured investors that while hosting the Kentucky Derby may be the company's most celebrated endeavor, it is hardly the most important.
Churchill Downs, one of the marquee names in horse racing, is no longer primarily a horse racing company. 
As fewer gamblers turn out for horse races and the business of horse racing continues its long decline, Churchill Downs has transformed itself into a full-blown gambling company with interests in casinos and Internet sites. While financial analysts have applauded the shift -- its stock has risen 51 percent in the past five years -- the horse racing world feels abandoned by Churchill Downs.
''They have the two prime races in the world in the Derby and Oaks; they speak with of those with obvious pride,'' said Michael Campbell, a trainer and president of the Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association, referring to Saturday's race and the Kentucky Oaks, the fillies' race held the day before. ''They have a lesser commitment to their other properties. They don't push horse racing anymore. They want casinos and technology, but they would not have access to either without horse racing.''
In 2005, Churchill owned seven racetracks that between them hosted more than 650 days of live racing every year. Now it has four tracks and half as many days of live racing.
Company officials say the pivot from horse racing was out of necessity. The Kentucky Derby brings hundreds of thousands of people to Louisville every year, generating the bulk of the $65 million in revenue that the company generated in the second quarter of 2012. But Churchill's live and simulcast horse racing segment regularly loses money.
''They are a more diversified company because they have had to be,'' said Jeffrey S. Thomison, an analyst with Hilliard Lyons here. ''The gaming sector has attractive economics. Horse racing does not.''
From the company's perspective, the strategy has worked well. In 2006, the last full year Churchill was a pure racing company, its revenue was $376 million. Last year, its revenue was more than $732 million.
The company's bottom-line approach to its racetrack holdings and its hard-line negotiating positions have alienated horsemen throughout the industry. On Wednesday, the group representing Florida's horsemen failed to reach an agreement on a new contract with Calder Race Course in Florida, a Churchill property. Purses there were cut 20 percent, and the horsemen refused to let races be simulcast and bet on at out-of-state sites.
Last year, horsemen boycotted the entry box at Arlington Park near Chicago as only 49 horses raced on Kentucky Oaks Day, and only 48 on Derby Day. A repeat of last year's disastrous opening was averted when Arlington Park and the Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association signed a two-year contract last week after tense negotiations.
Just as the company has shifted its focus from horse racing, the racetracks themselves have also moved beyond the horse races. Calder and the Fair Grounds in New Orleans now have slot machines, which steadily draw crowds, and Arlington Park is expected to get them if Illinois passes an expanded gambling bill.
The company has continued to lobby Kentucky legislators to introduce gaming to the mecca of horse racing, Churchill Downs. The track has been renovated and expanded in the past decade and has plenty of space to accommodate slot machines or a full-blown casino. At the same time, it has reduced the live racing it conducts as foal crops have declined and horsemen have left for racetracks in states where casino revenue has plumped purses.
Churchill has focused much of its attention in recent years on properties outside horse racing, like a casino resort in Greenville, Miss., and a casino hotel in Vicksburg, Miss. It is building a video lottery terminal and harness racing track in southwest Ohio. It owns a multimedia poker company, and it recently launched Luckity.com, which turns live racing into lottery-style games.
Evans, Churchill's chief executive, discussed the shift during an earnings call last March.
''To millions of people worldwide, Churchill Downs means the Kentucky Derby, the Kentucky Oaks, and Churchill Downs means thoroughbred racing,'' Evans said during the call. ''And while that's what our brands mean, it no longer is our business model.''
Churchill Downs officials declined to comment for this article. A company spokeswoman declined to make Evans available when The New York Times would not agree to let the company review quotations before publication.
With the number of days of live races falling across Kentucky and purses dwindling at Turfway in Florence, Ky., and Ellis Park in Henderson, Ky., the state's leading horse racing figures say Kentucky no longer feels like the heart of thoroughbred racing. Many blame Churchill Downs.
''We've lost any semblance of a circuit,'' said Marty Maline, the executive director of the Kentucky horsemen's association. ''They want to cut days to have full fields, but when you cut so much, we have to go find other options.''
Even before the recent shift away from horses, Churchill Downs has long clashed with members of the racing world. It has fought with the Jockeys Guild over everything from its contributions to the disabled riders fund to the absence of a kitchen for jockeys at Calder.
The company has irritated some of the sport's most prominent owners and breeders by tightly controlling ticket prices on Kentucky Derby weekend, which range from $40 in the infield to more than $1,300 per seat on Millionaires Row. Corporate suites on the finish line can run up to $200,000, and seats in third-floor boxes can top $75,0000. This year, the press box was converted into an area called the Mansion, which seats 296 people and features a library, a butler and a private chef. Tickets cost $7,000 to $12,500.
Despite the grumbling from the horse tracks and stables, analysts say the company would not have survived if it had remained reliant on horses.
''They were overly dependent on a contracting business,'' said Thomison, of Hilliard Lyons. ''They have done a great job of turning a different direction.''

HEADLINE: College Graduates Fare Well in Jobs Market, Even Through Recession

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Is college worth it? Given the growing price tag and the frequent anecdotes about jobless graduates stuck in their parents' basements, many have started to question the value of a college degree. But the evidence suggests college graduates have suffered through the recession and lackluster recovery with remarkable resilience.
The unemployment rate for college graduates in April was a mere 3.9 percent, compared with 7.5 percent for the work force as a whole, according to a Labor Department report released Friday. Even when the jobless rate for college graduates was at its very worst in this business cycle, in November 2010, it was still just 5.1 percent. That is close to the jobless rate the rest of the work force experiences when the economy is good. 
Among all segments of workers sorted by educational attainment, college graduates are the only group that has more people employed today than when the recession started.
The number of college-educated workers with jobs has risen by 9.1 percent since the beginning of the recession. Those with a high school diploma and no further education are practically a mirror image, with employment down 9 percent on net. For workers without even a high school diploma, employment levels have fallen 14.1 percent.
But just because college graduates have jobs does not mean they all have ''good'' jobs.
There is ample evidence that employers are hiring college-educated workers for jobs that do not actually require college-level skills -- positions like receptionists, file clerks, waitresses, car rental agents and so on.
''High-skilled people can take the jobs of middle-skilled people, and middle-skilled people can take jobs of low-skilled people,'' said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. ''And low-skilled people are out of luck.''
In some cases, employers are specifically requiring four-year degrees for jobs that previously did not need them, since companies realize that in a relatively poor job market college graduates will be willing to take whatever they can find.
That has left those who have spent some time in college but have not received a bachelor's degree to scramble for what is left. Employment for them fell during the recession and is now back to exactly where it began. There were 34,992,000 workers with some college employed in December 2007, and there are 34,992,000 today.
In other words, workers with four-year degrees have gobbled up all of the net job gains. In fact, there are more employed college graduates today than employed high school graduates and high school dropouts put together.
It is worth noting, too, that even young college graduates are finding jobs, based on the most recent data on this subgroup. In 2011, the unemployment rate for people in their 20s with at least a bachelor's degree was 5.7 percent. For those with only a high school diploma or a G.E.D., it was nearly three times as high, at 16.2 percent.
Americans have gotten the message that college pays off in the job market. College degrees are much more common today than they were in the past. In April, about 32 percent of the civilian, noninstitutional population over 25 -- that is, the group of people who are not inmates of penal and mental facilities or residents of homes for the disabled or aged and who are not on active military duty -- had a college degree.
Twenty years ago, the share was 22 percent. Given the changing norms for what degree of educational training is expected of working Americans, employers might assume those who do not have a four-year degree are less ambitious or less capable, regardless of their actual ability.
These forces might help explain why there is so much growth in employment among college graduates despite the fact that the bulk of the jobs created in the last few years have been low-wage and low-skilled, according to a report last August from the National Employment Law Project, a liberal research and advocacy group. Today nearly one in 13 jobs is in food services, for example, a record share.
Clearly, positions in retail and food services are not the best use of the hard-earned skills of college-educated workers, who have gone to great expense to obtain their sheepskins. Student loan borrowers graduate with an average debt of $27,000, a total that is likely to grow in the future.
But nearly all of those graduates are at least finding work and income of some kind, unlike a much larger share of their less educated peers. And as the economy improves, college graduates will be better situated to find promotions to jobs that do use their more advanced skills and that pay better wages, economists say.
The median weekly earnings of college-educated, full-time workers -- like those for their counterparts with less education -- have dipped in recent years. In 2012, the weekly median was $1,141, compared with $1,163 in 2007, after adjusting for inflation. The premium they earn for having that college degree is still high, though.
In 2012, the typical full-time worker with a bachelor's degree earned 79 percent more than a similar full-time worker with no more than a high school diploma. For comparison, 20 years earlier the premium was 73 percent, and 30 years earlier it was 48 percent.
And since a higher percentage of college graduates than high school graduates are employed in full-time work, these figures actually understate the increase in the total earnings premium from college completion, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an independent research organization.
So, despite the painful upfront cost, the return on investment on a college degree remains high. An analysis from the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution in Washington estimated that the benefits of a four-year college degree were equivalent to an investment that returns 15.2 percent a year, even after factoring in the earnings students forgo while in school.
''This is more than double the average return to stock market investments since 1950,'' the report said, ''and more than five times the returns to corporate bonds, gold, long-term government bonds, or homeownership.''

HEADLINE: An Ode To Helium

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
We have not been paying nearly enough attention to helium legislation.
Seriously. We've been complaining about the way Congress fails at everything except scheduling vacations. So it seems only fair to salute the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act. The way things are going, it could be the most significant piece of legislation to make it into law this year.
The issue is our helium stockpile, which is scheduled to go out of business. The House approved a bipartisan bill to save the program just before the members -- yes! -- left town for vacation. The Senate seems inclined to go along, unless, of course, Ted Cruz decides it's a United Nations plot. 
The House debate took two days, which some people felt was way more than enough time, given the fact that the final vote was 394 to 1. The lone ''nay'' came from Representative Linda Sanchez of California, who accidentally pressed the wrong button.
Democrats complained that the House could have taken care of helium in an hour, if the Republicans hadn't been afraid of discussing anything else. It's been a tough stretch for Republican leaders, who had set aside several days to debate a plan to improve the Obama health care act, before the rank-and-file rejected the idea on the grounds that it might improve the Obama health care act.
So, helium. ''I'm pleased to support this bill, which shows that this Tea Party Congress will make the tough choice to keep children's birthday parties on schedule and give industries that rely on helium the lift that they deserve,'' sniped Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia.
The second most popular theme for speeches, which Johnson ignored, was: look, helium is not a joke.
''Despite what many think, helium is not just used for party balloons,'' said Representative Doc Hastings of Washington, the Republican who brought the bill to the House floor.
Actually, if you'd heard the entire debate you would have been so impressed with helium that you would be wondering whether it should be wasted on balloons at all. It's used in M.R.I. machines, scientific research, fiber optics, aerospace technology. And it's not all that easy to come by, being the product of slow radioactive decay deep in the earth.
''It's liquid down to absolute zero. You can pour it on M.R.I. magnets. It'll cool those superconductive magnets down. There's nothing else like it,'' said Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey, a physicist who has very strong feelings about helium.
The United States began stockpiling helium after World War I because Congress was worried about catching up with the Germans in the race to build a fleet of dirigibles. Miraculously, despite the Pentagon's affection for continuing to build things that have no earthly use in modern warfare, the government eventually cut back on the blimp program. But it kept the stockpile going at a helium reserve near Amarillo, Tex.
In 1996, during the Newt Gingrich era, Congress voted to go out of the helium business and let private enterprise take over as soon as the reserve paid off the money the government had sunk into it.
Hasn't quite worked out. The debt is almost paid off, but the magic of the marketplace hasn't kicked in. If the reserve closes now, the country loses 40 percent of its helium supply. So, last week, the House voted to extend the program. ''Many people don't believe that the federal government should be in the helium business, and I would agree,'' said Hastings, as he pushed the bill to keep the government in the helium business.
There are two ways to look at this story. One is that it's about the impossibility of ever actually stopping any government program. Former Representative Barney Frank, who said in 1996 that if Congress could not manage to get rid of the helium reserve ''then we cannot undo anything,'' hasn't changed his mind. ''Everybody is against waste, but strongly defends this or that particular piece,'' Frank said in a phone interview.
He's right. I have fond memories of listening to protests after Congress managed, with great effort, to end a totally useless subsidy on mohair. Most of the howls came from lawmakers from Texas, land of many mohair goats. ''I have a mohair sweater! It's my favorite one!'' cried Republican Lamar Smith. The subsidy came creeping back a few years later.
But there's another possible moral. The helium program is great; it provided the country with a crucial product that business wasn't prepared to produce. It spurred economic growth and scientific research and made enough profit to pay the taxpayers back.
Maybe the only mistake was trying to pull the plug in the first place.
''The federal government going into helium in the 1920s I think was a fine thing,'' said Holt. He looks upon the current bill not as a temporary fix but as ''a validation'' of government's role in looking after things that the private sector is reluctant or afraid to take on.
The helium reserve, by the way, is still going to run dry in five or 10 years. Maybe private enterprise will step up to the plate. But if not, somebody's going to have to organize one hell of a balloon recycling program.

HEADLINE: Service Industry Expanded In April, but at Slower Pace

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A survey of United States service companies showed that the industry expanded at a slower pace in April than in March, as companies reported less business activity and could not raise their prices. 
The Institute for Supply Management said on Friday that its index of nonmanufacturing activity fell to 53.1 in April from 54.4 in March. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion. The report measures growth in industries that cover 90 percent of the work force, including retail, construction, health care and financial services.
The decline in the overall index suggested that some service companies may be starting to see less consumer demand, in part because of higher Social Security taxes.
April's weakness was largely caused by a steep drop in a measure of prices, to 51.2 from 55.9 in March. Nearly 70 percent of the companies surveyed said they did not change their prices last month, while 10 percent reduced them.
A measure of business activity also declined. Still, a gauge of new orders was mostly unchanged, and businesses stepped up restocking, typically a sign that they expect consumer spending to pick up.
Growth in the service industry depends largely on consumers, whose spending drives roughly 70 percent of economic activity. Americans increased their spending from January through March at the most rapid pace in more than two years, despite the increase in Social Security taxes that kicked in on Jan. 1.
And other trends may offset some of the impact of the taxes this year. Consumers have cut their debts. Rising home values and stock prices have increased household wealth And average gas prices nationwide have dropped 27 cents from their peak this year to $3.52 a gallon, according to AAA.
In manufacturing, orders fell 4 percent in March, the largest amount in seven months, but a crucial category that signals business investment plans increased. The drop in factory orders reflected a plunge in the volatile category of commercial aircraft, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. Orders were up 1.9 percent in February. But in core capital goods, a category considered a proxy for business investment plans, orders rose 0.9 percent after a 4.8 percent decline in February and a 6.7 percent surge in January.
Weaker economies overseas and the impact of across-the-board government spending cuts have made businesses more cautious, dampening demand for manufactured goods. But even with the March decline, total orders stood at $467.3 billion, 43 percent above the recession low in March 2009.

HEADLINE: Fayyad Steps Down, Not Out

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Ramallah, West Bank
THE streets of the Palestinian capital in the West Bank are quiet on a Saturday, but Salam Fayyad, who quit as prime minister three weeks ago, is still in his office, dapper as ever in suit and tie -- unable to carry on and yet, it seems, not permitted to go. His limbo is a reflection of Palestinian paralysis and disarray.
Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president with whom Fayyad feuded, knows that he needs his outgoing prime minister's rigorous competence. He needs Fayyad's standing with the United States and Europe, major sources of funding for the beleaguered Palestinian Authority. He needs Fayyad's grip on security.
Yet the Fatah old guard with their sweet deals wants Fayyad gone; Hamas hates him as a supposed American stooge, and Abbas has tired of this U.S.-educated ''turbulent priest.'' So the president hesitates. He mumbles about a ''unity government'' with Hamas. He does little. And Fayyad is at his desk when he might be eating sweet pastries with his family. 
''Our story is a story of failed leadership, from way early on,'' Fayyad tells me. ''It is incredible that the fate of the Palestinian people has been in the hands of leaders so entirely casual, so guided by spur-of-the-moment decisions, without seriousness. We don't strategize, we cut deals in a tactical way and we hold ourselves hostage to our own rhetoric.''
Fayyad first handed in his resignation on Feb. 23. Abbas demurred. President Obama, citing Fayyad's high reputation with the U.S. Congress and in the region, asked him to stay during a ''businesslike'' one-on-one meeting (their first) in March. Secretary of State John Kerry followed up with three or four phone calls. To no avail: Fayyad, after almost six years in the job, had had enough of the dance that leads nowhere, the ''peace process'' that is a mockery of those unhappily twinned words. On April 13 he resigned.
His was a revolution: Of acts over narrative, of state-building over slogans, of pragmatism over posturing. His core thought was simple: ''If you look like a state and act like a state nobody in the end is going to deny you that state.'' Such was the institutional transformation that the World Bank declared Palestine ready for statehood. As Fayyad says, ''We took the exam and passed.''
But the acting prime minister hit a wall. It had two elements: Palestinian division and Israeli intransigence. Which undercut him more? They were both devastating. Of course, they also fed on each other. American dithering did not help.
Fatah, the major political movement in the West Bank, is a revolutionary party that has exhausted itself; ossified and murky, lacking a popular mandate or a strategy to deliver statehood, headed by a 78-year-old man, Abbas, who did not have the courage to embrace the political program of an outsider, Fayyad, even though that program delivered growth, accountability and security.
Abbas, Moscow-educated, and Fayyad, Texas-educated, never overcame the cultural gulf those educations bequeathed. The can-do approach did not figure in the Soviet curriculum. Abbas declined to leverage Fayyad's achievements. He refused to use Fayyad's probity and work ethic as transformative examples. Theirs was a rocky marriage of convenience. Fayyad reckons the party spent more time worrying about what he was doing than solving anything.
''This party, Fatah, is going to break down, there is so much disenchantment,'' Fayyad predicts. ''Students have lost 35 days this year through strikes. We are broke. The status quo is not sustainable.'' He looks at me with a fierce conviction: ''In the end it did not matter what any foreign power told me about things changing for the better because I am living it. I have gone through hell before. But it's enough. This much poison is bound to cause something catastrophic. The system is not taking, the country is suffering. They are not going to change their ways and therefore I must go.''
Then there was the ''biggest problem'' -- the Israeli occupation, never relaxed despite a transformed security situation; in fact intensified through settlement expansion, demolitions, evictions and military incursions even into areas nominally under Palestinian control.
Fayyad, convinced of the need for two states living alongside each other in peace and security, had a double aspect for Israel, the interlocutor from heaven and hell. He was responsible and resolute in his opposition to violence. He was also the Palestinian who undid every convenient caricature of a people wedded to terrorism, corruption and chaos. So Israel never embraced him any more than Fatah. There was no Israeli quid pro quo for Palestinian progress.
''I told President Obama the shack must come before the skyscraper,'' Fayyad tells me. ''The Israelis have not rolled back the occupation gene. Let's make sure our Bedouin population in the Jordan Valley has access to drinking water before we discuss final arrangements. This is a right-to-life issue for Palestinians.''
He thinks the United States, now trying to conjure direct negotiations through osmosis rather than any new ideas, should ask Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a straightforward question: What do you mean by a Palestinian state?
From Netanyahu's few indications, such a state would not include the major Israeli settlement blocs, or have control over the strategic Jordan Valley (some 25 percent of the West Bank). All of greater Jerusalem would remain Israeli. Palestine would be demilitarized.
''A state of leftovers is not going to do it,'' Fayyad declares.
But is Netanyahu, a man of Likud who opposed the late Yitzhak Rabin's Oslo compromise, not convinced deep in himself of the need to hold on to all of Eretz Israel (a biblical term widely used to refer to the area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, encompassing all of the West Bank)? And are there not ministers in his new government, including Naftali Bennett, the economics minister, who enjoy dismissing the very idea of Palestine as a complete joke?
Well, Fayyad muses, perhaps the Israeli prime minister needs to say something like this to Israelis: ''Yes, it is true we have a contract with God Almighty who gave us the land, but there happen to be 4.4 million other people on this land who want to exercise their right to self-determination, so perhaps we can adjust the divine contract a little.''
That won't happen, of course. What will? Fayyad calls the new Obama administration initiative ''high-risk.'' Secretary of State John Kerry is trying to ease into Israeli-Palestinian negotiations buttressed by economic initiatives like tourism developments on the Dead Sea. But from a Palestinian standpoint, there seems to be little that would improve human conditions -- deliver water, stop settler violence, end demolitions -- and little to stop Netanyahu simply running the clock down again.
''Israel says no this, no that, and it's taken as a foregone conclusion,'' Fayyad says. ''There's nothing to underpin the U.S. initiative. So how can you invest in it?''
Despite his skepticism, Fayyad believes Palestinians do not have a moment to lose in the push for statehood. The essential missing ingredient is unity. There has to be one government in the West Bank (now controlled by Fatah) and Gaza (controlled by Hamas). ''Let's be clinical,'' he says. ''We are not going to have a state unless we are united first.''
The essential precondition for that, he says, is a ''security doctrine based on nonviolence.'' Hamas must irrevocably renounce violence. Then there would be ''conditions for takeoff that would not be perfect, but when did the perfect ever prevail?''
A unity government could get on with managing day-to-day business and, above all, preparing the national elections needed to know where Palestinians actually stand. Seven years without an election is far too long. Neither Fatah nor Hamas rule has any democratic legitimacy. Their positions are untenable even as they cling to power.
The United States and Europe should make holding a Palestinian election a diplomatic priority. Otherwise peace talks are merely chatter over a void. Of course, a unity government -- even one that has formally renounced violence -- would pose a severe diplomatic dilemma. Hamas is committed in its doctrine to Israel's destruction.
On balance, it is in the American interest to foster Palestinian unity, provided it is on the basis of the renunciation of violence. There are, after all, members of the Israeli government committed to Palestine's nonexistence. One does not choose one's interlocutor in peace talks. The Palestine Liberation Organization has recognized Israel; Abbas, as the P.L.O. leader, can wear that hat in talks. What matters are not slogans but the will to move forward -- and for now there is little evidence of such will.
Abbas is stuck. He has appealed for factions to set aside differences and said he wants a unity government to prepare elections. Hamas is cool to the idea. There is talk in Ramallah of his naming a trusted aide, Mohammad Mustafa, the chief executive of the Palestine Investment Fund, to replace Fayyad. There is talk of Abbas nominating himself to replace Fayyad. There is talk of him naming nobody and hoping Fayyad still shows up at the office.
Fayyad tells me he will not allow presidential inertia to keep him in the job. Within three to four weeks he will be gone -- but not completely. Despite rumors floated by his enemies of a return to the International Monetary Fund, he will stick around. ''I will reflect,'' he says, ''and if elections come, as they must because they are vital, I will see how best to take part in them.''
Palestinians have reached their ''Altalena'' moment. After the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948, the extremist Irgun Jewish militant group resisted being folded into the Israel Defense Forces and insisted on receiving weapons being shipped from Marseille aboard the Altalena. A pitched battle ensued; several were killed. Ben Gurion declared: ''There cannot be two armies and there cannot be two states.''
Equally, there cannot be two Palestines. One is hard enough. If Hamas will not cede its weapons to Fatah -- if the putative state does not, in Weber's famous definition, have the monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a given territory -- there will be no state.
''I resigned my job, that's all,'' Fayyad says. ''I am not resigned, even if it pains me additionally when lack of progress is self-inflicted. I will die without changing my mind that we Palestinians can prove the doubters wrong.''

HEADLINE: Kierkegaard at 200

BYLINE: By GORDON MARINO

 BODY:
Northfield, Minnesota
THE intellectual immortal Soren Kierkegaard turns 200 on Sunday. The lyrical Danish philosopher is widely regarded as the father of existentialism, a philosophical and literary movement that emphasizes the category of the individual and meditates on such gauzy questions as, Is there a meaning to life?
Not surprisingly, existentialism hit its zenith after humanity got a good look at itself in the mirror of the Holocaust, but then memories faded and economies boomed and existentialism began to seem a little overwrought. 
Still, throughout the ups and downs of the scholarly market, the intellectual world has remained bullish on Kierkegaard, in part because the Dane, unlike other members of the Socrates guild, always addressed what human beings are really up against in themselves, namely, anxiety, depression, despair and the flow of time.
There are at least a dozen scholarly fests going on around the globe to celebrate Kierkegaard's bicentennial, and here at the Hong Kierkegaard Library at St. Olaf College we are expecting over 100 international participants at our birthday bash.
In his youth, Kierkegaard earned the nickname ''gaflen,'' or ''the fork,'' for his ability to discern the weaknesses in other people and to stick it to them. All his writing life, Kierkegaard wielded his red-hot stylus to stick it to bourgeois Christendom. His life was a meditation on what it means to have faith.
Although Kierkegaard never used the exact phrase, ''the leap of faith,'' those words have become his shibboleth. A Lutheran raised in a pietistic environment, Kierkegaard insisted that there was no being born into the fold; no easy passage, no clattering up a series of syllogisms to faith. For Kierkegaard, faith involved a collision with the understanding and a radical choice, or to use the terms of his singular best seller, life and faith demands an ''Either/Or.'' Believe or don't believe, but don't imagine you can have it both ways. As the mostly empty pews attest, much of Europe has taken Kierkegaard up on his challenge.
But Kierkegaard was more than a Luther of his Lutheran tradition; his writings bristle with insights about culture and humanity that can be redeemed in the currency of secularism.
For instance, Kierkegaard flourished at the inception of mass media. Daily and weekly journals and newspapers were just beginning to circulate widely. As though he could feel Facebook and Twitter coming down the line, he anticipated a time when communication would become instantaneous, but no one would have anything to say; or again, a time when everyone was obsessed with finding their voice but without much substance or ''inwardness'' behind their eruptions and blogposts.
In one of his books Kierkegaard moans, ''The present age is an age of publicity, the age of miscellaneous announcements: Nothing happens but still there is instant publicity.'' In the end, Kierkegaard was concerned about the power of the press to foment and form public opinion and in the process relieve of us of the need to think matters through on our own.
Over a 17-year span, Kierkegaard published a score of books and compiled thousand of pages of journal entries. Like Nietzsche and other geniuses who were more than less immolated by the fiery force of their own ideas, Kierkegaard sacrificed his body to dance out the riches of his thoughts. Self-conscious of his own preternatural powers, he wrote, ''Geniuses are like thunderstorms. They go against the wind, terrify people, cleanse the air.''
Of course, we have all known hours of inspiration, but to live with the Muse on one's shoulders year after year is to be able to abide close to the borders of what must sometimes feel like madness. Not an easy task.
Just to pluck a couple of plums from the sprawling tree of Kierkegaard's extraordinary oeuvre: He was not what we would term an ethicist. He did not devote his energies to trying to find a rational basis for ethics, nor was he occupied with teasing out moral puzzles. And yet, he has something very significant to say about ethics.
According to Kierkegaard, it is not more knowledge or skills of analysis that is required to lead dutiful lives. If knowledge were the issue, then ethics would be a kind of talent. Some people would be born moral geniuses and others moral dolts. And yet so far as he and Kant were concerned, when it comes to good and evil we are all on an equal footing.
Contrary to the ethics industry that is thrumming today, Kierkegaard believed that the prime task is to hold on to what we know, to refrain from pulling the wool over our own eyes because we aren't keen on the sacrifices that doing the right thing is likely to require. As Kierkegaard put it, when we find ourselves in a moral pinch we don't just take the easy way out. Instead, he writes, ''Willing allows some time to elapse, an interim called: We shall look at it tomorrow.''
And by the day after tomorrow, we usually decide that the right way was, after all, the easy way. And so the gadfly of Copenhagen concludes, ''And this is how perhaps the great majority of men live: They work gradually at eclipsing their ethical and ethical-religious comprehension, which would lead them out into decisions and conclusions that their lower nature does not much care for.''
There are epiphanies in every nook and cranny of Kierkegaard's authorship, but paradoxically enough, from the beginning to the end, the man who seemed to know just about everything, was gently emphatic: ''The majority of men ... live and die under the impression that life is simply a matter of understanding more and more, and that if it were granted to them to live longer, that life would continue to be one long continuous growth in understanding. How many of them ever experience the maturity of discovering that there comes a critical moment where everything is reversed, after which the point becomes to understand more and more that there is something which cannot be understood.''
And what might it mean to understand that there is something of vital importance in life that cannot be understood? With the indirection of a Zen master, our Birthday Boy helps us unlock this and other koans that strike to the marrow of the question of what it means to be a human being.

HEADLINE: Unemployment in Europe Is Expected to Worsen

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- A deteriorating economy in the European Union is expected to drive unemployment to new highs this year in countries including Spain and Portugal that already are feeling acute pain, the Union's top economics official warned on Friday.
The new forecasts stood in stark contrast with figures from the United States on Friday that showed that more new jobs were created in April than expected, which pushed the unemployment rate to a four-year low. While American job creation is still slower than in a typical recovery, the new data could ease concerns of a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy.
In Europe, far from delivering relief, the outlook presented by Olli Rehn, the Union's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, stoked further concerns that unemployment risked becoming endemic and could eventually cause social upheaval.
Unemployment is expected to reach 11.1 percent across the European Union this year and hit 12.2 percent in the euro zone. It is expected to remain at those levels for much of 2014, according to the Union's spring forecast, which was released Friday. That picture is distinctly worse compared with 2012, when 10.5 percent were without jobs across the Union and 11.4 percent in the euro area. 
Given the fragmented structure of the 27-nation Union, economists and analysts say there are few real policy options for easing the situation any time soon.
''We are living through a very difficult process of adjustment following the financial crisis'' and that ''is having very unfortunate toll on employment,'' Mr. Rehn said during a news conference. ''In view of the protracted recession,'' he said, ''we must do whatever it takes to overcome the unemployment crisis in Europe.''
Mr. Rehn offered to give some countries longer to meet their budget targets. He also urged a quicker pace of economic liberalization in countries like France and said it was necessary to get credit flowing to households and businesses, especially in Southern Europe.
But analysts say remedies may be hard to find.
Unless the euro zone countries are willing to pool their debt and finances and engage in uniform economic policies -- which is politically unlikely -- the most effective medicine for the euro zone would be for Germany to stimulate its own economy to raise consumer demand for more of the goods sold by beleaguered nations in Southern Europe, said John Springford, a research fellow at the Center for European Reform, a research organization in London.
Another effective measure, he said, might be for Germany to drop its opposition to more direct lending by the European Central Bank to small and midsize companies in those countries.
''Relying less on exports, and more on domestic demand, would also be good for Germany as it's starting to feel recessionary effects from the south,'' Mr. Springford said. But, he acknowledged, ''those steps would be very difficult politically for the government in Berlin to take.''
Nicolas Véron, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels, said he did not expect European banks to significantly regain confidence to start lending to small and midsize businesses until late 2014 at the earliest, when the E.C.B. is expected to take over supervision of the European Union's biggest lenders.
''Credit allocation in Europe is clearly dysfunctional,'' Mr. Véron said, ''and that's hugely serious because lending in Europe is so reliant on banks compared to the United States, where there are far more diverse sources of capital, like bond markets and nonbank intermediaries.''
On Thursday, the E.C.B. cut rates to a record low to do what it could to spur growth. Bond markets responded favorably, with Spanish 10-year yields falling below 4 percent Friday for the first time in a couple years, and Italian 2-year yields below 1 percent for the first time ever.
But those yields had already been on their way down after Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, pledged last year to pull out all stops to save the euro. But the reduction in government borrowing costs has done little to ease joblessness in many countries.
Unemployment in Spain is expected to reach 27 percent this year, compared with 25 percent last year, the commission said, while the outlook for Portugal is 18.2 percent, after 15.9 percent last year. Unemployment in Greece, which has been in economic intensive care for three years, is expected to rise to 27 percent this year from 24.3 percent last year.
The figures also illustrate an increasingly rigid divide between the fortunes of these countries and those further north, where the picture is far rosier. In Germany, the forecast calls for unemployment to fall 0.1 percentage point this year from last, to 5.4 percent. In Austria, although unemployment is expected to rise 0.4 percentage point year, to 4.7 percent, that would still be well below 5 percent.
The dismal outlook for many parts of the European Union prompted an immediate outcry from critics of Mr. Rehn's austere budget policies, which have come under attack from some economists who say his approach has crimped countries' ability to restore growth.
''Again and again we are told that the recovery will come one day, if only the policy of harsh austerity is maintained,'' said Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian member of the European Parliament who leads an alliance of Socialists and Democrats.
But Mr. Rehn ''had to -- once again -- correct his forecasts by revising them downwards'' and to admit that ''no improvement in the labor market is to be expected this year,'' Mr. Swoboda said.
Another ominous sign for Europe is that debt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is expected to continue soaring in the euro zone's weakest members.
By 2014, Greece is expected to be running debt amounting to 175 percent of G.D.P., while the comparable figure for Portugal was 124.3 percent and for Cyprus, 124 percent. All would be higher than the levels expected this year, even as those countries try to abide by the belt-tightening terms of international bailouts.
Mr. Rehn said that because Italian public debt was so high -- it is expected to reach 132.2 percent next year -- the country would need to stay the course on austerity even if he removed the country from the commission's deficit watch list, known as the Excessive Deficit Procedure, later this month.
But Mr. Rehn was particularly critical of France, which will not reach the European Union-mandated deficit target of 3 percent of gross domestic product this year or next.
Mr. Rehn described the growth forecasts of the government led by President François Hollande as ''overly optimistic.'' He also warned that France needed labor market overhauls and was suffering steadily declining competitiveness.
Mr. Rehn said France would be given two more years, to 2015, to meet its budget deficit targets, given its difficulties.
Mr. Rehn said Spain, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Poland would also be granted more time to meet their targets. But those extensions amounted to little more than an economic Band-Aid, said Mujtaba Rahman, the director for Europe of the Eurasia Group.
''As long as countries continue to reform, they will earn more time to meet fiscal targets,'' Mr. Rahman said. ''But giving countries more time to meet targets is not the same as the E.U. having a credible strategy in place to boost growth.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Sadrist Governor Is a Folk Hero to Iraqis

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Duraid Adnan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
AMARA, Iraq
CLAD in his trademark blue auto mechanic's outfit, the governor was mobbed by his constituents as he walked the dust-choked streets of the old city here, where the poor sell textiles and pet birds.
One man poked his head in the scrum and said, simply, ''I just wanted to give you a kiss.''
Another man, sweat pouring from his brow, explained the commotion: ''He's gold. He takes care of everyone. He doesn't make any difference between a Muslim or a Christian. You won't find one person here who doesn't love him.''
For Iraqis around the country, most of whom are fed up with poor services, sectarian politics, and violence, the governor, Ali Dwai of Maysan Province, provides a rare example of democracy's potential. 
On one popular Facebook page where Iraqis gather, a man wrote, ''If it was in my hands I would make a coup and hand him the state.'' Another wrote, ''If we had one of him in each province, Iraq would be better than Dubai.''
Everyone, it seems, loves Mr. Dwai, a follower of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr and perhaps Iraq's most popular politician. In a country where leaders are separated from the people by bodyguards and blast walls, and where the space between politicking and bribery is thin, Mr. Dwai has become something of a folk hero.
And not just here. Through social media, Iraqis everywhere can see for themselves his intimate interactions with citizens, or his delivering on promises to improve services and fostering investments in everything from bridges to sewage systems to amusement parks.
''A leader must be close to the people,'' Mr. Dwai said in an interview in his cavernous office after a morning touring public works projects where at each stop he was accosted by citizens offering thanks or asking for favors.
Mr. Dwai's popularity, though, reflects something more than excitement for a hard-working politician. As the only provincial governor of Mr. Sadr's political party, he represents the maturation of a grass-roots political movement that has sought to mimic Lebanon's Hezbollah by fusing Shiite faith, military strength and a concern for the common citizen to build political power.
Mr. Sadr, who inherited his authority from his father, a revered cleric who was murdered by Saddam Hussein's henchmen, once directed a militia, the Mahdi Army, that fought the Americans and, during the country's sectarian war, Iraq's Sunnis. Now, he is seeking power through peaceful means, in part through politicians like Mr. Dwai, who was installed in 2011 after a deal in which Mr. Sadr agreed to back Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki for a second term.
''What they are trying to do is demonstrate that they can deliver services in the south,'' said Marisa Cochrane Sullivan, a fellow at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War who has written about the Sadrist movement. ''This is part of their transformation. They can no longer make the case that they have to be there to protect the Shiites from Al Qaeda or other Sunni groups.''
She added, ''The Sadrist strategy is to find areas where they can win the art of political argument.''
MR. SADR emerged from the national elections in 2010 as a kingmaker whose support allowed Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to secure a second term. With the majority of results in from the recent local elections, it appears Mr. Sadr's support has diminished in much of the south -- where leaders have not had the same success as Mr. Dwai -- with the exception of Maysan Province.
The results underscored two things: that Mr. Sadr has more work to do in expanding his constituency through governing in much of the south, and that Mr. Dwai is the movement's brightest star.
Amara, the capital of Maysan Province, lies in Iraq's Shiite heartland not far from the Iranian border. The area was once a bloody arena for Hussein's 1991 crackdown on his rebellious Shiite population and later, under the American occupation, a battleground for militias backed by Iran.
When American troops were preparing to leave Iraq at the end of 2011, the area was still considered so dangerous that American commanders paid local sheiks to clear the roadways of homemade bombs and Iraqi security forces carried out a wide-ranging military operation to drive out the armed groups.
Far from the tumultuous center of Iraq -- where Sunni militias are now fighting the Shiite-controlled government, and where car bombs and suicide attackers strike with impunity -- Amara has few terrorist attacks, and violent murders number in the single digits annually, said Mr. Dwai, who is also the head of the security committee in the local council.
There is no sign here of the sense of insecurity that dominates the Iraqi psyche elsewhere.
''We have no fear,'' said Ameir Jamal, 31, who works as a driver for the municipality, sitting in a local cafe drinking tea and smoking a water pipe. ''Our fear is when we have to go to Baghdad.''
Mr. Dwai's life story encapsulates the narrative of the Shiite underclass that Mr. Sadr's movement has sought to serve. He grew up in the primitive southern marshlands, ran from service in Hussein's army and was jailed for political dissidence. He eventually earned a degree in Islamic studies at a local university and worked in a sugar factory before the American invasion created an opening for him to enter politics.
As governor, he has embraced Mr. Sadr's strategy of elevating the movement above its sectarian past, when the Mahdi Army was associated with some of the worst abuses against Sunni Muslims during the civil war.
In the interview, Mr. Dwai, who is 46 but looks 10 years older, played down his party affiliation, saying only that he followed Mr. Sadr's father as a religious leader. ''It doesn't make a difference if you are Sunni or Shiite or Christian,'' he said. ''I don't differentiate between anyone.''
In the old city, Jalal Daniel, a Christian, was among those surrounding Mr. Dwai. At 57, Mr. Daniel has never seen a politician responsive to the people. ''It's not about Sadr,'' he said. Mr. Dwai, he said, ''always says, 'I am a son of Iraq.' He's not about his party.''
Local people say services have improved enormously during Mr. Dwai's tenure. Roads are being paved, new sewage systems installed and residents now enjoy electricity for up to 22 hours a day, far more than in Baghdad. Foreign investment is also on the rise. Turks are building a five-star hotel, Chinese are digging oil wells and Italians are putting up an amusement park.
Even as poverty and unemployment remain stubbornly high, the signs of improvement have lent a sense of civic self-confidence to a region that for decades suffered mightily under Hussein's brutality.
The province, said Ihsan Shnashin, a local barber, ''is like a fresh rose; people are happy.''
MR. DWAI spends little time behind his desk, and said he sleeps just three and a half hours a night. Most days are spent touring public works sites, barking at workers to get a move on.
Thursdays are reserved for constituents. He meets them one-on-one in his large reception hall, sometimes doling out cash from a discretionary fund, as he did recently when a young man admitted he could not afford to pay for his fiancée to have her hair done before their wedding.
In a country where many leaders spend much of their time abroad, where Parliament sessions are often canceled because not enough lawmakers show up for work and where public officials rarely exhibit any sense of urgency, Mr. Dwai is always in a hurry.
''We should not put off the work of today to tomorrow,'' he said. ''We have to invest the time of today, each minute.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Data Eases Fears Of a Sharp Slowdown; Joblessness Dips to 7.5%

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Washington may be hitting the brakes, but the private sector is still rolling ahead, helping create nearly 200,000 jobs a month, on average, since the beginning of the year and forcing the overall unemployment rate in April down to its lowest level since the end of 2008.
This push-and-pull dynamic was evident in data released Friday by the Labor Department, as private employers added 176,000 people to their payrolls even as the public sector shed an additional 11,000 workers.
The latest figures painted a somewhat brighter picture of the overall economy than had been expected as the government sharply revised upward its estimate for job creation in the previous two months. Those revisions concluded that the economy generated a robust 332,000 jobs in February, not the 268,000 originally reported, and 138,000 in March, up from 88,000.
The news sent the stock market soaring to new highs, with major stock market indexes closing up 1 percent for the day. 
Still, at 7.5 percent, a slight drop from last month's 7.6 percent, the jobless rate remains far higher than it typically would be this far into a recovery. It is also a full percentage point above the level the Federal Reserve has said it wants to see before it will consider raising interest rates from their current levels near zero.
As a result, most experts expect the economy to continue to be buffeted by countervailing factors in the months ahead, with business activity and the Fed providing a healthy measure of support for growth even as fiscal austerity in Washington makes a substantial drop in the unemployment rate unlikely.
''The drag from the government sector is quite substantial,'' said Gregory Daco, senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight. ''Given the fiscal headwinds, the private sector is doing O.K.''
Despite repeated fears of a double-dip recession, an economy that has endured a spring swoon for three consecutive years and other potential perils, the country's rate of job creation has been remarkably steady, if subdued. Over the last three years, the economy has added an average of 162,000 jobs a month, within a hairbreadth of April's pace, at least as initially estimated, of 165,000 new jobs.
But experts have been warning that the economy and job creation are likely to slow in the second quarter, largely as a result of fiscal tightening in Washington. Payroll taxes increased in January, and the effect of across-the-board spending cuts mandated by Congress is expected to be felt more broadly in the months ahead.
While the private sector has been on the upswing since last summer, cutbacks in government employment continue to prevent a stronger acceleration in the economy, economists said.
''If it weren't for the government, the economy would be stronger,'' said Mr. Daco, citing the spending cuts hitting now, as well as the higher Social Security deductions for all workers and increased income taxes for top earners that began in January.
On the other hand, he said, ''If the Fed hadn't loosened monetary policy, we'd be seeing weaker growth. Both sides are generating opposing forces.''
Even though job growth now looks better, continued strains in the economy and data this week showing inflation over the last 12 months running at a low 1 percent rate suggest that the Fed is not likely to slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases intended to stimulate the economy for at least the next few months. On Wednesday, the Fed said it was ''prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases,'' depending on the outlook for the labor market and inflation.
The White House was quick to highlight Friday's report, even as it warned of the potential dangers from the fiscal squeeze.
''While more work remains to be done, today's employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression,'' Alan Krueger, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. Mr. Krueger urged Congress to replace automatic budget cuts with a more balanced approach. ''Now is not the time for Washington to impose self-inflicted wounds on the economy,'' he said.
Republicans cautioned against drawing too positive a conclusion from April's data. ''President Obama's desperate hype-and-blame campaign will try to spin today's anemic jobs report six ways to Sunday,'' Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. ''But the facts remain clear: too many Americans have been unemployed for far too long. For millions, the economy is simply not working.''
The jobs report provided plenty of fodder for differing views. On the positive side, the size of the labor force increased, while the total number of unemployed Americans dropped by 83,000 to 11,659,000. What's more, the ranks of the long-term unemployed, defined as workers who have been out of a job for 27 weeks or more, declined especially sharply, falling by 258,000 to 4.4 million. That is still far above what is typical at this stage of a recovery, but it is a marked improvement from past months. The long-term unemployed have been a particular cause of concern for economists in this recovery, because skills degrade the longer a person is out of the work force, and employers are reluctant to hire someone who has not held a job in a while.
On the downside, the least-educated workers continue to bear the brunt of elevated joblessness, with the unemployment rate for workers who failed to graduate from high school rising to 11.6 percent from 11.1 percent in March. At the other end of the education spectrum, unemployment among people with a college degree or more remained at a low level, rising by 0.1 of a percentage point to 3.9 percent.
Employment in the construction sector, which increased at a healthy pace in the first three months of 2013, actually dipped by 6,000 in April. The recovering housing market has been one of the bright spots in the economic landscape, and economists will be closely watching to see if higher home prices and increased construction translate into additional jobs. The manufacturing sector, which is closely watched as a gauge of broader economic strength, was unchanged in April.
Analysts noted that the number of hours worked fell in April, another sign that the economy is having trouble generating enough additional income and jobs to help lift spending. The typical workweek fell to 34.4 hours from 34.6 in March. Average hourly earnings inched up 4 cents to $23.87.
The economy has been showing other signs of weakness of late. Several indicators beginning in March have pointed to much slower growth, with everything from retail sales to manufacturing looking soft recently.
''In one line: Not bad, especially in the light of beaten-down expectations,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, after Friday's report. ''This could have been much worse.''

HEADLINE: Last South Koreans Leave Industrial Park in North

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- The last remaining South Koreans in an industrial complex jointly run with North Korea returned home on Friday, terminating, at least temporarily, the final economic ties between the two Koreas. 
With the withdrawal of the seven South Koreans, the industrial complex, located in the North Korean town of Kaesong, was emptied out for the first time since it began operating in late 2004.
North Korea removed all 53,000 of its workers from the factory park early last month, accusing South Korea and the United States of plotting to start a war against the North.
After appeals to the North to reverse the decision went unheeded, South Korea decided last week to bring home all of the country's factory managers from the plant.
The last seven South Korean nationals -- five officials and two telecommunications technicians -- crossed the border on Friday after completing negotiations over unpaid wages for the North Korean workers.
The Kaesong Industrial Complex had been the best-known -- and last remaining -- symbol of rapprochement between the two Koreas. More than 120 South Korean factories hired low-cost North Korean labor there in an experiment that supporters hoped would help advance the economic integration and eventual reunification of the two Koreas.
The future of the complex now remains unclear. South Korea urged North Korea on Friday to protect its investments in Kaesong amid concern that the North might confiscate the South Korean properties if the shutdown was prolonged.
South Korea reaffirmed on Friday that it would try to reopen the complex. The country called on North Korea to guarantee that it would not use the economic project as a political bargaining chip.

HEADLINE: Revival of Europe's Economy Falls to German Leader

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Chris Cottrell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Even as the United States economy displays unanticipated resilience, with a healthy jobs report released on Friday, the outlook for Europe's economy grows ever dimmer. As it does, the pressure builds on Europe's most powerful leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and her economic team to find a way to get the Continent growing again.
But this puts Ms. Merkel in a bind, as she has to answer to German voters in September when the country holds parliamentary elections. While the European economy may be deteriorating at an alarming rate, the electorate here is still enamored of her as the Iron Chancellor, advocating the austerity policies that are rapidly falling into disfavor elsewhere, among economists as well as the public. 
Her response, in recent months, has been to try a delicate balancing act, quietly easing up on crisis-stricken states, giving them more time to narrow their budget deficits, while showing no outward signs of weakness that her political rivals can pounce upon.
But this stance may become increasingly untenable, if the United States's more stimulative economic policies begin to bear fruit and Europe continues to struggle, as seems to be the case. The European Commission said Friday that the economy of its member nations would shrink by 0.1 percent this year, while the countries that use the euro would contract even more sharply, by 0.4 percent.
And there are signs that the contagion from the south is migrating north and beginning to drag down Germany's export-driven economy, which is expected to grow by a meager 0.4 percent this year, adding another potential source of voter discontent to Ms. Merkel's concerns.
So the question now is not just whether Ms. Merkel will further relax her insistence on strict austerity but how far she thinks she can go in an election year, or perhaps how far she needs to go to prop up her own economy. Few experts expect any drastic departures.
''In the end, she's this sort of Prussian-Protestant determined person,'' said Stefan Kornelius, an editor at the Süddeutsche Zeitung and the author of a new book about Ms. Merkel. ''She's not ideological, but she's truly convinced about the rightfulness of her course.''
But the constant questions about austerity are taking their toll on Ms. Merkel, who has begun to bridle in public when people ask about spending cuts.
''I think budget consolidation is now interestingly labeled with the word austerity, which is otherwise not used in Germany,'' Ms. Merkel said this week at a news conference with the new Italian prime minister, Enrico Letta. ''In Germany we didn't even know this word before the crisis.''
Aware of the shifting dynamics in Europe, Ms. Merkel has chosen instead to emphasize the need for structural reforms to the labor markets of struggling countries over slashed spending. And she is not insisting on strict adherence to budget-cutting goals. That may help in the long run but can do little to immediately pull economies out of free fall.
''Her overarching goal right now is to get re-elected, and she won't get re-elected if she spends German money on French and Italian problems without getting anything in return,'' Mr. Kornelius said.
Ms. Merkel is forced to navigate dissension within her own conservative ranks at the slightest wavering from the disciplined German line, and a new party on the right, the Alternative for Germany, pressing for the more extreme step of a breakup of the euro.
To critics, Europe is facing an undeniable economic crisis and Germany is making decisions based on politics. ''They are prevaricating all the time and allowing short-term domestic considerations to determine euro-zone policy,'' said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, London.
Critics contend that fiscally solid countries like Germany have already gotten plenty in return and that the narrative of parsimonious Northern Europeans bled dry by profligate southerners is a false one. They have pointed to studies quantifying how Germany has been able to save billions of dollars because lower interest rates for perceived safe havens have made borrowing money dramatically cheaper.
A study last year by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, for instance, found that in 2011 alone Germany was able to save $11.1 billion. Allianz, a German insurer, estimated last year that from 2010 to 2012, the savings added up to $13.3 billion. The cost of a breakup to the euro looks steeper than advocates of such a drastic step are suggesting.
Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation released a study last month that said a return to the German mark would cost some $1.6 trillion over 13 years, paring back Germany's gross domestic product by an average of 0.5 percentage points between 2013 and 2025, the study found.
''It's in Merkel's self-interest to keep the German economy going and to reduce this negative spillover,'' said Justina A. V. Fischer, an economist and senior researcher at the University of Mannheim in Germany.
The result of changing German attitudes has not been some muscular new German-financed Marshall Plan for Southern Europe but instead the growing flexibility on the margins toward slower budget cutting.
''It's always about rules, never about leadership,'' said Mark Blyth, professor of international political economy at Brown University and the author of ''Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea.'' ''There's some kind of neuralgia about being bold.''
Markets have been keenly searching for evidence that thinking in the German government has shifted, rising at the slightest indication of greater flexibility from Berlin on spending to counteract the recession.
''We now see a softening in some respect, deficit targets aren't met and we say we'll give you some more time,'' said Joachim Scheide, an economist and head of the forecasting center at the Kiel Institute. ''I think it's tactical,'' Dr. Scheide said. ''Ms. Merkel is the scapegoat for the bad things that happen all through Europe.''
For politicians in France and Italy, he said, it can be easier to rail against German-dictated austerity than focus on unpopular labor market reforms at home. There remains the hope that if Ms. Merkel is unseated by a Social Democrat-led left wing coalition, the new government in Berlin will be more receptive to their demands for assistance.
That helps explain Ms. Merkel's steadiness in the face of overwhelming criticism in Europe. ''They're calm in the chancellery,'' Mr. Kornelius said.

HEADLINE: A Credit Score That Ignores the Innocuous Mistake

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Megan Barringer had no idea that a medical billing mix-up over a $742 charge for a back evaluation six years ago could end up costing her more than $33,000.
But the old bill, which she ultimately paid, had gone to collections and showed up as black mark on her otherwise clean credit report. Ms. Barringer said she found out about it only when she applied for a mortgage last month and got an interest rate that was half a percentage point more than it would otherwise have been. As a result, she is paying an extra $94 a month on the $298,000 loan she took out on a three-bedroom ranch in Dallas, adding up to tens of thousands of dollars over the life of her 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.
And it was all because the doctor didn't contact Ms. Barringer, an elementary school assistant principal, in a timely manner to let her know that she had mistakenly handed over her dental insurance card. 
''I have always paid my bills on time and I put myself through school and have not had any kind of credit issues,'' said Ms. Barringer, a single mother of twin 8-year-old boys. ''If they want to punish somebody, does it really need to be on your report for seven years if you have not had credit problems and you pay it off? It just seems a little much.''
Credit scores try to capture your financial behavior and distill that identity into one all-powerful number. But that figure doesn't differentiate between people like Ms. Barringer, whose credit suffered for an innocuous reason, and consumers who can't keep up with their credit card payments after a wild shopping spree at Best Buy.
But now, at least one major credit score generator, VantageScore Solutions, has decided to ignore collection actions on credit reports -- more than half of which are typically tied to medical debts -- as long as the collections are paid. The change is not being made out of sympathy for people like Ms. Barringer. Instead, the company found that paid collections are less accurate at predicting future defaults than looking at unpaid collections in combination with a variety of other factors, like the age of consumers' accounts and the size of their loans.
''There was no intentional decision to exclude a piece of behavior,'' said Sarah Davies, senior vice president of analytics, research and product management at VantageScore Solutions, a joint venture of the three major credit reporting companies. ''It was just about what was most predictive.''
VantageScore's findings would also seem to lend support, at least indirectly, to proposed legislation that was reintroduced in Congress this year to require consumer reporting agencies to remove fully paid or settled medical debt information from consumers' credit reports within 45 days of the debt's resolution.
That sort of fix could potentially help some of the estimated seven million people who reported that a billing error prompted a collection agency to contact them in 2012, according to an April study by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that researches health policy issues.
''While it doesn't seem like an isolated collection account should have a significant impact on your scores, it can,'' said Gerri Detweiler, a credit expert with Credit.com who supports the legislation. ''We've heard from so many people over the years who thought that paying a collection account would help their credit scores. They were shocked to learn it didn't. It feels terribly unfair to consumers not to feel like they are getting credit for doing the right thing.''
The VantageScore plays second fiddle to the FICO credit score, which is more widely used by lenders and continues to consider all collections valued at more than $100. So it's unclear how many consumers the formula change will help. And ignoring paid collections does little for the millions of people who cannot afford to pay their medical debts because they are underinsured, uninsured or simply can't keep up with the growing amounts their health insurance policies require them to pay. Among people who reported having trouble paying their medical bills, 32 million, or 42 percent, said they received a lower credit rating as a result of unpaid medical bills, Commonwealth found. And an estimated 28 million, or 37 percent, said they used all of their savings because of their bills, whereas 20 million, or 27 percent, took on credit card debt.
Even someone with a spotless credit history can fall into a downward spiral with just one hospital stay. ''It is easy to point to someone who has run up their debt when it has to do with consumer spending,'' said Mark Rukavina, former executive director of the Access Project and now a principal at Community Health Advisors, a Boston-based firm that consults with nonprofit hospitals. ''But it is harder to say that about somebody that is dealing with illness and injury.''
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which oversees both the major credit reporting agencies and debt collectors, has acknowledged that medical debts are a problem. Richard Cordray, the agency's director, has said that consumers who have medical collections reported on their credit file can face a harder time getting a loan -- or even a job, since some employers now look at prospects' credit reports. And the agency has gone so far as buying its own batch of anonymous credit reports so that it can study how medical debts affect consumers, as well as to better understand the degree to which paid medical collection items predict defaults. But it remains to be seen what sort of action, if any, it will take.
The big question is whether FICO's scoring strategy will eventually ignore paid collections, too, since that would have a much broader effect. A spokesman said that its scoring technique did not distinguish between paid and unpaid collections, though it began ignoring all collections for amounts under $100 when it introduced the latest iteration of its score in January 2009. All other types of reported collections are considered ''as a derogatory because as a category they have proven to be strong indicators of credit risk,'' the company said in a statement. ''To ignore data that has been proven to be highly predictive of a person's ability to repay a debt would not be in the best interest of consumers or lenders.''
John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com, said he found VantageScore's change noteworthy, especially when coupled with the fact that FICO began ignoring collections with an original balance under $100. ''Now, you have the two most prominent credit score developers agreeing, indirectly, that small and paid collections are worth ignoring,'' he said.
Ms. Davies, of VantageScore, noted that all collections were somewhat predictive: a person with a paid collection is generally three times more likely to default on a bill than someone without a collection, while an unpaid collection tells lenders you're seven times as risky. But looking at unpaid collections in combination with other factors was even more accurate. ''When you bring combinations of information together, that can provide more insight than any single variable,'' she said.
The scoring company is able to take a more nuanced look now because more detailed data has become available from the big reporting bureaus over a solid period of time, she said.
Stuart Pratt, president and chief executive of the Consumer Data Industry Association, the trade group for the credit reporting bureaus, said that they were waiting to see what conclusions the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau comes to after studying the credit report data related to medical bills. ''We take the position that the data has to be consistently presented and reported so that score developer groups and lenders can make their own decisions on how to weigh risk,'' he said. ''In this case, we don't see the decision by a single developer as a definitive statement on the predictability of the data.''
Several lawmakers, too, have weighed in on the medical bill issue, though they have not yet gained enough traction for their proposals. Last week, Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, along with several other members of Congress, introduced legislation that would require the consumer reporting agencies to remove fully paid or settled medical debt information from consumers' reports within 45 days of the resolution of the debt. A similar bill was approved by the House with bipartisan support in 2010. A companion bill was reintroduced in the Senate by Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, in January.
And in coming weeks, Representative Gary Miller, Republican of California, is expected to introduce a bill with bipartisan support that would try to prevent medical bills from even being reported to the credit reporting companies. Details are still being drafted, but the proposal would prevent debt collectors from reporting any negative information to the agencies for 90 days after a consumer contacts them to resolve the matter, according to a legislative aide with knowledge of the bill. This, too, would be only a partial fix because some consumers, like Ms. Barringer, are unaware that their bills have ended up in collections.
Though specific rules are still being drafted by the Internal Revenue Service, the Affordable Care Act has a provision that requires nonprofit hospitals to make ''reasonable efforts'' to determine whether a patient qualifies for financial help under the hospitals' own policies before, for instance, it sells the debt or reports negative information to the credit bureaus.
Each of these efforts would help people in situations similar to Ms. Barringer's, who, for now, will need to wait about another year for the credit stain to fade entirely. Of course, you need to know what's on your credit report to begin with. As Ms. Detweiler said, ''Consumers don't always know there is a problem until after it's too late.''

HEADLINE: Ad Effort Selling State as a Business Haven Is Criticized

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The Cuomo administration has set aside nearly $140 million for an advertising campaign called ''New York State Open for Business,'' with the money drawn largely from a state authority created to lower electricity bills and from federal disaster aid, records show.
Much of the money spent has been used to buy television ads, half of which are being broadcast outside New York, celebrating the state's economic success stories as part of an effort to lure and keep business here. 
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's administration, which began the campaign, says the ads are a valuable tool for recruiting businesses, but critics say they are a backdoor way of elevating the governor's stature, even though they do not mention his name and he is prohibited from appearing in them.
''We are doing everything we can to level the playing field to bring businesses and jobs to the state of New York, and will continue to double down on those efforts as long as this governor is in office,'' Melissa DeRosa, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said.
A portion of the campaign is being financed with money from public authorities, which have missions that include protecting the environment and financing public building projects, drawing some criticism. Additionally, a coming phase of the campaign will use $40 million from the federal government to promote businesses and tourism in the areas struck by Hurricane Sandy.
When the campaign began last June, a top state official, Howard Glaser, noted that New York was competing with other states to attract and keep businesses.
''Connecticut is spending $27 million promoting its state, Michigan $25 million, New Jersey ran a campaign to recruit businesses featuring its governor,'' Mr. Glaser, the state operations director, said. ''California spent $50 million on a campaign to promote its state. We have to compete.''
Mr. Cuomo's office says that much of the money has not yet been spent -- it says it spent $24 million on ad buys for the campaign last year, and another $12 million so far this year, and it says the scale of the campaign is similar to that in other states. A state filing last December said that by then, most of the initial $50 million allotment for the campaign had ''been either spent or committed.''
Critics of the ''Open for Business'' campaign, which the Legislature approved, have proliferated as the commercials receive heavy airtime on networks like CNN, CNBC and NBC. Some have questioned whether the campaign is a wise use of money, while others have questioned whether New York, with its high tax burden, is truly business-friendly.
Andrew Rudnick, the chief executive of the Buffalo Niagara Partnership, a trade group, said in an interview, ''New York's business climate still isn't competitive enough, in any objective sense of the word, for an ad to overcome.'' He added, ''I don't think it'll make a measurable amount of difference.''
Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who like Mr. Cuomo is a Democrat, said in an appearance on NY1 this week, ''They've spent who knows how much money on TV ads that are fluff and a waste of taxpayer money.''
One of the forces behind the campaign has been Harvey Cohen, who served as the adman for the political campaigns of the governor's father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and who now works at the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm. Advertising giant BBDO was hired to produce the commercials.
In a presentation to Empire State Development's board in 2011, Mr. Cohen described the campaign as confronting ''a classic marketing problem.'' He said consultants who helped businesses relocate had misconceptions about New York.
''Yes they knew high taxes, yes they knew regulations, yes they knew right to work, but interestingly, they would tell me that many companies don't even know that upstate New York exists,'' he said, adding, ''They certainly don't know the new attitude brought in by the new administration.''
An early commercial featured a voice-over by Robert De Niro and the Jay-Z song ''Empire State of Mind.''
''Some said we lost our edge,'' Mr. De Niro narrated. ''Well today, there's a new New York State, one that's working to attract businesses and create jobs.''
Another ad highlighted small businesses, from an ice cream factory to a bicycle shop, while a third ad focused on the state's emerging technology sector.
In a statement last year, Mr. Cuomo said, ''By telling the stories of businesses that are already succeeding in our state, we can attract even more economic opportunity and jobs.''
But others have raised concerns that the governor and lawmakers are draining money from ostensibly independent public authorities for purposes running counter to their missions, in a practice that is controversial but common in Albany. The state regularly takes what it describes as excess funds from public authorities, to finance state programs.
A state official said the early stages of the ad campaign were partly financed by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which runs programs intended to reduce energy consumption and improve the environment, and the Dormitory Authority of New York, which supports universities and nonprofit institutions.
Last December, the Cuomo administration added another $50 million. The money came from the State Power Authority, which was created to generate and provide cheap electricity to lower bills for residents and business. In public filings, officials with the authority described the advertising campaign as part of a broader effort by it to promote economic development.
Richard Brodsky, a Democrat and former assemblyman from Westchester County, said, ''These authorities should be lowering electric rates, building dormitories and otherwise doing what they were created to do, rather than being raided'' to pay for the ads.
Last month, the state expanded the ''Open for Business'' campaign, using $40 million from the federal aid package intended to help New Yorkers recover from Hurricane Sandy, records show. A new series of ads will, according to a state document, ''promote seasonal business in areas'' affected by the storm and a program focused on helping small businesses rebuild. New Jersey plans to spend $25 million of its federal funds on a campaign to promote the Jersey Shore and other storm-damaged areas.

HEADLINE: Obama Tells Mexico Audience of New Era in Relations

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Randal C. Archibold reported from Mexico City, and Michael D. Shear from San José, Costa Rica. Damien Cave and Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- President Obama, speaking to an enthusiastic crowd of young people here, on Friday declared a new era in relations with Mexico that will focus on strengthening the countries' economic ties and that will play down the battle against drug gangs that has dominated the discourse for several years.
Hours after a private dinner with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, who has made an overhaul of laws to foster economic growth the highlight of his five-month-old term, Mr. Obama urged Americans to look past stereotypes of Mexican violence and despair, and embrace the country's strengthening democracy and economic health. 
''We agree that the relationship between our nations must be defined not by the threats that we face, but by the prosperity and the opportunity that we can create together,'' Mr. Obama said to vigorous applause before an audience of high school and college students at the National Anthropology Museum.
After suggesting a few days ago that security relations between the United States and Mexico could be better, Mr. Obama hardly mentioned the subject in his speech or in earlier remarks on Thursday, a sign the topic has given American officials plenty of headaches. Thousands of people have been killed in battles between Mexican drug gangs and the police and military, while the flow of cocaine and marijuana flourishes.
Business analysts have said Mexico's economy would be even further along without its violence. But investment has gone forward, and the economy is a sunnier subject over all; the United States is Mexico's largest trading partner and Mexico is the United States' third largest, behind Canada and China.
Poverty remains deep here. Mr. Peña Nieto acknowledged this week that three of five Mexicans scrape by on informal jobs and that wages have so stagnated that they are now lower than China's, contributing to a sense among the members of the public that they are not yet feeling ''Mexico's moment,'' as the government slogan would have it.
But a surge of investment in manufacturing, technology and other sectors has helped lift the middle class and consumer spending and contributed to growth levels in the national economy that have been double those of the United States in the past two years.
Still, economic and trade talks have caused plenty of friction and disagreements, too.
Mexican government officials, in private talks with Mr. Obama, homed in on long, costly waits for trucks and workers at the international border in both directions, but far more severe going into the United States.
The backups grew significantly with the United States security clampdown on the border after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and budget constraints and the political reality of the mood for tighter border security may inhibit building new or larger stations or adding manpower to them.
But senior administration and Mexican officials suggested public-private partnerships could finance renovations.
''There was certainly recognition on both sides that this is something that we need to focus on,'' said one senior United States official who participated in the meetings. ''It brings together the issue of border safety, border security, immigration and trade.''
Antonio Garza, a former American ambassador and now counsel in the Mexico City office of White & Case, said Mexican and American officials have long suggested building customs stations in Mexican territory away from the regular border crossings and other short-term fixes that would speed commerce.
''The discussion now is how can you take the level of commitment to security and apply it to making the border commerce more efficient?'' he said.
American officials said they expect such topics to be a priority of a new economic dialogue that is to begin this fall and include cabinet members, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and senior Mexican economic officials.
Analysts suggested high-profile talks about ways to improve trade and economic ties were a significant step and a recognition that the principal trade deal, the North American Free Trade Agreement, is in some ways outmoded at 20 years old.
Later Friday, Mr. Obama arrived in Costa Rica, where he was expected to take his message of promoting economic improvement and to attend a meeting of regional leaders on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Adding Evacuation Zones In Response to Hurricane

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration announced on Friday that it would double to six the number of evacuation zones along New York City's coast and expand them to include an additional 640,000 residents, saying that the new map would provide more flexibility when major storms hit.
The changes to the city's coastal storm plan were the most visible initiative to emerge from a report on the response to Hurricane Sandy prepared at Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's request. 
The report repeatedly praises city agencies and their state and federal counterparts, and acknowledges few if any significant missteps as government officials scrambled to respond to and recover from the severity of Hurricane Sandy, which killed 43 city residents and damaged thousands of homes.
''Over all, the response was very strong,'' said Caswell F. Holloway, the deputy mayor for operations, who oversaw the preparation of the report with Linda I. Gibbs, deputy mayor for health and human services. He said the point was to identify ways the city could do better, not to find fault.
''We were certainly not in a self-flagellation mode,'' Mr. Holloway said.
The new evacuation zones will bring to nearly three million the number of New Yorkers living in these areas. The city has roughly eight million residents.
Mr. Holloway declined to provide details on the new map until it is finished in June, but a preliminary version was included in the report released on Friday.
He and Ms. Gibbs said the city had to work on making evacuation orders more persuasive to residents who resist calls to leave their homes.
The extra evacuation zones should help with that, Mr. Holloway said, by making it possible to ''only dislocate the people who truly need to be dislocated, and ultimately give everybody even more confidence that the data they're getting, they should be acting upon.''
Many lessons learned from Hurricane Sandy will be set down in new ''playbooks'' for city agencies that had to learn on the fly how to deal with a major storm's aftermath: how to request waivers and extensions from federal school-lunch and food-stamp programs to serve a deluge of needy families; how to muster economic development programs to help battered businesses get back up to speed faster.
Others issues will be left to future task forces to interpret.
A number of smaller recommendations are already being acted on, like the purchase of more emergency lights, generators and small boats for firefighters.
The report also calls for new regulations for hospitals, nursing homes and adult homes during evacuations. It recommends the creation of a patient tracking system, better communication equipment and guidelines for the return of patients.
The report defends the city's decision not to evacuate health centers before Hurricane Sandy, emphasizing that the risks of evacuation were high and had to be weighed against the risks of the storm, which no one expected to be so severe.
The city and the state helped evacuate approximately 6,300 patients from 37 health care centers without a fatality, according to the report.
But it does not address the harrowing details of many of those evacuations, which were widely reported after the storm.
Two hospitals voluntarily evacuated before the storm. But NYU Langone Medical Center, Bellevue and Coney Island hospitals were forced to evacuate as the floodwaters rose and power faltered or failed.
At NYU Langone and Bellevue, gravely ill patients, including babies, had to be carried down darkened flights of stairs. Two patients remained at Bellevue for days in the flickering gloom of backup power because they were too ill to be evacuated with the rest.
Many nursing and adult homes were flooded and lost power, stranding residents without enough food or clothing, or waiting in buses while there was a scramble to find places that would accept them. Some families could not immediately find relatives. Some homes did not reopen for months.
While the report acknowledges that many hospitals, nursing and adult homes are in coastal areas where the flooding was worst, it does not directly address that geographic problem as a planning issue for the future.
City officials said they planned to issue a future report on infrastructure planning.

GRAPHIC: MAP: Seeking Flexibility During Storms: A report on Hurricane Sandy that was released by New York City on Friday included a preliminary map of expanded evacuation zones. It doubles the number of zones to six from three and now includes nearly three million residents, an increase of more than 600,000 people. A more detailed version of the map will be finished in June.

HEADLINE: Shooting His Own Foot

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
President François Hollande of France has recently been on a campaign to change the widely held perception that his administration is hostile to business. He has sounded more welcoming to foreign investment and has promised to lower capital gains taxes. But barely days into his charm offensive, one of Mr. Hollande's ministers was triumphantly claiming credit for preventing Yahoo from buying a controlling stake in a successful French online video streaming company, DailyMotion. 
The announcement by the minister for industrial renewal, Arnaud Montebourg, that DailyMotion was ''a golden nugget that needs to be preserved'' sends a terrible message to French entrepreneurs and foreign investors. It suggests that any French enterprise that achieves success can never be acquired by a foreign business.
Nations are understandably hostile to foreign acquisitions of businesses important to national security or critical infrastructure. But it is hard to think of what vital French interest would be compromised if Yahoo were to take a controlling stake in a video streaming service that allows users to watch clips from ''The Office.''
Mr. Montebourg seems to hold the mistaken notion that by keeping the ownership of DailyMotion in French hands he will encourage the development of a cluster of French Internet companies. Far from it. The experience of Silicon Valley suggests that companies and entrepreneurs succeed when they are free to work, merge and partner with the best and brightest from around the world.
Consider the example of Skype, the popular Internet phone service which is based in Luxembourg. It was started by Janus Friis, a Dane, and Niklas Zennstrom, a Swede. They sold their business to eBay, an American company, and went on to start and invest in numerous other companies.
The French economy is in a deep slump, with an unemployment rate of 11 percent in March, up from 10 percent a year earlier. It certainly doesn't need protectionist measures grounded in meaningless nationalism.

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and a look at the president&#8217;s weekly address, plus the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
Cecilia Muñoz, a longtime immigration activist, was denounced and called a traitor after she joined the Obama administration and defended its deportation policy, Michael D. Shear writes. But now, as President Obama becomes the first president in decades with a chance to get an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws through Congress, Ms. Muñoz's loyalty in the face of public criticism appears to have paid off.
 

        
The dearth of candidates for open Senate seats reflects what former and current senators say is a sad truth: the chamber, which was once considered an apex of national politics, is so riven by partisanship and gummed up by its own arcane rules, Jeremy W. Peters reports, that potential candidates from across the nation are loudly saying, "Thanks but no thanks."

        
A group of academics joined a gathering of former government and military officials in Washington this week to discuss their commitment to ending the government's "truth embargo" on the existence of extraterrestrial life, Andrew Siddons reports. The lawmakers were there in hopes that their presence and political credibility would be enough to persuade Congress to take the issue seriously.
 Weekly Address 

        
President Obama delivered this week's address from Mexico City, where he spoke about "working with our neighbors on our common security and our common prosperity." He said that Latin America presented an opportunity for him to expand on his top priority of creating jobs for the middle class. "One of the best ways to grow our economy is to sell more goods and services made in America to the rest of the world," he said. "That includes our neighbors to the south."

The president also discussed border security and the immigration legislation that has been introduced in the Senate. "This bill is a compromise, which means that nobody got everything they wanted - including me," he said. "It would modernize our legal immigration system so that we're able to reunite families and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers who will help create good-paying jobs for our economy."
 Happenings in Washington 

        
Samuel Winstead, a World War II Marine combat veteran, has been on a 350-mile biking journey called the Ride for Peace. He is scheduled to end the trip, which started on April 28 in Raleigh, N.C., in Lafayette Park in Washington on Saturday.

HIGHLIGHT: Pressure on Merkel; new star of Iraqi politics; JP Morgan Chase under scrutiny; and Robert Diamond after the Libor scandal. 

 BODY:
 NEWS Even as the United States economy displays unanticipated resilience, with a healthy jobs report released on Friday, the outlook for Europe's economy grows ever dimmer. As it does, the pressure builds on Europe's most powerful leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, and her economic team to find a way to get the Continent growing again. But this puts Ms. Merkel in a bind, as she has to answer to German voters in September when the country holds parliamentary elections. While the European economy may be deteriorating at an alarming rate, the electorate here is still enamored of her as the Iron Chancellor, advocating the austerity policies that are rapidly falling into disfavor elsewhere, among economists as well as the public. Nicholas Kulish reports from Berlin.
For Iraqis frustrated with poor services, sectarian politics and violence, the governor of Maysan Province, Ali Dwai, provides a rare example of democracy's potential. Mr. Dwai's popularity, though, reflects something more than excitement for a hard-working politician. As the only provincial governor of Mr. Sadr's political party, he represents the maturation of a grass-roots political movement that has sought to mimic Lebanon's Hezbollah by fusing Shiite faith, military strength and a concern for the common citizen to build political power. Tim Arango reports from Amara, Iraq. 
Government investigators have found that JPMorgan Chase devised "manipulative schemes" that transformed "money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers," and that one of its most senior executives gave "false and misleading statements" under oath. The findings appear in a confidential government document, reviewed by The New York Times, that was sent to the bank in March, warning of a potential crackdown by the regulator of the nation's energy markets. Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Ben Protess report from New York.
Ten months after being pushed out as chief executive of Barclays, Robert Diamond is trying to be something other than the "unacceptable face of banking." Despite all the headlines about his role running a bank at the heart of the Libor scandal, Mr. Diamond's role in the matter was minimal, and perhaps wildly overblown. Unlike other chief executives who have lost their jobs since the financial crisis, Mr. Diamond was not ousted by his company's board. He was pushed out by the British government - specifically by Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England.Andrew Ross Sorkin reports from New York.
A deteriorating economy in the European Union is expected to drive unemployment to new highs this year in countries including Spain and Portugal that already are feeling acute pain, the Union's top economics official warned on Friday. The new forecasts stood in stark contrast with figures from the United States on Friday that showed that more new jobs were created in April than expected, which pushed the unemployment rate to a four-year low. While American job creation is still slower than in a typical recovery, the new data could ease concerns of a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy. James Kanter reports from Brussels.
 ARTS Garry Winogrand, a photographer, refreshed classic street photography in the 1960s and '70s, influenced by (and influencing) the increasingly warped sensibility that had started to shape the broader culture. Using a snapshot style, he captured the nation's unseemly nervous breakdown in stark black and white. Since his death in 1984 at 56, though, Mr. Winogrand's reputation has waned. But one of the goals of an ambitious exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is to restore and clarify Winogrand's place in 20th-century photography, to offer viewers the chance to re-evaluate Winogrand's unruly and grand oeuvre. "Garry Winogrand," which runs in San Francisco through June 2, is the largest Winogrand retrospective ever mounted and the first major United States museum show of his work since 1988. It is scheduled to travel next year to the National Gallery of Art in Washington (which helped organize it), the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Jeu de Paume in Paris. Ted Loos reports.
 SPORTS With its systemic corruption, fractious leadership, an entrenched code of silence and some of its members recently embroiled in a high-profile drug trial, professional cycling these days often seems to resemble organized crime more than sport. Fitting, then, that the cycling world will gather in Naples on Saturday - not for Camorra-like clandestine meetings, but to start the Giro d'Italia, the three-week Grand Tour that signals the start of the sport's high season. Recent editions of the Giro have been short on star power, but organizers have managed to up the wattage considerably this year by attracting Bradley Wiggins, the defending Tour de France champion, to headline the 21-stage race that will span 3,405 kilometers, or 2,116 miles. John Brand reports.
The headline with an earlier version of this post misidentified the month as April.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Hathaway's 2013 Shareholder Meeting

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: DealBook is on the ground in Omaha to cover Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting, where tens of thousands of investors have gathered to listen to Warren E. Buffett speak 

 BODY:
 OMAHA - Even with the addition of a hedge fund manager meant to inject additional skepticism into Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, Warren E. Buffett managed to escape making big news here on Saturday.
An array of shareholders, reporters and analysts asked the Berkshire chief about a litany of topics, from the state of his company's insurance operations to the global economy, but Mr. Buffett dodged thornier issues about succession. 
Douglas A. Kass, the so-called "credentialed bear," asked pointed questions about what Berkshire would look like after the 82-year-old Mr. Buffett leaves. But both the Berkshire chief and his longtime business partner, Charles Munger, staunchly defended the company and what they said was a deeply ingrained culture that would endure. 
 4:53 P.M. | And We're Done 
The meeting has ended, with interesting questions but nothing new on important topics like succession. Thanks for following along!
 4:32 P.M. | The Boring Part of the Meeting 
After what was decidedly less than five minutes, Mr. Buffett moves into the scripted part of the meeting: the actual corporate governance portion. Only a fraction of shareholders are actually in their seats, as Mr. Buffett runs through matters like the election of directors.
Generally little happens, other than a smattering of shareholder proposals on issues like climate change.
 4:25 P.M. | Climate Change and Carbon Trading 
While there's a five-minute break, we'd like to catch up on an interesting exchange earlier in the Q.&A. Andrew asked a shareholder question about climate change, carbon trading and how both affect Berkshire.
Mr. Buffett began his answer with cracks about the warmer weather of recent years - despite the chilly Omaha rain falling outside - and how Mr. Munger knows more about science than he does, "which isn't saying a lot." That said, while Mr. Buffett appears to believe that climate change is real, he said that it's a difficult thing for Berkshire's insurance operations to account for.
Mr. Munger then added that he doesn't think much about carbon-trading schemes, calling them impractical. What actually seemed to work: the high taxes that European governments have levied on motor fuel. 
"I think they've stumbled into the right policy," he said. "I think the United States should have way higher taxes on motor fuel."
 4:22 P.M. | The Buffett Estate Planning Rulebook 
A shareholder and estate planning expert takes the mic. He says that many of his clients want to follow Mr. Buffett's plan to leave his children a significant sum of money, but donate most of his enormous wealth to charity.
"The idea is leave enough to do anything, but not enough to do nothing," the investor says. "How much is that?"
The audience laughs. Mr. Buffett responds that children's behavior is often more dictated by how their parents act rather than how big their inheritance is.
Mr. Munger demurs on answering the question, saying it's a bad idea to discuss one's will with one's children - if they will be treated unequally. 
 4:08 P.M. | The Perils of Social Media, Redux 
Mr. Buffett says he wouldn't make a good social media manager for Berkshire. Mr. Munger hates the idea of a system where the teens in his family can preserve their dumb comments for all eternity.
Continue on.
 4:04 P.M. | Munger's Sharp Words About Greece 
Munger: Letting Greece into the EU was a lot like using rat poison for whipping cream ... exceptionally stupid idea.
- Becky Quick (@beckyquickcnbc)4 May 13
Munger on Greece getting into the EU: They committed fraud ... they lied about their debt. #BRK2013
- Becky Quick (@beckyquickcnbc)4 May 13
 3:56 P.M. | Buffett's 'Unpaid Chief of Staff' Speaks 
During the Berkshire meeting's introductory movie, Mr. Buffett called upon a heretofore unknown aide to crack some heads and get some work done. Specifically, getting his agent, Michael Kives of CAA, to get him a role in the next "Terminator" movie.
That was Devon Spurgeon, a former reporter turned public relations specialist who was billed in the movie as his "unpaid chief of staff." (That's a wry reference to a joke card she has handed out from time to time. The telephone number: "You don't call me. I call you.")
What did Ms. Spurgeon have to say about her first Berkshire movie role, as Mr. Buffett's personal terminator? 
"I destroyed him," she told DealBook, speaking of the agent. "My powers of domination know no bounds."
 3:46 P.M. | Buffett Still Likes I.B.M. 
A shareholder asks if Mr. Buffett is still confident in Berkshire's stake in I.B.M. Does the tech giant have enough of a "moat," or defensive protections against competition?
Mr. Buffett, who surprised people when he first unveiled the stake two years ago, conceded that he doesn't understand I.B.M.'s moat as well as he does, say, Coca-Cola's. But he added: "I think the odds are good that their position will be strong over time."
He told CNBC on Friday that he "won't be a seller," but isn't hasn't bought more I.B.M. shares following the company's recent earnings miss.
That said, he professed some concern about how I.B.M. essentially was a big annuity company on the side, owing to its big pension obligations. 
 3:33 P.M. | Questioning the Credentials of Mr. Buffett's Son 
Mr. Kass is up, and he asks a tough question: what makes Mr. Buffett's son, Howard, qualified to be Berkshire's next nonexecutive chairman? Howard Buffett hasn't run a business and doesn't have significant investing experience. (For what it's worth, the Berkshire bear notes that his own son is in the audience.)
"Other than accident of birth, how is he qualified?" Mr. Kass asks.
Mr. Buffett replies that his son won't be running Berkshire; he's meant to safeguard the company's culture. If a chief executive doesn't work out, having a chairman who cares deeply about the conglomerate's culture will make fixing the problem much easier.
 3:30 P.M. | Dodging the Succession Question Again 
Andrew asks about Ajit Jain, the highly praised head of Berkshire's reinsurance operations, and asks a) if the executive will take over for Mr. Buffett as chief executive and b) what will happen to those businesses if he leaves.
Mr. Buffett dodges the first question, obviously. And both he and Mr. Munger professed hope that Mr. Jain will stay as long as possible.
 3:24 P.M. | A Thinly Disguised Pitch? 
A shareholder asks how a budding investor in his 20s can convince people to invest in his partnership when he doesn't have much of a track record.
"Well, you haven't sold me," Mr. Buffett quips.
More seriously, he encourages young people to start building track records as early as possible. In picking Mr. Weschler and Mr. Combs, he says, "we looked for a record we could both believe and understand."
 3:17 P.M. | Trying to Beat the Index 
A shareholders asks if buying shares in the 20 best companies in the United States would be better than investing in an index fund.
Mr. Buffett replies that the results would probably be similar. Then he launches into a bigger point: there are professional investors, and then there are amateurs who invest. Being the former requires a lot of work and research, which many, many amateurs don't have the time or inclination to do.
The main problem for most people, he says, is "trying to behave like a professional when you aren't spending the time in the game needed to be a professional."
 3:04 P.M. | Buffett on Politics 
A fiery partisan question, part of which complained about the trillions of dollars in debt incurred under the Obama administration, draws an even-keeled response from Mr. Buffett.
Part of that reply involves a jab at the Bush administration, which Mr. Buffett says also racked up debt. And the Berkshire chief says that he is glad the response to the economic downturn hasn't been austerity, which would have hindered any sort of recovery. (Mr. Munger, who's more conservative than his friend, nonetheless agrees.)
But Mr. Buffett does praise the prior president, pointing out in particular 10 words of wisdom from the financial crisis: "if money doesn't loosen up, this sucker could go down." And the response to the financial crisis involved good work from leaders of both parties, which helped avoid more pain than the country otherwise has suffered.
So while the national debt remains troublingly high, Mr. Buffett says, "this isn't the country's toughest hour by a large margin."
 3:00 P.M. | Kass Issues a Challenge 
It's Mr. Kass' turn, and he comes up with a query that he concedes is part pitch. While Mr. Buffett is no fan of short-selling, or actively betting against stocks in the hopes that they will sink in price, the practice has proved useful.
In fact, Mr. Kass contends, it has proved so successful that even Mr. Combs had done well as an investor. To which Mr. Munger responded, "He had so much success that he stopped doing it," getting big laughs from the audience.
Undeterred, the Berkshire bear persisted: Would Mr. Buffett then consider investing $100 million in a managed account at Mr. Kass' firm, with the earned proceeds going toward charity?
Mr. Munger curtly says "No," before Mr. Buffett elaborates than in Berkshire's early days, the company tried its hand at short-selling.
The end of the discussion showed the two Berkshire buddies of same mind:
 Mr. Munger: We don't like trading agony for money
 Mr. Buffett: But we wish you well!
 2:46 P.M. | A Big Move for Munger? No, Thanks 
A shareholder asks Mr. Munger, who lives in the Los Angeles area, if he'd ever consider moving back to his hometown of Omaha. 
In his usual fashion, Mr. Munger is brief in his reply: "No."
Mr. Buffett adds that their current partnership works. "While we're somewhat technophobic, we've learned how to use the phone," he cracks, getting a number of laughs.
 2:39 P.M. | Berkshire Stays Grounded, When It Comes to Airlines 
Ms. Quick of CNBC passes along a question from Bill Miller, the famous portfolio manager at Legg Mason. Are the improved economics of the airline industry likely to stay, and would Berkshire ever consider adding another airline to its fleet, supplementing NetJets?
The second part is easy to answer for Mr. Buffett: "No."
The first part gets a bit more explanation. 
The airline industry has this situation where they have very, very low incremental costs with enormous fixed costs. And the temptation to sell that last seat at a very low price is very high.
It's a labor-intensive, capital-intensive, largely commodity-type business.
It's been a death trap for investors ever since Orville took off.
 2:38 P.M. | A Literary Note 
If you ask Mr. Buffett what his 10 favorite books are, he'll spend most of the time praising Ben Graham, his longtime hero and investing model. And then won't really list any other books.
 2:28 P.M. | A Question About Underwear 
Yes, really.
Mr. Brandt asks a question about underwear - luckily not, as Mr. Buffett quipped, "boxers or briefs?" - and specifically about Fruit of the Loom. With rising competition, how does Berkshire's company protect its market share?
Here's what Mr. Buffett had to say:

        
Keep your costs down and constantly work on brand-building
        
Make sure your main customers in turn have their customers happy with the product
 2:13 P.M. | 'The Passion Is Not Gone, I Promise You' 
We're back from lunch, and Mr. Kass leads off with a question about whether Mr. Buffett's intensity has waned over the years. He specifically cites the weeks of work that Berkshire put into research American Express at the time of its first investment, versus the quick decision-making that went into its move into Bank of America. (Mr. Buffett famously hit upon the latter idea while in the bathtub.)
"Are you at the point now where the game interests you more than the score?" Mr. Kass asks.
Mr. Buffett responds that he still finds running Berkshire the most interesting thing he could possibly do. 
"I have every bit of the intensity, though it's not manifested in the same way," he says. "I love thinking about Berkshire, about its investments, about its businesses. It's a part of me."
Mr. Munger interjects that Berkshire needed to do an enormous amount of analysis for its first investment in American Express, since the company was unfamiliar at the time. When it made a subsequent investment, Mr. Buffett had already amassed a wealth of knowledge.
"It was all cumulative," Mr. Munger said.
Responding to a later question, Mr. Buffett comes back to the Bank of America decision. "The bathtub wasn't the most important part," he jokes.
 1:13 P.M. | Lunchtime 
The shareholders in the CenturyLink Center have dispersed for lunch, and so too will DealBook. Back around 1 p.m.
 1:07 P.M. | Buffett Gloats in Bet Against Hedge Funds 
In case you're keeping score, Mr. Buffett's ahead in a bet with hedge funds over the performance of the S.&P. 500 versus a fund of funds. It's five years into a 10-year bet, with $1 million for charity at stake.
 1:06 P.M. | Dodd-Frank's Limited Impact on Berkshire 
Andrew is up with a question about the Dodd-Frank banking rules that may impinge on bank profitability. What will that mean for Berkshire's investments in firms like Wells Fargo?
Mr. Buffett - who first razzes Andrew for prefacing the question by asking if Berkshire is "too big to fail" - says that the bank investments will still generate a decent return, if lower than in previous years. Returns on tangible equity certainly will go down.
But the types of firms that Berkshire has invested in, including US Bancorp and M&T Bank, are pursuing sound policies that makes them less likely to be affected.
Mr. Buffett adds that he believes banks will not be behind capitalism's next bubble. Mr. Munger isn't so sure:
I do not see why massive derivative books should be mixed up with insured deposits.
That skeptical line draws applause from the crowd.
 12:48 P.M. | Warren and Women 
Susan Tilson, who identifies herself as a Berkshire shareholder (and is married to hedge fund manager and Buffett devotee Whitney Tilson) asks Mr. Buffett about opportunities for women. 
Mr. Buffett, who recently penned an essay on the topic for Fortune, says that while a lot has improved for women, much more progress needs to be made. He has said that he is a fan of "Lean In," the recent treatise by Facebook president Sheryl Sandberg. 
"They're crumbling to a very significant degree, and they should," Mr. Buffett says of the obstacles facing women's advancement. 
"The country has come a long way," he adds. "It continues to move in the right direction, but I hope it continues to move faster."
 12:44 P.M. | Rising Competitive Pressure in Insurance 
Mr. Gallant of Nomura asks Mr. Buffett about increased competition in the insurance field, especially reinsurance.
Mr. Buffett replies that the entrance of hedge funds into the field has been impressive. Behind the move, he said, was the ability of these investment firms to cut costs by selling off some of the risk to investors.
"Anything wall street can sell, it will sell," he says.
That said, Berkshire will hold fast to what it believes are appropriate prices for its products. It will not bow to pressure to do "dumb things."
 12:32 P.M. | The Benefits of Where and When Someone's Born 
In response to a shareholder's question, Mr. Buffett acknowledges that he benefited from being born in the United States in the early 20th century. (In fact, he spends a little bit of time talking about his conception, which isn't at all weird.)
But the fundamental point is that even as Mr. Buffett has done well by being born when and where he was, future generations will do even better, with more opportunities becoming more available.
 12:20 P.M. | Should Berkshire Be Broken Up? 
Mr. Kass, the Berkshire bear, prefaces his next question by saying, "When you are gone, and we hope that's not for a long time ..." to which Mr. Buffett quickly quips, "No one more than I."
Now, Mr. Kass' question. Should Berkshire, which may very well become more centralized under Mr. Buffett's successor, consider a break-up at some point to reduce an unwieldy complexity?
Mr. Buffett begins by saying that there will likely be very little change to how Berkshire is currently run, including its decentralized system. The conglomerate is actually easy to oversee now, since its managers are good and the overall cash being generated helps the parent company as a whole.

 12:14 P.M. | Buffett's Newspaper Deals 
Andrew asks a question about Berkshire's newspaper buying spree. Why buy into an industry that's dying, in what seems like a money-losing proposition?
Mr. Buffett insists that the papers Berkshire has purchased will generate "a decent rate of return." Key to that, he says, is that pays a low price and anticipates earnings to decline over time. Investment bankers pitching newspaper deals, on the other hand, constantly project that such companies will see a lift in profits.
He concedes that the industry is a rare break from Berkshire's deal-making playbook. Mr. Munger helpfully summarizes his partner's position this way: "It's an exception, and you like doing it."
 12:08 P.M. | A Fixation on Progressive's Snapshot Offering 
Clifford Galant of Nomura asks the meeting's latest question about Progressive's "Snapshot" product, which tracks how drivers behave to help determine rates. It's something that Geico won't follow.
Mr. Buffett again defends his subsidiary's practice, calling the company the best in the business. "If I were starting in the direct-auto insurance business, I'd copy Geico," he says. It wouldn't work, but it's a good start.
 12:05 P.M. | More on Weschler and Combs 
Buffett says his lieutenants Todd & Ted "do not check w/me" before they make investments. "they have bought things i wouldn't buy." #trust
- Andrew Ross Sorkin (@andrewrsorkin)4 May 13
 12:01 P.M. | Supervising Berkshire's Investment Chiefs 
Ms. Quick passes along a question about his two investment management chiefs, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. Mr. Buffett says that he doesn't supervise them particularly heavily, giving them free reign to make their own decisions.
The only restrictions they truly face are of the technical variety; for instance, American Express, in which Berkshire already owns a 13.8 percent stake, is off limits because of federal bank holding rules.
 11:58 A.M. | Question Casts Spotlight on Burlington Northern 
A shareholder question about Burlington Northern's moves into transporting oil products provides an opening for the railroad chief to speak directly.
The executive, Matthew Rose, details how his company is setting up positions in oil-rich drilling locations like the Bakken shale formation. Burlington Northern is in negotiations to add about 30 stations in the region, he says. 
 11:52 A.M. | Defining Berkshire 
Ms. Loomis of Fortune asks a question on behalf of a shareholder in the audience: How would you explain Berkshire and its value premise to the investor's 13-year-old daughter?
Mr. Munger takes first crack as Mr. Buffett helps himself to some See's Candy fudge: "We like to stay sane while others go crazy. That's a competitive advantage." He also notes that the company tries to be a good steward to its subsidiaries and a good partner.
"This was a very good idea," he says drolly. "I wish we'd done it on purpose."
 11:46 A.M. | Berkshire and Multi-Level Marketing 
Andrew notes the fight between William A. Ackman, the hedge fund manager (and Berkshire shareholder) and Herbalife, the nutritional supplements company that relies on "multi-level marketing," a direct marketing tool built upon recruiting layers of sales representatives. 
Does that battle trouble Mr. Buffett, since Berkshire owns a so-called M.L.M. as well, the kitchen supplies company Pampered Chef?
Mr. Buffett replies that the ultimate test is whether there's a market for the goods being sold. And in the case of Pampered Chef, he says, there's no question that there is.
 11:45 A.M. | Buffett's Halo 
Mr. Kass uses his next turn to ask whether Mr. Buffett's successor will be able to benefit from the Oracle of Omaha's imprimatur to strike the same sort of value-generating deals that Berkshire currently strikes.
Mr. Buffett replies that the unnamed individual will certainly have a lot more money to deploy. And Berkshire will remain the refuge to which distressed companies, like Goldman Sachs and General Electric, will flock:
"They will call Berkshire. And Berkshire's reputation will become only more solidified for providing capital in sound deals, when other people are frozen. When it happens when I'm not around, it will become more tied to the Berkshire brand."
Mr. Buffett notes that Berkshire will still have both the capital and the willingness to act decisively, a point with which Mr. Munger agrees.
 11:38 A.M. | Buffett on Bitcoin 
A shareholder asks Mr. Buffett about Bitcoin, the digital currency that was on the tip of everyone's tongues a few weeks ago.
Here's what the Berkshire duo had to say:
Mr. Munger: i have no comment whatsoever on Bitcoin being some kind of universal currency.
Mr. Buffett: Of our $49 billion, we haven't moved anything into Bitcoin.
 11:29 A.M. | Buffett Backs Bernanke 
Mr. Buffett discusses the current state of the Federal Reserve's moves to keep lending flowing by pushing rates low. 
The Berkshire chief says that he backs the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and notes that the policy hasn't led to inflation. That might actually be a little bad for the government as a debtor, he adds.
But still, interest rates will rise, and it will be a "shot heard around the world."
A separate question from Ms. Quick: How does the policy affect Berkshire's companies? Mr. Buffett notes how asset prices have risen because of the abundance of cheap debt, as well as lowering the costs for a deal like the Heinz takeover.
"This is like watching a good movie, as far as I'm concerned," he says, "because I don't know how it will end."
He adds more soberly that both Berkshire and the country have benefited from the easy money policy. "If they can successfully pull off a reversal," he says, "we will be better off."
 11:27 A.M. | Berkshire's Freaky Friday 
Responding to a shareholder's question, Mr. Munger surprisingly takes the first crack at an answer.
Mr. Buffett steals his partner's longtime line: "I have nothing to add."
 11:23 A.M. | A Berkshire Reorganization? 
Right now, Berkshire's companies operate relatively autonomously. Is that going to be different under new leadership?
"My successor won't do things identically, but things won't dramatically change," Mr. Buffett says.
 11:17 A.M. | Corporate America and Taxes 
Mr. Buffett addresses the issue of American companies complaining about the corporate tax rate, noting that businesses have been improving profitability while employment of individuals has lagged. Much of that is because corporate tax rates are lower now.
"It will be interesting to see whether these levels can be maintained," he says. "That's going to be a subject of a lot of public discourse."
Mr. Munger rebuts that other countries are lowering their tax rates, leaving American companies are at a disadvantage. He thinks individuals should pay more, while corporations less.
Mr. Buffett jokes that his partner's clearly the Republican and he the Democrat.
 11:10 A.M. | The Berkshire Bear's Debut 
Now up to the plate: Seabreeze Partners Management's Douglas Kass, who reiterates that he feels honored to be "Daniel in the lion's den."
He asks whether Buffett, which has grown so big that it now hunts for "elephants," not "gazelles," and that its acquisitions are pricier and less at a discount than in the past. Is Berkshire in danger of becoming more like an index fund?
Mr. Buffett says that while there's no question that Berkshire won't have as much growth as it has in the past, it will still continue to generate tremendous value. 
Mr. Munger adds that he expects the conglomerate to outperform its forebears in the world of big business. "We think we'll do better than the giants of the past," he says.
Mr. Buffett cheerily ends with a challenge to Mr. Kass: "You haven't convinced me to sell the stock, but keep trying!"
 11:02 A.M. | Berkshire in an Age of Social Media 
DealBook's own Andrew Ross Sorkin touches on a recent Buffett breakthrough: his debut on Twitter. There's a more business-oriented reason behind the query, Andrew says, since the Securities and Exchange Commission recently clarified that companies can use social media to publish information.
What are the ramifications for Business Wire, the press release wire that Berkshire owns? 
After first joking that he's not entirely sure why he's on Twitter, Mr. Buffett more soberly discusses his concerns about the S.E.C.'s initiative. He fears that the guiding principle of companies alerting all investors at the same time might be lost.
"I do not want to keep heading up to their Web page and hoping I'm not 10 seconds behind everybody," he says. 
He adds that he has no intention of selling Business Wire.
Mr. Munger drolly adds that he keeps away from Twitter "like the plague."
 10:52 A.M. | Breaking Down the Heinz Deal 
Becky Quick of CNBC relates a question from a Minnesota shareholder who asks about a recent piece about the H. J. Heinz takeover, in which the common share portion of the deal was regarded as "dead money."
Mr. Buffett strongly contests the premise. He praised Berkshire's partner in the deal, 3G Capital, and in particular the Brazilian billionaire who oversees the firm, Jorge Paulo Lemann. 
Berkshire is essentially lending to 3G through the use of preferred shares, increasing leverage and hopefully amplifying the investment returns from the transaction. But Mr. Buffett also expects the value of Heinz to grow quickly under its new ownership.
While the price was a little higher than Berkshire might have paid on its own, he adds, "It's absolutely a fair deal. i didn't have to change a word on the term sheet or the governance."
"If anyone thinks that the common is dead money, I think they're making a mistake, but we'll find out in five years," Mr. Buffett says.
 10:46 A.M. | What Will Worry Buffett After He Leaves? 
A shareholder from Chicago asks, What will worry Mr. Buffett the most about the decade after he finally leaves the company?
Mr. Buffett says that the key will be to preserve Berkshire's culture, as well as having a successor as chief executive who will have more passion, brains and energy than even he has.
He reiterates that the board has already identified that person. "We're solidly in agreement as to whom that individual should be," he said.
 10:43 A.M. | Spelling Out the Benefits of IMC 
The first question from the analysts comes from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, whom Mr. Buffett says first tangled with the Oracle of Omaha over games of chess as a child years ago. Mr. Brandt asks what the advantages of IMC, which Berkshire now fully controls, has over competitors.
Mr. Buffett replies, "The advantage it has is brains," before launching into an encomium of the Wertheimer family that founded the industrial parts maker. 
 10:38 A.M. | Explaining Berkshire's Relative Underperformance 
The first question comes from Fortune's Ms. Loomis, who relays a query from a shareholder in Texas. Why does Mr. Buffett use book value per share, and will that figure continue to lag the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, as it has the past several years?
Mr. Buffett says that the past decade has generally been rough for business. That said, if the market continues to rally as it has this year, Berkshire will suffer its first five-year period of trailing the S.&P. 500. 
"It won't be a happy day, but it won't discourage us," he said. He added as a caveat that the company is likely to outperform the market in down years.
Mr. Munger adds that he's not worried, professing a belief that the company will do well in the long run.
 10:26 A.M. | Running Through Berkshire's Latest Earnings 
Mr. Buffett discusses his conglomerate's earnings for the first quarter, which he described as "benign" for its core insurance businesses and great for the rest of the company's holdings.
Net income for the quarter rose over 50 percent, to $4.89 billion. Operating income, which Mr. Buffett prefers to focus on, jumped 42 percent, to $3.78 billion.
Over all, Berkshire's Class A shares now trade at $162,904, a new record. And Mr. Buffett proudly said that the company is now the fifth-biggest publicly traded company in the world, by market value.
 10:22 A.M. | Buffett Takes the Stage 
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger finally take their seats on the dais. "Whew, I'm worn out," he jokes, before thanking the people who put together the introductory movie.
One of the people he thanks is Carrie Sova, the Berkshire staffer who organizes the conference. He notes that Ms. Sova is both four months pregnant and just earned her master's of business administration.
 10:21 A.M. | Celebrating Berkshire's Managers 
Surprisingly, disco balls drop down, and a modified version of "YMCA" starts pumping through the CenturyLink Center's speakers as Berkshire calls out the managers of its portfolio companies.
 10:13 A.M. | Buffett Breaks, Bad 
Berkshire takes a huge step into cultural relevancy with a skit based on "Breaking Bad," with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul reprising their roles as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. Instead of cooking up meth, however, the drug-dealing duo opts to focus on peanut brittle.
"What we sacrifice in profit margins," White says in his inimitable growl, "we make up for in decreased risk."
That is, until a hatted Mr. Buffett shows up, proclaiming himself the competition. White first sniffs, "Are you Father Time?" before acknowledging that his new adversary is the Oracle of Omaha who can see into the future.
"Like a wizard?" Pinkman asks earnestly.
Mr. Buffett offers to buy the two out, leading to an intense stare-off with tropes familiar to "Breaking Bad" fans. (A declaration of names is involved.) But White and Pinkman back down and agree to sell, prompting Mr. Buffett to call Mr. Munger to notify him that a deal is done.
Sitting back in his chair, Mr. Munger haughtily proclaims, "Brittle, bitches." 
 10:05 A.M. | The Sobering Salomon Clip 
As has happened every year, Mr. Buffett has grounded the giddiness of the Berkshire annual meeting with a clip of his testifying before Congress about the scandal at Salomon Brothers years ago. It cuts down the levity brought on by Geico ads and sitcom clips.
Mr. Buffett again warns in the clip: "Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless."
 9:59 A.M. | Terminating Hollywood Dreams 
We turn to another clip, starting with Mr. Munger reading The Wall Street Journal and then a secretary reading The New York Times. Mr. Munger picks up his phone and calls Mr. Buffett, who happens to be reading ... Variety.
The Oracle of Omaha blows off questions about the Dow Jones industrial average and Apple's cash hoard, in order to pester his agent about playing the villain in the next "Terminator" movie. When the agent, Michael Kives of CAA, demurs, Mr. Buffett sends his "unpaid chief of staff," Devon Spurgeon of Hill & Knowlton, to break some heads.
Sufficiently intimidated, Mr. Kives calls Arnold Schwarzenegger, who quickly deems the notion "the stupidest idea" he's ever heard. But he comes up with a better one, after watching an old clip from "The Office": calling on Mr. Munger. 
 9:48 A.M. | A New Entrant Into the Berkshire Introduction 
A clip from "The King of Queens" plays, with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller arguing over a bottle of Heinz ketchup. Or is it "catsup"? Hilarity ensues. 
 9:42 A.M. | Geico Brings the Laughs Again 
It's a Geico commercial, featuring an obnoxious camel loudly asking his coworkers what day it is. One finally, reluctantly concedes that it's "Hump Day." The CenturyLink Center crowd cheers.
 9:39 A.M. | An Appearance From Jon Stewart 
Well, not live. It's a rebroadcast of Mr. Buffett's appearance on "The Daily Show" last fall alongside Carol Loomis of Fortune, the Berkshire chief's longtime friend and collaborator on the company's annual letter.
Among the clips selected is Mr. Buffett commenting on Washington, and how difficult it is to get things done.
 9:31 A.M. | Dancing With the Brands 
The movie has started and leads off with the animated segment. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger have been drafted as judges on "Dancing With the Stars." 
A procession of Berkshire brand representatives - the Geico gekko, Dairy Queen's queen, IMC's Eitan Wertheimer - show off their moves. Only the judges aren't impressed, instead playing Words With Friends or hula-hooping it up.
An exasperated Tom Bergeron asks if the judges can do better. "We thought you'd never ask," Mr. Munger boasts, before the two break out into Psy's "Gangnam Style." The crowd at the CenturyLink arena lets loose a cheer.
 9:27 A.M. | The V.I.P.'s Have Arrived 
Notice a big crowd at the head of the CenturyLink Center floor? That's all the shareholders craning to take pictures of the V.I.P. guests and Berkshire board members who've arrived. Among them is Bill Gates, who earlier partook in his usual newspaper-tossing contest with Mr. Buffett.
 9:21 A.M. | It's Movie Trailer Guy 
One of the traditions of the Berkshire meeting, a booming announcement from a beloved movie trailer narrator, lets shareholders that it's 10 minutes before movie time.
 9:19 A.M. | Product Placement 
If you're an exhibitor at the Berkshire meeting, the thinking must go, you have to display the likeness of the Oracle of Omaha very prominently.
A stroll through the exhibit hall reveals all manner of Buffett-related memorabilia, from the expected T-shirts (one model at the BH Media outpost was emblazoned with Mr. Buffett praising Omaha) to the more, shall we say, unusual (a pair of Fruit of the Loom "Berky" boxers featuring the cartoon likenesses of Mr. Buffett and Charlie Munger).
All were in fairly high demand.

HEADLINE: Does Class Size Count?

BYLINE: SARA MOSLE


HIGHLIGHT: Teacher quality affects learning. So do overcrowded classrooms. 

 BODY:
As states cut education budgets in response to the nation's continuing economic woes, student-to-teacher ratios are again on the rise after decades of decline. This resurrects an age-old debate in American education: does class size really matter?
To many educators, the answer seems obvious: Teachers who have fewer students can give each child more attention and tailored instruction. And parents agree. For years, annual surveys conducted by the New York City Department of Education have shown that the top priority of school parents is reducing class size, far outpacing "more effective leadership," "more teacher training," "more or better art programs," "more challenging courses" and both "more preparation for state tests" and "less preparation for state tests." 
But the data on class size is not conclusive, if only because, in the last quarter-century, there's been just one proper randomized, controlled study in the United States to measure, at sufficient scale, the effect of smaller and larger classes on student achievement. Known as Project STAR, it found that smaller classes do produce lasting gains, especially for economically disadvantaged and minority-group students.
Hiring more teachers, however, is expensive, and some researchers and policy makers insist that reducing class size is not cost-effective, compared with other possible reforms, and has been oversold to schools. They point to states like California and Florida that have spent billions of taxpayer dollars to reduce pupil-to-teacher ratios without, they argue, a commensurate increase in student performance.
Diverse figures including Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Bill Gates have coalesced around a new idea: why not increase class sizes for the best teachers and use the resulting budgetary savings to pay these best teachers more and to help train educators who need improvement? Yes, each class might be bigger on average but at least each child would stand a better chance of having a great teacher, which would-be reformers say is more important.
The proposal is intriguing, and some teachers may be on board. Matthew Chingos, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, has cited a national survey by the journal Education Next and Harvard's Program on Education Policy and Governance that found that 42 percent of teachers would gladly accept a $10,000 raise to forgo a three-student reduction in class size. Yet perhaps more striking, 47 percent of teachers said they would turn down this substantial pay increase to have just three students fewer in class. It's unclear if the teachers who want the extra money are the same ones schools hope to retain and reward. But the bigger problem is that class size is already increasing while there still isn't a mechanism to identify top-flight teachers and offer them more students for more pay; nor is there any assurance that parents, given a choice, would embrace these larger classes for their children.
In addition, while the idea is conceivable at the elementary level, where a single teacher typically teaches all subjects and most schools have several teachers per grade, it's harder to picture in many junior high or high schools, which may have only one chemistry or American history teacher. Also, how would distinctions between average and exceptional teachers affect collaboration, and how frequently would these ratings be revised? Upending salaries and teachers' schedules every year could destabilize schools.
Once you start to think about how the plan would play out, it begins to seem fantastical. Certainly, any widespread implementation is years away. Meanwhile, students will continue to languish in ever larger classes.
So here's a proposal for getting past this familiar stalemate: Secretary Duncan, Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Gates and other teacher-quality advocates should agree to fight - hard - to keep class sizes small for a limited population of at-risk students. That way economically disadvantaged and minority-group students, who Project STAR undeniably proved can benefit most from low student-to-teacher ratios, won't have to suffer through larger classes while waiting for better teachers.
In return, advocates of reducing class size agree to support pilot programs for creating more-students-for-more-pay classrooms to see if the plan has any takers among everyday teachers and parents and whether this theory actually works and is cost-effective in the real world.
I don't think either side is likely to be satisfied with this compromise, but both might have something to gain. Secretary Duncan, Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Gates need to develop more grass-roots support among parents who distrust many of their reform ideas and who continue to believe that class size counts. Parents would most likely find it reassuring if reformers demonstrated a willingness to phase in such changes only after test districts have demonstrated their effectiveness.
At the same time, education budgets are contracting, and the number of students per teacher is probably going up nationwide no matter what. Organizations like Parents Across America, which has lobbied for indiscriminate and far more costly across-the-board reductions in class size, might help preserve smaller classes for those children who most need them and would demonstrate their willingness to experiment with innovation. One class size need not fit all.

HEADLINE: Sunday Breakfast Menu, May 5

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Warren E. Buffett, President Obama and discussions about Syria and Boston dominate the Sunday shows. 

 BODY:
With April's jobs report easing concerns about an economic slowdown, Warren E. Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, joins ABC's "This Week" to share his thoughts on the economy.
In addition, the program will have a roundtable discussion on the president's first 100 days of his second term with James Carville, Democratic strategist; Mary Matalin, Republican strategist; Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation and former South Carolina senator; and Bill Richardson, the former New Mexico governor.
As the debate in Washington intensifies over how to handle the civil war in Syria and with Israel's airstrike on Thursday, Representative Darrell Issa of California, chairman of the oversight committee; Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, chairman of the Intelligence Committee; and Representative C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, will join CBS's "Face the Nation." The program will feature a segment on gay athletes in professional sports. 
President Obama gave interviews to Univision's "Al Punto" and Telemundo's "Enfoque" during his trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. The programs will air at 10 a.m. Eastern and noon Eastern, respectively, offering his perspectives on trade, border security and immigration. Univision will also have an interview with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, about his meeting with Mr. Obama.
As the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings continues, NBC's "Meet the Press" features a discussion on national security with Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the F.B.I.; Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor; Jane Harman, the former ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; and Representative Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
CNN's "State of the Union" talks to Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, about this week's hearing on the bombings in Boston, as well as a panel on radicalization. Also, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat and a member of the bipartisan group that proposed legislation to overhaul the immigration system, will talk about the push for reform on immigration and guns.
After the F.B.I. released photos Wednesday of men wanted for questioning in the September attacks on a United States diplomatic mission and C.I.A. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, two members of the House oversight committee will join "Fox News Sunday" to talk about the continuing search for answers: Representatives Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, and Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts.
In addition, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee and a member of the so-called Gang of Eight, will weigh in on several issues, including Syria, immigration and Benghazi.
Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, and William E. Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., are among the guests on TV One's "Washington Watch" at 11 a.m. Eastern. They will discuss the effects of the broad, automatic spending cuts known as sequestration on the African-American community.
On Bloomberg's "Capitol Gains" at noon Eastern, Charles F. Bolden Jr., the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, will share how sequestration will halt space launches in the United States and increase the agency's reliance on Russia.
Representative Jeff Miller of Florida, chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, will talk about the challenges facing veterans, including the backlog of disability claims, on C-Span's "Newsmakers."
Richard G. Lugar, the former ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser in the Carter administration, joined Bloomberg's "Political Capital" on Friday, talking about the situation in Syria, tensions with China and Mr. Obama's foreign policy. The program will be repeated over the weekend.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths MAHONEY, WILLIAM P

 BODY:
MAHONEY--William P. "Bill" Of New Canaan CT, died April 30 at the age of 55 years following a brief illness. He was born in Portland, ME on October 24, 1957 to William D. and Ellen Marie (Lucas) Mahoney, the eldest son and second of five children. He graduated from South Portland High School in 1976 and received a bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science from Boston College in 1980. In the mid-1980s Bill moved to New York, where he pursued his interest in business and finance. 
In 1993 he relocated to Sydney, Australia and worked in funds management at Bankers Trust Australia, where he went on to serve as Executive Vice President and Head of Business Development for BT Funds Management, LTD, and was a Managing Director of Bankers Trust Company. In 1998 he returned to the United States and was an equity partner at Bridgewater Associates, LP, where he was Executive Director of Business Development. During his tenure, Bridgewater Associates became the largest hedge fund in the United States. He left Bridgewater in 2007 and founded MBRO Capital, LLC, a private investment partnership which specialized in real estate investment and provided capital to start-up and early stage businesses. As managing member of MBRO, Bill pursued investments in novel and socially conscious businesses. He was an early and generous supporter of President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, traveling throughout the country encouraging others to support Mr. Obama's promising agenda. He served on the national finance committee for the presidential campaign, and was a major supporter of the inaugural activities of 2009 and 2013. Bill married Alice Bartlett in 1993, and they have two daughters, Josephine and Virginia. Of Bill's many accomplishments in life, none gave him greater joy than his family. With Alice and the girls he traveled the world, climbed several of the world's tallest mountains, pursued philanthropic interests, and was an unforgettable friend to many around the world. He was the best man in eight weddings. Dozens claimed that he was their best friend. Bill often said that he wished to be remembered simply as one who valued and practiced simple human kindness. His generosity was unrivaled, and he never gave expecting recognition or even thanks. Instead, he gave with the understanding that the recipient would accept the gift with the obligation to use it to make a better life for himself or another. His philanthropy offered opportunity and fostered independence. Having been raised on the Maine coast, Bill never got the sea out of his blood. He and his family spent summers at Watch Hill, RI, in a home which he designed and furnished. He was in his element at the helm of his boat, "Platypus," navigating the New England coast with family and friends. Giving back and sharing their good fortune was extremely important to Bill and Alice. Their many charitable interests include educational foundations, scholarship opportunities for underprivileged students, the Wounded Warrior Campaign, international relief agencies, and many others. Bill expressed a wish that memorial contributions be made in his name to the Blossom Hill Foundation and to Reach Prep. Services will be private. A celebration of life is planned for early June.

HEADLINE: Go the Same Way, or Go the Wrong Way

BYLINE: By LEE SIEGEL

 BODY:
Not long ago, a friend of mine, a dear man with exquisite taste, took me to dinner at Momofuku Má Pêche in Midtown Manhattan. I point out his taste because, being from out of town, he chose the restaurant on the fly, based on some reviews he had read on Yelp, the social networking site that rates everything from eating establishments to vacuum cleaners to gastroenterologists. The supertrendy place had gotten some raves.
Now, if I had the same experience with a gastroenterologist I had chosen based on glowing Yelp evaluations as I did at Momofuku, I would be checking myself into the emergency room.
My monkfish -- a special favorite of the Yelp hordes -- tasted like a pencil eraser. It was also so cold that it could not be described as cooked. It was deceased. 
As for the destination-place atmosphere, imagine the decibel level of a Justin Bieber concert as filmed by Leni Riefenstahl. The service was haute rude. Our waitress responded to my timid questions about the oysters with a pseudopopulist arrogance that implied I was both hopelessly out of touch with the everyday experience of fishermen and boat owners, and too much a rube to comprehend the subtle distinctions of taste and class that characterized the world of the fancy shellfish.
And those fake proletarian desserts! ''Compost cookie.'' ''Cereal milk.'' ''Crack pie.'' The idea, I suppose, is that if you eat such downwardly mobile treats, it is only because you are so confident of your upwardly mobile status.
Yet the fact is that the crowd of Yelp reviewers had decided that Momofuku was the place to eat. And so we found ourselves eating at Momofuku.
For the pop sociologists of the period after World War II, ''crowd'' was a scare word, an impersonal entity that would extinguish your personality, spew contempt at your uniqueness, disable the operation of your individual instincts and judgment.
Now the ''wisdom of crowds'' has become an accepted platitude. ''Peer pressure,'' far from being a pernicious influence, is something we seek out as we race from one review site to another.
You might call this the Yelpification of culture. The goal and appeal of Yelp, and of countless similar companies, is to make everyone, regardless of income or social status, feel like a teenager trying to get into an exclusive private school that evening.
Heaven forbid that you should meet one of your friends at your favorite Thai place. No, you have to meet at everyone's favorite Thai place. Because if your friend is like some of my friends, he or she will be Yelping the place you suggest, and you're in big trouble if your favorite Thai restaurant has -- unbeknown to you, who have been going there for 27 years -- the status of the Ebola virus among savvy restaurant-goers. (''This place should be BYOT -- Bring your own turmeric! Stay away!! Yuck!!!'')
No, you have to go to a place that has received the best reviews from lots of people, even if you have no idea who they are or what their motives might be for spending their time rating restaurants. Gone are the days when ''conformist'' was a slur on someone's character. Now the idea is that if you are not following the crowd of five-star dispensers, you are a tasteless, undiscriminating shlub.
Welcome to the lonely crowd of the 21st century, both a revival of and a variation on the original ''lonely crowd,'' a term famously coined by the sociologist David Riesman in his best-selling 1950 book of that name.
Riesman argued that as the economy turned producers who manufacture goods into consumers buying them, the nature of society changed. People went from being ''inner-directed' to being ''outer-directed,'' from heeding their own instincts and judgment to depending on the judgments and opinions of tastemakers and trendsetters. Having lost touch with themselves, outer-directed souls were all alone in the midst of other people.
Of course, in one important respect, Riesman's thesis has been radically refuted. Whereas he and other postwar intellectuals feared the conformist power of the crowd, we now fear the aberrant individual or individuals lurking in the crowd. The tragedy in Boston makes the postwar worries about mass society, inflamed by the perceived Communist threat at the time, seem trivial.
But in other respects, Riesman's insights seem like the seeds of our own time.
Thanks to the Internet, we have become both producers and consumers. We are, in the futurist (how old-fashioned the term ''futurist'' seems now) Alvin Toffler's unlovely phrase, ''prosumers.'' We tweet, and post, and update, and blog at the same time we are consuming other people's digital productions. We are all part of a vast crowd that is unaware of how atomized it is, ignorant of the fact that it is both interconnected and isolated at the same time. The social media response to the Boston bombings was, all at once, informative, misleading and disorienting.
Manipulating our iGadgets, we have the illusion of going our own way even as we make sure to follow everyone else. ''Following'' is now the hallmark of a triumphant individuality. The Internet prizes the cute angle, the startling factoid, the arch provocation, qualities that are actually the careful, calculated style of the other-directed person cannily hiding behind an inner-directed facade.
We are all, in Riesman's Runyonesque parlance, ''inside-dopesters.'' According to Riesman, the aim of the inside-dopester is ''never to be taken in by any person, cause or event.''
The acquisition and preservation of such knowingness is the essential principle of the Twitterverse. It is certainly the sole purpose of Yelp and its ilk, where we can be reassured that by obeying the crowd, we will never be taken in by any restaurant, gastroenterologist or vacuum cleaner.
In an information-saturated world, we need all the information we can get about all the information we are receiving. In a society more and more dominated by commerce, we need businesses that guide us toward the right commercial choices.
But one effect of this ocean of meta-commentary and meta-evaluation is to professionalize our leisure time. We are now in the midst of a national attempt to maximize leisure time the way Americans once joined together to beat the Russians to the moon. Quality time used to mean time away from the pressures of work or ambition. Now it means exactly the opposite: time spent working on getting the most and the best in just about every category of existence.
Another effect is, to my mind, the worst. Thanks to our constantly digitized lonely crowd, we are as keenly aware of other people's opinions and judgments as we were in high school. But we are aware of their opinions and judgments without ever getting to know them as personalities.
The centuries-old idea that taste is subjective has been replaced by the conviction that, as in elections, sheer numbers carry the day. As a result, we may well start to become as cynical about our social lives as we are about our politics.
And that would be a real one-star experience, as I'm sure everyone will agree.

HEADLINE: Panama City Rising

BYLINE: By TIM NEVILLE. 
TIM NEVILLE is a frequent contributor to the Travel section.

 BODY:
Traffic into Panama City was flowing for once, so Miguel Fábrega had only a moment to point out the crumbling ruins in the distance. They were the remains of a 16th-century New Spanish settlement that the British privateer Sir Henry Morgan eventually sacked in 1671. Ahead of us rose Old Panama's modern replacement: a forest of green, blue and yellow glass skyscrapers that sifted the metallic Central American sky into great vertical columns.
''You're going to hear a lot about identity, who we are and where we are going,'' said Mr. Fábrega, a 37-year-old artist, writer and partner in a creative think tank called DiabloRosso, which promotes emerging artists in Panama. We had met over e-mail a few weeks earlier while I was searching for creative residents willing to show me their city, and moments ago he had picked me up at the airport.
Despite being founded in 1519, Panama is really only 13 years old, Mr. Fábrega argued, its birthday being Dec. 31, 1999, the day the United States gave the Panama Canal and its surrounding land back to the Panamanians. For the first time in a century the country was whole and independent. 
''My generation inherited this blank canvas,'' said Mr. Fábrega, his salt-and-pepper hair fluttering slightly in the Audi's air-conditioning. ''Now we have the chance to make it our own.''
Today, that canvas is far from blank, however. Over the past 13 years, Panama City has been racing to become a world-class metropolis, and for travelers, the changes have been enormous. In 1997 there were perhaps 1,400 hotel rooms in Panama City. Now there are more than 15,000 with another 4,582 rooms in the pipeline, according to STR Global, a London-based agency that tracks hotel markets. In the last two years alone, Trump, Starwood, Waldorf-Astoria, Westin and Hard Rock have opened hotels here. A new biodiversity museum designed by Frank Gehry is nearly complete. The country's first modern dance festival unfolded last year, the same year Panama held its first international film festival. The Panama Jazz Festival is going strong after 10 years. The country even has its own year-old microbrewery.
''Panama was this compressed spring just ready to go,'' said Keyes Christopher Hardin, a New York lawyer-turned-developer working to restore the city's old colonial area. ''When the Noriega dictator years ended and the U.S. returned all that canal land, things just took off. Everything that could go right did go right.''
Indeed, since 2008, when much of the world was in a recession, the Panamanian economy has expanded by nearly 50 percent. The canal itself, which frames the western edge of Panama City, is undergoing a $5.25 billion expansion that is expected to double its capacity and fuel even more economic growth.
Yes, Panama still struggles with crime and poverty, but foreigners are clearly intrigued with the way things are unfolding. In 1999 just 457,000 international tourists visited Panama, World Bank figures show. In 2011, more than 1.4 million came. Plenty are staying, too: sun-seeking Americans, Venezuelans and wealthy Colombian expatriates who are buying second homes and retirement properties all over Panama. In short, this city of about 880,000 people has gone from a ho-hum business center on the navy blue Pacific to a major leisure destination in record time. In doing so it has become a place full of the kind of paradoxes that occur whenever a very old place grinds against the very new. While the capital now has luxury apartments and five-star cuisine, the thing it needs most is a solid sense of identity.
''You drive in and see all these skyscrapers and you have to wonder, is it just a mirage or does it have any substance?'' Johann Wolfschoon, an architect and designer, told me. ''What we need to be is amazing. Not amazing for Panama, but amazing.''
IT WAS LATE MARCH, my first day of five in the city, and over the next few days I hoped to get a sense of a city as it enters its teenage years. I would hike through slums where street merchants sold black magic spices, then change my shirt to sip $15 cocktails in the neon glamour of a Hard Rock bar. I would eat terrible chicken and wonderful octopus. I'd spend time with locals, expats, artists, entrepreneurs and a former gangster.
For now, Mr. Fábrega wanted to show me his interpretation of some of the changes afoot. We peeled off the freeway, turned down a boulevard and entered Costa del Este, a section of the city with a skyline that looked like a concrete comb. Our destination was a pop-up gallery that had opened the night before inside an unfinished retail space at the bottom of a new white skyscraper. Sixteen of Mr. Fábrega's abstract paintings with bright yellows, blues and reds hung on the concrete walls in an exhibition he called ''Banana Republic.'' It didn't take long to spot some common motifs: finger-shapes that formed no hands, faucets that had no pipes and machines that could do no work.
''This is Panama,'' Mr. Fábrega said with a shrug. ''It's beautiful, but it makes no sense.''
Indeed, Panama City can feel rather absurd at times. Soon a new $2 billion subway, Central America's first, will whisk people from A to B, but a dearth of sidewalks can make it tough to go anywhere once you arrive. A modern city could use proper addresses, too. Instead, ''by the old KFC'' or ''across from the guayacán tree'' is often as precise as it gets. As we left the gallery, Mr. Fábrega said the surest way for him to get mail is to have it sent to his girlfriend in New York.
We drove a few miles west to Casco Viejo, a colonial neighborhood on the far edge of the city, where Mr. Fábrega dropped me off. Casco Viejo, which is sometimes called Casco Antiguo, is a warren of brick streets, leafy plazas and Spanish colonial rum bars blasting the 2/4 beats of cumbia. After Sir Morgan sacked Old Panama, the Spanish regrouped and started anew, this time on a defendable peninsula a few miles away on which Casco Viejo now stands.
I wandered around to get my bearings -- seven squares, six churches, one fine-looking ice cream shop -- and then checked into my hotel. The Canal House, near the Plaza Mayor, did not look so special from the outside: a white and gray block surrounded by steel barricades for road-working crews. Inside, it was another world, a quiet colonial refuge with rich wood floors, high windows and a cozy lounge. A woven basket sat near my bed, a shout-out to how Panamanians still lower meals from the windows of upstairs kitchens to sidewalk restaurants. On a shelf in the bar downstairs I found a framed note from the actor Daniel Craig, who had stayed while filming scenes for the James Bond movie ''Quantum of Solace.'' (Casco Viejo stood in for La Paz, Bolivia): ''I wish we would have stayed longer.''
Panama has pretty much always been a bridge for cultures, conquerors and, well, birds, but once that mishmash gets distilled into the 50-some blocks of Casco Viejo, an eclectic, almost Noah's Ark-like vibrancy prevails. The Chinese run so many small groceries here that Panamanians simply call the shops ''Chinos.'' The French left their mark on the corner of Avenida A and Calle 4, where a Parisian-style apartment building displays elegant rounded balconies. You hear German, Portuguese and English on the streets.
Parts of the area are still pretty seedy, though, and an elite division of stern-looking police officers patrol the area with machine guns and motorcycles. ''I was definitely nervous about coming here at first, with the shootings and the gangs,'' recalled Matt Landau, a New Jerseyan who moved to Panama City in 2006 and now owns Los Cuatro Tulipanes, a boutique hotel and apartment enterprise in Casco Viejo. A stray bullet smashed into the Canal House in 2009, and Mr. Landau still warns guests not to wander beyond certain blocks. But Casco Viejo does feel quite safe, even at night, when the neighborhood comes alive with busy restaurants and rooftop bars. ''I can't begin to tell you how much it has all changed,'' he said.
Mr. Hardin, the developer, has been one of the major players behind that change. His firm buys property in Casco Viejo, renovates it and sells it for about $2,500 per square meter on average. Along the way, he builds affordable housing and works to get kids off the streets by offering jobs that ultimately improve the neighborhood. ''Revitalization always revolves around a culture, not an industry,'' Mr. Hardin said. ''You need a place with good bones that's affordable with spaces that people can use to explore -- pioneering restaurants, galleries -- and then you get events around those spaces. That's what's happening here. So yes, it's like Miami, but Miami in maybe 1989.''
To understand what he meant, he suggested I meet Nicolas Mercado, a former gang member who now runs a popular bar called La Vecindad on Avenida A. Mr. Mercado, who has a shaved head and thick, muscled arms, welcomed me in a courtyard at the end of a long entryway where two friendly police officers happened to be standing. Graffiti, the artful kind with intricate angles and bold colors, lined the walls. Upstairs a singer was working on a Latin pop track in the bar's recording studio.
It was midafternoon and the place was closed, but Mr. Mercado and I sat outside and talked about change. In a way, his story mirrors the turnaround of the entire neighborhood. In the early days of contemporary Panama, or 1999, Mr. Mercado was 16 and the head of the Hot Boys gang, which prowled the eastern blocks of Casco Viejo. There were three other gangs in the area. They mostly sold drugs, though robberies and murder were common too. One day a man came by ostensibly to buy some marijuana, but he shot Mr. Mercado with a pistol four times instead. The man got away, and Mr. Mercado mostly recovered.
''I knew I had to get out,'' he said, showing me the scar of a bullet wound on his hand. ''This wasn't for me.''
So Mr. Hardin donated a space for him and his buddies to start a barbershop. It did not go so well. The first client, an American, wandered out with just half of his head trimmed because the gangster-turned-barber ducked out to make a deal and didn't come back. Mr. Mercado eventually shaped up and turned the space into La Vecindad in 2009, which has since become so popular with live music that it warranted an expansion into the courtyard. There are no more stray bullets.
''I'm free now,'' he said when I asked whether he thought the reality of his old ways could return to haunt him. ''It doesn't get any more real than that.''
OF COURSE, the city's growing pains have been pretty real, too. Boca la Caja, a poor fishing community, is struggling as the city's demand for prime real estate presses in around it and strangles its access to the sea. A similar fate looms over Casco Viejo with the construction of a controversial bypass that threatens to annul the neighborhood's Unesco World Heritage status. Traffic is terrible.
I had been inside the Panama Interoceanic Canal Museum -- a third-floor exhibition in a red-roof building just off the Plaza Mayor -- reading about the hazards of building the canal, when Mr. Fábrega picked me up the next day. I still wanted to explore the city's music, nature and food scene, so we stopped-and-go'ed our way to a restaurant called Maito in Coco del Mar, a largely residential area about three miles away. ''I think you'll like what the chef is doing,'' Mr. Fábrega said.
The chef would have to work hard to impress me. ''Starchy, sweet, fried and basic,'' is the way Patrick Maurin, the French executive chef at Trump Ocean Club, described Panamanian food, and few would argue otherwise. One night, I had ordered a salad at a restaurant near the Canal House and cringed at the sorry bits of barbecued chicken and pale lettuce that arrived.
''Panama is not a culture that's built around the table,'' said David Henesy, a New York restaurateur, who in 2005 started La Posta, a contemporary restaurant in the Calle Uruguay area that focuses on local, environmentally sustainable ingredients. It can still be difficult to find high-quality foods to work with, he said. ''If you want an heirloom tomato or an organic pig, you pretty much have to do it yourself.''
Another chef, Mario Castrellón, is trying to do just that. After studying cooking in Spain, Mr. Castrellón returned to Panama in 2005 to work under Mr. Henesy. In 2009 he started his own venture, Maito, which now competes alongside a dozen other worthy places like Las Clementinas or Tantalo Kitchen, both in Casco Viejo.
Maito was nearly full when Mr. Fábrega and I found a table under paddle fans next to a window. Outside a gardener tended to raised beds that were bushy with Thai basil, cilantro and other herbs that show up in the food.
''No one knows what Panamanian cuisine really is,'' Mr. Castrellón, who is 30, said later. ''People can name maybe four traditional dishes, but we eat a bit of everything here -- Chinese, French, African, Spanish, Colombian, American.''
Mr. Fábrega and I shared a sea bass hot dog -- fine, flaky fish rolled into a sausage shape and lightly battered and fried -- which was far more delicious than it sounds. We tore into an order of ropa vieja, literally ''old clothes,'' a traditional meal of shredded beef and sauce that Mr. Castrellón has invigorated with spicy peppers, annatto and goat cheese salsa.
The crowning analogy came with the octopus. The creature had been candied, set upon a garbanzo bean paste, and garnished with cilantro flowers and other herbs. It was sweet, spicy, succulent.
''Chinese glaze, Spanish beans, local herbs,'' Mr. Castrellón said. ''Put all these elements together, and now you have a Panamanian octopus.''
Eager to explore more of the city, I said a hasty goodbye to Mr. Fábrega and met up with Jessica Ramesch, the Panama editor of International Living magazine. We piled into her Hyundai and fought our way out to a former United States military base called Clayton that sits along the canal in the northwest part of the city.
''All of this area was pretty much closed to Panamanians when the Americans were here,'' she said as we crept through the Canal Zone, a Phoenix-size former United States territory where Americans working and defending the canal lived a strange, cross-world existence. ''Zonians,'' as they were called, could get Guess jeans and Jif peanut butter just as on most military bases abroad, but then monkeys might walk with the children to school. Huge ships moved through the Miraflores Locks just to the west of the road.
''Many Zonians stayed and some of the bases have become these gorgeous neighborhoods,'' Ms. Ramesch said.
Clayton is one of them. Though it was now getting dark, I could see community centers and signs for the City of Knowledge, a compound for research, tech companies and nongovernmental organizations. We parked near a soccer field and wandered toward a massive corotú tree where a crowd had spread out blankets and lawn chairs. A band was warming up near the trunk.
While much of the city's night life unfolds along Calle Uruguay, every full moon during the dry months hundreds of people head out to Clayton to bang on Tupperware containers, buckets and anything else that might make a noise. They do their best to follow the band -- just a group of friends, really -- which plays pop, reggae and whatever else it feels like.
''Who here can drum?'' an announcer shouted into a microphone, and the pounding became a roar.
Over the next several days, few things I saw or did in the city had quite the same wow factor as this bucket band gathered under an old tree. I sipped cocktails at Barlovento, a new rooftop bar where slinky women and V-shaped men swirled around in a cyclone of perfume and cigarettes, and I shopped for tapestries made by Kuna Indians along a waterfront paseo. A hike on a steep, car-less road up a jungly hill in the middle of the city stood out, but that's because an anteater crossed my tracks, and I'd never seen one of those before.
But here on the ground with wine and cheese and a fat moon hanging in the trees, I wondered if a city needs to add up to make sense. As absurd as Panama City can feel at times, it is certainly a lot of fun, too, and between the cracks of all the chaos, these mini-miracles are burbling through.
As if on cue, the bucket band's disparate racket gradually fell into sync until -- no way -- ''The Girl From Ipanema'' emerged. It was messy and loud and no one knew how it would end, which made it all the more amazing, too.

HEADLINE: Squeezing More From Ethanol

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Faced with a crop of lemons -- too much ethanol, a population of cars not tuned to burn it effectively and a driving public leery of the fuel's properties -- the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to make lemonade.
The effort to untangle itself from this sticky situation is part of a larger proposal by the federal government to make the most sweeping changes in gasoline since lead additives were banned. 
Tucked inside the E.P.A.'s March announcement of a plan to cut the amount of sulfur allowed in gasoline was an audacious suggestion that sought to solve all three ethanol challenges at once. The proposal, for a fuel that is 30 percent ethanol, could reduce tailpipe emissions and improve fuel economy -- and even encourage drivers to use more ethanol.
''You make the dog like the dog food,'' said William H. Woebkenberg, senior engineer for fuels policy in the United States at Mercedes-Benz.
The idea is that while today's typical pump blend -- E10, which is 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline -- has drawbacks, a blend of 30 percent ethanol and 70 percent gasoline could take advantage of ethanol's strengths. Unlike a flexible-fuel vehicle that can use E85 formulations but offers little financial or performance benefit, an engine tuned specifically for E30 would perform better on that fuel than on the standard E10, creating a market incentive.
The idea has widespread support among technical experts.
It also has another appealing aspect: current ethanol policy is probably unsustainable, because Congress has ordered the oil companies to use ever-larger amounts of ethanol. To comply with the mandate, ethanol levels would have to exceed 10 percent of each gallon of fuel, yet many automakers advise against using higher concentrations unless the car is equipped for it. With a declining demand for gasoline, the problem becomes more acute.
The 30 percent idea is laid out deep in the 938-page text of the proposed Tier 3 rule, which would lower the amount of sulfur in gasoline by two-thirds, to the level required in California. In the proposal, the E.P.A. asked automakers to comment on E30.
Like other efforts to introduce new fuels, it would require big investments at gas stations for blending pumps and storage tanks.
Still, there is a powerful incentive in the E.P.A. plan: offering automakers the option of having their cars certified on E30. Before a new car can be sold in the United States, the company must submit data on the vehicle's pollution output and fuel economy to the E.P.A. Certifying with E30 would call for engines optimized to take advantage of the blend's octane rating of 93 or perhaps higher.
Using high-octane premium-grade gas in an engine that does not require it offers no benefit. But in engines designed to squeeze the fuel-air mixture to very high pressures before igniting it with the spark plug, high-octane fuel burns predictably and can produce more horsepower. (On the other hand, burning low-octane gas in an engine tuned for premium grade can cause erratic combustion, or knocking, and result in severe engine damage.)
Ethanol contains only about two-thirds as much energy as gasoline, gallon for gallon. But if it is burned in engines designed for high cylinder pressures, it will produce competitive horsepower.
In general, the oil companies have opposed using higher concentrations of ethanol. The oil industry is trying to get Congress to change federal rules so they can use less ethanol, not more.
But various engine and fuel experts like the idea, because the E.P.A. is inviting the auto companies to take advantage of the good characteristics of ethanol, including an octane rating that is well over 100.
''That's getting smarter,'' said Margaret Wooldridge, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan. The way ethanol is used now, she said, ''if anybody does notice there's any ethanol in the fuel, it's always in a way that is negative.''
The trouble with the flexible fuel vehicles on the market now, which can run at blends of up to 85 percent ethanol, is that they are still mostly optimized for gasoline, not ethanol, she said. While there are millions of such vehicles on the road, they run mostly on E10 because that is a better bargain for the driver.
Higher concentrations are no better, and ethanol companies are struggling for acceptance of E15 with drivers, who show little enthusiasm.
''E15 is the answer to the question nobody asked,'' said Mr. Woebkenberg of Mercedes-Benz. ''It is a detriment.''
But an E30 blend in an engine designed to use that fuel would be attractive to car buyers, he said, with ''ridiculous power and good fuel economy,'' and owners of those cars would seek out the fuel, unlike owners of flex-fuel cars.
''I hope that the E.P.A. agrees to do it,'' said C. Boyden Gray, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush who is now a Washington lawyer representing energy clients. In coming years, Mr. Gray and others say, more cars are going to be engineered for high-octane fuel so they can get better fuel economy as automakers move to double economy, and high-octane fuel with 30 percent ethanol is cleaner than blends relying more heavily on gasoline.
But Mr. Gray and other experts said that the E.P.A. would probably have to do more than just give automakers the option to certify vehicles on E30; it would probably have to mandate its availability to give car shoppers confidence that they would be able to refuel such vehicles.

HEADLINE: Striking a Pose Above the Clouds

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
No wonder travelers are bent out of shape.
Economy airplane seat width is usually 17 or 18 inches. The average American man's waist is about 40 inches (38 for women), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Need I even mention the sliver of space between your knees and the seat in front you?
Fliers nowadays expect to walk off planes with stiff hips and strained backs. Desperation for relief has made seats with extra legroom cash cows for airlines. Even top yoga instructors who can fold their bodies like origami say they abhor airplane seats. So how do you emerge from a plane without feeling like Quasimodo? I turned to one of the best-known yoga teachers for advice.
Cyndi Lee, the founder of the ''no baloney'' Om Yoga brand and familiar to veteran practitioners from her videos and New York City classes, is in her 50s and among the most flexible frequent fliers. A few weeks before spring trips that will take her to Japan, Virginia and Berlin, she shared some airplane-friendly poses that keep her feeling supple and can be done in a seat or in the aisle. Many of the poses can be performed by yoga novices; others are for seasoned yogis -- or those who dare to try a tree pose at 30,000 feet. 
For Beginners
''A lot of what you're doing with these stretches is just increasing the circulation,'' said Ms. Lee, explaining that fluids ''such as water and lymph can tend to pool in lower regions'' on an airplane, making fliers ''feel sluggish and thick.''
To improve circulation through your lower back on long flights, be sure to twist every so often. While in your seat, plant your feet on the floor and twist to the right (you can put your left hand on the outside of your right knee to deepen the twist). Always include your head and neck in the twist. Switch sides.
If you have enough room and flexibility, from your seat you can also try ankle-to-knee (with one leg) pose, which is a complicated way of saying place your ankle on top of the opposite knee. For most people, simply being in this position is a significant stretch. ''That will open your hip and give you a really good stretch around your butt and your hip,'' Ms. Lee said. To deepen the stretch, lean forward a little and place your forearms on top of your legs. Then switch legs. To improve circulation while in that position, flex and point your raised foot, and squeeze and spread your toes. Mind the whereabouts of the drinks cart.
Now, on to your upper back. This next pose, the hug, can be done sitting or standing. And it's perfect if your travels have you feeling stressed: just wrap your arms around yourself and squeeze, aiming to touch your shoulder blades with your fingertips. From there you can stretch your neck by pressing your right ear to your right shoulder; repeat on the other side. Then release and switch arms, this time placing the arm that was on top on the bottom, as you reach across your back.
After the hug, you can go into a modified eagle pose (normally done standing). Put your hands in front of you as if you were about to play peek-a-boo, but instead of covering your face with your hands, cross your forearms and wind your wrists until your palms touch. Move your palms away from your face for a little stretch. (Instructions for some of these poses are on YogaJournal.com.)
Need a bathroom break? In the space near the lavatory, you can counteract rounded shoulders and relieve a tight upper back with a shoulder stretch. Reach behind you with both arms outstretched until your hands meet, then interlace your fingers, and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Look up and lift your chest. Depending on your level of comfort, you can lift your arms up and away from your back a bit. ''You're curving your spine in the opposite direction of the seat,'' Ms. Lee said, ''which is good.''
Other yoga experts offered similar advice. Alexandria Crow, a yoga instructor and teacher trainer at YogaWorks in Santa Monica, Calif., suggests putting your palms on either side of the aisle wall near the bathroom and leaning forward, as if stretching your chest through an open doorway.
Even simply hanging forward from the waist -- folding at the hips and grabbing each elbow with the opposite hand -- can make you feel better, Ms. Crow said.
She added that it's important during long flights to elevate your feet to keep your ankles from swelling. ''I've gotten off the plane and had those gigantic ankles,'' she said. To prevent that, she puts her feet on the bulkhead wall, the back of the seat in front of her or the back edge of the armrest in front of her. That may be good for your ankles, though not necessarily for your relationship with fellow passengers. Some fliers (myself included) think feet belong on the ground.
For Yogis
For regular yoga practitioners, ''tree pose is a no-brainer,'' Ms. Lee said, referring to the standing pose in which you place the sole of one foot against the inner thigh of your other leg and raise your arms to your chest or over your head. (You can use a wall by the bathroom for balance.) This pose can open up tight hips and relieve lower back pain. A small price to pay for the possible eyebrow raise from another passenger.
''I do these things and nobody even cares,'' Ms. Lee said. ''In fact, I think some people are thinking, 'That's a good idea.' ''
Another option is a variation on downward dog. Stand at your seat and put your hands on the seat back in front of you (not when your neighbor is occupying the seat). Then step back and lean forward, bending in half. (You're making a 90-degree angle, so your upper body and arms should be parallel to the floor.) If there's no room for that (and chances are there isn't unless you are rather petite), adjust by placing your forearms on the seat and do the same thing. ''It's just a downward dog in a different relationship to gravity,'' Ms. Lee said.
You can also modify popular poses like cat and cow (done on your hands and knees) and do them while standing instead. Just bend your knees and place your hands slightly above your knees. Then alternate between rounding your spine like a dome (cat) and curving it like an arch (cow), looking down when you do cat and looking up when you do cow.
''You can do it in a very contained way and get a lot out of it,'' Ms. Lee said.
And don't forget to breathe deeply, which will help you become calmer. Ms. Lee, the author of ''May I Be Happy: A Memoir of Love, Yoga and Changing My Mind,'' practices sama vritti, equal breathing in and out. She inhales for a count of 4, 5 or 6, then exhales for the same amount of time. She also recommends that travelers try lion pose: scrunching up your face and then, as you exhale, sticking out your tongue and looking up at the space between your eyebrows.
''Try to touch your chin with your tongue,'' she said, noting that this is good for waking up and reminding you to breathe.
I was about to suggest that this is also good for making people think you're nuts, but Ms. Lee seemingly read my mind.
''You can do that one in the bathroom,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Working Alone, Together

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Whitney Tingle, a New York entrepreneur, once had the common fantasy of ditching the 9-to-5 world, starting her own business and working in the serenity of her home. It did not quite work out as planned.
A year after cofounding Sakara Life, an organic-meal delivery company, she discovered that ''there was no beginning or end to work,'' said Ms. Tingle, 27. ''I would get distracted by dust bunnies under the desk and end up vacuuming in the middle of the day, or look at myself in the mirror at 7 p.m. and realize I was still in pajamas.'' And though health food was her business, she could not stay away from her boyfriend's pretzel supply. ''They would stare at me from the perch above the fridge,'' Ms. Tingle said plaintively.
Concerned about her sanity and waistline, she and her business partner, Danielle DuBoise, in August applied to NeueHouse, a new ''co-working'' space near Madison Square that has fashioned itself as a private club. The work space has a lavish industrial-chic interior, courtesy of the designer David Rockwell; charter members that include Chris Blackwell, the Island Records founder, and Jefferson Hack, of the British magazine Dazed & Confused; and yearly fees that can reach five figures. 
In just a few months, Ms. Tingle said, her mood has brightened, and her company has doubled its revenues through the contacts she has made there. ''It's impossible to get that sort of thing at a Starbucks,'' she said.
This was supposed to be the age of the mobile (a k a nonexistent) office, with ''solopreneurs'' telecommuting from home or the beach in elastic-waist pants. But many who work independently are discovering alienation lurking behind the home-office fantasy, and an increasing number are joining a new generation of co-working organizations, like Grind, Fueled Collective and NeueHouse -- some more exclusive than others. There are work spaces for writers (the Brooklyn Writers Space); for design types and bloggers (Studiomates, in Dumbo); and scores for tech entrepreneurs, including ones that double as continuing-ed campuses (General Assembly, which opened in New York in 2011, offers classes on subjects like ''back-end Web development'').
Though there were grumbles when the Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer did away with her employees' work-from-home arrangements, maybe she was on to something: many workers are saying they need a hive to be happy and productive.
One is Rebekah Epstein, who used to run a public relations agency out of her home in Austin, Tex., with only her dachshund, Dixie, whose barking once forced Ms. Epstein into a dark coat closet as she carried out a sensitive negotiation by phone with a client. Frustrated, she joined a local space called Link Coworking, which offers birthday drinks, mixers and potluck dinners to members, as well as colleagues to look presentable for. ''It seems like a small thing,'' Ms. Epstein said. ''But getting dressed for work makes a huge difference.''
Ivory Chafin-Blanchard, a Web producer in Brooklyn who similarly wearied of working in a bathrobe and sunglasses on her sun-drenched terrace, had another complaint.
''When you don't have to commute, and you've got a demanding workload, it is very hard to switch off,'' said Ms. Chafin-Blanchard, 32. At home, she added, ''if I wasn't working, I felt guilty.''
She spent so many hours ''on'' that she tried to make her home office physically uncomfortable -- installing a hard, upright chair and a glass desk -- to keep her from spending too many hours there. ''I had to depersonalize my house,'' she said.
Last September, she gave up and joined Grind, a so-called ''work space for free-range humans,'' a ''22nd century platform'' on Park Avenue South that opened with a minimalist-chic interior in 2011, promising to ''help talent collaborate in a new way: outside the system.'' (Or in front of the vending machine, where Ms. Chafin-Blanchard said she met someone who is now a partner in her business.)
Ever since the futurist Alvin Toffler painted utopian images of the ''electronic cottage'' in his 1980 book, ''The Third Wave,'' professionals have imagined trading committee meetings and soul-crushing commutes for a life of self-directed fulfillment. The percentage of American workers who work exclusively from home, while still small, grew by 37 percent between 1997 and 2010, to 6.6 percent, according to one Census Bureau survey. While estimates vary widely on the number of millions who make up Freelance Nation, as of 2009, more than 15 million workers in the United States listed themselves as self-employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it seems the work-from-home dream was not all it was cracked up to be. There are now nearly 800 commercial co-working facilities in the United States, up from a little more than 300 only two years ago, and about 40 in 2008, according to an annual survey by Deskmag, an online magazine that covers the co-working industry.
Surely it wasn't the fluorescent lights and office politics they were missing? But Tierney O'Dea Booker, 37, who ran a media consultancy out of her home in Austin before joining Link, pointed out that there can be a positive side to the latter. ''The workplace is essentially gameified, with points and obstacles, rewards, pitfalls and allies,'' she said. ''When you're alone, you have to make up your own system to self-propel. It's easy to set the bar at the wrong level for yourself on a daily basis, either by not pushing yourself hard enough or too hard, trying to reach an unrealistic goal and feeling inadequate as a result.''
Offices can also be compelling sources of personal narrative, as evinced by the success of television shows like ''Mad Men,'' ''30 Rock,'' ''The Good Wife'' and, naturally, ''The Office.''
''Those shows are popular because they're about a community,'' said Ms. Booker, who worked at 30 Rockefeller Plaza as a news producer before moving to Austin. ''You have friends, feedback, drama, comedy,'' she said. ''Working by yourself, you lose out on that.''
This is not to say that working remotely has been disappointing for all. An oft-cited 2007 Pennsylvania State University meta-analysis of 46 studies on telecommuting found that working from home for people employed by traditional companies can have ''small but favorable effects on perceived autonomy, work-family conflict, job satisfaction and performance.''
But ''high-intensity'' telecommuters at home more than three days a week and fulltime freelancers risk feeling alienated, said Ravi S. Gajendran, an author of the study who is now an assistant professor of business at the University of Illinois. ''The need to feel socially connected is a fundamental human need,'' Dr. Gajendran said.
A Google search on ''freelance lonely,'' for example, yielded 3.6 million results. For many, the ''electronic cottage'' has become an ''electronic tiger cage,'' said Paul Saffo, the Silicon Valley technology forecaster.
''We went through our work-from-home-in-your-bunny-slippers phase and discovered it was lonely,'' Mr. Saffo said.
No wonder some work spaces are playing up their party atmosphere. Link holds ''Mad Men''-themed holiday soirees. Indy Hall in Philadelphia, which opened six years ago, members organize after-hours jams and art shows in their mural-covered space, all in line with a quasi-communitarian dogma espoused by Alex Hillman, a founder of Indy Hall.
''People aren't going back to the office for the office,'' Mr. Hillman said. ''They're going back to the office to be around people again.'' With its emphasis on fun, Fueled Collective, a new 18,000-square-foot work space in SoHo, feels more like a frat house, with a whiskey room, carts with free ice cream and Ping-Pong tables.
And at Grind (which has a waiting list of 200, according to a founder, Benjamin Dyett, and is expanding to the garment district and to Chicago), members are encouraged to sit next to someone new every day.
No co-working space, however, has debuted with the same social aspirations as NeueHouse. With its exposed plywood, cast-iron chandeliers and concrete floors, the 50,000-square-foot interior suggests the Ace Hotel crossed with a Las Vegas mega-club. Its founders -- Joshua Abram and Alan Murray, both veteran tech entrepreneurs in their 40s, along with Oberon Sinclair, a partner -- are targeting globe-trotting creative professionals, the Monocle magazine types who consider it strategically crucial that Neuehouse plans outposts in far-flung locales starting with Los Angeles, London and Shanghai, and do not flinch at the cost ($600 a month to work in the main ''gallery'' downstairs, starting at $4,000 for the private studios upstairs). The work space features a screening room, broadcast studio and recording studio.
''We have members, not tenants,'' Mr. Abram said. Membership, by application, is ''curated'' by a board that includes Michelle Grey, a former gatekeeper at Soho House, the London-based chain of private clubs, and Tracey Ryans, a former collaborator with Serge Becker at velvet-rope night spots like the Box. Early members include Frieze Art Fair and Blue Bottle Coffee.
Not that snobbery is condoned. NeueHouse's organizers say they are looking for nothing more than a diverse set of skills from its members, so that they might come together organically to form the blockbuster start-ups of tomorrow.
''It's an ecosystem,'' Mr. Ryans said. ''A lot of places focus on creating an environment where it's like a lake, you've got four species of fish. We think we're the Great Barrier Reef.''
The very layout of Neuehouse is meant to suggest that work nowadays, at least for entrepreneurs, is a glorified version of hanging out. The main, gallery space, which opens next month (its upstairs studios opened last spring), is a collection of spaces meant to bring people together: there are retro-style library tables, kilim-covered cushions on a grand staircase designed for lounging, and conversation nooks with coffee tables and leather sofas.
''The design strategy is a typology that looks at accidental encounters, as much as organizational clarity or efficiency,'' Mr. Rockwell said.
It's an office designed for the interactive, serendipitous manner in which creative professionals work today, in a supposed ideas economy where corner offices and in-boxes feel like relics. ''We've gone from a task-oriented office culture to a cafe culture,'' Mr. Murray said. Such lofty talk may help sell memberships, but even such new-model offices eventually start to feel a bit like regular offices, said Po Bronson, the writer who co-founded the San Francisco Writers' Grotto 19 years ago. Meaning: Competition, gossip, envy and ego as well as collaboration.
''It's like in school; you want to go to a school with other good students, but you don't help them with their homework,'' Mr. Bronson said. ''You compare yourself with them. You don't want to be the loser.''
Besides, not every freelancer these days wants to enjoy a college-housing-co-op level of intimacy with a bunch of strangers.
Milano Buckley, a former advertising copywriter, rented a sleek, glass-walled office at We Work in SoHo when she left a fashion label to work on a memoir. The guys next to her used to bring their dogs to work, and the dogs were cute. But sometimes, you can have too much of a good thing, even ''community.''
''It was a little bit of a fishbowl feeling,'' Ms. Buckley, 33, said. ''People want to know what you do, so that communal culture lends itself to, 'What are you working on, awesome, high five.' But for some kinds of work, you don't necessarily want to share it.''
But at least co-working spaces have one advantage over regular offices, said Ms. Booker, of Austin: You're there by choice.
''If anyone is annoying you,'' she said, ''You just move.''

HEADLINE: Mold, Come Out With Your Hands Up

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
Bill Sothern, an expert at detecting residential mold, has a cedar-lined hot tub on his verdant south-facing terrace at Madison Avenue and 117th Street. The tub holds 3,000 liters of ionized water heated to 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, 95 degrees in the summer, and the terrace has an elaborate irrigation system.
With all that moisture corralled seven stories above 117th Street, the danger of a leak, which often begets mold, and the potential for lawsuits blamed on leaks, a chronic source of unneighborly New York City courtroom disputes, appear ominous. But Mr. Sothern, occasionally an expert witness in those cases (Bianca Jagger once hired him), is not tempting fate on the home front.
He built the hot tub himself. And having built a career on investigating and remediating environmental hazards -- mainly mold colonies, water damage and debilitating airborne agents like secondhand smoke, chemical vapors, lead and asbestos -- Mr. Sothern says his conscience is as clear as the drains on his terrace. 
The aluminum flashing beneath his patio door is sealed tight; the filters on his heating and ventilation system are changed on cue, second nature for a certified industrial hygienist with a master's degree in environmental and occupational health. ''Some people don't even know where the drains on their terraces are,'' he said. ''It's a recipe for trouble.''
Mr. Sothern, 66, is the founder of Microecologies, a 12-person firm that has conducted more than 5,000 investigations of metropolitan-area homes and businesses, typically occasioned by health-related complaints, since it opened in 1993.
''Our mission was to help city residents achieve clean and healthy indoor environments so that their home really could be a castle,'' he said.
Mr. Sothern exited his first career, in his family's garment business, in 1991 after coming to the conclusion that ''the world really didn't need another T-shirt,'' but could probably use a progressive nutritionist. He was steered toward environmental science by a professor at Hunter College and by the discomfiting memory of a dusty D.I.Y. apartment renovation that left his daughter Wendy, then 5, with respiratory allergies. Back then, he was a smoker, too: a double offender.
''Now I am a health nut and an exercise nut,'' he said. He is also a professional mold-buster and an author in 2005 of the instructional booklet and video ''Mold Cleanup Guidance for New Orleans Residents Affected by Hurricane Katrina,'' sponsored by the HUD Office of Healthy Homes, and adopted as a template by the World Health Organization. (Mr. Sothern and a colleague drove to New Orleans after the hurricane to help out.)
The booklet was updated in 2012 to reflect the ravages of Hurricane Sandy; according to Mr. Sothern, some 100,000 homes along the New Jersey, New York and Connecticut coastlines sustained water damage, and ''99 percent plus of them are seeing mold problems on structural wood.''
The tiny Microecologies office is a few blocks north of his home. A sign in the window announces ''Asthma Intervention.'' The storeroom is stocked with full-face respirators; after contracting pneumonitis early in his career while removing mold from the basement of a lighting fixture store on the Bowery, he stopped using half-face respirators.
Green mold, he said, has been recognized since 2004 as highly allergenic to humans. Black mold is that and potentially worse.
Half of the company's investigations are related to complaints about water damage and mold: ''We consider ourselves to be health care providers.'' Microecologies also designs exhaust systems for problematic commercial businesses on the ground floors of residential buildings, like cigar stores or dry cleaners.
To resolve complaints about secondhand smoke, Mr. Sothern said, the simplest and cheapest solution is to install an exhaust fan in the smoker's apartment. The alternative is to retrofit a building's ventilation system at a cost of $100,000 to $200,000.
''Secondhand smoke is a big issue,'' he said. ''Some of the highest-end residential buildings in Manhattan have decided it's worth it to spend the money and solve the problem. They know their residents have every reason to object to secondhand smoke.''
A spare room in his apartment is stacked with the files -- more than 50 -- of the cases that Microecologies is handling this spring in addition to the pro bono work it did in the Rockaways section of Queens after Sandy's inundation.
The firm is also working with Neighborhood Revitalization NYC on a need- and income-based program to provide inspections and mold remediation to 2,000 homes. ''We have inspected 300 so far,'' he said, ''and 100 percent of them showed mold activity.'' The devastation here, he added, ''is similar to Katrina.''
One hint to residents affected by water damage from Sandy: wallboard with paper facing is a prime conduit for mold and should be avoided in reconstruction projects. When water-soaked, the paper is a breeding ground for Stachybotrys chartarum, the black mold suspected of exercising toxic health effects on humans, especially infants and persons with compromised immune systems. A safer option, Mr. Sothern said, is cement board or gypsum board faced with fiberglass.
A few years ago, Mara Landis hired Microecologies to inspect her Park Avenue duplex. Her family had long-term respiratory and neurological problems, initially traced to mold caused by leaky windows and a burst pipe, and a remediation attempt by a Connecticut company had failed. ''They came in wearing their little hazmat suits,'' Ms. Landis recalled of that company. ''Charged us $100,000, which our insurance paid, but when we moved back into our apartment I immediately started to feel sick again.
''I love this apartment,'' she continued, ''but I got so upset, I told my husband I thought we were going to have to sell it and move. Then somebody told us that if we really wanted to clean up the mold, Bill Sothern was the guy to call.''
Mr. Sothern assessed the air quality in the duplex and, a bit like a detective, had a hunch the problem was lurking upstairs. ''He told me he needed to rip out the floorboards,'' Ms. Landis said, ''and when he did, there was a paper liner underneath, full of black mold.'' Since its removal, she said, she's been symptom-free.
Mr. Sothern has a low-tech general rule of thumb for breathing easier indoors: ''Everybody should crack open a window a quarter-inch no matter the season,'' he said. ''The air indoors is 10 times more contaminated than the air outdoors at any given time. Your grandmother was right.''
A noxious exception to that golden rule, he added, is a West Side warehouse-to-lofts conversion where the original lead-based paint on the exterior is flaking off and wafting indoors through open windows, sickening some residents. Lawsuits have been filed. Mr. Sothern is an expert witness for the complainants in this case.
''If you are unfortunate enough to live there,'' he said, ''then grandma is wrong. Keep the windows closed.''

His firm, Microecologies, volunteered its services in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and is battling household mold problems caused by Sandy. Mr. Sothern, 66, and his team have conducted more than 5,000 investigations over the years, often with the help of a vacuum pump and an ''air-o-cell'' device, which collects airborne mold spores for laboratory testing.

HEADLINE: What Health Insurance Doesn't Do

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
IN one of the most famous studies of health insurance, conducted across the 1970s, thousands of participants were divided into five groups, with each receiving a different amount of insurance coverage. The study, run by the RAND Corporation, tracked the medical care each group sought out, and not surprisingly found that people with more comprehensive coverage tended to make use of it, visiting the doctor and checking into the hospital more often than people with less generous insurance.
But the study also tracked the health outcomes of each group, and there the results were more surprising: With a few modest exceptions, the level of insurance had no significant effect on the participants' actual wellness. 
Needless to say, experts have been arguing about what the RAND results mean ever since. But the basic finding -- that more expensive health insurance doesn't necessarily lead to better health -- just received a major boost. The state of Oregon expanded its Medicaid program via lottery a few years ago, and researchers released the latest data on how health outcomes for the new Medicaid users differed from those for the uninsured. The answer: They didn't differ much. Being on Medicaid helped people avoid huge medical bills, and it reduced depression rates. But the program's insurance guarantee seemed to have little or no impact on common medical conditions like hypertension and diabetes.
As liberals have been extremely quick to point out, these findings do not necessarily make a case against the new health care law, which includes a big Medicaid expansion as well as subsidies for private insurance. After all, the first purpose of insurance is economic protection, and the Oregon data shows that expanding coverage does indeed protect people from ruinous medical expenses. The links between insurance, medicine and health may be impressively mysterious, but staving off medical bankruptcies among low-income Americans is not a small policy achievement.
This is true. But it's also true that the health care law was sold, in part, with the promise (made by judicious wonks as well as overreaching politicians) that it would save tens of thousands of American lives each year. There was so much moral fervor on the issue, so much crusading liberal zeal, precisely because this was not supposed to be just a big redistribution program: it was supposed to be a matter of life and death.
But if it turns out that health insurance is useful mostly because it averts financial catastrophe -- which seems to be the consensus liberal position since the Oregon data came out -- then the new health care law looks vulnerable to two interconnected critiques.
First, if the benefit of health insurance is mostly or exclusively financial, then shouldn't health insurance policies work more like normal insurance? Fire, flood and car insurance exist to protect people against actual disasters, after all, not to pay for ordinary repairs. If the best evidence suggests that health insurance is most helpful in protecting people's pocketbooks from similar disasters, and that more comprehensive coverage often just pays for doctor visits that don't improve people's actual health, then shouldn't we be promoting catastrophic health coverage, rather than expanding Medicaid?
Liberals don't like catastrophic plans because, by definition, they're stingier than the coverage many Americans now enjoy. But this is where the second critique comes in: If the marginal dollar of health care coverage doesn't deliver better health, isn't this a place where policy makers should be stingy, while looking for more direct ways to improve the prospects of the working poor? Some kind of expanded health security is clearly a good thing -- but if we want to promote economic mobility as well, does it really make sense to pour about a trillion dollars into a health care system that everyone agrees is deeply dysfunctional, when some of that money could be returned to Americans' paychecks instead?
There are a variety of ways this could be accomplished -- a bigger child tax credit for struggling families, a payroll tax cut to boost workers, an expanded earned-income tax credit to raise wages at the bottom, health savings accounts that roll over money left unspent. In each case, the goal would be to help people rise by giving them more money and more options for what to do with it, rather than just expanding 1960s-vintage programs that pay medical bills and only medical bills.
It's to the Republican Party's great discredit that these policies and goals don't have enough conservative champions at the moment. But it's to liberals' discredit that they remain wedded to the dream of a health care bureaucracy that pays and pays and pays, when in all likelihood we could be spending much less with similar results, and finding better ways to help the poor.

HEADLINE: Brain, Interrupted

BYLINE: By BOB SULLIVAN and HUGH THOMPSON. 
Bob Sullivan, a journalist at NBC News, and Hugh Thompson, a computer scientist and entrepreneur, are the authors of ''The Plateau Effect: Getting From Stuck to Success.''

 BODY:
TECHNOLOGY has given us many gifts, among them dozens of new ways to grab our attention. It's hard to talk to a friend without your phone buzzing at least once. Odds are high you will check your Twitter feed or Facebook wall while reading this article. Just try to type a memo at work without having an e-mail pop up that ruins your train of thought.
But what constitutes distraction? Does the mere possibility that a phone call or e-mail will soon arrive drain your brain power? And does distraction matter -- do interruptions make us dumber? Quite a bit, according to new research by Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Lab. 
There's a lot of debate among brain researchers about the impact of gadgets on our brains. Most discussion has focused on the deleterious effect of multitasking. Early results show what most of us know implicitly: if you do two things at once, both efforts suffer.
In fact, multitasking is a misnomer. In most situations, the person juggling e-mail, text messaging, Facebook and a meeting is really doing something called ''rapid toggling between tasks,'' and is engaged in constant context switching.
As economics students know, switching involves costs. But how much? When a consumer switches banks, or a company switches suppliers, it's relatively easy to count the added expense of the hassle of change. When your brain is switching tasks, the cost is harder to quantify.
There have been a few efforts to do so: Gloria Mark of the University of California, Irvine, found that a typical office worker gets only 11 minutes between each interruption, while it takes an average of 25 minutes to return to the original task after an interruption. But there has been scant research on the quality of work done during these periods of rapid toggling.
We decided to investigate further, and asked Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology, and the psychologist Eyal Peer at Carnegie Mellon to design an experiment to measure the brain power lost when someone is interrupted.
To simulate the pull of an expected cellphone call or e-mail, we had subjects sit in a lab and perform a standard cognitive skill test. In the experiment, 136 subjects were asked to read a short passage and answer questions about it. There were three groups of subjects; one merely completed the test. The other two were told they ''might be contacted for further instructions'' at any moment via instant message.
During an initial test, the second and third groups were interrupted twice. Then a second test was administered, but this time, only the second group was interrupted. The third group awaited an interruption that never came. Let's call the three groups Control, Interrupted and On High Alert.
We expected the Interrupted group to make some mistakes, but the results were truly dismal, especially for those who think of themselves as multitaskers: during this first test, both interrupted groups answered correctly 20 percent less often than members of the control group.
In other words, the distraction of an interruption, combined with the brain drain of preparing for that interruption, made our test takers 20 percent dumber. That's enough to turn a B-minus student (80 percent) into a failure (62 percent).
But in Part 2 of the experiment, the results were not as bleak. This time, part of the group was told they would be interrupted again, but they were actually left alone to focus on the questions.
Again, the Interrupted group underperformed the control group, but this time they closed the gap significantly, to a respectable 14 percent. Dr. Peer said this suggested that people who experience an interruption, and expect another, can learn to improve how they deal with it.
But among the On High Alert group, there was a twist. Those who were warned of an interruption that never came improved by a whopping 43 percent, and even outperformed the control test takers who were left alone. This unexpected, counterintuitive finding requires further research, but Dr. Peer thinks there's a simple explanation: participants learned from their experience, and their brains adapted.
Somehow, it seems, they marshaled extra brain power to steel themselves against interruption, or perhaps the potential for interruptions served as a kind of deadline that helped them focus even better.
Clifford Nass, a Stanford sociologist who conducted some of the first tests on multitasking, has said that those who can't resist the lure of doing two things at once are ''suckers for irrelevancy.'' There is some evidence that we're not just suckers for that new text message, or addicted to it; it's actually robbing us of brain power, too. Tweet about this at your own risk.
What the Carnegie Mellon study shows, however, is that it is possible to train yourself for distractions, even if you don't know when they'll hit.

HEADLINE: The Idled Young Americans

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
THE idle young European, stranded without work by the Continent's dysfunction, is one of the global economy's stock characters. Yet it might be time to add another, even more common protagonist: the idle young American.
For all of Europe's troubles -- a left-right combination of sclerotic labor markets and austerity -- the United States has quietly surpassed much of Europe in the percentage of young adults without jobs. It's not just Europe, either. Over the last 12 years, the United States has gone from having the highest share of employed 25- to 34-year-olds among large, wealthy economies to having among the lowest. 
The grim shift -- ''a historic turnaround,'' says Robert A. Moffitt, a Johns Hopkins University economist -- stems from two underappreciated aspects of our long economic slump. First, it has exacted the harshest toll on the young -- even harsher than on people in their 50s and 60s, who have also suffered. And while the American economy has come back more robustly than some of its global rivals in terms of overall production, the recovery has been strangely light on new jobs, even after Friday's better-than-expected unemployment report. American companies are doing more with less.
''This still is a very big puzzle,'' said Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard professor who was chief economist at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration. He called the severe downturn in jobs ''the million-dollar question'' for the economy.
Employers are particularly reluctant to add new workers -- and have been for much of the last 12 years. Layoffs have been subdued, with the exception of the worst months of the financial crisis, but so has the creation of jobs, and no one depends on new jobs as much as younger workers do. For them, the Great Recession grinds on.
For many people with jobs and nest eggs, the economy is finally moving in the right direction, albeit a long way from booming. Average wages are no longer trailing inflation. Stocks have soared since their 2009 nadir, and home prices are increasing again. But little of that helps younger adults trying to get a foothold in the economy. Many of them are on the outside of the recovery looking in.
The net worth of households headed by people 44 and younger has dropped more over the past decade than the net worth of middle-aged and elderly households, according to the Federal Reserve. According to the Labor Department, workers 25 to 34 years old are the only age group with lower average wages in early 2013 than in 2000.
The problems start with a lack of jobs. In 2011, the most recent year for which international comparisons exist, 26.2 percent of Americans between ages 25 and 34 were not working. That includes those for whom unemployment is a choice (those in graduate school, for example, or taking care of children) and those for whom it is not (the officially unemployed or those who are out of work and no longer looking). The share was 20.2 percent in Canada, 20.5 percent in Germany, 21 percent in Japan, 21.6 percent in Britain and 22 percent in France.
The European economy has deteriorated over the last two years, and the American economy has strengthened modestly. But the job growth here has been fast enough merely to keep pace with population growth, which suggests that this country still lags in the employment of young adults. In 2000, by contrast, the United States led Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Japan -- as well as Australia, Russia and Sweden -- in such employment rates. The nation now trails them all. Older American workers have also lost relative ground, but not as much.
As Mr. Katz, Mr. Moffitt and others note, an explanation of the root causes remains elusive. But there are obvious suspects, and each probably plays a role.
The United States, for example, has lost its once-large lead in producing college graduates, and education remains the most successful jobs strategy in a globalized, technology-heavy economy. It is no accident that the most educated places in the country, like Boston, Minneapolis, Washington and Austin, Tex., have high employment rates while the least educated, including many in the South and inland California, have low ones. The official unemployment rate for 25- to 34-year-old college graduates remains just 3.3 percent.
Beyond education, the nation has also been less aggressive than some others in using counseling and retraining to help the jobless find work. To take one small example, a recent study in France by the renowned M.I.T. economist Esther Duflo and four colleagues found that placement programs for unemployed workers helped not only the workers but the economy too. The counseled workers were more likely to find work, and they did not simply take jobs from other candidates. Overall employment rose more quickly in the regions with job counseling.
Other research notes that the United States has expanded parental leave and part-time work less than other countries -- and, perhaps relatedly, employment rates among women here have slipped.
Whatever role these trends are playing, they do not appear to fully explain the employment decline. It is too big and too widespread. Existing companies are not adding jobs at the same rate they once did, and new companies are not forming as quickly.
What might help? Easing the parts of the regulatory thicket without societal benefits. Providing public financing for the sorts of early-stage scientific research and physical infrastructure that the private sector often finds unprofitable. Long term, nothing is likely to matter more than improving educational attainment, from preschool through college (which may have started already).
Many business executives and economists also point to immigration policy. Done right, an overhaul could make a difference, many say, by allowing more highly skilled immigrants to enter the country and by making life easier for those immigrants already here. Historically, immigrants have started more than their share of new companies.
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the jobs slump is that the Americans in their 20s and 30s who have been most affected by it remain decidedly upbeat. They are much more hopeful than older generations, polls show, that the country's future will be better than its past.
Based on what younger adults have been through, that resilience is impressive. It's probably necessary, too. The jobs slump will not end without a large dose of optimism.

LENGTH: 1293 words

HEADLINE: A NORC, Up Close and Personal

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
Fort Hamilton, the square-mile-size southern half of Bay Ridge, which takes its name from the local Army garrison, is not a place that people tend to leave. Judging from the numbers, this magnetism has effectively turned it into a ''NORC,'' or naturally occurring retirement community.
Almost a third of the 28,500 or so residents are over 55, according to 2010 census data. That compares with only a quarter in the city as a whole. Those 55 to 64 constituted the fastest-growing group by far from 2000 to 2010; their numbers increased by 25 percent.
Josephine Beckmann, the district manager of Community Board 10, which covers Fort Hamilton, says she frequently goes with her father-in-law to the well-attended Fort Hamilton Senior Recreation Center. ''You have seniors living immediately in the area who are learning how to use a computer, taking dance classes, going to work out,'' Ms. Beckmann said. ''They have a big social network and dances every week. It's a fun place to go.'' 
Fort Hamilton even has some of the flavor of a Florida retirement community, with high-rise apartment buildings lining Shore Road, which fronts the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and New York Bay.
Many of these buildings are prewar, and many of the houses, too, were built decades ago. The real estate market, known for its constancy, barely stumbled during the financial crisis, brokers said.
''It stayed stable because of the convenience of where we're located,'' said Joseph Madaio, the managing broker of Re/Max Metro, who grew up and works locally.
Settled starting in the 19th century by Norwegians, followed in the 20th by immigrants from Ireland and Italy, the area has in recent years grown more diverse, with arrivals from Greece, Egypt, Lebanon and China, along with other Mideastern and Asian countries, residents say.
Doris Cruz, a 30-year Fort Hamilton resident of Norwegian descent living on 99th Street, says that two families on her block have been in the same home for three generations, or about 75 years. Others have lived there for 40 or more years.
Fort Hamilton ''is a neighborhood where people age in place,'' Ms. Cruz said. ''There are some very established families on my block, and I think that's typical.''
Not that there aren't younger people moving in -- primarily to take advantage of Fort Hamilton's relatively reasonable house prices and convenient Manhattan commuting options, Mr. Madaio said.
Stephen Nesbit, a 33-year-old law student and program coordinator for a graduate school on the Upper East Side, commutes daily and searched in the area for an apartment ''because it's affordable housing, tree-lined streets, a very safe neighborhood,'' he said. ''And the people are very friendly here.''
Mr. Nesbit grew up in Bay Ridge, frequently accompanying his father to business meetings in the Fort Hamilton area. In particular, he remembers the neighborhood's parks, along with the Civil War memorial, a massive cannon surrounded by cannonballs. The area is frequently used as a site for weddings.
''Those things are nice landmarks,'' Mr. Nesbit said. ''This is part of Brooklyn that you wouldn't necessarily expect to exist if you weren't familiar with the borough.''
What You'll Find
Boundaries can often be a subject of contention, but a well-accepted definition of Fort Hamilton has it stretching from the Narrows north to the main commercial strip at 86th Street, and from New York Bay east to Seventh Avenue, which runs south to the fort.
Described as one of the oldest continuously garrisoned federal forts in the country, United States Army Garrison Fort Hamilton is a neighborhood icon, along with the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Since the terror attacks of 2001, however, it has reduced its community involvement for security reasons. ''They used to have concerts, and many more events that were open to the public,'' Ms. Cruz said. ''But since 9/11, it's really declined.''
The area's low-slung character and leafy environs have had extra protection since a 2005 rezoning. The housing stock is mostly one-, two- and three-family attached and detached homes; the tallest structures are six-story apartment complexes along Shore Road, and here and there along Third and Fourth Avenues.
New development has been limited, although there are new condominiums at 9917 Shore Road and 346 93rd Street, among others, Mr. Madaio said.
What You'll Pay
Home prices are cheaper than in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Downtown Brooklyn, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens and Park Slope. A recent Zillow.com search turned up 210 market-rate properties for sale in Fort Hamilton.
''A brownstone in Park Slope could be $1.8 million or $2 million,'' Mr. Madaio said. ''You can get something nice over here for around $1 million, so it's much more affordable.''
In general, single-family homes in Fort Hamilton start in the high $600,000s, while detached houses on Shore Road can go for several million dollars, Mr. Madaio said.
New one-and two-bedroom condos start in the upper $500,000s; three-bedrooms can cost over $1 million. There are many more co-op apartments in Fort Hamilton than condos, and they tend to be cheaper -- some are even less than half the price, depending on the area, Mr. Madaio said.
Rentals are also a relative bargain. One-bedrooms rent for $1,100 to $1,300 a month; two-bedrooms for $1,250 to $1,850; and three-bedrooms for $1,600 to $2,400, according to Andrei Hippix, a sales agent with Rapid Realty.
(Mr. Nesbit, the law student who had hunted a rental in the area, ended up in a large one-bedroom a few blocks away in Dyker Heights, which has similar property values. He pays $1,200 a month.)
The Commute
Most residents complain that the R train into Manhattan, with stops at Bay Ridge-95th Street and 86th Street, is sluggish and packed during rush hours. Others skip the train, opting for the many express buses into Manhattan, like the X27, X37, X28 and X38. The former normally takes about 50 minutes, the latter about an hour.
What to Do
The Harbor Defense Museum, within the fort at 230 Sheridan Avenue, displays its history but is closed for renovations until sometime in the summer.
Security is tight at the museum and throughout the fort complex, said Bruce Hill, a public affairs specialist there.
The Community Club at the fort has a swimming pool. Although memberships are available mostly to service members, military retirees and some federal employees, unaffiliated residents can get guest memberships if sponsored by eligible members.
The water is a recreational focus for many. A bike path runs along Shore Road, and fishing is popular, with access at Fourth Avenue and 101st Street near John Paul Jones Park. Its 5 acres are devoted to historic memorials, but the nearby 8.6-acre John J. Carty Park has basketball, tennis courts and a playground, along with the senior center.
The Schools
Public School/Intermediate School 104 the Fort Hamilton School, which runs through Grade 8, got a B on its latest city progress report, with 68 percent of students showing mastery in English and 83 percent in math, versus 47 and 60 citywide.
SAT averages at Fort Hamilton High School last year were 417 in reading, 478 in math and 411 in writing, versus 434, 461 and 430 citywide.
There are several dozen private and parochial schools within three miles of Fort Hamilton, several of them within the neighborhood. Among these are Fontbonne Hall Academy, a girls' high school, and the St. Patrick School.
The History
St. John's Episcopal Church, founded in 1834, soon thereafter became known unofficially as the Church of the Generals, said the Rev. David Sibley, the priest in charge. Capt. Robert E. Lee (the future general) served on the governing board of the parish, and Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson, a Confederate general in the Civil War, was baptized there.

HEADLINE: Latest Product Of Tech Firms: Immigrant Bill

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and SOMINI SENGUPTA; Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Somini Sengupta from San Francisco. Neha Thirani contributed reporting from Mumbai, India.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The television advertisement that hit the airwaves in Florida last month featured the Republican Party's rising star, Senator Marco Rubio, boasting about his get-tough plan for border security.
But most who watched the commercial, sponsored by a new group that calls itself Americans for a Conservative Direction, may be surprised to learn who bankrolled it: senior executives from Silicon Valley, like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn, who run companies where the top employees donate mostly to Democrats.
The advertising blitz reflects the sophisticated lobbying campaign being waged by technology companies and their executives.
They have managed to secure much of what they want in the landmark immigration bill now pending in Congress, provisions that would allow them to fill thousands of vacant jobs with foreign engineers. At the same time, they have openly encouraged lawmakers to make it harder for consulting companies in India and elsewhere to provide foreign workers temporarily to this country. 
Those deals were worked out through what Senate negotiators acknowledged was extraordinary access by American technology companies to staff members who drafted the bill. The companies often learned about detailed provisions even before all the members of the so-called Gang of Eight senators who worked out the package were informed.
''We are very pleased with the progress and happy with what's in the bill,'' said Peter J. Muller, a former House aide who now works as the director of government relations at Intel. ''It addresses many of the issues we've been advocating for years.''
Now, along with other industry heavyweights, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the technology companies are trying to make sure the law gets passed -- which explains the political-style television advertising campaign, sponsored by a group that has revealed no details about how much money it gets from its individual supporters.
The industry also hopes to get more from the deal by working to remove some regulatory restrictions in the proposal, including on hiring foreign workers and firing Americans.
Silicon Valley was once politically aloof before realizing in recent years that its future profits depended in part on battles here in Washington. Its effort to influence immigration legislation is one of its most sophisticated.
The technology industry ''understands there's probably not a tremendous amount of resistance to their part of the bill,'' Mr. Rubio said in an interview last week, saying he welcomed the industry support. ''But their future and getting the reform passed is tied to the overall bill.''
The bill has a good chance of winning passage in the Senate. The hardest sell will come in the House, where many conservative Republicans see the deal as too generous to immigrants who came to this nation illegally.
Rob Jesmer, a former top Republican Senate strategist who helps run the new Zuckerberg-backed nonprofit group that sponsored the Rubio ad, insisted that his organization's push is based on the personal convictions of the executives who donated to the cause and who believe immigration laws need to be changed. Those convictions just happen to line up with what their corporations are lobbying for as well, he said.
''It will give a lot of people who are educated in this country who are already here a chance to remain in the United States,'' Mr. Jesmer said, ''and encourage entrepreneurs from all over the world to come to the United States and create jobs.''
The profound transition under way inside Silicon Valley companies is illustrated by their lobbying disclosure reports filed in Congress. Facebook's lobbying budget swelled from $351,000 in 2010 to $2.45 million in the first three months of this year, while Google spent a record $18 million last year.
That boom in spending translates into hiring of top talent in the art of Washington deal-making. These companies have hired people like Joel D. Kaplan, a onetime deputy chief of staff in the Bush administration who now works for Facebook; Susan Molinari, a former House Republican from New York who is now a Google lobbyist; and outside lobbyists like Steven Elmendorf, a former chief of staff to Richard A. Gephardt, a former House majority leader, who works for Facebook.
The immigration fight, which has unified technology companies perhaps more than any other issue, has brought the lobbying effort to new heights. The industry sees it as a fix to a stubborn problem: job vacancies, particularly for engineers.
''We are not able to fill all the jobs that we are creating,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, told the Senate Judiciary Committee late last month.
Chief executives met with President Obama to discuss immigration. Venture capitalists testified in Congress. Their lobbyists roamed the Senate corridors to make sure their appeals were considered in the closed-door negotiations among the Gang of Eight, which included Mr. Rubio and Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who have been particularly receptive.
In the many phone calls and hallway asides on Capitol Hill this year, those lobbyists realized that they had to give a little to get a lot of what they wanted. At the top of their wish list was an expansion of a temporary visa program called the H-1B, which allows companies to hire foreigners for jobs in the United States. There are a limited number of H-1Bs available each year, and competition for them is fierce.
Companies like Facebook and Intel use them largely to bring workers to their own offices. Consulting companies like Tata, based in India, use them to supply computer workers at American banks, oil companies and sometimes software firms.
Critics of H-1B visas point out that they mostly bring workers at the lowest pay scales. The technology industry's main rivals in these negotiations were lawmakers who have long been critical of guest worker visa programs, chiefly Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and groups that represent American engineers.
Silicon Valley lobbyists told Senate negotiators they agreed that the H1-B visa system had been subject to abuse. Go after the companies that take advantage of guest worker visas and give us the benefit of the doubt, they told the Senate staff members, according to interviews with several lobbyists.
''You know and we know there are some bad people in this system,'' is how Scott Corley, the president of Compete America, a technology industry coalition, recalled the conversation. ''We are simply trying to make sure that as they are pursuing the rats they are not sinking the ship.''
That acknowledgment, several lobbyists said privately, helped unlock an impasse in negotiations.
What emerged was a Senate measure that allows American technology companies to procure many more skilled guest worker visas, raising the limit to 110,000 a year from 65,000 under current law, along with a provision to expand it further based on market demand. The bill would also allow these companies to move workers on guest visas more easily to permanent resident visas, freeing up more temporary visas for these companies.
But it requires them to pay higher wages for guest workers and to post job openings on a Web site, so Americans can have a chance at them. And it draws a line in the sand between these technology firms and the mostly Indian companies that supply computer workers on H-1B visas for short-term jobs at companies in the United States.
''This provision accomplishes the goal of discouraging abuse of the program while providing an important incentive for companies to bring top talent to work in the United States for the long-term, where they will contribute to our economy,'' said Mr. Kaplan, the former Republican White House aide who is now the vice president for United States public policy at Facebook.
The bill is written in such a way that it penalizes companies that have a large share of foreign guest workers among their United States work forces, eventually making it impossible for them to bring in any more. It allows large American companies that have many more American workers to continue to import workers. And it includes a provision that exempts from the guest worker count those employees that companies sponsor for green cards, essentially a bonus to American businesses like Facebook whose work forces are growing fast.
Companies that provide temporary foreign workers say the move is intended to push them out of the American market.
These companies, mostly based in India, have far less good will on Capitol Hill. Their hope now rests with convincing lawmakers that it would be counterproductive to punish them.
''Why are we in the United States? We are there because American corporations want us,'' said Som Mittal, the president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, which represents Indian companies. ''We help them become competitive and serve their customers better.''
In interviews, Mr. Rubio and an aide to Mr. Schumer said the draft bill takes a balanced approach to penalize those who do not hire American workers for jobs here. They say the proposal is good for the country, even as it may benefit American technology firms.
In March, some of the biggest figures in the technology industry, including Mr. Zuckerberg, the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the venture capitalist John Doerr, unveiled a new nonprofit advocacy group, called Fwd.Us, with its first mission being to push Congress to overhaul immigration law. The group has hired lobbyists and a staff of veteran political operatives.
One of its first campaigns was to bankroll the television ad for Mr. Rubio. Two other ads backed Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, who is considered a critical swing vote, in a state where there are many critics of the legislation. Mr. Jesmer said the group spent ''in the seven figures'' on the ads.
Mr. Rubio has been a vocal ally. He says he understands the industry's need for talent and wants to prevent companies from having to ship work overseas.
To negotiate the details on the immigration bill, Mr. Rubio hired Enrique Gonzalez, who took a leave from a law firm that handles H-1B visa applications for many technology companies. Mr. Gonzalez said the assignment presented no conflict of interest because he works with universities handling visas, not technology companies.
The fact that technology lobbyists were given an unusual degree of access to the negotiators on the bill is entirely justified, he said. ''Because of the unique needs of the technology industry, the newness of it, the novelty of a lot of the issues they are confronting, I think that was why there were more engaged than some of the other industries were,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Loan Qualifications for Retirees

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
Retirees trying to obtain a mortgage may find that a pristine credit history and healthy retirement accounts are not enough. Lenders are also looking for a consistent monthly income in line with their usual debt-to-income standards.
Sanford Evans, 75, ran up against this requirement recently when he applied for a $174,000 loan to finance the purchase of an apartment in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. With brokerage accounts exceeding $1 million, a TransUnion credit score of 822, and the ability to make a 40 percent down payment, Mr. Evans didn't anticipate any problem with qualifying. 
''I would have paid cash,'' he said, ''but the interest rates are so low it didn't make financial sense to do it. I figured this was going to be as easy as it's been in the past.''
But despite the loan officer's initial assurances that the loan would close quickly, Mr. Evans, who was moving from a condo in Boston, endured delays that dragged on for months. The problem, he was told, was his income. He received Social Security and monthly dividend distributions, and supplemented these earnings with part-time medical writing for a Boston hospital. Yet he still came up short. The lender wouldn't count the writing income because he was moving away from Boston.
This made no sense to Mr. Evans, given the size of his brokerage accounts. ''Having a job does not give you any more security than having the assets that I have,'' he said.
Most lenders, though, measure income the same way, said Richard Pisnoy, a principal of the Silver Fin Capital Group, a brokerage in Great Neck. When they look at dividends, they want to see a regular annual amount on the tax return paid out over at least the last two years. As far as part-time work, when the borrower applies, ''they need to be able to confirm you're actually employed at that moment,'' he said. They will then credit income shown, but may require a two-year work history. Social Security income is always counted. Borrowers should be aware that Fannie Mae guidelines allow lenders to increase that income by 25 percent if the beneficiary isn't paying taxes on it, Mr. Pisnoy said.
John Prom, the Manhattan branch manager for Real Estate Mortgage Network, offers other tips on coping with the income requirement. A couple of portfolio lenders are still issuing loans without verifying income, he said, but their interest rates are a little higher. So are down payments, at 30 to 40 percent.
In addition, some lenders qualify income-deficient, asset-rich retirees by using a program known as asset depletion.
''They take a fraction of your assets, amortize it and apply it as income,'' Mr. Prom said.
Asset depletion was ultimately the strategy used by Sterling National Bank to qualify Mr. Evans, according to Tony Jao, a regional sales manager.
But by the time Sterling was ready to close, Mr. Evans had grown so frustrated that he had applied to a second bank, HSBC. It interpreted his income differently, given that he could work remotely, and approved his loan in four weeks. He ultimately took his business there.
Mr. Evans says the application process wouldn't have irked him so had he known what to expect. ''I was in the advertising business for 40 years,'' he said, ''and the rule was always underpromise and overperform. That's what part of the problem was here.''

HEADLINE: Does Class Size Count?

BYLINE: By SARA MOSLE. 
Sara Mosle is a sixth-grade English teacher, a journalist and the author of a forthcoming book about a 1937 school explosion in New London, Tex.

 BODY:
As states cut education budgets in response to the nation's continuing economic woes, student-to-teacher ratios are again on the rise after decades of decline. This resurrects an age-old debate in American education: does class size really matter?
To many educators, the answer seems obvious: Teachers who have fewer students can give each child more attention and tailored instruction. And parents agree. For years, annual surveys conducted by the New York City Department of Education have shown that the top priority of school parents is reducing class size, far outpacing ''more effective leadership,'' ''more teacher training,'' ''more or better art programs,'' ''more challenging courses'' and both ''more preparation for state tests'' and ''less preparation for state tests.'' 
But the data on class size is not conclusive, if only because, in the last quarter-century, there's been just one proper randomized, controlled study in the United States to measure, at sufficient scale, the effect of smaller and larger classes on student achievement. Known as Project STAR, it found that smaller classes do produce lasting gains, especially for economically disadvantaged and minority-group students.
Hiring more teachers, however, is expensive, and some researchers and policy makers insist that reducing class size is not cost-effective, compared with other possible reforms, and has been oversold to schools. They point to states like California and Florida that have spent billions of taxpayer dollars to reduce pupil-to-teacher ratios without, they argue, a commensurate increase in student performance.
Diverse figures including Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Bill Gates have coalesced around a new idea: why not increase class sizes for the best teachers and use the resulting budgetary savings to pay these best teachers more and to help train educators who need improvement? Yes, each class might be bigger on average but at least each child would stand a better chance of having a great teacher, which would-be reformers say is more important.
The proposal is intriguing, and some teachers may be on board. Matthew Chingos, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, has cited a national survey by the journal Education Next and Harvard's Program on Education Policy and Governance that found that 42 percent of teachers would gladly accept a $10,000 raise to forgo a three-student reduction in class size. Yet perhaps more striking, 47 percent of teachers said they would turn down this substantial pay increase to have just three students fewer in class. It's unclear if the teachers who want the extra money are the same ones schools hope to retain and reward. But the bigger problem is that class size is already increasing while there still isn't a mechanism to identify top-flight teachers and offer them more students for more pay; nor is there any assurance that parents, given a choice, would embrace these larger classes for their children.
In addition, while the idea is conceivable at the elementary level, where a single teacher typically teaches all subjects and most schools have several teachers per grade, it's harder to picture in many junior high or high schools, which may have only one chemistry or American history teacher. Also, how would distinctions between average and exceptional teachers affect collaboration, and how frequently would these ratings be revised? Upending salaries and teachers' schedules every year could destabilize schools.
Once you start to think about how the plan would play out, it begins to seem fantastical. Certainly, any widespread implementation is years away. Meanwhile, students will continue to languish in ever larger classes.
So here's a proposal for getting past this familiar stalemate: Secretary Duncan, Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Gates and other teacher-quality advocates should agree to fight -- hard -- to keep class sizes small for a limited population of at-risk students. That way economically disadvantaged and minority-group students, who Project STAR undeniably proved can benefit most from low student-to-teacher ratios, won't have to suffer through larger classes while waiting for better teachers.
In return, advocates of reducing class size agree to support pilot programs for creating more-students-for-more-pay classrooms to see if the plan has any takers among everyday teachers and parents and whether this theory actually works and is cost-effective in the real world.
I don't think either side is likely to be satisfied with this compromise, but both might have something to gain. Secretary Duncan, Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Gates need to develop more grass-roots support among parents who distrust many of their reform ideas and who continue to believe that class size counts. Parents would most likely find it reassuring if reformers demonstrated a willingness to phase in such changes only after test districts have demonstrated their effectiveness.
At the same time, education budgets are contracting, and the number of students per teacher is probably going up nationwide no matter what. Organizations like Parents Across America, which has lobbied for indiscriminate and far more costly across-the-board reductions in class size, might help preserve smaller classes for those children who most need them and would demonstrate their willingness to experiment with innovation. One class size need not fit all.
Deal?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With an Old Factory, Philadelphia Is Hoping To Draw New Teachers

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- A Victorian-era dye factory is taking on a new role to help this city's troubled public school system attract and retain teachers.
Two redbrick buildings in the up-and-coming but still gritty South Kensington section of Philadelphia are being converted into apartments and offices intended to house teachers and nonprofit educational organizations in what the developers hope will become a cohesive community.
When the renovation is complete, 60 percent of the buildings' 114 apartments will be reserved for teachers, who will be offered a 25 percent discount on market rent -- paying about $1,000 a month for a one-bedroom unit in a neighborhood where they typically rent for $1,300. 
The remaining apartments will be available to the public. In addition, a quarter of the 160,000-square-foot space is being turned into offices for education-related nonprofit groups like Teach for America, which will use 10,000 square feet of renovated space as its regional headquarters.
The buildings, scheduled to be ready in time for the 2014-15 school year, will have conference rooms, a coffee shop, a health club and a copy center to help teachers with their lesson plans.
The idea of bringing educators together in an affordable, supportive housing complex is intended to make teaching in city public schools a more attractive option -- particularly for those new to the profession -- and to reduce the risks of burnout.
''It's an especially hard job for young teachers who relocate from other cities and find themselves among tough students in poor neighborhoods,'' said Greg Hill, a principal, along with Gabe Canuso, of D3 Real Estate Development, which is leading the $36 million project. ''We're creating a community of like-minded people.''
The complex, renamed Oxford Mills, is modeled on two similar centers in Baltimore, where there is now a waiting list of about 70 teachers for 96 apartments that have been designated for teachers and others in education since 2009.
The developers are able to offer rental discounts because of state and federal tax credits based on the historic nature of the properties and on the economically challenged nature of their locations, said Donald Manekin, a developer of the Baltimore buildings and a partner in the Philadelphia project through his company, the Seawall Development Corporation.
''But for the tax credits, these projects couldn't happen,'' said Mr. Manekin, a former chief operating officer of Baltimore City Public Schools. The Baltimore buildings were the first of their kind in the United States, he said.
The Baltimore centers were backed by Teach for America, which trains recent college graduates to teach in poor neighborhoods. It identified school systems in New Orleans, Philadelphia and Washington as targets for an expansion of the program.
Matt Gould, Teach for America's vice president for administration, said that he had no data on the retention of teachers who have lived in the Baltimore centers, but that there had been anecdotal reports that teachers want to live among their peers and close to the communities in which they work.
''It allows them to have safe, affordable housing,'' Mr. Gould said. ''It's a recruiting tool.''
The buildings that will house the Philadelphia center began life in 1875 as the Quaker City Dye Works. The complex became a warehouse for textile waste in the early 20th century and in the 1960s was converted into a lamp factory, which went out of business in the early 2000s. The complex, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, was bought in 2012 by the current developers.
After considering other sections of Philadelphia, the developers chose a neighborhood that was once a thriving manufacturing center but is now pockmarked with empty lots.
While the postindustrial landscape, just a few miles from downtown Philadelphia, may be uninviting, it is sandwiched between the fashionable neighborhood of Northern Liberties and the tough but gentrifying Fishtown section. Local rents are already rising, Mr. Hill said.
For the school district, the project is part of the efforts to improve a notoriously low-performing system.
The superintendent, William R. Hite Jr., who attended the groundbreaking last month, said the project would help retain teachers in the district, where only 64 percent of students graduated on time in 2012 and 82 percent are classified as economically disadvantaged.
Dr. Hite said the development would also help Philadelphia identify itself as a city that is seeking teaching talent at a time when the district is closing schools and consolidating the student population in response to falling enrollment.
Teachers living among other teachers are less likely to experience social isolation, he said.
''Unlike other professions, individuals may feel very much alone,'' Dr. Hite said in an interview. ''They go back to their respective places, and they don't have other individuals with whom they can share their challenges or successes.''

HEADLINE: In Latin America, U.S. Focus Shifts From Drug War to Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Michael D. Shear reported from San José, and Randal C. Archibold from Mexico City.

 BODY:
SAN JOSÉ, Costa Rica -- In February 2009, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. declared that international drug trafficking posed ''a sustained, serious threat'' to Americans. Two months later, President Obama, in his first visit as president to Mexico, made it clear that no issue dominated relations between the two countries more, saying drug cartels there were ''sowing chaos in our communities.''
Last week, Mr. Obama returned to capitals in Latin America with a vastly different message. Relationships with countries racked by drug violence and organized crime should focus more on economic development and less on the endless battles against drug traffickers and organized crime capos that have left few clear victors. The countries, Mexico in particular, need to set their own course on security, with the United States playing more of a backing role.
That approach runs the risk of being seen as kowtowing to governments more concerned about their public image than the underlying problems tarnishing it. 
Mexico, which is eager to play up its economic growth, has mounted an aggressive effort to play down its crime problems, going as far as to encourage the news media to avoid certain slang words in reports.
''The problem will not just go away,'' said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. ''It needs to be tackled head-on, with a comprehensive strategy that includes but goes beyond stimulating economic growth and alleviating poverty.
''Obama becomes vulnerable to the charge of downplaying the region's overriding issue, and the chief obstacle to economic progress,'' he added. ''It is fine to change the narrative from security to economics as long as the reality on the ground reflects and fits with the new story line.''
Administration officials insist that Mr. Obama remains cleareyed about the security challenges, but the new emphasis corresponds with a change in focus by the Mexican government. The new Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, took office in December vowing to reduce the violence that exploded under the militarized approach to the drug war adopted by his predecessor, Felipe Calderón. That effort left about 60,000 Mexicans dead and appears not to have significantly damaged the drug-trafficking industry.
In addition to a focus on reducing violence, which some critics have interpreted as taking a softer line on the drug gangs, Mr. Peña Nieto has also moved to reduce American involvement in law enforcement south of the border. With friction and mistrust between American and Mexican law enforcement agencies growing, Mr. Obama suggested that the United States would no longer seek to dominate the security agenda.
''It is obviously up to the Mexican people to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations, including the United States,'' he said, standing next to Mr. Peña Nieto on Thursday in Mexico City. ''But the main point I made to the president is that we support the Mexican government's focus on reducing violence, and we look forward to continuing our good cooperation in any way that the Mexican government deems appropriate.''
In some ways, conceding leadership of the drug fight to Mexico hews to a guiding principle of Mr. Obama's foreign policy, in which American supremacy is played down, at least publicly, in favor of a multilateral approach.
But that philosophy could collide with the concerns of lawmakers in Washington, who have expressed frustration with what they see as a lack of clarity in Mexico's security plans. And security analysts say the entrenched corruption in Mexican law enforcement has long clouded the partnership with their American counterparts.
Putting Mexico in the driver's seat on security marks a shift in a balance of power that has always tipped to the United States and, analysts said, will carry political risk as Congress negotiates an immigration bill that is expected to include provisions for tighter border security.
''If there is a perception in the U.S. Congress that security cooperation is weakening, that could play into the hands of those who oppose immigration reform,'' said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a counternarcotics expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
''Realistically, the border is as tight as could be and there have been few spillovers of the violence from Mexico into the U.S.,'' she added, but perceptions count in Washington ''and can be easily distorted.''
''Drugs today are not very important to the U.S. public over all,'' she added, ''but they are important to committed drug warriors who are politically powerful.''
Representative Michael T. McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, has warned against the danger of drug cartels forming alliances with terrorist groups. ''While these threats exist, you would be surprised to find that the administration thinks its work here is done,'' he wrote in an opinion article for Roll Call last month, pressing for more border controls in the bill.
The Obama administration has said any evidence of such cooperation is very thin, but even without terrorist connections, drug gangs pose threats to peace and security.
Human rights advocates said they feared the United States would ease pressure on Mexico to investigate disappearances and other abuses at the hands of the police and military, who have received substantial American support.
The shift in approach ''suggests that the Obama administration either doesn't object to these abusive practices or is only willing to raise such concerns when it's politically convenient,'' said José Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division.
Still, administration officials have said there may have been an overemphasis on the bellicose language and high-profile hunts for cartel leaders while the real problem of lawlessness worsens.
American antidrug aid is shifting more toward training police and shoring up judicial systems that have allowed criminals to kill with impunity in Mexico and Central America.
United States officials said Mr. Obama remains well aware of the region's problems with security, even as he is determined that they not overshadow the economic opportunities.
It is clear Mr. Obama, whatever his words four years ago, now believes there has been too much security talk.
In a speech to Mexican students on Friday, Mr. Obama urged people in the two countries to look beyond a one-dimensional focus on what he called real security concerns, saying it is ''time for us to put the old mind-sets aside.'' And he repeated the theme later in the day in Costa Rica, lamenting that when it comes to the United States and Central America, ''so much of the focus ends up being on security.''
''We also have to recognize that problems like narco-trafficking arise in part when a country is vulnerable because of poverty, because of institutions that are not working for the people, because young people don't see a brighter future ahead,'' Mr. Obama said in a news conference with Laura Chinchilla, the president of Costa Rica.

HEADLINE: Plans to Harness Chinese River's Power Threaten a Region

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Patrick Zuo contributed research.

 BODY:
BINGZHONGLUO, China -- From its crystalline beginnings as a rivulet seeping from a glacier on the Tibetan Himalayas to its broad, muddy amble through the jungles of Myanmar, the Nu River is one of Asia's wildest waterways, its 1,700-mile course unimpeded as it rolls toward the Andaman Sea.
But the Nu's days as one of the region's last free-flowing rivers are dwindling. The Chinese government stunned environmentalists this year by reviving plans to build a series of hydropower dams on the upper reaches of the Nu, the heart of a Unesco World Heritage site in China's southwest Yunnan Province that ranks among the world's most ecologically diverse and fragile places.
Critics say the project will force the relocation of tens of thousands of ethnic minorities in the highlands of Yunnan and destroy the spawning grounds for a score of endangered fish species. Geologists warn that constructing the dams in a seismically active region could threaten those living downstream. Next month, Unesco is scheduled to discuss whether to include the area on its list of endangered places. 
Among the biggest losers could be the millions of farmers and fishermen across the border in Myanmar and Thailand who depend on the Salween, as the river is called in Southeast Asia, for their sustenance. ''We're talking about a cascade of dams that will fundamentally alter the ecosystems and resources for downstream communities that depend on the river,'' said Katy Yan, China program coordinator at International Rivers, an advocacy group.
Suspended in 2004 by Wen Jiabao, then the prime minister, and officially resuscitated shortly before his retirement in March, the project is increasing long-simmering regional tensions over Beijing's plans to dam or divert a number of rivers that flow from China to other thirsty nations in its quest to bolster economic growth and reduce the country's dependency on coal.
According to its latest energy plan, the government aims to begin construction on about three dozen hydroelectric projects across the country, which together will have more than twice the hydropower capacity of the United States.
So far China has been largely unresponsive to the concerns of its neighbors, among them India, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Russia and Vietnam. Since 1997, China has declined to sign a United Nations water-sharing treaty that would govern the 13 major transnational rivers on its territory. ''To fight for every drop of water or die'' is how China's former water resources minister, Wang Shucheng, once described the nation's water policy.
Here in Bingzhongluo, a peaceful backpacker magnet, those who treasure the fast-moving, jade-green beauty of the Nu say the four proposed dams in Yunnan and the one already under construction in Tibet would irrevocably alter what guidebooks refer to as the Grand Canyon of the East. A soaring, 370-mile-long gorge carpeted with thick forests, the area is home to roughly half of China's animal species, many of them endangered, including the snow leopard, the black snub-nosed monkey and the red panda.
Clinging improbably to the alpine peaks are mist-shrouded villages whose residents are among the area's dozen or so indigenous tribes, most with their own languages. ''The project will be good for the local government, but it will be a disaster for the local residents,'' said Wan Li, 42, who in 2003 left behind his big-city life as an accountant in the provincial capital, Kunming, to open a youth hostel here. ''They will lose their culture, their traditions and their livelihood, and we will be left with a placid, lifeless reservoir.''
As one of two major rivers in China still unimpeded by dams, the Nu has a fiercely devoted following among environmentalists who have grown despondent over the destruction of many of China's waterways. The Ministry of Water Resources released a survey in March saying that 23,000 rivers had disappeared entirely and many of the nation's most storied rivers had become degraded by pollution. The mouth of the Yellow River is little more than an effluent-fouled trickle, and the once-mighty Yangtze has been tamed by the Three Gorges Dam, a $25 billion project that displaced 1.4 million people.
For many advocates, the Nu has become something of a last stand. ''Why can't China have just one river that isn't destroyed by humans?'' asked Wang Yongchen, a well-known environmentalist in Beijing who has visited the area a dozen times in recent years.
Opponents say it is no coincidence that the project was revived shortly before the retirement of Mr. Wen, a populist whose decision to halt construction was hailed as a landmark victory for the nation's fledgling environmental movement. Although he did not kill the project, Mr. Wen, a trained geologist, vowed it would not proceed without an exhaustive environmental impact assessment.
No such assessment has been released. Given the government's goal of generating 15 percent of the nation's electricity from non-fossil fuel by 2020, few expect environmental concerns to slow the project, even if the original plan of 13 dams on the Nu has for now been scaled back to 5. ''Building a dam is about managing conflicts between man and nature, but without a scientific understanding of this project, it can only lead to calamity,'' said Yang Yong, a geologist and an environmentalist.
Some experts say that China has little choice but to move forward with dams on the Nu, given the nation's voracious power needs and an overreliance on coal that has contributed to record levels of smog in Beijing and other northern cities. Still, many environmentalists reject the government's assertion that hydropower is ''green energy,'' noting that reservoirs created by dams swallow vast amounts of forest and field.
Also overlooked, they say, is the methane gas and carbon dioxide produced by decomposing vegetation, significant contributors to global warming.
''By depicting dams as green, China is seeking to justify its dam-building spree,'' said Brahma Chellaney, a water resources expert at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. Mr. Chellaney said that Beijing had also failed to take into account the huge amounts of silt retained by dams that invariably deprive downstream farmers of the seasonal nutrients that have traditionally replenished overworked soil.
That the Nu has remained untouched even as China has corralled most of its rivers is a testament to the isolation of northwest Yunnan, a two-day drive from Kunming along a white-knuckle road carved into the canyon walls. Every few miles are the scars of recent landslides, a jarring reminder of the area's geologic instability.
Despite the 2004 moratorium, work on the Nu River dams never really stopped, although Huadian, the state-owned hydropower giant, has ramped up planning efforts since the Chinese government removed any obstacles.
Late last month, as dusk fell on Maji, a proposed dam site, the sound of explosions echoed through the valley as workers, toiling around the clock, blasted test holes deep into canyon walls. Li Jiawang, 33, a laborer, said engineers were still trying to determine whether the rock was strong enough to support a dam several hundred feet high.
Huadian did not respond to interview requests, nor did the Ministry of Water Resources. But word that the project is moving forward has already drawn many outsiders, threatening to upend the delicate patchwork of ethnic populations. Hong Feng, 45, a migrant from Hunan Province who recently opened a roadside shop near Maji, said that most of his customers were dam workers from other parts of China. ''We're here to make our fortune, and then we'll leave,'' he said.
Most of the estimated 60,000 people who are likely to be displaced from the flooded, fertile lowlands do not have that option. They are largely subsistence farmers, and with nearly every level patch of land spoken for, many will be relocated to dense housing complexes like the one in New Xiaoshaba, a 124-unit project begun before the dam project was suspended.
''We used to grow so many watermelons we couldn't eat them all, but now we have to buy everything,'' said Li Tian, 25, a member of the Lisu ethnic group whose family was evicted from its land and who now works part time in a walnut processing plant.
While local leaders have been tight-lipped about relocation plans, they have worked hard in recent years to cast the project as a gift that will alleviate poverty in one of China's poorest regions.
But Yu Shangping, 26, a farmer in Chala, a picturesque jumble of wooden houses hard by the Nu, objects to the notion that he and his neighbors are impoverished, saying the land and the river provide for nearly all their needs. ''We've worked hard to build this place,'' he said, ''but when the government wants to construct a dam, there's nothing you can do about it.''

HEADLINE: When the Global Economy Was on the Brink

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS

 BODY:
NEIL IRWIN admires central bankers, and maybe he has a point. With the interplay of Congress and the presidency bordering on the dysfunctional these days, is there a more accomplished Washington figure than the scholarly and respected Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve?
Europe still lurches from one numbing financial debacle to another, with no resolution in sight. For better or (as many say) worse, the European Central Bank has tried to rescue governments from looming defaults on debt, imposing pain and sacrifice on Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and, most recently, Cyprus. Though critics say the European bank is using monetary policy to force fundamental changes better left to elected politicians, others say that at least it has the backbone to act. 
Mr. Irwin, a Washington Post columnist who covered the Fed in the financial crisis, has provided an accessible, engrossing account of the tribulations that Mr. Bernanke, with Mervyn A. King of the Bank of England and Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank, endured in pulling the world financial system back from collapse. Mr. Irwin's new book, ''The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire'' (Penguin Press, $29.95), describes a learned order of government bankers and economists who meet often, sharing ''a closeness unheard-of elsewhere in international relations.''
''They speak the same language,'' he says, observing that central bankers ''understand more deeply than perhaps anyone else where other countries are coming from.'' Why do we care? ''Mankind has given them incredible power.''
Many revelations of ''what really happened'' behind the scenes in politics tend to rely on one or two good sources who blab. Not true of this one. Mr. Irwin seems to have talked with everyone, read the right scholarly papers and interviewed important dissenters in the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bundesbank. Much of his sourcing was on ''deep background,'' but he has produced a well-rounded account.
He has a nice touch for translating central banking's mysteries, opaque and forbidding, into understandable English. He is astute in describing the internal and external politics of institutions traditionally expected to remain above politics of the usual sort. He may tell you more than you want to know about the subtleties of picking a new president for the European Central Bank. But he shows how in its hour of need, the Fed, supposedly a political naif, was more than a match for its Congressional foes in the financial crisis.
In 2009, after the wildly unpopular bailout of big banks, political rage toward the Fed was bipartisan and extreme. Christopher J. Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, planned to build a landmark regulatory reform bill around stripping the Fed of its power to regulate banks. The libertarian Representative Ron Paul, a Republican, was pushing a proposal for Congress to audit the institution, a mandate that sailed through the House. Mr. Bernanke's first term as chairman was running out.
Senator Dodd saw his proposal melt like ice in the noonday sun. Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, insisted that the very largest banks remain under the Fed's watch. Smaller banks lobbied to keep the Fed's 12 regional reserve banks as their regulator, making a populist case that the arrangement was a counterweight to dominance by Washington and New York.
One Dodd proposal would have required presidential appointees, rather than each bank's board of directors, to select the 12 reserve bank presidents, including the powerful New York Fed president, but that idea went nowhere. The Paul demand was watered down to tolerable. And Mr. Bernanke, easy to denounce but too capable to be spared, comfortably won reappointment.
Though the book's accounts of the euro zone's crises are at least as intricate, savvy and detailed, the Fed inevitably takes center stage. Mr. Irwin is by no means a starry-eyed acolyte, yet there is little doubt his sympathies lie with Mr. Bernanke. He admires the chairman's efforts to devise novel ways to pump money into a faltering economy. ''The Fed created so many emergency lending facilities,'' Mr. Irwin says, ''that a document just listing and summarizing them required a legal-size piece of paper covered in small type.''
Mr. Bernanke's Fed did what he decided it had to do, and never looked back. ''For nearly a century, the Fed had been lender of last resort to American banks,'' Mr. Irwin writes. ''In the space of three months, it expanded that role to encompass both banks headquartered across Europe and the masters of the investment universe on Wall Street.''
The author has written a squarely centrist account, echoing conventional wisdom that might place Mr. Bernanke second only to the sainted Paul A. Volcker in the pantheon of Fed chairmen. The book mentions but never really explores concerns by more conservative bankers that the central banks have fatally jeopardized their independence by plunging into political thickets beyond their brief.
Nor does the book give more than passing attention to criticism from the left, voiced most insistently by Paul Krugman, who in New York Times columns loudly deplored ''Europe's Austerity Madness.'' Though Mr. Bernanke vowed that the Fed would never repeat its dreadful mistakes of willful inaction during the Depression, Mr. Krugman accused him last year of doing just that, being intimidated into an ''abdication'' by irate Republicans.
Yet there are limits to the central bankers' accomplishments and an apt double meaning to Mr. Irwin's title, ''The Alchemists.'' Wizardry, yes, but the true alchemists never succeeded in transforming ordinary metals into gold. For all the bankers' learned theories and late-night deliberations, American economic growth remains sluggish and Europe still suffers from rising unemployment and stagflation.
So, Mr. Irwin writes, their triumph is what didn't happen: ''As ugly as the global economy looked five years after the onset of crisis, no war had broken out among the great global powers. Europe remained united. There had been no confidence-shattering hyperinflation or, outside of perhaps Greece and Spain, economic depression. None of this was a certainty.'' As he puts it: ''It may seem like damning with faint praise, but a catastrophe averted is no small thing.''

HEADLINE: Dow 15,000, And the Big Disconnect

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IT'S a ho-hum economy, at best. Four years after the end of the Great Recession, gross domestic product appears to be growing at a lackluster pace, labor productivity is lagging and, despite a slight improvement last month, the unemployment rate is still a painfully high 7.5 percent.
Yet in the financial markets, it's a much happier world. An epic rally in stocks has been roaring ahead, with the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday briefly surpassing 15,000 for the first time.
Thanks to the intervention of the Federal Reserve, the bond market remains improbably strong, too. The benchmark 10-year Treasury rate fell as low as 1.612 percent last week, driving prices, which move in the opposite direction, to stratospheric levels. That helped Apple sell $17 billion of bonds at yields once reserved for the sovereign debt of only the safest governments. 
In short, it's been a giddy time to be an investor. But while the financial markets are soaring, the real economy appears to be mired in an endless slog. That discrepancy raises a troubling question: How long can financial portfolios continue to swell if wages, employment and corporate revenue remain constrained?
Unfortunately, there is no clear answer.
''The beauty of economics is that we are still arguing about the causes of the start and the end of the Great Depression,'' said James W. Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ''We'll be debating these questions for the rest of our lives.''
Economists and market strategists have plenty of opinions, however, and Mr. Paulsen, who takes a glass-half-full perspective on the current situation, is no exception.
He says the stock market rally can continue so long as the economy keeps growing at what he prefers to call a ''modest'' pace, rather than a disappointing one. Despite evidence to the contrary -- most crucially, stubbornly high unemployment -- he maintains that the recovery is actually quite good under the circumstances. And, he said, it's robust enough for American corporations to churn out solid profits that will bolster stock returns.
That provides no comfort for people who are out of work or earning inadequate wages, he said, but it may reassure investors and be useful for public policy.
Why? Mr. Paulsen has been arguing for years that the annual rate of economic growth is likely to remain in the low single digits because of a long-term demographic shift: the aging of the American population. The working-age population has been expanding less rapidly, at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent from 1986 to 2012, down from 1.7 percent from 1960 to 1985.
Mr. Paulsen favors liberalizing immigration rules, which would reverse this trend and spur more robust growth, he said. Until that happens, he said, ''it's possible that 4 percent annual growth is all we are going to get, and we should be happy with it.''
In the first quarter of this year, the annualized G.D.P. growth rate was only 2.5 percent, he points out, but it would have been 4 percent if the effects of government budget cuts had been excluded. Government austerity is a drag on the economy now, he said, but is likely to become less severe at some point, when a longer-term solution replaces the draconian budget sequestration.
Whatever the reason for less-than-stellar economic growth, American companies have been reaping handsome profits. And corporate America's ability to preserve its profit margins has been a linchpin of the market rally, said David J. Kostin, the chief United States equity strategist at Goldman Sachs.
An important metric, recurring profit margin, has plateaued near 9 percent, according to his calculations, and as long as it continues at that level, it should be enough to propel the market upward. Last week was the heart of earnings season for American companies. More than 80 percent of the companies in the S.& P. 500 have reported results for the first quarter and, by and large, they fared well, he said.
''The stock market is trading at fair value today, and I think it can continue to climb higher in line with earnings growth,'' he said.
Goldman projects that the American economy will grow at a rate of 2 percent this year, he said. In the quarter, sales reported so far at S.& P. 500 companies -- which include revenue from faster-growing markets like China's -- were virtually flat, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But profits grew 5.7 percent. ''We aren't seeing an extraordinary level of economic growth,'' he said, ''so companies need to take other measures to enhance profits.''
ONE thing that companies are doing is ''being very careful about costs and about hiring,'' he said, which helps explain the anemic labor market. And by borrowing at low rates, businesses can use the money for productive purposes or to engage in financial engineering.
They can buy back shares -- thus increasing earnings per share -- or increase dividends or both, which is what Apple plans to do with its borrowed billions. (Apple is keeping a cash hoard of more than $100 billion overseas, at least partly to avoid incurring a tax liability in the United States.)
Low interest rates will be with us a good while longer, Fed policy makers reiterated last week. They said they'd keep rates low as long as inflation was subdued and unemployment stayed high. In fact, they suggested that they might even add stimulus -- increasing their $85 billion a month in bond purchases -- if economic conditions worsen.
''For the stock market the Federal Reserve is the big wild card,'' said Ed Clissold, United States market strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla. ''As long as the Fed and the other central banks keep pumping liquidity into the economy, our base case is that the cyclical bull market in stocks can continue.''
But Mr. Clissold said the lack of meaningful sales growth for S.& P. 500 companies concerned him. Weak sales could presage a drop in profit margins, he said. And if profit margins decline sharply -- by about 10 percent or so -- history suggests that it's time to say goodbye to the bull market. And that's the least of it.
A sharp drop in sales and profit margins might also be an early indicator of an outright recession. That would bring untold pain to many people, not just stock investors.
For now, though, while he is scrutinizing the numbers closely, they appear to be benign.
It may not be a great economy, but the financial markets are partying on.

HEADLINE: Friend of the Corporation

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
NOT long after 10 a.m. on March 27, a restless audience waited for the Supreme Court to hear arguments in the second of two historic cases involving same-sex marriage. First, however, Justice Antonin Scalia attended to another matter. He announced that the court was throwing out an antitrust class action that subscribers brought against Comcast, the nation's largest cable company.
Almost no one in the courtroom paid attention, despite Justice Scalia's characteristically animated delivery, and the next day's news coverage was dominated by accounts of the arguments on same-sex marriage. That was no surprise: the Supreme Court's business decisions are almost always overshadowed by cases on controversial social issues.
But the business docket reflects something truly distinctive about the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. While the current court's decisions, over all, are only slightly more conservative than those from the courts led by Chief Justices Warren E. Burger and William H. Rehnquist, according to political scientists who study the court, its business rulings are another matter. They have been, a new study finds, far friendlier to business than those of any court since at least World War II. 
In the eight years since Chief Justice Roberts joined the court, it has allowed corporations to spend freely in elections in the Citizens United case, has shielded them from class actions and human rights suits, and has made arbitration the favored way to resolve many disputes. Business groups say the Roberts court's decisions have helped combat frivolous lawsuits, while plaintiffs' lawyers say the rulings have destroyed legitimate claims for harm from faulty products, discriminatory practices and fraud.
Whether the Roberts court is unusually friendly to business has been the subject of repeated discussion, much of it based on anecdotes and studies based on small slices of empirical evidence. The new study, by contrast, takes a careful and comprehensive look at some 2,000 decisions from 1946 to 2011.
Published last month in The Minnesota Law Review, the study ranked the 36 justices who served on the court over those 65 years by the proportion of their pro-business votes; all five of the current court's more conservative members were in the top 10. But the study's most striking finding was that the two justices most likely to vote in favor of business interests since 1946 are the most recent conservative additions to the court, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., both appointed by President George W. Bush.
The study was prepared by Lee Epstein, who teaches law and political science at the University of Southern California; William M. Landes, an economist at the University of Chicago; and Judge Richard A. Posner, of the federal appeals court in Chicago, who teaches law at the University of Chicago.
In the Comcast case, subscribers seeking $875 million in damages charged that the company had swapped territory with other cable companies to gain market power and raise prices. But the legal issue before the court was technical. It concerned the sort of evidence needed to allow two million subscribers in the Philadelphia area to band together as a class.
Justice Scalia said the plaintiffs' evidence was not enough to allow them to proceed as a class. They could still, he said, pursue their complaints individually. But the difficulty of mounting such suits over insignificant sums would not make them very attractive to most lawyers.
The decision, however, went far beyond the Comcast subscribers. By reaffirming Wal-Mart v. Dukes, a 2011 blockbuster case in which the court threw out a large employment sex discrimination class, the Comcast case limited class actions more broadly.
The question of whether plaintiffs have enough in common to sue as a class is different from whether they deserve to win. The first question is generally resolved early in the case. The second one may await trial.
But the Wal-Mart and Comcast decisions said the two questions often overlap and may call for an early answer. The decisions essentially required early scrutiny -- by a judge, not a jury -- of the ultimate legal question in high-stakes cases, sometimes before all the relevant evidence has been gathered. This delighted business groups, which have pushed to limit class actions.
''The court is telling lower courts across the country they really do have to fulfill their gate-keeping function and keep these meritless classes out of the courts,'' said Kate Comerford Todd, a lawyer with the litigation unit of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
Justices deeply unhappy with a decision sometimes read their dissents from the bench. It happens perhaps three times a year. Justice Scalia, in remarks at George Washington University in February, said such oral dissents were a way to call attention to a grave misstep.
''I only do it in really significant cases,'' he said, ''where I think the court's decision is going to have a really bad effect upon the law and upon society, a really, really big case.''
By that standard, the dissenters thought the Comcast decision was very bad indeed. It gave rise to two oral dissents, from the two senior members of the court's liberal wing, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
Justice Ginsburg accused the justices in the majority of unseemly judicial gamesmanship. She said they had reframed the legal issue in the case so they could rule for Comcast. ''Thus the plaintiffs had no unclouded opportunity to brief and argue with precision the issue the court decides against them,'' she said. ''And that's not cricket.''
THE Supreme Court decides one case at a time, and its jurisprudence is the sum of incremental and sometimes inconsistent rulings driven by quirky facts and shifting judicial alliances.
The law, that is to say, does not always move in a straight line, and the Roberts court's decisions have not all favored corporations. Employees suing over retaliation for raising discrimination claims have fared quite well, for example. Nor has the court always been receptive to companies claiming that state rules and injury awards from state juries should be struck down because they are in conflict with federal laws.
But the court's general track record, particularly in low-profile but important procedural rulings, has been decidedly pro-business, said Arthur R. Miller, a law professor at New York University. The upshot, he said, is that businesses are free to run their operations without fear of liability for the harm they cause to consumers, employees and people injured by their products.
''The Supreme Court has altered federal procedure in dramatic ways, one step at a time, to favor the business community,'' he said, by, among other things, ''increased grants of summary judgment, tightening scientific evidence, rejecting class actions, heightening the pleading barrier and wholesale diversions into arbitration.''
In a despairing overview published last month in The New York University Law Review, Professor Miller criticized many rulings from the Roberts court, including the Wal-Mart decision, which rejected a class of some 1.5 million female employees, and AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, which allowed companies to escape class actions by insisting on one-by-one arbitrations, even over trivial amounts, in standard-form contracts.
Jason M. Halper, a lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, said the collective message of those and related cases was clear: ''When you take all of them together, the effect is certainly to make the use of class actions much more difficult.''
It is easy to understand why companies hate class actions. Once a class is certified, the damages sought are often so enormous that the only rational calculation is to settle even if the chances of losing at trial are small. The costs of litigation -- for lawyers, experts and the exchange of information -- are also far larger in class actions. And it is not always clear that the plaintiffs, as opposed to their lawyers, receive very much in the settlements.
Plaintiffs' lawyers, on the other hand, say class actions are the only way to vindicate small harms caused to many people. The victim of, say, a fraudulent charge for a few dollars on a billing statement will never sue. But a lawyer representing a million such people has an incentive to press the claim.
''Realistically,'' Professor Miller wrote, ''the choice for class members is between collective access to the judicial system or no access at all.''
So the Supreme Court's rulings making it harder to cross the class-certification threshold have had profound consequences in the legal balance of power between businesses and people who say they have been harmed.
Arbitration, in which the two sides agree to resolve disputes outside of court using informal procedures, is more complicated.
Depending on how they are structured, arbitrations can offer benefits in speed and cost to both sides, though the car rental companies or cellphone stores that have customers sign nonnegotiable contracts presumably do not have their best interests at heart.
Minor claims in arbitration raise harder questions. In theory, there is no reason that consumers and others could not join together in a mass arbitration, just as they file class actions in court.
But the AT&T Mobility decision limited that recourse for consumers. The case was brought by a California couple who objected to a $30 charge for what was presented as a free cellphone. They had signed a ''take it or leave it'' form that required them to resolve disputes through arbitration and barred them from banding together with others, whether in arbitration or in court.
The Supreme Court said the contract was lawful, and in doing so it gave businesses a powerful tool.
''The decision basically lets companies escape class actions, so long as they do so by means of arbitration agreements,'' Brian T. Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, said on the day of the decision. ''This is a game-changer for businesses. It's one of the most important and favorable cases for businesses in a very long time.''
The central legal issues in the Wal-Mart, AT&T Mobility and Comcast cases were decided by 5-to-4 votes. In each, the justices in the majority were appointed by Republican presidents and the dissenters by Democratic ones.
Since World War II, the Minnesota Law Review study found, ''justices appointed by Republican presidents are notably more favorable to business than justices appointed by Democratic presidents.'' Indeed, it said, ''on the current court, no Republican-appointed justice is less favorable to business than any Democrat.''
That does not mean that the Roberts court's pro-business decisions are always decided by 5-to-4 votes. They are often lopsided or unanimous.
That is a consequence, Judge Posner said in an e-mail, of broader trends: ''American society as a whole is more pro-business than it was before Reagan and this is reflected in the votes of Democratic as well as Republican Supreme Court justices.''
In March, for instance, the court unanimously rejected an attempt by class-action lawyers in Arkansas to keep their case out of federal court by promising that their clients would accept less money than they might deserve. (The case had been filed in Miller County, Ark., where courts, according to business groups, are notorious for coercing large settlements from out-of-state defendants.)
But sometimes unanimity masks division. The most important business decision of the current term, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, severely limited human rights suits against corporations based on charges of complicity in abuses abroad. All nine justices agreed that the particular suit before them had to be dismissed, largely because every significant aspect of the case was foreign: the plaintiffs were Nigerian, the companies they sued were based in England and the Netherlands, and the atrocities the companies were said to have aided took place in Nigeria.
Yet the court split 5 to 4 along the usual lines about how far to leave the door open to similar suits. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, suggested that it would be the rare case indeed that was proper. Certainly, he said, it should not be enough that a multinational corporation does business in the United States. ''Corporations are often present in many countries,'' he wrote, ''and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.''
Justice Breyer, in dissent, said such suits could play an important role in bringing to justice ''torturers and perpetrators of genocide.''
THE Minnesota Law Review study did not rely on the common political science technique of coding each Supreme Court decision as conservative or liberal. To draw its main conclusions, it relied on a simpler formula, looking at cases with a business on one but not both sides. (The adversary might be an employee, job applicant, shareholder, union, environmental group or government agency.)
A vote for the business was counted as a pro-business vote.
By that standard, the study found, ''the Roberts court is indeed highly pro-business -- the conservatives extremely so and the liberals only moderately liberal.'' Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, who spoke up in the Comcast case, were only slightly less likely to vote for business than the median justice in the survey but were in the bottom six for such votes in 5-to-4 decisions.
The arrival of Chief Justice Roberts in 2005 and Justice Alito in 2006 seem to have affected the behavior of the justices already on the court. The probability that the other three more conservative members of the court -- Justices Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas -- would vote for business grew to 56 percent from 52 percent. And the probability that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer would do so dropped to 32 percent from 38 percent.
Scholars who look at doctrine rather than data also say there is something distinctive about the current court.
''The Roberts court is the most pro-business court since the mid-1930s,'' said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Irvine. ''I think this helps understand it far more than traditional liberal and conservative labels.''
Others are wary of generalizations. Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said the Roberts court was ''not particularly welcoming to efforts by plaintiffs' lawyers to open new avenues of litigation, but it has not done much to cut back on those avenues already established by prior cases.''
Business groups have been enthusiastic litigants in the Roberts court. Adam D. Chandler, a recent Yale Law School graduate and a Justice Department lawyer, published a new study along these lines on Scotusblog (noting that his views were not those of his employer). Looking at friend-of-the-court briefs supporting petitions seeking Supreme Court review over a roughly three-year period ended in August 2012, he found that pro-business and anti-regulatory groups accounted for more than three-quarters of the top 16 filers.
''My data indicate that, as the court shapes its docket, it hears conservative voices far more often than liberal ones, and the disparity is growing,'' he wrote.
He found that the Chamber of Commerce was ''the country's pre-eminent petition pusher,'' with 54 filings in the period. It also had an enviable success rate: the court grants one out of every hundred petitions; for ones supported by the chamber, it granted 32 percent.
Ms. Todd, the chamber lawyer, said her group would continue to be active. The aftermaths of the Wal-Mart and AT&T Mobility decisions, on class actions and arbitration, ''are really where a lot of our focus and resources are going right now,'' she said.
''These cases have a huge impact on the business community and on the American economy more broadly,'' Ms. Todd said.
The Comcast decision is just over a month old. But lower courts have already relied on it to reject class actions contending harm from defective trucks, poisoned drinking water, discrimination against disabled workers, misrepresentations in insurance policies and improperly docked wages.
Some of the plaintiffs in those cases will now pursue their claims in individual suits. But many will not, and the businesses accused of wrongdoing will, thanks to the Roberts court, breathe a little easier.
Advantage, Business: CITIZENS UNITED V. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION (2010) By a 5-to-4 vote, the court ruled that corporations and unions may spend freely in candidate elections.; WAL-MART STORES V. DUKES (2011): By a 5-to-4 vote, the court ruled that 1.5 million female employees of Wal-Mart did not have enough in common to pursue a class action contending sex discrimination.; AT&T MOBILITY V. CONCEPCION (2011): By a 5-to-4 vote, the court ruled that companies may avoid class actions by using standard-form arbitration agreements.; PLIVA INC. V. MENSING (2011): By a 5-to-4 vote, the court ruled that people harmed by unsafe generic drugs may not sue manufacturers under state law for failing to issue warnings about the risks associated with their products.; KIOBEL V. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM (2013): The court unanimously limited the sweep of a 1789 law that had been used to address human rights abuses abroad, but split 5 to 4 over what sorts of suits should still be allowed.

HEADLINE: In Waning Weeks Of the Legislature, It All Can Change

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
No issue is really dead as long as the Legislature is in town.
Lawmakers love to take things to the brink of legislative death and then revive them. They can make a relatively easy thing look surprisingly hard, then go home and recount their fantastic and ingenious rescues of vital bills that would otherwise have been sent to that great paper shredder in the sky.
The last three weeks of a legislative session are brutal. During the 20-week session, thousands of bills are filed, and fewer than one in four makes it to the finish line. In 2011, lawmakers filed 6,003 bills and constitutional amendments; only 1,390 passed, according to the Legislative Reference Library of Texas. 
Over the next few weeks, the parliamentary rules gradually remove paths to success. Most House legislation has to be handed to the Senate by the end of this week to survive. The rest of the month is a minefield of similar deadlines, all designed to limit what is written into the law books.
Headline issues get the full dramatic treatment. When the Texas House knocked down $2 billion in financing for water last week, the author, Representative Allan Ritter, Republican of Nederland, declared his legislation ''doorknob dead.''
It ain't so.
Mr. Ritter got off a good quote, but his plan isn't dead yet. Water does not stand out in most opinion polls, but drought conditions have the full attention of business, agriculture, local government and others, all the way up to the state's top officials. The condition of his proposal is serious, but not critical. There are still ways to get it done, and there is still time to do it.
Just listen to a guy who's been doing this every two years since 1985:
''We have plenty of time to get the work done in the session,'' said Gov. Rick Perry, adding that ''there is nothing more important to this state'' than the water legislation. ''We have 30 days. It's that classic period of time when people start getting a little bit stressed.''
That pronouncement is a little like pixie dust. Issues like water that are dear to the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the House are harder to kill. Legislative SWAT teams are standing by. Legal emergency rooms are staffed. The threats are more serious: if a governor wants something done and it doesn't get done, he or she can call lawmakers back for special sessions. The other two can delay bills -- use them as hostages -- now that the deadlines are looming.
Transportation financing is looking a little green around the gills. Not dead, but not exactly robust, either. The problem isn't with the needs -- those are well established. The water guys just built a better case this time. If one infrastructure issue passes, it will be water. The Senate moved a constitutional amendment that would invest billions in water and transportation -- and public education, too -- but that is getting a lukewarm response from the House.
Mr. Perry and some lawmakers would like to shrink or repeal the state's business franchise tax. Some reduction is possible; repeal is expensive and unlikely. Either way, the conversation is not over.
And public education, the other big and expensive issue hanging over the final days, remains open. Democrats in particular are pushing to restore all of the $5.4 billion cut in 2011, and are arguing for increases to cover inflation and population growth. More than half of that is already in the state budget; a grab for some of the rest helped push Mr. Ritter's water bill off track.
Lawmakers will probably get another bite at education, if not in this session then in an expected special session next year, after the Texas Supreme Court rules on a pending school finance case.
Some fights appear to be over. For instance, gambling never had a real chance this year, in spite of some hype. Having a casino in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana or Arkansas remains, for the time being, a pretty good way to extract money from Texans. Redistricting is unlikely, despite the urgings of Attorney General Greg Abbott, who wanted lawmakers to approve new maps.
But nothing is certain. No issues are truly and finally dead. The Legislature is still here.

HEADLINE: To Fight Pandemics, Reward Research

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
THAT frightening word ''pandemic'' is back in the news. A strain of avian influenza has infected people in China, with a death toll of more than 25 as of late last week. The outbreak raises renewed questions about how to prepare for possible risks, should the strain become more easily communicable or should other deadly variations arise.
Our current health care policies are not optimal for dealing with pandemics. The central problem is that these policies neglect what economists call ''public goods'': items and services that benefit many people and can't easily be withheld from those who don't pay for them directly. 
Protection against communicable diseases is a core example of a public good, as is basic scientific research, which can yield new ideas that may be spread at very low additional cost. (In contrast, Medicare, which is publicly financed, has some elements of a public good, but any particular expenditure tends to benefit an individual receiving treatment, rather than being spread over a number of beneficiaries.)
One obvious step forward would be to exempt biomedical research from cuts of the current federal budget sequestration. Research and development grants are a way to pay potential innovators up front -- an important move, as an innovator can't always charge high-enough prices for the value of its remedies when they're actually needed.
If a pandemic became a major issue in the United States, demand for remedies would surge far beyond the level associated with a typical seasonal flu outbreak, and permitting high prices would be unpopular -- and perhaps unfair. The threat of contagion also makes it crucial to spread the net of protection as widely as possible, which again suggests low prices.
Yet it is crucial to have some reward system in place for medical innovators. Well in advance of a pandemic, research needs to be done, and vaccine capacity and drug distribution facilities need to be built up. In the H.I.V./AIDS crisis, for instance, the United States was caught flat-footed -- and an appropriate response has taken decades, in part because we were not prepared. Without government financing for such public goods, the capacity wouldn't be there if a new pandemic produced a surge in demand. This would amount to an institutional failure.
The government could also take another, more unusual step: it could promise to pay lucrative prices for the patents on drugs and vaccines that prove useful in dealing with pandemics. The point of buying the patent is to distribute the remedy, if needed, as widely and as cheaply as possible. If the pandemic never occurs, the reward wouldn't have to be paid. But the very promise of such a reward might induce suppliers to take the risk of increasing capacity in advance.
Without such a government promise, private patents could easily lead to very high prices and limited distribution, as has already occurred for some cancer drugs, which are being sold to patients for more than $100,000 a year.
If anyone doubted a government pledge to pay big money for the rights to remedies, the patent's value could be established by a competitive auction. Michael Kremer, a Harvard economics professor, outlined the procedure for such an auction in his research paper ''Patent Buyouts.''
The government should resist the strong temptation to skimp on rewards. Many health care breakthroughs come through university research programs and government grants, but bringing an innovation to fruition and managing wide and rapid distribution usually requires the profit-seeking private sector. In any single instance, the government could save money by confiscating rights, but in the longer run this would discourage the search for additional remedies.
If anything, the American government -- or, better yet, a consortium of governments -- should pay more for pandemic remedies than what market-based auctions would yield. That's because, if a major pandemic does arise, other countries may not respect intellectual property rights as they scramble to copy a drug or vaccine for domestic distribution. To encourage innovations, policy makers need to bolster the expectation of rewards.
How many drugs should we cover with such prizes, and then distribute free or at minimal charge? It's an interesting but perhaps insoluble moral question. But in the meantime, economics can offer practical advice. If the remedy is a public good, as is the case in fighting a communicable disease, the value of widespread treatment will make cheap distribution a good idea.
Unfortunately, the United States lacks strong political coalitions for many beneficial public health measures. The Democratic Party has focused on insurance coverage and Medicaid expansion as political issues, while often wishing to lower prices of drugs or to weaken patent protection. The Obama administration's new budget lowers spending on pharmaceuticals by an estimated $164 billion over 10 years, mostly through bargaining down Medicare drug prices. That makes it hard for the Democrats to embrace lucrative rewards for pharmaceutical companies or vaccine producers.
Nor can we expect much on pandemic preparation from the current Republican Party, which has been focusing its fiscal conservatism on discretionary spending. That means disproportionate cuts for public health and research and development. This decision can be seen as at odds with a true conservative philosophy, which usually embraces the provision of public goods like a strong military and general national security. Such goods can also serve the purpose of protecting against bioterror.
OVER all, the American government seems to be turning its back on its traditional role of producing and investing in national public goods. If there is any consistent tendency in recent government spending, it is that spending on entitlements like Social Security and Medicare -- which provide mostly private benefits -- is rising and that investment and spending on national public goods is falling.
As a budget category, ''government consumption and gross investment'' is a proxy for many kinds of public goods spending. As a share of gross domestic product, it has fallen to less than 19 percent, from a peak of 24 percent in the 1980s, with no expected reversal in sight. Yet total government spending is expected to increase because of income transfers and entitlements. Neither political party seems able to halt that logic or even cares to make an issue of it.
Focusing government on the production of public goods may sound like a trivial issue, too obvious to be worth a mention. But, in fact, we have been failing at it, and the consequences could be serious indeed.

BEYOND WARReimagining American Influence in a New Middle East
By David Rohde221 pp. Viking. $27.95.
Luckily, David Rohde's new book, ''Beyond War: Reimagining American Influence in a New Middle East,'' doesn't live up to its name. ''American influence'' is too amorphous, and the ''new Middle East'' too broad, to be convincingly ''reimagined'' in 221 pages. To his credit, Rohde, a columnist for Reuters and The Atlantic, barely tries. What he does instead is expose the deep contradiction between Washington's long experiment in slashing the civilian instruments of American power and its post-9/11 attempt to use those same instruments to remake the greater Middle East. 
Rohde quotes one veteran of the United States Agency for International Development as estimating that the country today employs one-tenth as many foreign service officers as it did during the Vietnam War. Between 2001 and 2010 alone, Rohde notes, Congress cut U.S.A.I.D.'s staff by 30 percent. Over the same period, it doubled the agency's budget. The result: foreign policy by contractor. Suddenly required to spend vast sums bringing democracy and prosperity to Afghanistan and Iraq, America's emaciated civilian agencies could do little more than write huge checks to the megacontractors that grew fat off the ''war on terror.'' The contract to train the Iraqi police went to DynCorp, which, according to Rohde, enjoyed a ''cost-plus'' arrangement under which it spent as much as it wanted and charged the government a set fee above that. At one point, two government employees and one contractor in Baghdad oversaw 500 DynCorp trainers spread throughout Iraq.
Another contractor, the Academy for Educational Development, paid its president $879,530 in 2007, despite officially being a nonprofit organization. By 2010, contractors constituted 30 percent of the people working for American intelligence agencies, and private sector employees were conducting interrogations, recruiting spies and abducting suspected terrorists. In Afghanistan's Helmand Province, Rohde notes, the federal government was so strapped for staff that it hired contractors to oversee the contractors.
Rohde briefly retells the now familiar story of how the Bush administration defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- contemptuous of the Clinton administration's experiments in ''nation building'' -- spurned efforts to plan for governing Iraq after Saddam Hussein. But Rohde usefully extends this account by noting that it wasn't just Bush officials who undervalued the civilian elements of American foreign policy; Washington had been doing so for decades. Thus, even when the Obama administration took office determined to empower the State Department -- and put Richard C. Holbrooke in charge of a ''civilian surge'' in Afghanistan -- the effort failed. Part of the problem was bureaucratic infighting. But Holbrooke also found it difficult to reduce the government's reliance on large contractors: U.S.A.I.D. simply didn't have the staff.
Around this one core insight, Rohde appends chapters that read like stand-alone magazine features: on Holbrooke's final stint in government, on the Obama administration's enthusiasm for drones, on the killing of American diplomats in Benghazi. And when the finely rendered vignettes end, Rohde's conclusion feels disconnected from contemporary reality. ''Each day, 23,000 people . . . go to work at the Pentagon,'' he writes near the book's end. ''If we are serious about reimagining American influence and security, we must make equivalent investments in institutions that promote diplomacy, development and trade. . . . In its second term, the Obama administration must reprioritize those agencies, adequately fund them and support their efforts politically.'' Sure, and a manned mission to Mars would be nice too.
While Rohde's call for dramatically empowering the civilian instruments of American foreign policy represents an understandable reaction to the failures he's chronicled, it's not remotely plausible. Even the politically powerful Pentagon is set to see its funding slashed. In this budgetary environment, more U.S.A.I.D. spending would probably come at the expense of money for teachers and police officers in the United States.
Besides, while more American money to help Muslim entrepreneurs would be valuable, Rohde's own reporting suggests that the far more important dynamics in the greater Middle East have nothing to do with whether U.S.A.I.D. gets a staffing boost. In one of the book's best chapters, Rohde describes Turkey's rising cultural and economic influence in the Arab world, and notes that when it comes to advancing democracy and prosperity in the Middle East, Turkey's leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan ''has vastly more credibility in the region than the United States does.''
Erdogan, Rohde rightly acknowledges, is no paragon of liberal democracy. But the point is that in the struggle between democracy and zealotry, progress and stagnation, the real expertise, and the most important resources, will come from inside the region itself. As much as some Americans might wish for a second Marshall Plan in which American cash and brainpower help save a crucial part of the globe from tyranny, we lack both the money and the legitimacy to play that role. And to suggest that we can risks displaying the same hubris that Rohde aptly criticizes.
The lesson that Rohde teaches -- about how America's feeble civilian institutions kept it from achieving its epic post-9/11 ambitions -- is important. But over a decade later, the more basic lesson is that America's ambitions in the Middle East should have been less epic to begin with.

HEADLINE: The Bulgarian Equivalent

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Clive James (By the Book, April 14) says that the funniest novel he has ever read was ''Lucky Jim,'' and asks: ''Is there some Bulgarian equivalent, languishing untranslated? Probably not.'' 
As someone born in Bulgaria, raised in America and educated in England, I can assure James that Bulgarian is a grammatically rich and unique language. Like the people who speak it, the Bulgarian language survived 500 years of Ottoman rule, and it is colored by Turkish, French and, currently, American and English words and phrases. Its slang is funny, touching and bittersweet.
Although Bulgaria may have given the world the Cyrillic alphabet, few of its notable works have been translated into English, except for a couple of classics from the late 19th century, like Ivan Vazov's novel ''Under the Yoke'' (1893) and Aleko Konstantinov's travelogue ''To Chicago and Back'' (1894). Gaining support to translate important Bulgarian works and commentary into English is an uphill economic battle. The Elizabeth Kostova Foundation is an important part of the effort.
I hope that rather than mocking a language and people he does not know, James will pick up a translation of Konstantinov's ''Bai Ganyo'' and enjoy some Balkan humor.

NOON (13) UN BALLO IN MASCHERA Marcelo Álvarez, above with Kathleen Kim, performs the role of the ill-fated King Gustavo III; Dmitri Hvorostovsky is his best friend and eventual rival, Count Anckarstrom; and Sondra Radvanovsky is Amelia, Anckarstrom's wife and the object of the king's secret passion, in this Metropolitan Opera production of Verdi's drama about political intrigue and thwarted romance. ''The most interesting aspect of David Alden's disappointing, metaphor-laden new production,'' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times of this ''Great Performances at the Met'' presentation, ''is that he uses an early-20th-century setting and film noir imagery to emphasize not just the work's darkness but also its strangeness.'' Still, he said, Ms. Radvanovsky was ''splendid,'' and Mr. Hvorostovsky sang ''with his trademark dark sound and supple phrasing, which poignantly brought to life this suffering husband's love.''

The cast includes Emma Thompson as the prime minister's sister, a housewife whose husband (Alan Rickman) is besotted with his secretary (Heike Makatsch); Liam Neeson as a widower and single stepfather; and Colin Firth as a writer cuckolded by his brother. A. O.

Writing in The Times, Stephen Holden said that the movie, directed by Brad Anderson, ''skillfully manipulates familiar tropes: innocents abroad; ominous, glowering foreigners; conspiracy and duplicity; erotic intrigue. Until it fizzles in an anticlimactic train crash, it is extremely entertaining.'' In Danny Boyle's ''Trainspotting'' (1996), at 11, a Scottish heroin addict (Ewan McGregor) tries to kick the habit, with no help from his strung-out friends.

HEADLINE: The Damnedest People Ride The Subway

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
In the sparse office he now occupies in the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan, Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former C.E.O. of Barclays, paced in circles and tried to explain how he had gone from being one of the highest-ranking and highest-paid bankers in Britain to a guy who takes the subway to this office in exile and waits in line for his coffee at a cart on Park Avenue. Not to suggest that times are too tough for Diamond -- he's not complaining, and he still has more money than his grandchildren's grandchildren will ever need. But for the American investment banker who was arguably responsible more than anyone else for transforming the British finance industry, it has been a pretty spectacular fall.
''It's hard for me to talk about it,'' Diamond said. ''I've tried to move on.'' 
The conventional explanation is that Diamond, 61, was ousted last July after regulators in Washington and London uncovered a ''pervasive'' scheme by several banks, including Barclays, to manipulate a key interest-rate benchmark known as the Libor, or London interbank offered rate. The years-long investigation found that Barclays traders regularly submitted false information in order to boost the company's trading profits and, in some cases, make the bank appear stronger than it really was. (''If you know how to keep a secret I'll bring you in on it,'' one trader wrote to another in an instant message.) The scheme, which cost Barclays $450 million to settle, was described as the finance world's ''scandal of all scandals'' and eroded what little confidence was left in the workings of the industry.
Despite all the headlines -- and there were hundreds of them -- Bob Diamond's role in the scandal was minimal, and perhaps wildly overblown. It may have been the nominal cause for his dismissal, but what really drove his departure was that he had become, as one member of Parliament described him, the ''unacceptable face of banking.'' Unlike other C.E.O.'s who have lost their jobs since the financial crisis, Diamond wasn't ousted by his company's board. He was pushed out by the British government -- specifically by Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, which is the equivalent of Ben Bernanke's deciding to fire Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase.
On July 2, less than a week after the Libor scandal broke, King summoned Barclays' chairman, Marcus Agius, to his office in the imposing Bank of England Building in the heart of London's financial district. According to Agius, King told him, ''Bob Diamond no longer enjoyed the support of his regulators.'' The next morning, Diamond resigned. The day after that, George Osborne, Britain's finance minister, declared, ''I hope that it is the first step toward a new culture of responsibility in British banking.''
Diamond looked stung when I mentioned Osborne's comment. ''Do you want the truth?'' he said. ''Up until all of this, I didn't even know the mechanics of how Libor was set. If you asked me who at Barclays submitted the rate every day, I wouldn't be able to tell you. I bet you if you asked any chief executive of any bank on the street, they would give you the same answer.''
The ''I can't know what every rogue trader is doing'' defense has been used before, though I don't doubt that it's true. But the assumption in Britain and around the world was that Diamond created a culture at Barclays that encouraged the profit-at-all-costs mind-set that led to the scandal.
''After the financial crisis, the British establishment became very divided over what's the model for the big banks that we want to see,'' Martin Wolf of The Financial Times told me. ''Bob represented investment banking big time. He represented the success of it -- but also the sense that investment banking is dicey and not a completely sound business. He represented a way of doing business that we've become very uncomfortable with.''
It's an easy and satisfying caricature -- that the reckless American banker poisoned the whole system -- but it ignores an important reality: under Diamond, Barclays was the only major bank in the U.K. that didn't need to be bailed out.
Bob Diamond didn't go to an Ivy League school, didn't have the right friends and didn't grow up knowing anything about finance. He was raised outside of Boston, one of nine children in an Irish Catholic family, and went to Colby College expecting to become a teacher, like his parents. That plan was derailed when he took a job at a medical company, hoping to make enough money to go back to school to get a Ph.D. A year later, in 1979, his boss was hired to build the computer system for Morgan Stanley and asked Diamond to go with him. ''It's embarrassing,'' Diamond said, ''but when he sat down and told me about Morgan Stanley, I said, 'Who's Morgan Stanley?' '' Soon after, he made his way to the trading floor, and it didn't take long for the outsider to became a fully formed creature of Wall Street. When he quit in 1992 to go to Credit Suisse, Diamond poached his team in a way that has become lore inside Morgan Stanley. Knowing that his former boss, John Mack, who went on to run the firm, was going to be aboard a 12-hour flight from Tokyo to London, Diamond had his team resign en masse. Mack learned the news after he touched down at Heathrow, and at a staff meeting the next morning, he described Diamond as a ''duplicitous scumbag.'' Today Diamond bristles at that version of the story. ''I didn't do anything while his airplane was in the air,'' he says.
In 1996, Diamond left Credit Suisse. He briefly flirted with Goldman Sachs (his suitor was Jon Corzine), and then took what at the time seemed like a step down, joining Barclays' investment division, which was considered ''the rump'' of the already staid bank. Yet over more than a decade, Diamond turned Barclays into the only British financial institution that could be credibly mentioned in the same breath as major Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan. Along the way, he bought Lehman Brothers out of bankruptcy (''God Save the Queen'' was played over the loudspeaker on Lehman's trading floor the day the deal was reached) and remade Barclays' asset-management business, which was making under $100 million a year in 2001 when he started running it and became a $1.5 billion annual business. Barclays later sold the division for a whopping $15.2 billion.
Diamond was paid well for his success, often to the chagrin of the public and even some of his higher-ups. For his work between 2007 and 2012, he walked away with about $30 million, after giving up his bonus in 2008 and 2009 and returning his bonus for 2011. He also earned as much as another $30 million for the sale of Barclays' asset-management business, in which he had a separate stake. The press feasted on the numbers -- often inflating the total to $180 million -- contributing to the resentment in a city where even the most successful C.E.O.'s were paid much more modestly. (Compared with the income of a C.E.O. of a major U.S. bank, Diamond's income might have been low; Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs made $68.5 million in 2007 alone.)
When Diamond returned to the subject of his final days at Barclays, he got visibly anxious and unleashed a several-minute monologue. He learned the details of the Libor investigation while he was on a trip to visit clients on the West Coast in late June. As he paged through the evidence, he said, ''I got physically sick, and I couldn't believe some of the phone conversations that were happening between traders.''
He expected blowback, but Diamond didn't believe it would be directed at him. The company's lawyers advised the board to settle the case immediately, figuring that regulators would look more favorably upon the firm if it got out in front of the other banks. Diamond was convinced that he had the support of the bank's shareholders, board and regulators, but when he got back to London and the settlement was announced, all hell broke loose.
''Who was going to take responsibility?'' Prime Minister David Cameron said. ''How are they being held accountable?'' Lord Oakeshott, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, went further: ''If Bob Diamond had a scintilla of shame, he would resign. If the Barclays board had an inch of backbone between them, they will sack him.'' The Labour leader Ed Miliband declared that a criminal investigation into Barclays should begin in earnest, and Diamond was called to testify before a parliamentary committee.
Marcus Agius, who had privately planned to step down as chairman at the end of the year, decided to resign immediately in an attempt to defuse the criticism. The board told itself the politics would subside and reaffirmed its backing of Diamond. Diamond even wrote a memo to employees saying, ''We have their full support, so it is now our responsibility to execute.''
But 24 hours after writing that memo, Diamond was standing in his kitchen with Agius and another director, who had come to his house straight from their meeting with Mervyn King. It was over, they said. Diamond had to go.
''My first reaction, which is still my reaction today, is, He doesn't have the authority to do that!'' Diamond said about the pressure King exerted to oust him. After the two men left that night, Diamond talked the situation through with Jennifer, his wife of 26 years. ''What is the best thing right now I can do for the firm?'' he asked. His answer: ''Step aside and shut up.''
His daughter, Nell, a recent graduate of Princeton, wasn't quite so discreet. The morning after Diamond announced his resignation, she tweeted: ''George Osborne and Ed Miliband you can go ahead and #HMD'' -- referring to a slang term that can't be reprinted in these pages. (Google it.) She immediately called her father. '' 'Dad, I think I did something really bad. I think I'm in trouble,' '' Diamond recalled her saying. He told her: ''Sweetie, I love you. That's so nice. I think we're probably all in trouble.''
One Sunday a few weeks ago, Diamond took the subway from the Upper West Side to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn for a game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Atlanta Hawks. Since he returned to New York, his pilgrimage to Brooklyn has become a regular affair, often a couple of times a week. On this night, he was joined by his three children, Robert, Nell and Charlie, and a group of their friends.
Though Diamond resigned before the arena ever opened, it might not have existed without his decision for the bank to pay $400 million to slap its name on the building. His skybox, which he personally pays for, is a homage to his time at Barclays, its walls lined with pictures of some of his proudest moments. There is one of him and Jay-Z breaking ground on the arena, him playing golf with Phil Mickelson, him handing over the championship trophy of the English Premier League, which Barclays sponsors. (As a consolation prize, the investors behind the arena added Diamond to the board of the Barclays Center after he left the bank.)
Over the many months I talked with Diamond, who resisted being interviewed for much of last fall, he dropped a lot of hints that he is still the same humble guy he was before he ever knew what a derivative was. ''This is going to sound arrogant as hell,'' he said, ''but I never did anything for money. I never set money as a goal. It was a result. And if you look at how Jennifer and I and our three kids have lived our lives, as soon as we had any money at all, we created a family foundation. The only car I own, honestly, is an 11-year-old Jeep on Nantucket. I think Jennifer and I have always had a great home for our kids. We really like to take vacations with them, so those are good. But we don't have a boat, we don't have fancy cars. I think we have lived well, but it hasn't been about accumulation or anything like that.''
That might be a matter of perspective. In London, Diamond bought and sold an enormous town house with an indoor swimming pool. He has a home on Nantucket and another in Beaver Creek, Colo. And his current residence is a $37 million penthouse apartment on the 40th floor of 15 Central Park West, where Sting and Lloyd Blankfein also live. Diamond was aware enough of the ''optics'' that he tried to hide the fact that he was buying the apartment by purchasing it under the name of Novgorod, a Russian-sounding company he created to make it appear that an oligarch had bought the apartment. It worked. The New York Observer reported at the time: ''Are the Good Times Back? 15 Central Park West Penthouse Sells for $37 M.'' The article never mentioned the name of the real owner.
At one point during our conversations, Diamond offered a list of people he thought I should call. It was impressive, filled with C.E.O.'s and politicians. But I was anxious that he was trying to influence the article, and I didn't call them. He nagged me. Eventually, I called someone on the list with whom Diamond worked for many years. ''I'd rather go on background,'' the friend said right away. The same thing happened repeatedly. When I asked one of his friends to explain how someone with Diamond's middle-class background could have missed so many warning signs of a public backlash, the friend cut me off. ''You mean, How could he be so imperial and narcissistic?'' (It bears noting that each person I spoke with also said they genuinely felt that Diamond is a decent and honest guy who got a bad rap.)
When I reached a senior colleague at Barclays, he offered perhaps the most cogent explanation for why Diamond ultimately lost his job. ''Did he deserve to be fired for Libor? No. He was a scapegoat. But that's not why he resigned. He had lost support. And it's not that he somehow missed all of this coming. He knew it was there the whole time. I think he made a calculated assessment that there was no reason he needed all these people, because he was producing big profits.''
After I told Diamond that some of the people on his list had offered a decidedly mixed view of him, he seemed a combination of hurt, defensive and apologetic.
''Do I think I was tone-deaf to the American thing?'' he said. ''Probably. I think that the anger against banks and bankers, particularly in the U.K., was deeper than I realized.''
His tone-deafness to public outrage over the banking system was not a new problem. In 2011, for instance, he caused a monthlong stir in Britain after he said at a hearing in Parliament: ''There was a period of remorse and apology for banks. I think that period needs to be over.'' Now, reflecting back on that statement, he said: ''I don't know if I regret the quote or not. I certainly regret what was taken away by certain people.''
There's a counternarrative, however, to the one that's been told about Barclays', and therefore Diamond's, role in the Libor scandal. The accusations often get conflated: there's one -- rogue traders seeking to manipulate Libor for their own profit -- and there's another, that the bank systematically, under Diamond's direction, submitted low rates to make itself look healthier.
To appreciate what really happened, it's necessary to understand both the mechanics of Libor and the politics of the moment in the U.K. Libor is a reference rate that is used in all sorts of loans around the globe. (A student loan, for example, might be based on Libor plus 2 percent.) It is defined by the British Bankers' Association as ''the rate at which an individual Contributor Panel bank could borrow funds, were it to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers.'' The rate is established every weekday, at 11 a.m., when 18 banks from around the globe submit their numbers for that day. The highest and lowest submissions are thrown out, then an average is calculated and published.
It isn't hard for a bank, or a series of banks, to have an impact on that daily average. As a top regulator told me, ''Everyone always knew Libor was made up.'' In June 2008, Timothy Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, sent an e-mail to Mervyn King in London politely suggesting that Libor could be manipulated and to ''establish a credible reporting procedure.'' Just two months earlier, on a recorded call, a Barclays employee told a Federal Reserve employee, ''We know that we're not posting, um, an honest Libor.''
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the shocks to the financial system, King seemed to indicate to Parliament, in November 2008, that he too was aware that Libor had become a farce. ''It is not a rate at which anyone is actually borrowing,'' he said.
Just a month before King made those comments, Bob Diamond had a curious conversation with one of King's top lieutenants, a man named Paul Tucker. The call was so perplexing, Diamond told me, that he wrote a memo to his own file, perhaps worried it might come up again later. ''Mr. Tucker reiterated that he had received calls from a number of senior figures within Whitehall [Treasury] to question why Barclays was always towards the top end of Libor pricing,'' he wrote, suggesting Barclays was in fact looking weaker than many of the other banks, even though, in truth, Barclays was perhaps the strongest of the banks submitting a daily rate. ''Mr. Tucker stated . . . that, while he was certain we did not need advice, that it did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as we have recently.''
In other words, the memo suggested that Tucker was pressing Barclays to reconsider how it was determining the rate at which other banks would lend to it -- and because the market was essentially dead at the time, the number could be invented. Barclays was making the submissions of other banks, like Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which required bailouts, look unrealistically low.
On the final morning of Diamond's tenure at Barclays, he said he picked up The Financial Times and saw, splashed across the front page, an article saying that he threatened to reveal damaging details regarding the regulators' dealings with Barclays.
Diamond told me that he never planned to implicate Tucker. Tucker would later dispute Diamond's memo, saying it gave the ''wrong impression.'' But inside the Bank of England, they were bracing for Diamond's testimony. Later that same day, King summoned Agius and the other Barclays director to his office, setting the resignation of Bob Diamond in motion.
Martin Wolf of The Financial Times said of the regulators' determination to get Diamond: ''You've got this major scandal. You want somebody's head to roll, and you don't want it to be yours. Having somebody who was looking like a convenient scapegoat was quite attractive.''
One afternoon this winter, Diamond stood in a classroom at Yale, waxing on about the political view that banks are too big to fail and about the implications of regulation and the opportunities that he now sees in Europe and Africa. It's a talk he has been giving in a lot of places, and it serves not just as a way to keep him on the radar of the business community but also as an introduction to his next big venture, once he's allowed out of exile.
Because of a noncompete agreement with Barclays, Diamond is prevented from starting a new business or going to another company until this summer. But he has been flying all over the world, talking with academic experts and investors, floating his idea of creating a merchant bank that advises and buys stakes in businesses in Africa and Europe. His thesis is that Africa, where he spent the past decade building Barclays Capital and donating much of his family's foundation money, is going to be one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. And his other thesis is that Europe's banking system is going to be dismantled, so opportunities to buy pieces on the cheap will be abundant.
It's very unlikely that Diamond will ever create something that can compete with Barclays, but he says that he hopes to work with large companies again, even if his own is much smaller. It will be his way back into his former world.
For now, though, he's still alone in his office, without the power or the entourage or the trappings he once enjoyed. He seemed a little wistful for that former life. ''If you looked annoyed,'' he said, ''someone was walking up and saying, 'How could I help?' It's a bit of an exaggeration, but you know what I mean.'' As for where he is now, he said, ''All of a sudden, if you scream fire, there's no one there.'' And then he added, ''I think it's been very positive and kind of liberating.''

HEADLINE: Boom, Bust or What?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON

 BODY:
One cold late-winter afternoon, Larry Summers was standing by the free-throw line at Lavietes Pavilion, on the Harvard campus, somberly shooting a basketball. In the past couple of years, Summers has sworn off Diet Coke, gluten and junk food and lost a fair amount of weight. As a result, his gray White House T-shirt billowed over his loose gym shorts. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and celebrated economist, is well known for his cutting wit and laserlike focus; he is less well known for his jump shot. But Summers, who recalls with anguish being cut from his high-school basketball team, never let his gaze wander as he took, and missed, nearly every shot. Two Harvard players ran down his rebounds. 
After practice, Tommy Amaker, the Harvard basketball coach, invited Summers into a lounge to address his team. Over pizza -- his gluten-free pie sat off to the side -- Summers delivered a 30-minute speech that was part motivational and mostly scholarly. (Imagine what Bobby Knight might sound like if he had an advanced degree in public economics.) The theme was adjustments. Summers began by recalling a recent Harvard game against Brown. The Crimson had blown a 22-point lead in the second half but came back and eked out a win in double overtime. ''It's not that people who win never make mistakes,'' Summers said. Then he transitioned to his old boss, President Barack Obama, who botched his first debate against Mitt Romney before adjusting his plan and winning the next two. ''Like the president,'' he said, ''you finished strong!''
Summers segued to an explanation for how he chose a career in economics. The field, he said, provided tools that can be used to make the world, or a basketball team, better. The key is reading data and recognizing what it tells you. Then Summers paused and asked the assembled players a rhetorical question: Did they believe a shooter could get a ''hot hand'' and go on a streak in which he made shot after shot after shot? All the players nodded uniformly. Summers paused again, relishing the moment. ''The answer is no,'' he said. ''People apply patterns to random data.'' A statistical analysis of player performance reveals that streaks are random events. The players listened respectfully. They perked up when it was noted that Summers grew up in the same school district as Kobe Bryant.
A few days later, I witnessed an equally unusual discussion of basketball and economics. Before a crowded lecture hall at Columbia University, the economist and former adviser to both Bush presidents, Glenn Hubbard, wrote a series of words on the blackboard. Among them: Milton Friedman, Yeats, basketball. Hubbard, a mild and genial man, looks as if he entered the world fully formed, wearing a conservative suit with a side part in his hair and an accountant's pair of thick eyeglasses. Close your eyes and picture an economist -- that's Hubbard. For the next hour, he maintained an oddly cheery tone as he laid out a dystopian vision of the United States' economic future. He ticked off a series of empires -- Rome, medieval China, Spain, 19th-century Britain -- and argued that they fell because their leadership ossified and squashed free trade, technological progress or other forces of economic growth.
Hubbard fears that the United States is also veering away from the forces that made it grow into the world's most powerful economy. Rather than corrupt Roman senators or courtly Spanish twits, he argued, our culprits are myopic politicians who are creating a middle-class entitlement state. If those politicians don't make fundamental changes to lower our debt -- especially by changing the rules governing increasingly expensive Social Security and Medicare policies -- the United States may collapse, too.
As he wrapped up, Hubbard pointed to the good news: results can change when the right adjustments are made. This is where he brought up basketball. By the 1940s, he said, the sport had become boring, dominated by extremely tall players who planted themselves next to the rim. Then a Columbia University graduate student who also coached basketball wrote a Ph.D. dissertation arguing that the game could be saved by innovations, like the 3-point shot, which created an incentive to move action away from the hoop. It took decades for the N.B.A. to adopt the 3-pointer, but since its implementation, it has helped make basketball one of the most popular and lucrative sports on earth.
The U.S. economy, in other words, desperately needs to find its own 3-point shot.
Larry Summers and Glenn Hubbard have shadowed each other for decades. In the late '70s and early '80s, they were young academic stars, part of a revolution in economics taking place at Harvard. New computer technology and large data sets allowed them to explore with unprecedented precision how government policy affected the economic behavior of people and companies. Many of their peers went on to become influential public figures. Jeffrey Sachs, Paul Krugman, Ben Bernanke and Greg Mankiw were all at Harvard or nearby M.I.T. around the same time. But by the 1990s, it was Hubbard and Summers who, above others, translated the leading economic research into Washington policy. While only in his 30s, Summers had already made major contributions in the fields of unemployment, taxation, savings and the role of central banks, among others. Hubbard, meanwhile, spent the 1980s zeroing in on Social Security and tax policy.
Over the intervening decades, they helped define economic policy at the highest levels. Summers held several key roles in the Clinton administration, ultimately becoming Treasury secretary. In 2008, Obama named him National Economic Council director, placing him in charge of White House economic policy-making. Hubbard, a Treasury official under George H. W. Bush, became chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the George W. Bush administration and was widely expected to be named Treasury secretary in a Romney administration. Summers, the former president of Harvard, now teaches there. Hubbard is dean of Columbia Business School. Through their own work and that of their protégés, much of the economic policy now advocated by moderate Democrats can be traced to the ideas of Summers. (''I'm progressive, but not of the ideological left,'' Summers told me.) And many Republican policies, especially dealing with taxation, can be credited, in some way, to Hubbard on the right. (''I'm a pragmatist,'' he says of his conservatism. ''I'm not doctrinaire.'') The space between their views roughly defines the American center.
Economically speaking, that center has never been more important or more fraught. Even these two, with such similar training and moderate impulses, are remarkably far apart on basic questions. Hubbard argues that the imperative of the moment -- our 3-point shot -- is rolling back federal benefits for wealthier and middle-class Americans. If it's done right, he says, taxes will fall and ''more entrepreneurs will start businesses. Corporate investment would rise, creating more jobs. Individuals will work harder and save more. The country would have faster growth. The benefits are quite broad.'' If we stay the present course, though, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will keep growing unchecked, and the United States, paralyzed by debt, could burn like Rome.
Summers, who once told me ''I don't do apocalypse,'' acknowledged that some entitlement reform is inevitable, but that it is not the real adjustment that needs to be made. ''That is playing defense,'' he said. ''It is essential but insufficient.'' Instead, Summers wants the country to start playing offense: the crisis that demands our attention now, he says, is long-term unemployment. Millions of Americans have been out of work for more than half a year, many for much longer; not only are they suffering, but the overall economy is poorer without their contribution. Summers argues that the U.S. government can address this problem in several ways, especially by committing to more government spending, notably on infrastructure.
So, there's the political stalemate, two apparently incompatible worldviews. Over the last several months, I spoke extensively to Summers and Hubbard, together and apart, in classrooms and in their offices, hopeful that two men who consider themselves empiricists and share the same economic training could help cut through the confusing and overwrought political debate. And even if they couldn't, that they might at least help clarify the choices that will define the future of our economy.
For two men who are so smart and analytical, neither could fully articulate how they came to understand their field in such fundamentally different ways. During our many conversations, each referred to opinions shaped early in life. Summers and Hubbard were born in the 1950s, but they had remarkably different upbringings. Summers's parents were well-respected economists at the University of Pennsylvania. Two of his uncles won Nobel Prizes in the field, including Paul Samuelson, who advised President Kennedy and wrote ''Economics,'' an enormously influential textbook. His family and their friends were committed Democrats who celebrated the expansionary programs under Lyndon Johnson. Some of them even helped design those programs.
Hubbard, on the other hand, grew up in a remote agricultural town in Central Florida. His parents were public-school teachers. The programs that were beloved by Summers's family struck many Southerners as another sign of government growing too large. Hubbard told me that a favorite book in high school was Friedrich Hayek's ''Road to Serfdom,'' a 1944 treatise against big government that remains a sacred text among conservatives, including Paul Ryan.
On some level, their upbringings seem to have influenced their work from the beginning. When Hubbard was at Harvard, in the early '80s, he built a computer model of the U.S. economy that allowed him to investigate how Social Security distorted savings. The results were devastating. His model suggested that for every dollar worth of future benefits, Americans saved 33 cents less in their private accounts. Later, he focused on the taxes needed to pay for these programs and concluded that higher taxes discouraged companies from investing and potential entrepreneurs from starting new businesses. In one paper, he looked at a long-term study of 5,000 households and projected that when the top tax rate was raised to 39.6 percent from 31 percent, as many as 20 percent fewer wealthy Americans would become entrepreneurs.
This research, Hubbard concluded, shows that Social Security and Medicare and high taxes can hurt the country: Americans save less, companies invest less and the economy slows down. This, of course, reflects what conservative economists have argued since Social Security began in the 1930s. But when Republicans make the argument now, they point to Hubbard's work as support.
Around this time, Summers was working on his own pivotal research project. In a 1986 paper, he and Olivier Blanchard, now the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, argued that increases in unemployment during recessions seriously harm an economy for years afterward -- companies adjust to smaller work forces and the long-term unemployed give up on working altogether. A few years later, Summers studied the 1987 market crash and other historical events to determine why financial markets sometimes acted so irrationally. His work pointed to the influence of ''noise traders,'' speculators who added volatility and inefficiency to the markets. The markets weren't perfect, it suggested, and you needed strong government assistance when they stumbled.
How did two men, whose work is widely respected, reach such different conclusions from data about the same economy? As I read their papers, I realized that they simply asked different questions. Hubbard was fascinated by analyzing the ways in which government intervention can distort otherwise efficient markets; many of Summers's papers explored the reasons markets aren't always perfectly efficient.
So one morning this spring, I met Summers and Hubbard in a small, well-appointed room at the Council on Foreign Relations on Manhattan's Upper East Side to hear them battle it out as if they were preparing to brief the president and leaders of Congress on what must be done to fix our economy right now -- what, in other words, is our best 3-point shot. I wanted to hear their answers, of course, but I was also interested in how they made them. I wanted to understand the extent to which empirical economic research can provide objective guidance for policy -- and at what point even brilliant, highly trained economists resort to articles of faith.
As we settled in that morning, Hubbard quickly zeroed in on the issue that has defined his career. In regard to the size of the government, Hubbard said the real challenge is the steady rise in so-called entitlement spending. Going forward, he said, government debt will rise partly on account of the increase in the cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Already these programs take up around half of all U.S. government spending. As the population ages and as health care costs rise far faster than inflation, these programs could double in cost by 2040. Hubbard goes into great, semi-apocalyptic detail about the effects of taxes and debt in his forthcoming book, ''Balance.'' It's a mode he slips into rather easily in person too. Hubbard, usually regarded as a centrist Republican, suddenly started to sound like a member of the Tea Party. ''Entitlement programs are on autopilot,'' he said. ''I'm alarmed. We're close to the danger zone.''
Then he presented his solution. ''I see no reason we need programs that are exactly the same for all Americans,'' he said. Hubbard suggested turning Social Security and Medicare into smaller programs that help ''the least well off among us.'' With smaller social-insurance programs, the government can prevent tax increases and shrink the debt burden. That, he said, would lead to broad economic growth. As he spoke, I began seeing the arc in my mind: a young boy grows up in Central Florida reading Hayek, charts Social Security's distortions in graduate school and eventually argues to overturn the system. Hubbard would go on to become the architect of George W. Bush's famous tax cuts, which slashed taxation on dividends and capital gains. His views all seemed to coalesce around a fairly simple idea: the U.S. economy is better off when the government gets out of the way. Cutting the entitlement programs was an extension of this. It could free up more capital to further enable virtually everyone to contribute to the economy.
Summers's worldview seemed to take into account more moving pieces. ''It would surely be better to address long-run fiscal issues sooner rather than later,'' he said. ''But this needs to be done in a balanced way. The highest priority is getting the economy growing.'' Summers said that he expected the government debt to grow, because the cost of services that the government pays for -- like education and health care -- are rising far faster than many of those bought in the private sector. He considered this a problem but a separate one that needed addressing on its own. ''We have an enormous amount of work to do as a society to figure out how to contain health care costs,'' he said.
As he slid comfortably into the professorial mode I glimpsed a few weeks earlier at Harvard, Summers started to take on Hubbard's argument directly. He had told me that if tax rates were so dominant in determining economic health, ''it wouldn't be the case that the economy grew fastest when top tax rates were highest.'' After all, the U.S. economy did grow quite quickly in the 1950s and 1960s when top tax rates were far higher (income tax was once as high as 91 percent). Lowering taxes on the rich and cutting benefits to the middle class, he said, could also have the opposite of Hubbard's intended effect. Ambitious middle-class people might see no point in taking risks, fearing that the fix was in and that only the rich could get richer. At some point, Summers became emotional in his defense. He told me that Social Security and Medicare were among the best things about America. They took the group of people that were most vulnerable in our society -- the elderly -- and made them secure. ''Why would you want to get rid of that?'' Summers asked rhetorically.
As they continued to trade arguments, seeking to undercut each other, Summers and Hubbard remained calm. Neither raised his voice or interrupted. Hubbard, leaning forward, smiling, began responses with ''I want to agree with Larry on . . .'' before explaining his many, many disagreements.
Their views were especially incompatible when the talk veered to rising inequality. Summers said he would limit benefits for the rich like ''carried interest'' rules that allowed private-equity managers (including, I recalled, Mitt Romney) to convert their income, which would be taxed close to 40 percent, into something that looked just like capital gains, which are taxed at 20 percent. He also said that the very wealthy should pay higher inheritance taxes. Dynastic wealth is ''highly problematic in a society committed to freedom of opportunity,'' he said.
For Hubbard, though, the rich aren't the problem. The pursuit of wealth, he said, is an engine that powers the economy, and it makes no sense to address inequality by redistributing the very thing that fuels growth. ''The real question is 'What can we do to improve the earnings of lower- and middle-income Americans?' '' he said. ''That's about increased education and skills training, and that may require higher government spending.'' (Hubbard's belief in more education financing sets him apart from more doctrinaire conservatives.) Hubbard also dismissed Summers's concerns about dynastic wealth. So few Americans have that kind of money, he said, that taxing them doesn't make a major impact on the nation's finances.
In the end, it became clear that Hubbard sees many of our economic challenges -- rising entitlements, inequality and even the financial crisis -- as different manifestations of the same basic problem: unsustainable debt. Those challenges also have the same solution. If Congress and the White House can agree on a long-term plan to reduce the entitlements, everything will begin to look better. With a permanent solution in sight, investors will gain confidence from the fact that their country's finances are in good shape and that their future tax burden will be lower; companies will hire workers. Then, once the big fiscal problem is solved, the government can redouble its efforts on education and help the truly needy.
At moments, Summers seemed close to exasperated. ''I don't think Bill Gates, in his garage, was calculating his marginal tax rate,'' Summers told me, before referring back to sustained growth during the 1950s and 1960s. ''There is no serious statistical evidence in support of the view that tax rates at current levels have a major disincentive effect on economic growth,'' he said. He suggested, pointedly, comparing the rapid economic growth during the Clinton years with the comparatively worse performance of the post-tax-cut Bush period.
Then Summers settled on his point: The United States, he said, is not simply facing one unified problem that could be solved through one straightforward solution. The country is facing myriad challenges, starting with unemployment and slow growth. These immediate challenges, he said, can be addressed with a 10-year commitment by the government to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. In 2009, Summers helped design the $800 billion stimulus package. He said he wished it could have been larger, but he and many others feared that political concerns with the word ''trillion'' would have freaked out Congress. One trillion is still a very scary number in Washington, but the long-term unemployment crisis in America justifies it, he said. Returning millions of workers to productive jobs will eventually generate the economic growth needed to pay off the extra debt.
I found Summers's opinions harder to categorize ideologically. His academic work covered so many different areas, and some of it even seemed more in line with Hubbard's political opinions. (Hubbard likes to point to some of Summers's own academic research supporting the idea that taxes can suppress investment.) Some of Summers's views, like his support of stimulus spending, are core left-leaning Keynesian economics. Other times, though, he sounds like a moderate Republican who wants to let private markets function with minimal government intervention, at least when times are good. It is for this reason that Summers is a polarizing figure on the left. I spoke to many progressive economists and activists who said they were deeply disappointed when President Obama appointed him as National Economic Council director. Dean Baker, an economist with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, told me, ''I think Summers has had a negative impact.'' He said he would have preferred Obama to appoint an economist who wanted to break up the large banks, supported labor unions more aggressively and pushed for more-effective business regulation.
Hubbard is also out of step with the more radical members of his party. He is quick to dismiss the theories of Ron Paul and his followers about abolishing the Federal Reserve and reinstating the gold standard. And unlike many Tea Party activists and libertarian economists, he doesn't imagine the government playing a substantially smaller role in much of what it does. He doesn't want to eliminate public education or the post office or the national parks.
But many of his own ideas seem nearly as politically outlandish. I suggested to Hubbard, in one of our last conversations, that aggressive entitlement reform seems rather unlikely to be enacted. I asked if shrinking the wildly popular Social Security and Medicare programs, if ever seriously put forward, wasn't quite likely to meet the same fate as George W. Bush's failed Social Security privatization plan, one of the most hastily rejected presidential initiatives in recent memory. Hubbard said that Americans didn't realize the equation between these programs and taxes -- that ''taxes would have to go up a lot on middle-class people. You can tax all the high-income people and barely put a dent in the problem.''
Then he paused for a long moment. They may not realize it now, he said, but they will when the crisis arrives, perhaps in the next decade and they are forced to choose between his path and Summers's. And by that point, it wouldn't be much of a choice.
Before I met Summers and Hubbard, I had this little fantasy that I would get the two of them to agree, in my presence, to some sort of grand compromise that both parties might at least consider. Especially these two, trained around the same time, in the same place, to use the same analytical tools. Surely they could get their pencils out and come up with a tax-and-entitlement-reform plan that neither would find perfect but that would still be a huge improvement over what we have now. Yet both men took evident satisfaction in sticking to their guns, leaving me feeling the frustration that many do these days: Why can't these two sides just work something out?
Sean West, a young political analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, has been remarkably prescient. He told me that my fantasy -- one big, bipartisan solution -- is common these days. Given the current circumstances, though, any reform to our economic system will have to be incremental and ultimately unsatisfying to all of those clamoring on the left and the right for significant change. And that starts with tax reform. Nearly every economist feels that some clear reforms are needed, as Hubbard and Summers certainly do. Our current tax system presents many opportunities for little fixes that both parties could chalk up as victories, like a cap on total deductions that any person could take, which would increase government revenue while also allowing the top marginal tax rate to be lowered. Who's against that?
West recently told me that he thinks there's about a 50-50 chance that Congress will pass a tax-reform bill suitable for Obama's signature in the next two years. It will be a step in the right direction, but it won't solve everything. West added -- only partly joking -- that he has come to think of the presidential election of 2016 as a battle between whoever will hire Larry Summers and whoever will hire Glenn Hubbard. Because somewhere in those following four years, he said, the fiscal crisis will become unavoidable, Congress will have to act, and it will have to work with the White House.
When that happens, though, West said the edge will very likely go to Summers's path. There is little popular support for Hubbard's drastic solutions. Just as Summers and Hubbard held on to the ideals of their upbringings, tens of millions of middle-class Americans won't just let go of the retirement benefits that they have expected to collect their entire lives. As both men know, you can't separate economics from politics.

HEADLINE: Where Do Old Cellphones Go to Die?

BYLINE: By LEYLA ACAROGLU. 
A sustainability strategist based in Melbourne, Australia.

 BODY:
AMERICANS replace their cellphones every 22 months, junking some 150 million old phones in 2010 alone. Ever wondered what happens to all these old phones? The answer isn't pretty.
In far-flung, mostly impoverished places like Agbogbloshie, Ghana; Delhi, India; and Guiyu, China, children pile e-waste into giant mountains and burn it so they can extract the metals -- copper wires, gold and silver threads -- inside, which they sell to recycling merchants for only a few dollars. In India, young boys smash computer batteries with mallets to recover cadmium, toxic flecks of which cover their hands and feet as they work. Women spend their days bent over baths of hot lead, ''cooking'' circuit boards so they can remove slivers of gold inside. Greenpeace, the Basel Action Network and others have posted YouTube videos of young children inhaling the smoke that rises from burned phone casings as they identify and separate different kinds of plastics for recyclers. It is hard to imagine that good health is a by-product of their unregulated industry. 
Indeed, most scientists agree that exposure poses serious health risks, especially to pregnant women and children. The World Health Organization reports that even a low level of exposure to lead, cadmium and mercury (all of which can be found in old phones) can cause irreversible neurological damage and threaten the development of a child.
The growing toxic nightmare that is e-waste is not confined to third world outposts. It also poses health problems in the United States where, for several years, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has kept inmates busy processing e-waste. There are concrete steps the government, manufacturers and consumers could take to better dispose of electronic trash and to help prevent the pileup of more e-waste and the hazards e-waste processing poses.
The United States, for example, remains the only industrialized country that has not ratified the Basel Convention, an international treaty that makes it illegal to export or traffic in toxic e-waste. Fully implementing the treaty would be a step toward joining global efforts to contain toxic waste troubles.
The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act, introduced in Congress in 2011, would have made it illegal to export toxic waste from the United States to countries that don't belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The aim was to stop dumping e-waste on the world's poorest nations and thus to provide an incentive for safer waste management in our own country. The bill had bipartisan support but was never put to a vote.
The European Union provides a model for industrial regulation that would shift the burden of safe product disposal back to the manufacturers that produce electronic goods. Its Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive requires electronic sellers to accept, free of charge, any of their used products brought in by customers for recycling. The goal is to have properly recycled 85 percent of the European Union's e-waste by 2019. Similarly, Japan requires its electronic manufacturers to establish their own recycling facilities or commission third parties to recycle a range of products, from computers and cellphones to TVs and air-conditioners.
Government or consumer pressure on manufacturers to design electronics with end-of-product-life issues in mind could be enormously helpful. Most cellphones, for example, are deliberately designed to make disassembly difficult. Changes in the way manufacturers glue, screw and solder components together would make it easier to dismantle discarded phones and thus reduce the risks posed by crude recycling techniques like those deployed by Ghanaian children.
THERE are alternative phone service business models that could be beneficial to producers, users and the rest of us. For example, manufacturers could sell products complete with prearranged recycling service or subscriptions that made it possible, for example, for phone user to exchange old units for new ones rather than throwing them away. Under a product service system model, companies recycle old units and repurpose core components. Xerox uses a similar model for its photocopiers, without impact on sales or profits.
In the absence of government regulation or industry initiative, consumers could play a role in determining what happens to products that have outlived their usefulness. Most phones and small electronics are designed with obsolescence in mind. But what if we held on to our gadgets longer and repaired, rather than replaced them? We could recycle the ones we no longer use through certified recycling services like e-Stewards, a nonprofit organization that runs certification programs for e-waste recyclers, ensuring that goods are not improperly exported.
As consumers we need to demand better end-of-life options for our high-tech trash; if manufacturers and government fall down on the job, we, the millions of Americans who own cellphones, should press for safe recycling.

HEADLINE: Alaska Media Battle Pits Old Power vs. Cable Rival

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
ANCHORAGE -- Yes, Alaska is woolly and wild. But here is the paradox: it functions in many ways like a medium-size city with a big backyard. Nearly 54 percent of the population, in a state more than twice the size of Texas, clusters here in the largest metropolitan area. That degree of single-city dominance is matched in only a few other places in the United States, notably Nevada, where a tail named Las Vegas wags its dog.
Concentration of population, in turn, creates concentration of power in economics, news and culture, which means that Anchorage -- though very different from the rest of the state, if only by virtue of being urban -- largely defines what it means to be Alaskan through the messages it sends out and controls. 
Now, there is a fight over who wields that Anchorage-centered, Alaska-size microphone.
In one corner, wearing the rainbow-colored peacock logo, is the powerful NBC affiliate, KTUU. As Channel 2, it was one of the first stations on the air here, starting in the early 1950s, before statehood, and it has been crushingly dominant just about ever since in statewide news coverage.
When the Legislature is in session at the capital in Juneau, KTUU has often been the only station covering it full time. And the recession, which swept like a scythe through journalism jobs in Alaska -- as it did in many places -- left ''Alaska's News Source,'' as it calls itself, more pre-eminent than ever as competition faded.
In the other corner, just as muscular in its own way, is a homegrown cable company, General Communication Inc., Alaska's biggest provider of telecommunications services, from cable to telephone. Last fall the company, known as GCI, proposed going into the content side of the business, putting its own programming into the cable lines it controls with near-monopoly power in parts of the state.
The fight that has raged ever since: will access to the cable system that snakes out of Anchorage to inform and entertain the state still be fair?
In its application to the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates broadcasting, GCI said it wanted to acquire an Anchorage station, KTVA, a CBS affiliate with a small market share in news, and flood the zone with millions of dollars in new resources and news staff. Two low-power television stations, in Juneau and Sitka, would also come under the GCI umbrella.
''We want more coverage of local Alaska,'' David Morris, a company spokesman, said in an interview in its Anchorage headquarters.
KTUU's owners, joined by most other Alaska television broadcasters in a united front, said in filings to the F.C.C. that GCI would naturally favor its own content and strangle competitors through overt or subtle means, like channel placement on the cable menu. They also say, based on comments from GCI executives quoted in affidavits, that the company plans to skew its news coverage toward ''corporate interests.''
''KTUU has been the king of the heap for so long, the thought of not being there has to be sort of terrifying for them,'' said Lynne Lott, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and a reporter at KTVA in the late 1990s. But fears can go the other way, too, she said. ''The big complaint is that GCI will be in control of everything everywhere. I'm not sure if it's true or not, but it's what people are very afraid of.''
The opposition's filings specifically ask the F.C.C. to impose equal access conditions, like those put on Comcast, the cable giant, when it bought a broadcast network, NBC Universal, in 2011. Though the numbers might look small -- Alaska has only 733,000 residents -- opponents of the GCI deal said that, in per capita terms, GCI's powers to make or break are even greater than Comcast's.
''Competition is only competition if it creates choice for the consumer,'' said Andrew MacLeod, the president and general manager of Northern Lights Media, KTUU's owner. ''Competition that is structured to squeeze someone out is not competition.''
GCI responds that opponents have grown too comfortable with their cozy local clout, and that increased news coverage can only serve the public interest. And if a conservative or pro-business tone in news coverage were to be embraced -- though no such decision has been made, the company says in its application documents -- well, what of it?
''Licensees' political beliefs and editorial positions are not a barrier to entry; they are a central asset of our country's broadcast system,'' the company said in one of its commission filings.
Quirks of the far northern life compound the stakes on both sides.
Home satellite dishes, for example, which can allow people to dump their cable providers in the lower 48, do not work as well in far northern latitudes because of the way satellite orbits are plotted.
But talk of GCI's possibly growing influence also helped gather votes this spring in the Legislature to find money for a state-chartered television system called the Alaska Rural Communications Service, which serves many small communities and is structurally guaranteed to provide a neutral content mix.
Political support for the service had faltered in recent years, said one lawmaker, Senator Dennis Egan, a Democrat from Juneau who has raised questions about the GCI sale. Uncertainty about the road ahead made the rural service feel important again.
''I don't want to knock GCI -- they're good corporate citizens,'' Mr. Egan said. ''The problem is we don't know what they're going to do.''

HEADLINE: Australia Strives to Balance China and the United States

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Reactions in the official Chinese media to Australia&#8217;s new defense White Paper on China, which is more conciliatory than a previous one, were low-key, if apparently approving. Reactions from ordinary Chinese, expressed online, were mixed but still often critical. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - The official Chinese news media responded in a low-key, if apparently approving, fashion to a shift by the Australian government toward a more conciliatory strategic approach to China, judging by reactions over the weekend.
And judging by at least some online reactions from ordinary Chinese, suspicions linger that Australia may largely be doing the United States' bidding in the region, despite the shift in Canberra.
The Australian government "no longer considers China a potential strategic threat, but considers China an important partner," People's Daily wrote from Canberra in a matter-of-fact article, citing the content of Australia's new defense White Paper, which softens that country's policy on China laid out four years ago. 
"The white paper points out that 'the government will not make China out to be an adversary. The goal of this policy is to encourage China's peaceful rise and to prevent strategic competition in the region from slipping into conflict,'" the reporter Li Jingwei wrote in the newspaper, a Communist Party mouthpiece.
"In issues of development assistance in the Asia-Pacific region the white paper no longer criticizes China but recognizes China's influence in the region," Mr. Li wrote.
The white paper, presented in Canberra on Friday by Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Defense Minister Stephen Smith, "stresses the importance of Australia's relations with both China and the U.S., but says the U.S. will remain Australia's most important ally," the newspaper The Australian wrote in a story titled, "Defence white paper pivots over China threat."
"We welcome China's rise," The Australian quoted Ms. Gillard as saying. "We seek to have a comprehensive and constructive engagement with China."
"We also recognize that China's rise and its subsequent military modernization is changing the strategic order of our region, and that the U.S.-China relationship is pivotal to our region of the world," it quoted Ms. Gillard as saying. As China modernizes its military, Australia will "continue to call for transparency on that military modernization," she said.
Australia's geographic position in the Asia-Pacific region makes relations with China a pressing strategic issue for the country. Australia is economically increasingly reliant on China but also a longtime U.S. ally, complicating its relations with the Asian giant.
The new white paper recalibrates Australia's response to China, James Brown of the Lowy Institute for International Policy wrote, comparing it with the previous paper, issued in 2009, which was tougher and annoyed China.
"The strategic assessment of the White Paper is much more sophisticated than that of the 2009 version. The rise of China is no longer a threat to wax histrionic about, but instead a nuanced issue on which there are many aspects and many possible outcomes," Mr. Brown wrote on The Interpreter, the institute's blog.
In 2011, Australia drew China's ire by agreeing to station 2,500 U.S. marines in Darwin, a northern city, in a move widely seen as part of the U.S. "pivot" to focus more on a perceived, growing strategic threat from China.
China responded by accusing the United States of increasing military tensions in the region.
Some commentators have said that for Australia, balance is essential in negotiating the different geopolitical interests. As a headline in The Australian put it Saturday, "China relations require a delicate balancing act."
The Australian cited Ross Terrill, an Australian and a China expert at Harvard: "He does not believe Australia is faced with a frightening choice between our great ally and our main trading partner," the newspaper wrote. Instead, Australia could balance its interests.
"Radar still on Chinese, but it's all friendly fire" was another headline, in The Sydney Morning Herald.
The English-language newspaper China Daily wrote over the weekend: "Australia defense paper accepts rise of China's military."
"The white paper's welcoming attitude toward China's peaceful rise demonstrates Australia's emphasis on its ties with China," the story said, citing Hua Chunying, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.
Stories with a similar content to the People's Daily report ran in other official media, including military media, as well as on the Web site of the Chinese edition of the Scientific American. 
That one linked to a comment site on Netease, a major portal. There, many comments, made apparently by ordinary Chinese, showed a range of responses.
"Reckon Australia has no plans to occupy China, and China also has no plans to rule Australia," wrote a person identified as 221.11.*.*, from Xi'an city.
"The White Paper says one thing but in their hearts the real action is different," wrote a Chengdu-based commenter identified as 112.193.*.*. Australia didn't want to provoke China, the person said. "But they have already prepared well and that shows that Australia has grown clever!"
Another comment, which gained the most approval votes, was outright critical: "We're nearly almost there in terms of tidying up American imperialism, we've more than enough to spare in terms of taking care of you, little Australia. Don't jump around, behave well, understand," wrote a person with the online handle Huanshun bu xiangxin.

HEADLINE: How Social Networks Drive Black Unemployment

BYLINE: NANCY DITOMASO


HIGHLIGHT: Favoritism and social connections among whites, not just racial discrimination, hurt blacks in the job market. 

 BODY:
It's easy to believe the worst is over in the economic downturn. But for African-Americans, the pain continues - over 13 percent of black workers are unemployed, nearly twice the national average. And that's not a new development: regardless of the economy, job prospects for African-Americans have long been significantly worse than for the country as a whole.
The most obvious explanation for this entrenched disparity is racial discrimination. But in my research I have found a somewhat different culprit: favoritism. Getting an inside edge by using help from family and friends is a powerful, hidden force driving inequality in the United States. 
Such favoritism has a strong racial component. Through such seemingly innocuous networking, white Americans tend to help other whites, because social resources are concentrated among whites. If African-Americans are not part of the same networks, they will have a harder time finding decent jobs.

The mechanism that reproduces inequality, in other words, may be inclusion more than exclusion. And while exclusion or discrimination is illegal, inclusion or favoritism is not - meaning it can be more insidious and largely immune to legal challenges.
Favoritism is almost universal in today's job market. In interviews with hundreds of people on this topic, I found that all but a handful used the help of family and friends to find 70 percent of the jobs they held over their lifetimes; they all used personal networks and insider information if it was available to them.
In this context of widespread networking, the idea that there is a job "market" based solely on skills, qualifications and merit is false. Whenever possible, Americans seeking jobs try to avoid market competition: they look for unequal rather than equal opportunity. In fact, the last thing job seekers want to face is equal opportunity; they want an advantage. They want to find ways to cut in line and get ahead.
You don't usually need a strong social network to land a low-wage job at a fast-food restaurant or retail store. But trying to land a coveted position that offers a good salary and benefits is a different story. To gain an edge, job seekers actively work connections with friends and family members in pursuit of these opportunities.
Help is not given to just anyone, nor is it available from everyone. Inequality reproduces itself because help is typically reserved for people who are "like me": the people who live in my neighborhood, those who attend my church or school or those with whom I have worked in the past. It is only natural that when there are jobs to be had, people who know about them will tell the people who are close to them, those with whom they identify, and those who at some point can reciprocate the favor.
Because we still live largely segregated lives, such networking fosters categorical inequality: whites help other whites, especially when unemployment is high. Although people from every background may try to help their own, whites are more likely to hold the sorts of jobs that are protected from market competition, that pay a living wage and that have the potential to teach skills and allow for job training and advancement. So, just as opportunities are unequally distributed, they are also unequally redistributed.
All of this may make sense intuitively, but most people are unaware of the way racial ties affect their job prospects.
When I asked my interviewees what most contributed to their level of career success, they usually discussed how hard they had worked and how uncertain were the outcomes - not the help they had received throughout their lives to gain most of their jobs. In fact, only 14 percent mentioned that they had received help of any kind from others. Seeing contemporary labor-market politics through the lens of favoritism, rather than discrimination alone, is revealing. It explains, for example, why even though the majority of all Americans, including whites, support civil rights in principle, there is widespread opposition on the part of many whites to affirmative action policies - despite complaints about "reverse discrimination," my research demonstrated that the real complaint is that affirmative action undermines long-established patterns of favoritism.
The interviewees in my study who were most angry about affirmative action were those who had relatively fewer marketable skills - and were therefore most dependent on getting an inside edge for the best jobs. Whites who felt entitled to these positions believed that affirmative action was unfair because it blocked their own privileged access.
But interviewees' feelings about such policies betrayed the reality of their experience of them. I found these attitudes evident among my interviewees - even though, among the 1,463 jobs they discussed with me, there were only two cases in which someone might have been passed over for a job because of affirmative action policies benefiting African-Americans. These data are consistent with other research on affirmative action.
There's no question that discrimination is still a problem in the American economy. But whites helping other whites is not the same as discrimination, and it is not illegal. Yet it may have a powerful effect on the access that African-Americans and other minorities have to good jobs, or even to the job market itself.

HEADLINE: Palestinian Leader Seeks Chinese Support

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY; Jodi Rudoren contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, arrived in Beijing on Sunday seeking support from Chinese leaders, days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is to make a visit of his own, although Israeli officials have said there are no plans for a meeting between them. 
China has tried to maintain firm ties with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority while supporting Palestinian demands for statehood and occasionally chiding the Israeli government for its policies toward the Palestinians. But it has shown little appetite for taking on a role as a broker in that and other conflicts in the Middle East.
Still, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, told reporters in Beijing last week that ''if the Palestinian and Israeli leaders want to meet each other in China, we will happily provide the necessary assistance.''
China ''supports the Palestinian and Israeli sides in resolving their differences and disputes through peace talks,'' Ms. Hua said on Thursday. ''China's reception of the Palestinian and Israeli leaders for visits is also a part of these efforts.''
Mr. Netanyahu will arrive in Beijing on Wednesday, and Mr. Abbas is to leave on Tuesday night, according to Israeli government officials, who said there would be no encounter between the two in China.
Mr. Netanyahu will first visit Shanghai, where he arrives on Monday, though his departure from Israel was delayed Sunday so that he could attend a security meeting to discuss the increased tensions in the Middle East after the Syrian government accused Israel of airstrikes near Damascus on Saturday, calling them an ''act of war.'' Ehud Olmert, in 2007, was the last Israeli prime minister to visit China.
Mr. Abbas told Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, before his trip that he would ask China ''to use its relationship with Israel to remove the obstacles that obstruct the Palestinian economy.''
The Palestinian Authority, which has limited control over the West Bank, has been in financial distress, in part because of shrinking donations from foreign supporters and Israel's withholding of tax revenue transfers in response to Mr. Abbas's bid for enhanced status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Israel's diplomatic dealings with China are dominated by broader Middle Eastern security concerns, especially Iran's disputed nuclear program and the worsening violence in Syria. Those two issues are likely to feature in Mr. Netanyahu's talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping; the prime minister, Li Keqiang; and other officials.
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China has backed resolutions aimed at pressing Iran to curtail nuclear activities that Israel, the United States and other Western governments say are aimed at giving Tehran the means to make nuclear weapons. But China is a major buyer of Iranian oil and has criticized Western governments' unilateral sanctions aimed at curtailing that trade.
China has also stood alongside Russia in resisting Western calls for stronger intervention in the Syrian conflict, instead arguing that there is still hope of a negotiated solution.

HEADLINE: Wrongfully Convicted Often Find Their Record, Unexpunged, Haunts Them

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
In Wisconsin, Audrey Edmunds served 11 years in prison in the shaking death of an infant girl for whom she had been baby-sitting. In 2008, a mountain of new medical evidence cast so much doubt on the case that a higher court overturned her conviction and set her free. Leaving prison, Ms. Edmunds hoped that would be the end of it.
But a few months later, as she applied for a secretarial job with an office-supply company, her conviction for first-degree reckless homicide popped up in a background check. Sorry, she was told. She tried to get work with an airline, but heard a similar rejection.
''I hate it,'' said Ms. Edmunds, 52, who now lives in northern Wisconsin. ''They put us through enough to begin with. They don't give us any assistance. I'm glad to be out, but there's got to be more support. I don't like having this awful nightmare of a cloud hanging over me.'' 
Across much of the country, sealing or clearing a criminal record after a wrongful conviction is a tangled and expensive process, advocates and former prisoners say. It can take years of appeals to courts and pleas to governors to wipe the slate clean. Even then, many felony convictions remain on federal databases and pop up during background checks or at traffic stops.
Aside from the practical challenges -- a criminal record can impede big things like finding housing and employment, and smaller things like getting a hunting license -- people who have been exonerated say they feel unfairly marked, branded with a scarlet letter from a justice system that should not have locked them up in the first place.
''It was destroying my life,'' said Sabrina Butler, who was sentenced to die in Mississippi for the 1989 death of her infant son, then exonerated in 1995. ''It's always there.''
Clearing a criminal record can take years and cost thousands of dollars in legal fees, and differs widely state to state. Many require that defendants return to court to prove their innocence, a higher hurdle than showing that charges were dismissed or a conviction was overturned. In some states, a governor's pardon is needed. It can be a complex process, which advocates say is made even more difficult by a lack of support services for the exonerated.
Ms. Butler said she realized her arrest was still on the books after she failed a criminal-background check while trying to buy a shotgun. She said she applied for jobs at restaurants and retailers, and was turned down every time. After she petitioned the state, her record was expunged last July -- 17 years after she was released.
With hundreds of men and women now freed from prison by exculpatory DNA tests or successful appeals by advocacy organizations, more states are grappling with questions of what they owe the wrongfully convicted, and how to prevent former prisoners from slipping into poverty or back into prison.
A study of 118 exonerated inmates led by Evan Mandery and Amy Shlosberg, two criminal-justice researchers, found that one-third still had criminal records, sometimes more than a decade after their release. They found that former convicts with clean records were less likely to return to prison than those whose records had not been expunged.
Some states, including New York and Illinois, have a straightforward process for erasing or sealing criminal records after a wrongful conviction. But legal researchers say that most state laws are out of date with the recent waves of exonerations, and require onetime convicts already declared not guilty to once again prove their innocence.
''Even in the best case, it is difficult to move beyond a prison sentence,'' Mr. Mandery and Ms. Shlosberg wrote in their study, which is now under review at The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology. ''The wrongful conviction serves as a permanent, undeserved stigma.''
Of course, blotting out a criminal record does not solve everything. Researchers have found that high percentages of the wrongfully convicted slide into poverty or substance abuse as they struggle to rebuild a life outside prison. How do you explain a 10-year gap on a résumé? How do you answer a yes-or-no question from a prospective employer asking whether you have ever been convicted of a felony?
''Employers, if they see a homicide conviction, dismissed or not, they're not going to get past that,'' said Saundra Westervelt, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, who has written extensively about exonerated death-row inmates. ''The conviction is still there. You're stuck.''
In Alabama, Gary Wayne Drinkard said he was pulled over for a routine traffic stop after being released from prison. His 1995 murder conviction had been overturned, and a second jury trial found him not guilty. But, he said, the charges popped up when the officer ran a background check. Mr. Drinkard said he was held in the squad car for 30 minutes while the police checked out his story.
''They knew I'd done something wrong,'' he said. ''And here I was on the street.''
So far, he has not tried to have his record expunged. ''I don't even know how to file the petition,'' he said.
Sometimes, the lingering record reflects a court system that views exonerated defendants as not guilty, but not innocent. In Philadelphia, Vincent Moto spent a decade behind bars on charges that he and another man had dragged a woman into a car at gunpoint, robbed her and raped her repeatedly. He was convicted after the victim identified him as one of her attackers, but DNA testing later showed that none of the samples from the crime scene had come from Mr. Moto. In 1995 his conviction was vacated and he was freed in 1996.
In the 17 years since, he said the charges have trailed him like a shadow, frustrating his efforts to get work. He is unemployed and lives on a monthly disability check from the federal government. But he is behind on property taxes on his Philadelphia home, and worries that a foreclosure is coming. He does not sleep much these days.
''It's still on your record,'' he said. ''Who wants to take a chance on someone who was locked up for 10 and a half years?''
In 2007, he filed a petition asking that his record be expunged, but Pennsylvania fought the effort, arguing that based on the victim's testimony, the state still viewed Mr. Moto as the assailant, even though prosecutors did not believe they could convict him again. After conflicting rulings from lower courts, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the charges should stay on Mr. Moto's record.

HEADLINE: Myanmar's Educators Reach Out to the World

BYLINE: By LARA FARRAR

 BODY:
YANGON, MYANMAR -- Yangon Technological University has come a long way since it was the site of anti-government student protests in 1988 that eventually spread across Myanmar. The campus has been refurbished and a sense of normality is beginning to return.
Undergraduate students, barred for about a decade, are back, although they all must leave by 5 p.m.; they cannot live on campus. 
One important question is how the university is going to forge links with the outside world. Like many other universities in Myanmar, Yangon Technological lacks adequate teaching materials, research facilities and updated technology, all of which a foreign partner could bring. Nyi Hla Nge, a retired rector at the university, said he had written a letter to the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology seeking to ''establish cooperation.''
As Myanmar's government embarks on improving its higher education system, the possibility of assistance from foreign universities and scholars, whether in training faculty or rebuilding libraries has become a central focus. And foreign universities are pouring into the country to try to find ways to help.
''Many, many major international universities would like to have a piece of the pie,'' said Jacques Fremont, director of the international higher-education program at the Open Society Foundations, a nonprofit organization founded by the investor-philanthropist George Soros.
It is providing grants for scholars to teach at the University of Yangon and the University of Mandalay and to help Myanmar build an electronic library database. ''It is sexy now to say you have a partnership with a Burmese university,'' Mr. Fremont said. ''But the issue is: Will the Burmese say yes to everyone and then lose control of the reform agenda? Or will they be in a position to plan and say, 'Here is what we need?' The pressure is huge right now.''
Foreign institutions say the Education Ministry is showing new openness. ''Our ability to engage with them has quadrupled over the last few months,'' said Andrew Leahy, a public diplomacy officer with the U.S. Embassy in Yangon who is working on exchange programs. In January, the U.S. Embassy placed the first Fulbright scholar in nearly three decades at Yangon University.
In February, the European Union organized a higher-education conference with ministers, university administrators and foreign academics. The conference was ''significant'' because such ''open and frank discussions'' had not happened before, said an E.U. representative, who requested anonymity because he did not have permission to speak to the news media.
EducationUSA, the U.S. State Department's outreach program for foreign students, held its first college fair in Myanmar in February. More than a thousand students and parents attended, as did representatives of almost a dozen U.S. universities and community colleges.
Also in February, a delegation of 10 American universities, organized by the International Institute of Education, a nonprofit group based in New York, visited Myanmar to explore partnerships. In April, the institute released a report citing some of the problems in Myanmar's education system. They included inferior physical infrastructure and technology, a lack of international ties and a political and economic system that is unable to fulfill immediate needs. ''I think they feel a little overwhelmed,'' said Carola Weil, who is dean of the School of Professional and Extended Studies at American University in Washington and was part of the delegation.
And so do the foreign universities looking to build partnerships.
While some commitments were made by the delegation, including financing faculty exchanges and helping Myanmar universities renovate libraries, many participants said there was so much need that they did not know where to start. ''The situation is much more challenging than we expected,'' said Denis F. Simon, vice provost for international strategic initiatives at Arizona State University. ''We definitely want to do something here, but how big and how large will depend on the availability of funding.''
Finding financing is a main obstacle even though Myanmar's education spending has almost tripled from $340 million in 2011 to $1 billion in the current budget. So far, seeking money from outside donors has not yielded much.
Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, is planning to open a center for teacher training and graduate education at the University of Yangon, but concrete plans have been put on hold until resources can be secured. ''There is a commitment and a willingness to do this, but these things cost money,'' said Pamela Cranston, vice provost for international programs at Johns Hopkins. ''People are still reluctant to get into Myanmar yet in a big way.''
The U.S. Agency for International Development began taking applications last November to finance higher-education projects in Myanmar. More than 200 organizations and individuals participated in an information session on agency grants in Washington in December. The European Union will also provide financing for faculty and student exchanges.
Yet foreign engagement still requires government approval. ''The government said how hungry they are to have scholars from the U.S. come and visit,'' said Christopher McCord, who is the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Northern Illinois University and also in the delegation. ''We said, 'You have to find a way if you want us to be able to send scholars where universities don't have to go all the way to the top to get permission.'''
Improvements have come, even though in fits and starts, and in varied ways. The campus of Yangon University was spruced up a few days before a visit by President Barack Obama last November. More important, scholars from the United States are now allowed to lecture at Yangon University for the first time in decades.

1913 Montenegro Leaves Scutari to Powers
LONDON -- At yesterday's [May 5] Conference of the Ambassadors at the Foreign Office, satisfaction was expressed at King Nicholas' submission to the will of Europe. The Powers will now enter into communication among themselves to decide how and when Scutari shall be handed over to them. It is now no secret that the greatest pressure had again been used at Cettinje. Reuter's Agency learns that Great Britain took separate and very strong action, and Russia so late as last Saturday used all her influence in the direction of peace. It was proposed at the Conference that Scutari should be handed over to naval officers representing the Powers whose ships are now off the coast. 
1938 'Snow White ' Opens Tonight
PARIS -- The storybook world of witch and fay, when pigs could talk and men had never heard of bacon, is unfolded amid a riot of color and song in Walt Disney's full-length screen fantasy, ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' for which Paris has long been waiting. Not the least of the unprecedented successes of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' in England and America has been in the merchandising field. More than 100 manufacturers in America and over 150 in England and on the Continent are making and selling books, games, toys, dolls, silk, jewelry, food, candy and other articles using the characters of Walt Disney's first full-length feature picture.
1963 Per Jacobsson Dead at 69
LONDON -- Per Jacobsson, one of the world's most influential economists, chief mechanic of a multi-billion-dollar machine and godfather of the treasuries of several nations, died today [May 5]. Mr. Jacobsson, 69, was managing director and chairman of the International Monetary Fund. A native of Sweden and a resident of Washington, D.C., Mr. Jacobsson died of a heart attack in a hospital in Middlesex. He entered the hospital for a checkup after arriving in London two weeks ago on a business trip. The International Monetary Fund he headed grew out of the Breton Woods conference and played a role in untangling post-war Europe from suffocating exchange restrictions.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Are Transforming a New York Town

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
PORT CHESTER, N.Y. -- Nearly 20 years after he arrived penniless in this country from Mexico, Moises owns two restaurants, with a third on the way. He has five employees, an American wife and a stepdaughter. His food even has a following on Yelp.com.
What Moises does not have is American citizenship, or even a green card permitting him to reside legally in the United States. So he inhabits an economic netherworld, shuttling among his establishments on the bus and train because he cannot get a driver's license and making do without bank loans or credit cards even as he files for zoning permits and incorporation papers.
While the estimated 11 million immigrants here illegally are often portrayed as dishwashers, farmhands, gardeners and other low-paid service workers, increasingly they are also business owners and employers. That is one reason economists say opening the door to entrepreneurs like Moises -- whose last name is being withheld because of the risk of deportation -- could give the American economy a shot in the arm. 
The most prominent feature of the proposed immigration bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators last month would provide residents of the United States who overstayed their visas or arrived illegally before Dec. 31, 2011, a long and winding path to citizenship, one that would probably take more than a decade to complete. But less noticed is that the legislation would offer such residents much more immediate provisional status, enabling them to work and travel legally.
That status would make it easier for immigrants here illegally to open businesses, buy big-ticket items like homes and cars and negotiate raises. All of these help explain why immigration reform is one of the few things economists on the left and right generally agree on these days.
While there is considerable debate about whether increased immigration depresses wages on the low end of the pay scale, most experts say allowing more new immigrants and offering a more secure legal footing for workers who are currently in the country illegally would bring the nation broad economic gains.
''We need more legal immigration,'' said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, an economist at the conservative Manhattan Institute. ''Additional human capital results in more growth.''
Lawrence F. Katz, a liberal professor of economics at Harvard who is among those who say that immigration can push down pay for workers directly competing with new immigrants, nevertheless supports the argument that a freer flow of people from other nations would foster more growth. ''No doubt some individuals are harmed,'' he said, ''but the benefits outweigh the costs.''
Some conservative skeptics, though, see a steep price in a broad amnesty, largely because of increased spending on social services and entitlements.
The pluses and minuses of more immigration are evident in this working-class village of 29,000 about 30 miles north of Midtown Manhattan that shares a border with affluent Greenwich, Conn.
A wave of Hispanic immigrants, both legal and illegal, has transformed downtown Port Chester, which fell on hard times in the 1980s and '90s after factories and mills closed and an older generation of Italian immigrants moved away or died off.
Today, 59 percent of the village's population is of Hispanic origin, said Christopher Gomez, Port Chester's director of planning and development. From 1990 to 2010, Port Chester's population jumped by 17 percent, twice as fast as Westchester County as a whole.
The immigrant influx, he said, has become the ''lifeblood'' of the town. ''I don't know where we'd be without it.''
Mexican and Peruvian restaurants dot the downtown streets, while immigrant-owned stores and markets offer goods from Ecuador and services like money transfers to Guatemala and other Central American countries.
The predominance of Spanish-speaking customers has forced older businesses to adapt. Chris Rubeo, the owner of Feinsod Hardware on North Main Street, hired several Spanish-speaking workers to help him compete with a nearby Home Depot and lure Hispanic contractors and builders.
Fourteen years after she arrived from Lima, Peru, and started working as a baby sitter, Itziar Llamoca now owns Fiesta Place, which makes traditional decorations and balloon arrangements for family events like baptisms, weddings and the girl's coming-of-age party called the quinceañera. She earned her associate's and bachelor's degrees from colleges in Westchester and bought the store with her sister from its original owners several years ago.
Ms. Llamoca, who now holds American citizenship, did not rely on bank loans to make the purchase. ''For us, it was easier to borrow money from the family,'' she said.
A few doors down, a Guatemalan-born accountant, Julio Grijalva, shares a storefront with a travel agent originally from Mexico. Mr. Grijalva serves a growing clientele of legal immigrants like himself as well as unauthorized ones who nevertheless file using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number granted by the Internal Revenue Service.
''I'm starting to get more business owners asking for help with accounting and taxes,'' Mr. Grijalva said. He is looking for a permanent place to call his own, but rents have been rising in recent years as a result of the downtown resurgence so he is splitting an office for now.
The I.R.S. does not share data with immigration enforcement agencies, so taxpayer identification numbers are a familiar feature in the economic netherworld Moises inhabits. ''I'm doing everything right,'' he said. ''I worked day and night. I know what to do.''
''I have many years living like that,'' he said. ''But if I had the documents, it would be easier.''
Even as Moises has prospered, the influx of cheap labor in the form of new immigrants has depressed wages among certain types of workers.
That benefits business owners like John Muscatella, who can pay the minimum wage to workers in the kitchen of his Italian restaurant, T&J Villaggio Trattoria. ''We can replace them in five minutes,'' he said. ''We have five people looking for every job, so you can fill it in a heartbeat.''
But it underscores research by some economists that shows increased immigration can reduce wages slightly for some native-born workers, especially lower-skilled ones.
There are other side effects of the influx here. Port Chester's schools suffer from overcrowding as children of immigrants flood the education system, and longtime residents complain that houses are occupied by many more residents than zoning laws permit. And with one resident in 10 below the poverty line, social services in the town have felt a strain.
Still, at street level, the economic impact of the immigrant wave has largely been positive.
Immigrant-owned restaurants have drawn patrons from wealthier areas like Rye, N.Y., and Greenwich, and more upscale options like Mario Batali's Tarry Lodge have moved into the community. Several new real estate developments aimed at affluent renters have opened or are in development, like the Mariner, where rents for a one-bedroom exceed $2,000 a month.
''It's not the Bedfords and North Salems that are growing,'' said Mr. Gomez, the Port Chester planning director, referring to upscale communities farther north in Westchester. ''It's here.''

HEADLINE: The Chutzpah Caucus

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
At this point the economic case for austerity -- for slashing government spending even in the face of a weak economy -- has collapsed. Claims that spending cuts would actually boost employment by promoting confidence have fallen apart. Claims that there is some kind of red line of debt that countries dare not cross have turned out to rest on fuzzy and to some extent just plain erroneous math. Predictions of fiscal crisis keep not coming true; predictions of disaster from harsh austerity policies have proved all too accurate.
Yet calls for a reversal of the destructive turn toward austerity are still having a hard time getting through. Partly that reflects vested interests, for austerity policies serve the interests of wealthy creditors; partly it reflects the unwillingness of influential people to admit being wrong. But there is, I believe, a further obstacle to change: widespread, deep-seated cynicism about the ability of democratic governments, once engaged in stimulus, to change course in the future. 
So now seems like a good time to point out that this cynicism, which sounds realistic and worldly-wise, is actually sheer fantasy. Ending stimulus has never been a problem -- in fact, the historical record shows that it almost always ends too soon. And in America, at least, we have a pretty good record for behaving in a fiscally responsible fashion, with one exception -- namely, the fiscal irresponsibility that prevails when, and only when, hard-line conservatives are in power.
Let's start with the common claim that stimulus programs never go away.
In the United States, government spending programs designed to boost the economy are in fact rare -- F.D.R.'s New Deal and President Obama's much smaller Recovery Act are the only big examples. And neither program became permanent -- in fact, both were scaled back much too soon. F.D.R. cut back sharply in 1937, plunging America back into recession; the Recovery Act had its peak effect in 2010, and has since faded away, a fade that has been a major reason for our slow recovery.
What about programs designed to aid those hurt by a depressed economy? Don't they become permanent fixtures? Again, no. Unemployment benefits have fluctuated up and down with the business cycle, and as a percentage of G.D.P. they are barely half what they were at their recent peak. Food stamp usage is still rising, thanks to a still-terrible labor market, but historical experience suggests that it too will fall sharply if and when the economy really recovers.
Incidentally, foreign experience follows the same pattern. You often hear Japan described as a country that has pursued never-ending fiscal stimulus. In reality, it has engaged in stop-go policies, increasing spending when the economy is weak, then pulling back at the first sign of recovery (and thereby pushing itself back into recession).
So the whole notion of perma-stimulus is fantasy posing as hardheaded realism. Still, even if you don't believe that stimulus is forever, Keynesian economics says not just that you should run deficits in bad times, but that you should pay down debt in good times. And it's silly to imagine that this will happen, right?
Wrong. The key measure you want to look at is the ratio of debt to G.D.P., which measures the government's fiscal position better than a simple dollar number. And if you look at United States history since World War II, you find that of the 10 presidents who preceded Barack Obama, seven left office with a debt ratio lower than when they came in. Who were the three exceptions? Ronald Reagan and the two George Bushes. So debt increases that didn't arise either from war or from extraordinary financial crisis are entirely associated with hard-line conservative governments.
And there's a reason for that association: U.S. conservatives have long followed a strategy of ''starving the beast,'' slashing taxes so as to deprive the government of the revenue it needs to pay for popular programs.
The funny thing is that right now these same hard-line conservatives declare that we must not run deficits in times of economic crisis. Why? Because, they say, politicians won't do the right thing and pay down the debt in good times. And who are these irresponsible politicians they're talking about? Why, themselves.
To me, it sounds like a fiscal version of the classic definition of chutzpah -- namely, killing your parents, then demanding sympathy because you're an orphan. Here we have conservatives telling us that we must tighten our belts despite mass unemployment, because otherwise future conservatives will keep running deficits once times improve.
Put this way, of course, it sounds silly. But it isn't; it's tragic. The disastrous turn toward austerity has destroyed millions of jobs and ruined many lives. And it's time for a U-turn.

HEADLINE: A Disappointing Debut

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Mary Jo White, the new chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has gotten off on the wrong foot. Last week, in her first commission vote, Ms. White led the commissioners in approving a proposal that, if finalized, could leave investors and taxpayers exposed to the ravages of reckless bank trading. 
At issue is the regulation of the multitrillion-dollar market in derivatives. When speculative derivative bets go right, the results are lavish bank profits and huge banker paydays. When they go wrong, the results are shareholder losses and taxpayer-provided bailouts. Even when derivatives are used in a relatively prudent manner -- say, to hedge against price swings in food or fuel -- the largely deregulated and opaque way they are traded allows the big banks that dominate the market to charge more than they could if trading were more transparent, enriching bankers at the expense of businesses and consumers.
The S.E.C. proposal would let the foreign branches of American banks avoid rules being developed under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and instead follow rules that prevail in the foreign countries where the deals are done. Foreign banks involved in derivative deals with American companies also could adhere to their own country's rules as long as those rules are deemed broadly comparable to Dodd-Frank rules.
The banks lobbying for this approach say they want to avoid duplicative regulation and preserve competition. In fact, it would enable them to avoid regulation and preserve bank profits. The proposal implies that foreign regulation will be adequate, but the rules elsewhere are weak or nonexistent. It is no coincidence that major derivative failures have been linked to trading from abroad, including the meltdown in the financial crisis, the failure of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 and, most recently, JPMorgan Chase's London Whale fiasco.
To make matters worse, the S.E.C. proposal is weaker than the sound guidelines from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees a larger swath of the derivatives market than the S.E.C. does. Disagreement among regulators now gives the banks and their Congressional allies in both parties renewed opportunity to shape final rules to their liking.
Meanwhile, the S.E.C. is about to consider a major rule governing hedge funds and other private companies that solicit investments from the public. Ms. White's immediate predecessors supported an early proposal of the rule that, shockingly, did not include any specific investor protections. What is needed is a new proposal with the safeguards recommended by the S.E.C.'s own Investor Advisory Committee, including steps that nonpublic companies must take to verify the ability of investors to understand and absorb the risks in private offerings, and requirements that those companies disclose the data the S.E.C. will need to adequately police them. This is a critical test for Ms. White, who has yet to show that she supports stronger regulations.

HEADLINE: Obama Delivers Message Of Optimism to Class of '13

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Acknowledging that commencement addresses are no place for partisanship, President Obama nonetheless skirted close to that political line on Sunday, telling graduates at Ohio State University to ignore antigovernment arguments that ''gum up the works'' and instead aspire to be citizens who value both individual rights and community responsibilities.
''Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems,'' Mr. Obama told the crowd at the Ohio State commencement ceremony. ''They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices.'' 
Ohio State graduates, their families and friends -- almost 60,000 people in all -- turned the university's huge football stadium into a sea of red and gray, the university's colors. Mr. Obama noted that it was his fifth visit to the campus in the past year, reflecting the importance of Ohio and young voters to his re-election in November.
But this was the president's first trip here in his young second term, which has already faced setbacks in Congress over the budget and legislation to reduce gun violence and is now confronting the escalating violence in the Middle East and a push to overcome Republican opposition to an overhaul of immigration law that would provide a path to citizenship to about 11 million people who are in the country illegally.
Mr. Obama will make another trip outside Washington this week, this time to Austin, Tex., to press for long-blocked initiatives supporting infrastructure projects, education and a higher minimum wage. But in the commencement speech on Sunday, the first of three that he plans to give during graduation season, Mr. Obama mostly steered clear of those subjects and others that he and Republicans are fighting over. His address was both a pitch for good citizenship and an optimistic message as the economy recovers from the most serious recession since the Great Depression.
''While things are still hard for a lot of people, you have every reason to believe that your future is bright,'' Mr. Obama said. ''You're graduating into an economy and a job market that is steadily healing.''
The president described the graduates' generation as having a ''sense of service'' that ''makes me optimistic for our future.'' Ohio State's class of 2013, he noted, included military veterans, volunteers for the Peace Corps and Teach for America, and entrepreneurs who are already running start-up companies.
Their lives, he said, started as the cold war was ending and the Internet age was beginning, and they came of age as the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, wars, recession and technological advances transformed America.
''You've been tested and you've been tempered by events that your parents and I never imagined we'd see when we sat where you sit,'' he said. ''And yet despite all this, or perhaps because of it, yours has become a generation possessed with that most American of ideas -- that people who love their country can change it for the better.''
Citizenship, he said, is sometimes seen ''as a virtue from another time, a distant past -- one that's slipping from a society that celebrates individual ambition above all else, a society awash in instant technology that empowers us to leverage our skills and talents like never before, but just as easily allows us to retreat from the world. And the result is that we sometimes forget the larger bonds we share as one American family.''
Mr. Obama urged the graduates to find not just a career but a cause for the greater good. Perhaps, he said, they might even run for public office.
''I promise you, it will give you a tough skin. I know a little bit about this,'' he said. ''President Wilson once said, 'If you want to make enemies, try to change something.' ''

HEADLINE: In Commerce Pick's '08 Answers on Finances, Possible Hints at Road Ahead

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In November 2008, as President-elect Barack Obama began putting together his cabinet, reports emerged that he was considering nominating Penny Pritzker, the billionaire Hyatt Hotels heiress and businesswoman who had served as his chief campaign fund-raiser, as commerce secretary. But faced with awkward questions about her financial dealings, she declared that she did not want the nomination.
Last week, however, on Ms. Pritzker's 54th birthday, she stood beside Mr. Obama as he announced her nomination for that same position, investing his administration's political capital in trying to get her confirmed amid a far more toxic political atmosphere than he faced at the start of his first term.
''For your birthday present, you get to go through confirmation,'' Mr. Obama joked. ''It's going to be great.'' 
Republican senators are likely to be interested in the Pritzker family's reputation as innovators in the use of offshore trusts and foreign bank secrecy laws to shelter their wealth from income, capital gains and inheritance taxes. Even after tax code loopholes were closed, the family's trusts were grandfathered in and it kept benefiting from them.
Indeed, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has called for scrutiny of her family's trusts, saying she was ''associated with the kind of tax avoidance activity that the president dismisses as fat cat shenanigans for others. It's hypocritical to overlook tax avoidance when it's convenient.''
The administration declined a request to interview Ms. Pritzker. But in 2008, The New York Times sent her questions hours before she withdrew from consideration. Her written answers then may foreshadow testimony in her confirmation hearing.
For example, The Times asked whether it was ethical to avoid taxes through such arrangements. Ms. Pritzker replied that most of her wealth was held by domestic trusts, but she acknowledged, ''I am a beneficiary of some non-U.S. situs trusts which were established about 50 years ago (when I was a child) and are administered by a non-U.S.-based financial institution, as trustee. I do not control how those trust assets are administered.''
The White House expressed confidence that Ms. Pritzker would be confirmed, pointing to support from groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. When asked what had changed since 2008, Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said that Ms. Pritzker was in a different place.
''At the time,'' he said, ''she was managing an extensive portfolio of businesses that were under pressure due to the financial crisis. Those businesses had thousands of employees. She also had an ongoing obligation to oversee her family's restructuring of assets to separate out the interests of various family members.''
Indeed, a Democrat familiar with the Obama transition team said in 2008 that Ms. Pritzker's family had resisted any nomination because their assets were so entangled. Last week, a White House official involved in vetting her said they had since completed dividing up their finances.
The official said the Commerce Committee disclosure form, which will be made public soon, focuses on assets dating back one to two years. (To avoid conflicts of interest, the official added, Ms. Pritzker agreed to sell off certain holdings if she is confirmed.) But it is not clear whether she can avoid disclosing her tax records and what was in her shared family trusts earlier.
Asked what would happen if Congress sought earlier financial records, the White House official said it would be ''not fair'' if lawmakers were ''to subject her to a process that is different from other cabinet secretaries generally,'' adding, ''We're going to evaluate those requests when they come.''
Ms. Pritzker's role in overseeing Superior Bank, which collapsed amid accounting irregularities in 2001, may also draw scrutiny.
Her family and a partner established the bank in 1988 from the ruins of a failed savings and loan that was acquired -- along with the right to more than $600 million in tax credits from its previous losses. Ms. Pritzker became its chairwoman, and later a director of its holding company.
In the 1990s, Superior focused on subprime lending -- high-interest loans that are marketed to people with shaky finances. It was a pioneer in bundling them into securities -- selling some portions, while retaining riskier ones -- a practice that later spread and led to the 2008 financial crisis.
Outside accountants signed off, allowing the owners to take cash out of the bank as dividends. But in 2001, regulators said that Superior was undercapitalized because it had overstated the value of the toxic assets on its balance sheet.
In a sign of the closeness of her own role, Ms. Pritzker wrote a letter assuring employees that its owners would save the bank, adding, ''Our commitment to subprime has never been stronger.'' But the deal fell through, and the bank was declared insolvent two months later.
''The failure of Superior Bank was directly attributable to the board of directors and executive management ignoring sound risk diversification principles as evidenced by excessive concentrations in residual assets related to subprime lending,'' a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation inspector general report said.
Burt Ely, a banking consultant who testified at a 2001 hearing about Superior's failure, said that Ms. Pritzker's stewardship raised embarrassing questions.
''What is going to cause turbulence is not just the failure of Superior, but also the kind of lending that Superior was doing before it failed,'' he said, adding that Ms. Pritzker has a reputation as ''a very sharp person, financially. She had to have understood what the basic business model was.''
In 2008, Ms. Pritzker wrote that ''I sincerely regret the closing of Superior Bank'' and noted that her family's trusts were paying $460 million to help defray the losses ''despite the fact we had no legal duty to do so.''
Still, depositors with an excess of the insured limit in their accounts lost $10 million. A lawyer, Clint Krislov, sued on their behalf. But the Pritzkers defeated the lawsuit.
Ms. Pritzker in 2008 defended her family's refusal to pay uninsured depositors more than the deal reached with regulators, noting the legal principle ''that there should be only one representative for a failed institution, the F.D.I.C.,'' and stressing their contributions to the receivership.
Mr. Krislov said the Pritzkers won an unusual deal allowing bank shareholders to be paid from recovered assets before depositors, which, along with the tax credits they obtained in 1988, meant ''they came out ahead.'' He portrayed the episode as showing ''that the very wealthy get special deals the rest of us don't get.''
One open question is how much hay Republicans will be able to make out of such sentiments. Bruce Buchanan, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Austin, noted that Republicans typically defend against populist-tinged attacks on the financial dealings of the wealthy. Indeed, the White House noted that in 2006, Mr. Grassley backed a wealthy Bush administration Treasury secretary nominee who used offshore funds.
Still, as Mr. Grassley's statement showed, hypocrisy charges can go both ways. In other contexts, Mr. Obama has criticized arrangements that allow wealthy people to avoid taxes, portrayed some subprime lending practices as predatory, and denounced as irresponsible and wrong the tactics that led to the financial crisis.
For now, Democrats are wary. Through a spokesman, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said Ms. Pritzker ''has the support in the Senate to be confirmed, and we should do so with haste.'' He added that ''playing politics'' with her nomination would be ''mindless, knee-jerk'' obstructionism by Republicans.
Still, Ms. Pritzker brings ''a lot of baggage'' to her confirmation fight, said Mr. Buchanan, the political science professor.
The president ''must really feel obligated to her, because it's not like he doesn't have enough on his plate as it is of the buzz saw variety,'' he said. ''On the other hand, she is a talented woman and she's done some good work, so I'm guessing he thinks he can weather this whether she is confirmed or not.''

HEADLINE: 2008 Q. and A. With Penny Pritzker

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
In November 2008, after Senator Barack Obama won the presidential election, reports circulated that he was vetting one of his major campaign donors, the businesswoman and Hyatt Hotels heiress Penny Pritzker, as his commerce secretary nominee. The New York Times sent a list of detailed questions to Ms. Pritzker, through her publicist, about her business dealings. Several hours later, she issued a statement saying she did not want to be considered for the position, but she still answered The Times's questions. On Thursday, President Obama announced that he was nominating Ms. Pritzker to be commerce secretary for his second term. Here are her written answers from 2008.
Q. You have blamed the accountants for the Superior Bank collapse. But regulators were raising questions about the bank's risky operations for years before it failed. Why don't you bear any responsibility for what happened? 
A. I sincerely regret the closing of Superior Bank. Business interests of my extended family, voluntarily, agreed to pay the F.D.I.C. $460 million to help defray the losses at Superior despite the fact we had no legal duty to do so. Even though I had no ownership interest (personally or through trusts) in Superior Bank, trusts for my benefit, together with trusts for the benefit of many other family members, participated and will participate in these payments.
Q. Why did you write a letter in May 2001 assuring employees about the bank and allow Superior Bank to continue accepting uninsured deposits in the spring and early summer of 2001? Why did the family decide not to implement the rescue plan you had negotiated -- were you overruled? Do you have any regrets about how you or the family handled the situation?
A. I wrote the letter in May 2001 during a period of time in which we were engaged in negotiations with banking regulators concerning the recapitalization of Superior. Unfortunately, those negotiations ultimately were unsuccessful.
Q. Given your family's vast wealth, why won't you make the relatively small underinsured depositors whole? Their lawyer says they will end up being short about $10 million.
A. My extended family has contributed and will contribute a large amount of money to the Superior Bank receivership. The agreement we reached was with the F.D.I.C., which, by law, acts on behalf of all depositors. This legal principle has been upheld by all courts and is based upon the sound rationale adopted by Congress that there should be only one representative for a failed institution, the F.D.I.C. Uninsured depositors, to date, have received the insured portion of their deposits and nearly 70 percent of their uninsured monies. They are expected to continue to receive monies from the receivership collections. The average loss for uninsured depositors is projected to be about $6,000 each (about $10 million divided by approximately 1,600 depositors). My extended family will have contributed more than $450 million to the receivership.
Q. Is your wealth still primarily held in offshore trusts? Do you think it is ethical to use such arrangements to evade paying U.S. taxes, even if it is legal to do so because of the grandfathering in?
A. The vast majority of wealth that is publicly attributed to me is held in trusts for my benefit and the benefit of my family. Most of those trusts are based in the United States of America. I am a beneficiary of some non-U.S. situs trusts which were established about 50 years ago (when I was a child) and are administered by a non-U.S.-based financial institution, as trustee. I do not control how those trust assets are administered.

HEADLINE: A Bit of Sunshine Returns at Last for Fans in the Twilight of an Era

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
UNIONDALE, N.Y.
Sunlight is always a good sign for a hockey team, denoting survival well into springtime, into that totally different sport called the Stanley Cup playoffs.
However, sunlight at noon is something else. The Islanders and the Pittsburgh Penguins played a midday playoff game Sunday for the benefit of television schedules. When anybody sane would have been gardening or cycling or brunching, the bearded lads were whacking into one another with typical playoff ferocity.
The Isles, who have not won a postseason series since 1993, revived memories from before some fans were born. The fans at Nassau Coliseum added their energy to the karma left from the age of Al Arbour, and tried to raise the roof of the old barn. That will happen soon enough, because in the fall of 2015 the Isles will move into Brooklyn (which is actually on Long Island, for the record), leaving the Coliseum to be scaled down for concerts or minor league hockey or monster truck rallies. 
This season's schedule is running late, because of the labor stoppage that killed 34 games for each team, so the Islanders are playing first-round games when the playoffs might normally be well into the third round. But in this deprived part of the world, playoff games are to be savored.
On this sunny afternoon, it sounded like the old days, at least until the Penguins scored a power-play goal at 8 minutes 44 seconds of the first overtime for a 5-4 victory. The Islanders, who have not won a home playoff game since 2002, will try again Tuesday, but at least the players have heard the echoes of the good old days.
''You could hear them through the walls,'' said Colin McDonald, a fringe Islander enjoying his first playoff action at 28. ''I felt like a 10-year-old, goose bumps all over.''
McDonald has heard that this place used to vibrate, back when the Islanders were good, essentially before he was born. On Sunday, he heard it for himself.
''The fans deserve it,'' he said. ''They've waited a long time.''
Ken and Karen Joelson of Port Washington, N.Y., were wearing blue-and-orange gear on Sunday. He was a Rangers fan until 1972 when the Islanders were formed and he schlepped out from Jackson Heights, Queens. He was hooked when the Islanders bounced back from a three-game deficit to stun Pittsburgh in the 1975 quarterfinals, and before long, he was sharing season tickets. As his law practice grew, he took over a two-ticket package for all home games.
Asked about his best moments in the old barn, Joelson, 62, did not name any heroics from the four straight Cups but, rather, ''the Bates goal'' -- the penalty shot by Shawn Bates that beat Toronto in 2002, a series the Islanders went on to lose.
The fact is, they have not won a series since 1993, when they beat Pittsburgh in seven. And they are running out of time. The taxpayers of Nassau County had a chance to spring for a bond referendum for an ambitious development of arena and housing and business from the entrepreneurial mind of Charles Wang, the owner of the Islanders. But the residents, already desperate with real estate and school taxes, turned down the proposal in 2011.
Joelson blamed elected officials' politics for the result and said the owner was ''devoted to the team'' but the arena proposal was done in by a bad economy and taxpayer resistance. Still, Joelson plans to make the run to Brooklyn starting in 2015.
The fans live on memories. One quickie jersey survey outside on Sunday produced this count -- dozens of Tavares 91s, three Bossy 22s, two DiPietro 39s and two Gillies 9s, along with a Peca 27, a Westfall 18, a LaFontaine 16, a Potvin 5 and a Tonelli 27. There were also five Crosby 87s, one Lemieux 66, one Malkin 71 and, go figure, a vintage Quebec Nordiques jersey (Stastny 26).
The fans were enjoying the bright sunlight before going inside. There was plenty of pregame light in the old days, when the Islanders were winning four straight Stanley Cups from 1980 to 1983. The season would slog from winter into the prolonged nasty April, but one day, everybody arrived at the Coliseum for a May series with the sun shining in the west.
I remember the sunburned arms of Dave Langevin, a stalwart defender in those Stanley Cup years, who was not supposed to play in a crucial playoff game in 1984 because of a damaged left shoulder, so he spent the afternoon hammering away on a shed in his backyard. When he arrived at the Coliseum, his arms were glowing. Then the doctor cleared him to play, so he covered up his arms and went out and belted Montreal.
The sun comes back to Long Island, but Potvin, Bossy, Trottier and Smitty do not skate here anymore. The franchise has slipped to dead last in attendance, averaging 13,306 fans a game this season. Coach Jack Capuano has helped make the Islanders respectable. They came back from a 3-1 deficit to win Game 2 in Pittsburgh, and showed great intensity at times Sunday, but with Sidney Crosby scoring points in multiples again, the Islanders are in big trouble. Spring may well outlast the Islanders again this year.
