Before an Election, Prisons Are Good. The Bills Come Later.

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
This is an election year in New Jersey, and it is not a good time to be a criminal.
With Governor Whitman and every state legislator up for re-election in November, lawmakers have passed one bill after another to keep thousands of criminals behind bars for longer times. And the Governor has signed the bills with much fanfare, saying they will make New Jersey a safer place. 
 But rarely does the Governor, or any other elected state official, Republican or Democrat, mention what it is costing taxpayers to put an ever greater number of people away. Nor do they much discuss where they plan to put new inmates when state prisons are already crammed with almost half again as many prisoners as they were designed for.
"We are more willing to deal with the growth in prison population than to see violent criminals on the streets," said a spokeswoman for Governor Whitman, Julie Plocinik.
State corrections officials estimate that the toughest new law, which requires violent offenders to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, will add a total of 4,100 prisoners over the next 18 years to a prison population of more than 27,000 men and women. The officials say it will cost $329 million just to build enough cells for those new inmates. And it will cost taxpayers $26,000 a year for each prisoner for food, security, electricity and other costs of running the prisons.
Most prisoners now serve about 40 percent of their sentences before being paroled.
Last week, Governor Whitman signed another crime bill, which stiffens sentences for drug dealers who sell large amounts of marijuana, hashish or methamphetamine.
She signed the bill while sitting at a table in front of the Passaic County jail, which, like most county jails in New Jersey, holds hundreds of state prisoners for whom the 13 state prisons do not have room. But the Passaic County jail, which holds about 1,600 inmates in cells that were intended for 839, is even more crowded than the prisons.
Last fall, 150 police officers provided the backdrop as Mrs. Whitman signed another bill prohibiting parole to anyone convicted of murdering an on-duty law enforcement officer. That bill-signing ceremony was filmed by the Republican State Committee in case Mrs. Whitman decided to use clips in her campaign commercials.
The legislature had passed all three bills almost unanimously.
"If you are going to do a crime in New Jersey, you are going to have to do the time," said State Senator John O. Bennett, Republican of Little Silver, who sponsored the bill requiring violent offenders to serve 85 percent of their sentences. "I many times say that it is too bad that not every year is an election year."
Mr. Bennett said he believed that corrections officials might be overestimating the impact of the new crime bills on the prison population. And he said he believed that the state might be able to relieve some of the overcrowding by moving some nonviolent drug offenders out of the prisons and into drug rehabilitation programs.
But Mr. Bennett has also proposed another bill that would ask voters to agree to build another state prison. The state's newest and largest prison, the $237 million South Woods prison in Bridgeton, opened in May, but corrections officials say the 3,200 new beds will not even take care of the 5,500 state inmates now in the county jails.
The state's prison population is now rising by about 100 people each month. To cope, state prison officials have put double bunks in most cells and have created dormitories from gymnasiums, classrooms and even a chapel. At Bayside State Prison, tents that officials set up in 1989 as temporary housing still house more than 100 prisoners.
"Overcrowding has been like a virus that has gobbled up every inch of space," said Bob McHugh, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections. "We are just trying to keep from being overwhelmed."
Late last month, a corrections officer at Bayside, Frederick Baker, died after a prisoner stabbed him with a handmade knife. Officials of the labor union that represents the corrections officers said the state had created dangerous conditions at that Cumberland County prison and others by jamming in too many prisoners.
Governor Whitman recently credited the state's tougher sentencing laws with helping to reduce the violent crime rate. Violent crimes in New Jersey dropped 11 percent in 1996, largely because of large decreases in murders and other crimes in Newark and Camden.
But James A. Hemm, the executive director of the New Jersey Association on Correction, a group that works to improve prison conditions, said he did not believe the crime rate was dropping because of the new laws. Instead, he said, crime may be falling because fewer people are unemployed and because there are fewer people between 16 and 28, the age group more likely to commit crimes.
Mr. Hemm added that the new laws meant more offenders would be imprisoned late in their lives, a time when it is far less likely that they would commit another crime.
"You don't hear a lot about 56-year-olds getting arrested for armed robberies," he said. "You're locking up a whole lot of people who likely wouldn't commit crimes."

The cost of keeping adult lawbreakers in prison has climbed steadily. Until the fiscal year of 1994, the Department of Corrections budget also included the cost of housing juvenile offenders. The chart shows the correlation between the number of inmates, and the amount of money spent on them from 1986-1997. (Source: Department of Corrections)

Whom to Call if the Neighbor Never Cuts the Grass

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: LONG BRANCH

 BODY:
Nobody dropped a sack of garbage on Kevin Hayes's desk last week.
In fact, it hasn't happened since June. But metaphorically speaking, whenever residents of Long Branch feel dumped on by their neighbors -- by their uncovered trash cans, their overhanging branches and untrimmed hedges, or the funny smell coming from the improvised auto body shop next door -- they are only too happy to dump their problems on Mr. Hayes. 
 And Mr. Hayes, the city's chief of code enforcement, is relatively happy to be dumped on.
"If they don't complain, we don't know there's a problem," he said. "And to us, if someone complains, they got a reason for it."
The police may go after the burglars and murderers, but in most towns, much of the burden of defending the quality of life rest on code officers, who enforce state and local cods on health, housing, zoning, property maintenance, fire and public nuisances.
"Our job is to protect the public health, safety and welfare to see that the home, workplace and recreation space are safe from hazards," said Gary Lewis, president of the New Jersey Fire Prevention and Protection Association, a state organization of code enforcement officials.
Mr. Lewis, the head code officer in Summit, did receive an unsolicited gift of trash in his office last week.
"Mrs. Vespucci just brought us a bag of garbage from the car dealer she lives next door to," he said Tuesday afternoon. Inside were dozens of the paper mats that mechanics put on the floor in front of the driver's seat when they're working on a car, which many customers apparently toss into the parking lot and which then blow onto Mrs. Vespucci's lawn. Mrs. Vespucci, who Mr. Lewis said had also complained about the noise from the car dealer's outdoor paging system, is not unknown to local authorities.
"If she had simply called me, I would have believed her," Mr. Lewis said. "But I guess she chose to make the point a little more saliently."
Even those who simply call tend to make their points saliently enough that the code enforcers need to hold the phone away from their ears.
"What happens is that people see something for three or four weeks and it festers and drives them crazy," Mr. Hayes said. "Then they call up and they say: 'This has been going on for months. When are you people going to do something about it?' "
What they do, usually, is try to solve the problem by the gentlest means possible.
"Our goal is not to bring people into court to fine them," said Mr. Hayes, a good-natured, heavy-set man of 39 who was once Long Branch's fire chief. "We'd rather have them put the money into fixing up their property. A $500 fine would go a long way toward painting a building, fixing leaks, boarding it up, whatever."
Complaints in Long Branch, an economically, ethnically and architecturally diverse city of 28,000 with a five-mile oceanfront that includes $15 million castles at one end and a burned-out amusement pier at the other, tend to be about almost anything.
"We had a complaint about chickens in the alley behind a botanica," Mr. Hayes said, referring to a Hispanic religious goods store. "When we went in the back, we came to find out they were doing some kind of voodoo and cutting the heads off them."
"We got another complaint that someone was operating a business out of an apartment selling lesbian products. I guess it was some type of accessories. But it proved to be unfounded because they were doing a little mail order business, and that's legal as long as you don't have stock and entertain customers in your home."
The stack of green complaint provides terse portraits of small-city life. "There is an old Corvette parked in the rear side yard with weeds growing up around same," one report says. "Running illegal rooming house for Mexicans, living in basement, camping in backyard," says another. "Neighbor has built a stockade fence over three feet high in violation of 20-7.2," reads a third.
Not every complaint is happily resolved.
Around 4 o'clock Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Hayes took a phone call.
"A woman in Vine Court Apartments says they got some stuff washing up on the beach," Mr. Hayes said to Fran Varacalli, the city's new watershed environmental coordinator. "Fran, you want to take a ride out?"
Ms. Varacalli, a recent Rutgers University graduate who was hired five weeks ago, leaped at the chance. She and Mr. Hayeswere soon walking the beach. A line of trash several hundred feet long was scattered along the beach: six-pack rings, tampon applicators, motor oil quart containers, half a calabash, a shampoo bottle, a small magnetic letter P from somebody's refrigerator.
"This is definitely household," Ms. Varacalli said.
"Looks like somebody had a party on a boat and instead of bringing the trash in, they just dumped it overboard," Mr. Hayes said. The two of them scanned the trash for a piece of mail or a prescription bottle that might identify the culprit, to no avail.
On the way back to the car, Ms. Varacalli paused against the railing of the boardwalk and looked out at the ocean.
"I come to this beach almost every day," she said, "and to see what the effects are of a little garbage bag all over the beach -- ooh, it makes me so angry."
Mr. Hayes had seen worse.
"By tomorrow morning, the beach rake will come by and it'll all be gone," he said, lowering himself into the car. "Another day in the big city."

HEADLINE: Legislation Would Ban Beach-Badge Fees

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I have introduced legislation, along with Assemblyman Neil Cohen of Union, that would enable beachgoers to enjoy free access to New Jersey's public beaches. Under the measure, shore towns would be responsible for seeking state reimbursement for public beach costs. This would eliminate the need for beach badges. 
 Shore communities would stand to benefit economically from our legislation because excessively high beach fees are an impediment to shore tourism, New Jersey's second largest industry.

In Fair August, Work Is but a Midsummer Daydream

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
IT seems T. S. Eliot was wrong. August, not April, is the cruelest month, at least for trying to conduct business. Just try setting up a meeting this month. Or arranging a job interview. Or getting a telephone call returned.
Yes, technology has taken some of the angst out of working in August with cellular phones and E-mail. Still, these technological leashes are not long enough or pervasive enough to tether the many Americans who flee their jobs, if not their towns and even the country, for the entire month. And in many parts of this country, as has been true in Europe for years, August is an all-purpose reason nothing gets done. 
 "August is the month we dread," said Ricky Eisen, president of Between the Bread, a caterer for 2,000 businesses in New York City. "Our clients depend on us when they do business. If their business is off, our business is off, and August is our slowest month."
And the dog days of Ahhhhhgust are getting even more somnolent. For example, in August 1994 business at Between the Bread fell 10 percent from July. Last year, it fell 20 percent. "Nothing happens," Ms. Eisen said. "Important people go away. There are fewer meetings, fewer big decisions."
The annual August abandonment afflicts the professional class in addition to corporate wheeler dealers and businesses big and small. Do not be arrested in August; your lawyer may be lounging in the Hamptons. Do not be audited in August; your accountant may be taking the children to the Grand Canyon. Do not become sick in August; your doctor may be puttering around the golf courses of Ireland. And do not even try to get a Prozac prescription in August; your psychiatrist is dictating a self-help book at his vacation home on Cape Cod.
"Most shrinks take August off as a vacation month," said Dr. Robert R. Butterworth, a psychologist in Los Angeles.
Vacation is not always the right word, though, especially in an age that has elevated the entrepreneur to rock star status.
"It is uncool to 'go on vacation' in the career-crazed late 1990's," said Patricia Rosenberg, a public relations executive in Tustin, Calif.
"Everyone I try to contact is 'traveling,' simply 'away from the office,' an interesting view of one's personal time," she said.
But while so many are ostensibly traveling so far for business, not much seems to be accomplished, with August the universal excuse. While some companies in Europe are now trying to have employees stagger their time off, August has long been known as a getaway month there.
In France, everyone from the owner of the local patisserie to the prime minister heads for the Cote d'Azur, a tradition with roots in les grandes vacances -- the summer school break -- and labor laws that guarantee paid vacation. In Italy, the fleeing of Rome in August causes the ability to do business to go from difficult to impossible. In Germany, even the Bundesbank shuts down for four weeks.
The whole world does not shut down in August, of course. "The sharpest marketing organizations schedule South American and Australian tours during the dead months of July and August," said Steve Foote, vice president of Research Strategy at the Hurwitz Group, a management consultant and market research company in Newton, Mass. "One: It's wintertime in the Southern Hemisphere in July and August, therefore there's no vacation issues. Two: South America is a rapidly growing market and economy, fifth largest in the world by most any metric."
In the United States, some areas fall asleep in August more noticeably than others. Washington is notorious for shutting down. In Manhattan, getting away is part of the status game, even if it means enduring hours of traffic jams and arriving in towns filled with the people many New Yorkers are trying to escape: other New Yorkers.
August may yawn the widest in South Florida, however, where many businesses still close for the entire month as their owners decamp to places like the North Carolina mountains and Bar Harbor, Me.
Despite August's hold, or lack of hold, on Americans, it is not the busiest month for vacations. July holds that spot, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. July vacationers must be campers, though, because August is the busiest month for both air travel and hotel stays, industry trade groups say.
"I have worked for nonprofits for many years, and we wouldn't even try to raise money from businesses or individuals in August," said Winter Prosapio, now a spokesman with P.G.& E. Gas Transmission-Texas in San Antonio. "Your solicitation letter ends up in the summer reading circular file, even with companies who are on September to August business cycles."
In the news business, August is regarded as a permanent weekend, a calendar page of Sundays. Often, editors think news waits to happen until August is over.
But August's reputation as a no-news month is undeserved. Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990; Hurricane Andrew struck Miami in August 1992, and Elvis Presley died in August 1977. In fact, so much happens in August that after Boris N. Yeltsin rescued Mikhail S. Gorbachev from a coup d'etat in August 1992, President George Bush quipped: "What is it about August?"
August can be enough to make one turn to drink. But even that is not easy. "We own a small tavern," says Sharon Clark of Eastampton, N.J. "But in August, the liquor companies close down for two weeks every year. All of them, at the same time, and there is no place else to purchase liquor for the bar."
"To handle it," she added, "we had to stockpile two weeks' worth of liquor and pray that we ordered enough to get us through."

HEADLINE: THE NEW TAX LAW: Amid Complexity, Opportunities Abound;
Planning Your Estate Around the New Exemptions

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
For all Washington's celebratory mood over the nation's first major tax cut in 16 years, Congress and the Clinton Administration hardly issued an open invitation to the party. Rather than an across-the-board tax cut, the $96 billion package is a series of narrowly focused measures intended to achieve specific goals. How much you benefit depends on your personal circumstances. Here is a guide to achieving key financial objectives under the new rules.
FOR countless American families grief strikes twice, first when a person dies, and next when heirs learn that taxes will take a big chunk of the estate, taxes that could have been significantly reduced by planning.
The hue and cry over estate taxes has gotten louder in recent years, as inflation has eroded the value of the $600,000 estate that is exempt from gift and estate taxes, which go as high as 55 percent, and as housing values have climbed and soaring financial markets have swollen pension assets, making millionaires of people who have been middle-class all their working lives. 
 The distress signal has been especially loud from family-owned businesses, because in extreme -- but not unusual -- cases heirs have had to sell off plant and equipment to pay estate taxes, sometimes crippling the business.
The new law addresses these concerns by gradually raising the amount that is exempt from gift and estate taxes to $1 million in the year 2006, beginning with $625,000 next year, and by raising the exemption for qualifying family businesses to $1.3 million next year.
"It is not the major relief that had been sought," said John H. Gardner, senior manager in the Washington national tax office of KPMG Peat Marwick. He added that the provisions for family businesses are "really complicated" and may not help many businesses.
Still, for small, family businesses in which the next generation would be active, Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and accountant, said, $277,000 in taxes could be be avoided on an estate of $1.3 million. For a business like a store, that might be the difference in carrying on or selling.
"It is terribly important for all people to have their wills and estate plans reviewed in light of these rules," Mr. Kess said.
Sanford J. Schlesinger, head of the wills and estates department of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, a New York law firm, who is and head of its wills and estates department, said the first thing he asked a new client to do was make a list of assets. "They are nearly always surprised at how much they have," he said. "In New York a school teacher with a $200,000 to $300,000 house, life insurance and a pension plan can be a millionaire," with a taxable estate.
The goal of an estate plan is to cut tax liabilities by reducing the size of the estate. Life insurance, for example, can be removed from an estate by transferring ownership to an irrevocable trust. And a couple, instead of owning everything jointly, can put some assets in the husband's name and some in the wife's. They can then set up trusts so that a surviving spouse gets the benefit of the other's assets, but upon that spouse's death a child, or someone else, inherits the assets.
Under the old law, a $1.2 million estate that would have owed taxes of $235,000 could have been divided into two $600,000 estates in this way, and taxes would have been avoided.
Jonathan Herlands, the partner in charge of the trusts and estates department of Janvey, Gordon, Herlands, Randolph, Rosenberg & Cox, a New York law firm, said that "a lot of people have wills that talk about $600,000 in trust." Now, with the exemption gradually rising to $1 million in 2006, many documents will have to be revised. One way is to use percentages, as is often done in will-writing, instead of specific dollar amounts.
However, other wills do use percentages, known as formula provisions, he said, and for a $1 million estate, that might now effectively disinherit a spouse or family members, who could then contest the will. So each estate plan will have to be reviewed individually.
The family businesses provisions are especially complex, and "the details of this make it unavailable to the majority of business owners," said Ross W. Nager, a partner in Arthur Andersen in Houston and national executive director of the firm's Center for Family Business. "The rationale is buried in the political sausage-making process," he said.
One difficulty is that if the business is sold within 10 years of the owner's death, and the heirs have taken advantage of the $1.3 million exemption, they will then be liable for what is known as recapture of the taxes that were avoided, plus interest, and for taxes on any capital gains on the sale. And there are no exceptions or hardship provisions in the law.
Other problems are the law's stringent requirements that family members materially take part in the business, that the business be at least 50 percent of an estate, and that 50 percent of the business be owned by one family, 70 percent by two or 90 percent by members of three families, which could exclude many third and fourth-generation businesses.
But for a bigger business -- one with millions in assets and several hundred employees -- the new law is unlikely to be helpful, Mr. Nager said. Families with large businesses still need sophisticated succession and estate plans.

Pension Concerns Move to the Picket Line

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
IF you are among the millions of Americans worried about being able to retire in comfort, you may want to pay close attention to the strike that began Monday at United Parcel Service and the tentative settlement the same day of the steel industry's longest strike ever, at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel.
Pensions were the core issue at Wheeling-Pittsburgh and are the No. 2 issue in the U.P.S. talks. And at companies from Continental Airlines to Rochester Telephone, workers are telling unions that pension benefits are almost as important to them as wages. 
 This interest marks a shift from the last decade, when, after wages, the big issues in collective bargaining were job security and preserving health insurance benefits. Sustained economic growth and lower inflation, together with a deluge of news coverage telling the nation's aging workers how poorly they may fare in retirement, have raised the profile of pensions.
Bill Patterson, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s pension policy chief, said: "The central issue is the security of retirement benefits. The trend by employers is to downgrade retirement benefits and shift the risks to workers."
At issue in the strikes is the unions' desire to preserve the traditional defined-benefit pension plan, in which the employer makes a fixed monthly payment, based on salary and years of service, and then makes investing decisions and guarantees a monthly check at retirement. In their stead, companies are increasingly offering defined-contribution plans, like 401(k)'s, to which the employer, and often the workers as well, make contributions. Employees make investment decisions from options offered by the employer -- and are therefore responsible for the profits (or the losses) caused by their investing decisions.
Employees like those at U.P.S. and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel like the traditional pension plan because the employee gets a check for life -- whereas the investment choices made by an employee with a 401(k) can leave him or her broke. Although stocks have risen sharply, amateur investors may fear they will lose their investments if the market falls. Many companies dislike defined-benefit pensions because such plans are highly regulated and put all the investment risk on the company. Moreover, companies say workers under 50 do not value the plans.
Mr. Patterson said, "The bull stock market makes it easier for companies to promote defined-contribution plans because right now it looks like everyone who is in the stock market can get rich, but that won't last and the danger is that there will be losses and there won't be enough money at the end of the road."
Alan Glickstein, a principal at Kwasha Lipton Group, the benefits consulting arm of the Coopers & Lybrand accounting firm, said unions were increasingly resistant to changes in retirement plans.
"We are seeing more and more a very educated union leadership that is raising pension design issues, sophisticated issues that were never even discussed in the past," said Mr. Glickstein, whose group has been in the forefront of designing less expensive pension plans for employers.
Corporate spending on all types of retirement plans, adjusted for inflation, has fallen by more than a third, from 84 cents an hour worked in 1977 to 53 cents an hour last year, said Lawrence Mishell, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, a research organization partly financed by unions.
The percentage of private-sector workers with defined-benefit pensions fell to 28 percent by 1992, from 40 percent in 1975, Mr. Mishell said. The percentage with defined-contribution plans grew to 33 percent from 13 percent in the same period, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute.
At Wheeling-Pittsburgh some 4,500 steelworkers walked picket lines for 10 months to win a traditional defined-benefit pension of $1,200 a month after 30 years of work. The company for years had the same pension plan as other steelmakers, but after going through bankruptcy proceedings a decade ago the company switched to a defined-contribution plan with what the union regarded as minimal benefits.
The United Steelworkers said the financier Ronald LaBow, who bought the company while it was in bankruptcy, had promised to restore traditional pensions when Wheeling-Pittsburgh became healthy, a situation the union felt was reached in 1995.
Winning back the traditional pension with lifetime payments came at the cost of 850 jobs, some of them held by workers ages 55 to 62 who will get just $450 a month until they become eligible for Social Security.
At U.P.S., management wants to withdraw from seven regional multi-employer defined benefit plans, to which many companies contribute, and set up its own single-employer fund -- also a defined-benefit plan -- for its employees. The company calculates that it would need to pay $700 million to cover its share of the existing shortfall in these plans, which do not have enough money to meet their obligations. Yet, the company says, it would still be better off, able to either spend the same amount on pensions it does now and offer much bigger benefits, or to cut its costs and produce the same benefits.
The problem is that the potential withdrawal of U.P.S., the strongest participant in these seven regional plans, raises concerns that teamsters with other trucking companies may not collect all the benefits due them, said Greg Tarpinian, executive director of the Labor Research Institute, a union-financed group in New York.
"It is the nature of multi-employer plans that stronger companies tend to subsidize weaker ones," Mr. Tarpinian said. "From a strictly economic standpoint, U.P.S. can get a bigger bang for its buck by creating its own plan. But the union cannot possibly allow that to happen without putting at risk the pension of hundreds of its members at other companies."
At Continental, leaders of the Independent Association of Continental Pilots were surprised to find when they surveyed their 5,100 members that "the pension was neck-and-neck with pay as an issue," said Bob Borelli, a vice president of the union.
The issue was complicated by the company's 1983 bankruptcy. The union says a captain with 30 years at Continental qualifies for a pension with a lump-sum value of less than $300,000, while an American Airlines pilot gets $3.7 million. This is true because the American pilot, who makes more money in the first place, also gets credit for 30 years of service in one plan, while Continental's bankruptcy means the pilot gets 16 years in the pre-bankruptcy pension plan, one year without coverage and 13 years in the new plan.
Mr. Borelli said that 150 Continental captains who reached 60 -- the Government-mandated retirement age for pilots -- had to take work as flight engineers because their pensions were inadequate. "I have 15 years to go and I don't intend to leave my captain's chair to be a flight engineer," Mr. Borelli said. "And a lot of our members feel that way because they have told us that pensions and wages are the pillars on which they want our new contract built."
Ned Walker, a Continental spokesman, said, "We recognize this as an important issue and have offered some creative solutions." He said the disparity between the Continental and American pensions for pilots is only one-fifth what the union says.

Unions say that their members are pressing to preserve and enhance pension benefits. In traditional, defined benefit-pension plans, the investment risks are borne by the employer and the retiree gets a check for life. Over the last two decades, however, the trend has been toward defined-contribution plans like profit-sharing and 401(k)'s, in which workers bear the investment risk and are not guaranteed a fixed amount for life.

HEADLINE: For Cleaner Air, Try Electric Trucks

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An Aug. 6 news article reports that Judge Lawrence E. Kahn ruled that New York State can order auto manufacturers to sell thousands of electrically powered vehicles in the state beginning this fall. But the real question is whether he can order customers to buy the cars. 
 I am old enough to recall the Ward Baking Company electric vehicles delivering their products to grocers in the 1930's. It had nothing to do with environmentalism; it was simply more economical for a truck that did short-haul, stop-and-go driving to be powered by electricity.
The effort should be made to electrify this class of trucks. They contribute a disproportionate amount of pollution with their mode of operation. Why California and New York try to promote the electric vehicle for use by the average motorist defies all reason.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
New Frenzy: A Split, a Beep and an Option

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
CARL CZEREPAK was sitting in a barber shop last June, getting a haircut and a shave, when his beeper went off.
The barber's phone did not work, so Mr. Czerepak rushed out to his car, not on the news of a birth or an emergency at home but on a flash bulletin from Wall Street: Caterpillar Inc. had just announced a 2-for-1 stock split. 
 "I ran out with a bib on, got my cellular phone and called my broker," said Mr. Czerepak (pronounced SEH-re-pack), a law-enforcement officer. "I knew Caterpillar was a blue-chip stock, so I didn't hesitate to buy."
Like scores of other investors who hope to reap the rewards of the raging bull market, Mr. Czerepak has been swept up by stock split fever, the bet that once a company splits its stock, the shares will soar.
Some academic studies have found that share prices do tend to rise on news of a stock split, though there is no clear reason they should: all a split does is take one share worth, say, $100 and turn it into two shares worth $50 each.
Some analysts suggest that cheaper stocks are more attractive to amateur investors, who drive their prices up; others say a split is a sign that management of a company is confident about its future. Investors who have picked up on such logic from seminars, investing guides and Internet newsletters are rushing out to capitalize on it.
The boom has created its own mini industry of advisers and seminars as well as paging services like the one Mr. Czerepak uses. And it has contributed to a surge in trading volume at securities exchanges around the country.
But the frenzy worries some Wall Street observers, who say that stock splits are simply a meaningless division of the stock pie into smaller pieces. They fret that amateur investors are getting swept up in a speculative bubble that is bound to burst, leaving them with big losses.
"It's a sign of the times," said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. "This is a market in which pretext follows speculation, and the new pretext for speculators is that there are two shares in place of one, and that more is better than less, even though a stock split has no financial value."
Adding to critics' concerns is the way many investors are playing the stock-split game -- by using call options. These options are contracts that give investors the right to buy a stock at a particular price, within a set period. They are relatively inexpensive, compared with equities, and far more volatile. And while a successful options trade can bring an investor big profits, many options become utterly worthless.
"Of course, it is a fact that this strategy will not work forever," Bernard Schaeffer, president of the Investment Research Institute, wrote recently in a bulletin to his customers. He added that it is likely to end "very, very badly for the latecomers to the game."
Trading in equity options set a record in July, according to the Options Industry Council, and some of it, at least, is attributable to speculation on stock splits.
For instance, Caterpillar announced on June 11 that it would split its stock a month later. Before the announcement, trading volume in Caterpillar options on the American Stock Exchange had averaged 927 contracts a day; but on the day of the announcement, volume hit 7,693 contracts -- an eightfold rise.
"It's our feeling that it's happening because there are people out there with pagers," said Joseph B. Stefanelli, who oversees options trading at the American Stock Exchange. "They get a call that says, 'There's been a stock split. Buy Amalgamated Garbage Pails.' "
In recent months, the number of investor paging services has proliferated. Among the best known are Splitalert, Splitxpress and the IQ Pager. The services can cost up to $1,500 a year. There is also an Internet site called the Right Line Split Report, which is "devoted to the short term dramatic investment profitability of companies who have declared stock splits."
Trading options, "particularly on the split announcements, is probably the biggest thing going on Wall Street right now," said Kevin Tuohy, chief operating officer at Data Research Group, which runs Splitalert.
Anthony LaPine, the chief executive at Datalink Systems, an electronic-paging company, said that in recent months Datalink received scores of calls asking for a stock-split service. In response, his company created the Splitxpress pager, which already has several hundred subscribers. He said, "I'm led to believe that a lot of the history derives from people like Wade Cook."
Indeed, the name Wade B. Cook came up repeatedly in interviews with those who use stock split pagers. Mr. Cook is an evangelizing investment guru who spreads his word through seminars, tapes and best-selling books. He is also under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for securities fraud, according to documents his company, the Profit Financial Corporation, filed with the agency. Mr. Cook has denied any wrongdoing.
In a recent book, "Wall Street Money Machine," Mr. Cook -- a former cab driver whose proverbs include "God wants us to prosper" -- has an entire chapter devoted to buying options on stock splits. He also has an Internet site that, among other things, markets his IQ Pager. And a growing number of investors are taking his advice.
For instance, Edward Iskra of Clifton, N.J., a computer consultant, said that although trading on stock splits can be risky, he has done very well. "I can't say I've made a mint off of it, but the returns on investment I've gotten are large versus the market."
But even Mr. Cook thinks things may have gotten a little out of hand. "Options are just the latest craze," he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday, adding that no more than 5 percent of investors are sophisticated enough to make what he allows can be risky trades.
Still, earlier that day, he said, he was attending a meeting at an investment bank when his beeper sounded. Ingersoll-Rand had announced a 3-for-2 split. He tried to buy options, he said, "but we didn't get in there in time." He settled for buying 1,000 shares of stock.
It's a fast-moving market, even for those with beepers; just ask Mr. Czerepak, the law-enforcement official who had phoned his broker to buy options on Caterpillar. After less than a half-hour, Mr. Czerepak placed another call to his broker, only to find that the price of the options he owned had already risen substantially. He quickly sold them.
"I got a hot one, and got out and made a nice profit in 20 minutes," he said. "Of course, I gave the barber a nice tip."

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Staying Too Close to Home

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
Many investors own some mutual funds that invest overseas in the hope that these funds will help protect their portfolios from losses. After all, when markets sag in the United States, the international markets should soar, at least in theory.
But in practice, a lot of investors are not getting the benefits of international diversification, said Olivia Barbee, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund trackers. The reason: Many "international" funds have big holdings of American stocks. And these funds have recently been the best performers, attracting a lot of investors. 
 Moreover, in a global economy markets are increasingly linked. Many overseas investments have started to move in tandem with markets in the United States, rather than in the opposite direction.
Investors looking for diversification, Ms. Barbee said, should seek funds active in Japan, Latin America or emerging markets. Though risky standing alone, these funds can lower a portfolio's overall risk because their performance is so poorly correlated with American stocks.
Funds that invest in emerging markets may give the best diversification because they have expanded beyond Latin America and Asia and are moving into Russia, Poland and other eastern European countries.
Ms. Barbee suggests Templeton Developing Markets and a closed-end fund, Templeton Emerging Markets, both run by Mark Mobius, who has a long record of finding good values in out-of-the-way places. She also likes Vanguard International Equity Emerging Markets.
As for Latin American funds, while Mexico and Brazil have strong economic ties to the United States, the currencies and securities markets in both countries do not track American markets, Ms. Barbee said. She recommends Scudder Latin America, which buys high-quality large-capitalization stocks.
The stocks of Japanese companies also march to their own drummer. Ms. Barbee suggests that investors look at Vanguard International Equity Pacific, which keeps 80 percent of its money in Japan, and Schwab International Index, which invests in the largest companies outside of America and has big investments in Japanese equities. Among actively managed funds, she likes T. Rowe Price Japan.
 
Openings and Closings
Managers who have closed their funds to new investors, usually because the funds have become too big to be effectively managed, sometimes change their minds. A few reopen because of new opportunities.
But sometimes, unwieldy funds find that the market solves the problem for them. In other words, their performance declines, investors flee, and the fund shrinks.
Such was the case with PBHG Select Equity, which had $650 million under management at its peak last September. It closed a month later, but reopened in July after assets slid to $418.6 million because of its poor performance. The fund has gained less than 8 percent this year, while the average capital appreciation fund is up almost 19 percent, Lipper Analytical Services says.
Sometimes, funds have to close earlier than planned. The NI Growth and NI Micro Cap funds, run by John C. Bogle Jr., announced in mid-July they would close on Aug. 29, when the funds were expected to have each accumulated $100 million in assets. But strong performance lured investors, and the funds closed on Aug. 8, already over their target by more than $10 million. NI Growth, which invests in small companies, rose 20.2 percent in the first seven months of the year, while NI Micro Cap gained almost 25 percent in that time.
 
Mergers
Seven Invesco Advisor funds became AIM Advisor funds last Monday, though Invesco continues to manage the funds. (Last February, Invesco, which sells funds through direct marketing, bought AIM, which sells funds through brokers.)
The seven funds are Large Cap Value, Flex, International Value andMultiflex, which retain a 5.5 percent sales charge; Real Estate, with a 4.75 percent charge, and Income and Cash Management, also 4.75. The last two will be closed to new investors on Oct. 3 and be merged into existing Aim funds, subject to board approval.
Marketing and operations of two fund families, Turner and Clover, have been consolidated. The four Turner funds, Small Cap, Mid Cap, Ultra Large Cap and Growth Equity, and the three Clover funds, Equity Value, Small Cap Value and Fixed Income, will be renamed the TIP funds. TIP Turner Small Cap, which has $97 million under management, will be closed on Aug. 30.
Evergreen Keystone, a unit of the First Union Corporation, has merged six of its funds.
Keystone Balanced II merged into Evergreen Foundation; Keystone Mid-Cap Growth (S-3) into Keystone Strategic Growth (K-2); Evergreen Short-Intermediate Municipal-California into Evergreen Short-Intermediate Municipal; Keystone Liquid Trust into Evergreen Money Market; Keystone World Bond into Keystone Strategic Income, and Keystone Government Security into Evergreen U.S. Government.
 
Manager Changes
Nick C. Thakore, who runs Fidelity Select Telecommunications, will add to his responsibilities by taking the reins of Fidelity Utilities, Fidelity Select Utilities Growth and Fidelity Advisor Utilities Growth on Aug. 18. He replaces John M. Muresianu, who was named associate manager of American Trust Portfolio, an offshore fund managed by Fidelity International.
At the same time, Douglas B. Chase, the manager of Fidelity Select Automotive, will take over Fidelity Select Consumer Industries and Fidelity Advisor Consumer Industries from Paul L. Antico, who continues to run Fidelity Select Leisure. James F. Catudal, an equity analyst, takes over Fidelity Select Industrial Materials from Mr. Chase.

HEADLINE: THE NEW TAX LAW: Amid Complexity, Opportunities Abound;
Lower Capital Gains Rates, but the Devil Is in the Detail

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
For all Washington's celebratory mood over the nation's first major tax cut in 16 years, Congress and the Clinton Administration hardly issued an open invitation to the party. Rather than an across-the-board tax cut, the $96 billion package is a series of narrowly focused measures intended to achieve specific goals. How much you benefit depends on your personal circumstances. Here is a guide to achieving key financial objectives under the new rules.
TAXES on capital gains went down under the new tax law signed by President Clinton. They also got a lot more complicated, in part because the long term is becoming longer.
Under the new law, taxpayers who own an asset, like a stock or a bond, for at least 18 months and one day, and sell it at a profit, will owe a capital gains tax of 20 percent, or 10 percent for those in the 15 percent tax bracket for ordinary income. 
 One important change is in the holding period. The old law deemed as long-term assets those that were held for at least one year and a day. People who sell assets on or after July 29 that they have held for more than one year, but less than 18 months and a day, will still be subject to the old law, paying a rate of 15 percent if they are in the 15 percent tax bracket on ordinary income, and 28 percent otherwise.
The treatment of short-term capital gains has not changed. Any profits on an asset held for 12 months or less are taxed at ordinary income-tax rates of up to 39.6 percent.
Proving that tax laws can be complicated, taxpayers can get the 20 percent rate on sales between May 7 and July 28, even if they held the assets for no more than one year and a day. The new law also introduces a five-year rate, with different rules and effective dates for those who earn a lot and for those who earn a little.
Those who are in the 15 percent bracket in the year 2001 will be able to sell assets they have owned for at least five years and pay a capital gains rate of just 8 percent, two points below the 10 percent they would otherwise owe.
The catch is that people in that group -- with taxable incomes for a married couple of $41,200 in 1998, and a little bit higher in 2001, assuming inflation leads to bracket changes -- tend to have small capital gains. And if they have very much, they would be pushed into a higher bracket. But the provision may be of use to some retirees.
For those in higher brackets, the five-year break is more complicated. It will normally apply only to assets acquired in 2001 or later. So the 18 percent rate, instead of the normal long-term rate of 20 percent, will not generally apply to assets sold before 2006.
But if you own shares on Jan. 1, 2001, and would like to have them become eligible for the five-year rule, you can do so at a cost. The cost is that you will pay taxes then on the profits up to that point, at the 18 percent rate if you have then owned them for at least 18 months and a day. Then you would need to hold them for at least five more years, and would owe taxes at 18 percent on the additional appreciation when you sold them.
A popular way to defer capital gains taxes on stock has been to borrow identical shares and sell them short. This tactic -- called shorting against the box, in a reference to the old days when stock certificates might be held in a strong box -- is similar to selling because the holder no longer has any economic interest in the stock. But until now tax law has not treated it as a sale.
Now it will. And such shorting against the box after June 8 will be deemed a "constructive sale," resulting in capital gains taxes, unless the short position is covered by Jan. 30, 1998. Then, once the person had refrained from shorting the stock for at least 60 days, he or she could short it again, thereby hedging against a decline in the stock. To avoid having that hedge treated as a sale, however, it, too, would have to be removed by the following Jan. 30.
There are other ways to hedge against loss without becoming subject to the constructive sale rules. If you use options to limit risk, but leave yourself open to a possibility of at least some loss if the stock falls, or some profit if it rises, you will escape capital gains taxation while still reducing the risk of a plunging stock market. Just how much risk you have to keep will not be clear until regulations are issued, but they will not be retroactive.

REBIRTHING PAINS
Apple Makes Its Peace
Apple Computer and its archrival Microsoft exchanged words last week -- harmonious ones, for a change. In a stunning alliance, Microsoft agreed to invest $150 million in the struggling Apple, and to cooperate on several fronts. That offered Apple a much-needed vote of confidence. Microsoft apparently concluded it would pay too high a price if it let Apple die, since Microsoft is the largest seller of programs for Macintosh computers. And cleaning its own house, Apple changed its board, bringing in Steven P. Jobs, its co-founder, below, to a more official role and sweeping out A. C. Markkula Jr., another co-founder and power broker. Mr. Jobs joins the board with a number of industry and investment veterans, including Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of the software company Oracle and a critic of Microsoft. The changes mean that virtually every major computer hardware and software company -- many of which had been fighting each other -- have entered into the Apple camp. Apple's stock jumped on the news, but gave up some of its gains in Friday's market selloff.
 
THE BUDGET DEFICIT
A Monster at Bay
The Government's budget deficit is dwindling to a mere $37 billion this year, from $107 billion in 1996. That will bring it to its lowest level since 1974, President Clinton forecast. The strong economy and high tax receipts -- thanks in part to increases passed in 1990 and 1993 -- brought a great improvement even before the balanced-budget agreement he signed into law last week had a chance to take effect. Economists said the budget deal would control the deficit in coming years, however, when the gap between revenue and spending would otherwise begin widening. 

STOCK INVESTING
Cloud on the Market
Stocks teetered at the end of the week, as interest rates rose. For the week, the Dow gave up its record-setting ways and fell 162.82 points, to 8,031.22, down 1.99 percent. Virtually all the drop came on Friday, on profit-taking and rising concerns that inflation may accelerate in the third quarter, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. In the credit markets, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 6.63 percent from 6.29 percent a week earlier. But mutual funds investors have kept on pouring money into the market. New estimates for July show that investors put $23 billion in new cash into equity funds, the most since January and the fifth-biggest month ever.
 
TAX AVOIDANCE
Kicking Back at the Rich
The cosmetics company Estee Lauder went public two years back, and some shrewd maneuvering by its namesake and her son Ronald avoided as much as $95 million in capital gains taxes on the sale, a feat that impressed Wall Street. Rather than selling their own shares, they borrowed shares from family members and sold them, a move based on the classic tax-avoidance technique called shorting against the box. Now, in the new tax law, Washington has struck back. Unless one of the Lauders dies in the next few months, or unless the law is amended or struck down in court, the Lauders or their estates will end up facing a big tax bill. The provision could catch other investors as well.
 
HEALTH CARE GIANTS
The Leader Stumbles
Columbia/HCA Healthcare is changing the way it does business, vastly transforming a company that upended the sleepy world of hospitals and pushed the proposition of medical care for profit, to the point that it drew the interest of Federal investigators. Gone apparently is the obsession with 15 percent profit growth each year. Gone also is the seemingly insatiable appetite for acquiring competing hospitals. And gone is the unshakable faith that to succeed, a modern health care company must own businesses that provide every phase of treatment, from hospital care to home care. The jettisoning of many of its controversial practices, like its cash bonuses for executives who met financial targets, may portend changes in other parts of the consolidating industry.
 
PHONE REGULATION
Heat Is on the Foreign Carriers
Washington issued tough rules to cut the $5.4 billion that American phone companies pay foreign carriers to complete their calls. The rules represent the Government's aggressive entry into the back-room haggling of phone companies and may have a dramatic impact on the average phone bill. Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the F.C.C., said the rules would help slash the average cost of calling overseas from 88 cents a minute, to just 20 cents six years from now. "There has been a consensus for a decade that a cartel of companies has jacked up prices to a hideous level," he said. But foreign carriers howled, and some might refuse to go along. For good measure, they also questioned the agency's jurisdiction.
 
GLOBAL WARMING
Oil Companies Relent
The industry monolith that opposed efforts to curb greenhouse gases is cracking up. Just a few years ago, the energy industry spoke with one voice dismissing the whole idea of global warming, particularly the need for a treaty to control gas emissions into the atmosphere. Now that unanimity has cracked and from an unlikely direction -- producers of coal and oil. British Petroleum, the world's third-largest oil company, said it believed there was enough evidence to warrant concern about whether burning coal and oil was changing the Earth's climate. The dominant scientific view is that greenhouse gases are probably responsible for at least part of a rise of 1 degree Fahrenheit in the average global temperature over the last century. And the next century could see a rise of 3.5 degrees.
 
BOTTLED WATER FRENZY
Eau de Buffalo, Coming Up
Tapping into the $4 billion-a-year market for bottled water, cities of lesser cachet, like Kansas City and North Miami Beach, are exploring plans to market their tap water, with eye-catching labels and the ever-popular "sport caps" that enable the thirsty to open the container with a pull of the teeth. The marketing plans dare consumers to pay $1 or more for a quart that could be drawn from their own taps and put in a refrigerator for less than a tenth of a cent. Water drinkers praise the trend as a sign of marketing genius, or deride it as worthy of P. T. Barnum.
 
CITY SLICKERS
Garth Takes Manhattan
Simon and Garfunkel conquered Central Park, and so did Diana Ross, but let's face it, country music is far afield in Manhattan. But nationally country music has exploded, and Garth Brooks is the best-selling performer of the decade and one of the most successful singers in pop history, a blend of "classic rock" and country. His appearance in the park, before a live audience estimated at a quarter million people, drew a crowd of folks in cowboy hats, some carrying a cell phone to boot. HBO spent $5 million or more to advertise and produce the concert, which it broadcast simultaneously. It operated 22 cameras and 600 speakers over 25 acres of the park.

It Takes One to Start a War, but Four to Make Peace

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WAR, its tensions and repercussions, can endure long after the last shot is fired. Then there is Korea, where the war wages on.
North and South Korea, split by the cold war in 1945, remain in a state of perpetual hostility, with few hopeful signs of a thaw. The ailing and isolated totalitarian regime in the north shows an old, familiar truculence -- even as the country's headlong slide into famine forces it to accept aid from the outside and stokes fears in the south of economic disaster if North Korea collapses. Business ties between the two countries are nominal, the goodwill nonexistent. 
 In a modern conference room at Columbia University, encircled by a sweeping view of New York City, diplomats from the United States, China and North and South Korea met last week to try once again to ease the tensions by bringing the Korean War to an official end.
The war, which no one really won, was never really over. The armistice, signed in Panmunjom on July 27, 1953, was designed to silence the guns just long enough to arrange peace talks and a permanent and legal truce. Instead it lasted 44 years, however tenuously at times, leaving the Korean peninsula in a state of war-not war that has made it one of the most tense and most heavily defended regions in the world.
"This is a war that's never been won by either side," said Charles K. Armstrong, a professor of history at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, which played host for the talks. "It resulted in a stalemate, and that's what's carried on all these years."
The meetings in New York were meant to lay the foundation for "four-party talks" now that the United States, China and the two Koreas have agreed to replace the fragile armistice with something more lasting. After all these years, that goal may prove all but impossible.
After three days of meetings, the delegations abruptly broke off their talks Thursday evening. They were unable to agree even on an agenda for further talks, although they agreed to try again in September.
It was a reminder, if one was needed, that starting a war can be a lot easier than ending one.
The Koreas, of course, are not the only countries in such a state.
Cyprus is a torn and potentially explosive place, restrained only by the presence of United Nations peacekeepers 23 years after Turkey invaded, ostensibly to protect the island's Turkish minority from a Greek coup attempt.
Ecuador and Peru keep fighting -- for three bloody weeks in 1995 -- over a swath of mountain jungle because Ecuador in 1960 stopped recognizing a peace treaty the two countries signed in 1942. Israel, nearly half a century after its founding, remains officially at war with Syria, which has not yet made peace with the Jewish state, unlike Egypt (in 1979) and Jordan (in 1994).
The Koreas, though, are unique.
For most of the century, the peninsula has experienced only occupation and division. Japan was the first, occupying the country from 1910 through the end of World War II. Promised independence by the Allies, Korea was instead cleaved in two by the Soviet Union and the United States, creating separate societies, each isolated from and increasingly suspicious of the other.
 
'A Throwback'
 The Korean War, which is often called the Forgotten War, sandwiched as it was between the epic of World War II and the American quagmire in Vietnam, was the first real battleground of the cold war. It has now outlived it.
"Korea is a throwback," a senior Clinton Administration official said. "There is no other place in the world where this type of cold war remains."
The fighting in Korea ended more or less when the generals decided enough was enough. After North Korea's invasion in 1950, the American-led United Nations counteroffensive and China's intervention, the war had reached a stalemate, but the slaughter continued. Three years of fighting had killed 118,000 soldiers on the United Nations side, nearly half of them Americans; the South Koreans lost 70,000 soldiers, the North Korean and Chinese more than a million.
The Military Armistice Agreement was what it sounds like: a military solution, not a political one, signed by the commanders of the United Nations forces, China's "volunteers" and the "Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army," Kim Il Sung. Complications now arise from South Korea's not signing the armistice, which allows North Korea to claim that the south should not even be represented in peace talks. North Korea has long tried to negotiate directly with the United States over the peace terms, freezing out the south.
The armistice, with its preamble and five articles that went on for 63 paragraphs, quieted the guns, established a demilitarized zone more or less along the 38th parallel, separating the badly battered armies, and created a Military Armistice Commission to act as a sort of arbiter of the cease-fire.
The military commanders agreed to stop fighting "in the interest of stopping the Korean conflict, with its great toil of suffering and bloodshed on both sides," as the preamble put it, but left the "final peaceful settlement" to the civilians. The civilians met in Geneva in 1954, but the talks broke down almost immediately. And despite subsequent attempts over the years, they never resumed.
 
Regrets Only
 But if the armistice has held so long, is it really necessary to replace it?
Jeong Ho Roh, associate director of the Center for Korean Legal Studies at Columbia University's School of Law, said a formal end to the war is crucial. The lack of a peace treaty, he explained, frees both North and South Korea of accountability. Either side can violate the armistice more or less with impunity, as happens repeatedly in clashes along the demilitarized zone.
Last September an incident involving a North Korean submarine ended with 24 of sailors and commandos being killed South Korea. That incident, condemned as a provocation by the South and the United States, actually allowed the diplomatic breakthrough leading up to last week's meeting: North Korea delivered an unprecedented "expression of regret." Last week Pyongyang released the remains of American soldiers killed four decades ago.
A peace treaty, Mr. Roh said, would bind the two sides to certain international norms.
And that may explain why the effort to arrange peace talks among the United States, China and the Koreas -- first proposed by President Clinton and South Korea's President Kim Young Sam of South Korea in April 1996 -- have dragged on so long.
Officially ending the war would be, for North and South Korea, tantamount to recognizing the legitimacy -- in fact, the very existence -- of the other. Neither seems fully prepared for that, and so the status quo, for all its flaws, preserves the claims of each to represent the one, true Korea.
"Without a legal end to the war," Mr. Roh asked, "how can there be a start to a new relationship between the two Koreas?"

What Goes Up Must Usually, Well, Stop Going Up

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
WHEN the history is written of America's mid-1990's economic boom, a fat chapter will certainly be devoted to the mystifying strength of corporate profits -- how they were able to rise so fast for so long. But there must also be a chapter that describes what happened when this extraordinary performance became ordinary, or worse. And the material for this second chapter seems to be falling into place now.
Part of the foundation undergirding the boom is quietly being eaten away. Stagnant wages -- the workers' contribution to their bosses' profits -- are beginning to rise. And there is agitation for more improvement. Workers for the United Parcel Service began a nationwide strike last week that was partly a protest against the insecurities of the Age of Downsizing. As if on cue, stock prices fell sharply on Thursday and Friday, suggesting the vulnerability of another engine of prosperity to shifting circumstances. 
 That's not to say that the profits, the equally spectacular stock market and the thriving economy -- all of them interconnected -- won't be able to continue their upward climb. But even if they do, the good times seem likely to take on a different, more precarious character.
The keys to this story are corporate profits and wages. More than usual, the market and the economy have fed off the strength of profits at the expense of wages. For every $100 in new production -- the assembly of a car, the services of a doctor, the dry cleaning of a suit -- nearly $10 is going into profits. Not since 1968 has the percentage been so high. From then until the mid-1990's, it rarely rose above $8.50. And much of the rise has come out of wages and benefits, which, according to new Commerce Department numbers, have declined as a percentage of national output to their lowest level in more than a decade.
The record-breaking stock market is the offspring of the profits squeezed from this process. The rising stock prices, in turn, feed the economy by encouraging spending. But there is a problem. Not often in history has the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 8,031 Friday, gotten so high in relation to earnings, even unusual earnings. And that leaves a lot of experts casting about for ways to make what is happening sound rational and lasting. If profits can't keep rising at the expense of wages -- and many experts think that vein has played out -- then some more enduring engine will have to kick in soon.
"People are looking for an easy explanation of why profits are doing well," said David Wyss, director of research at DRI-McGraw Hill, a consulting firm.
And not surprisingly, one has been summoned. The heartening explanation, the one that would keep profits and stock prices rising if it turns out to be true, depicts the American economy as having entered, in the last year or two, a new, robust era.
The main characteristic of this new era is rising productivity. The new technologies, particularly computers and telecommunications, are finally making workers more productive, the story goes. Using the new tools, workers are producing more in each hour on the job. Already, they may be keeping some of this extra revenue from their production, while the rest goes into profits. And the stock market -- the great indicator of American prosperity -- will continue upward, reinforcing the process.
"Evidence of higher productivity abounds," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "You may not accept it, because it does not show up in the official Government statistics. We think most of the statistics are out of date."
There are problems, however, with the rosy productivity scenario, which has attracted varying degrees of endorsement from a range of business executives and economists. One is that it may not be happening, although it certainly sounds logical. Indeed, it fits neatly with the well documented rise in profits. Consider this example:
A carpenter is paid $25 an hour to make one birdhouse every hour, which is sold for $35. The profit from that hour of work is $10. If the price does not change and the carpenter's wage does not either, but the profit rises to $20 an hour, then it must be that, having finally mastered some cutting-edge technology, the carpenter is turning out two birdhouses an hour. Or so the rosy scenario goes, by deductive reasoning.
Maybe. But as Mr. Jasinowski acknowledges, the improvement has not shown up in Government statistics that measure the rate of productivity growth across the nation's private businesses. Quite the contrary, these statistics show productivity rising more slowly in the 1990's than they did in the 1980's.
The believers say the statistics don't tell the story.
"We have good theoretical reasons to believe that productivity is higher than what is measured in the aggregate numbers," said Bennett Harrison, an economist at the New School for Social Research in New York, joining Mr. Jasinowski in this view.
Their productivity thesis -- and the accuracy of the Government's statistics -- is likely to be tested soon. Tight labor markets give the hypothetical carpenter, like the real U.P.S. drivers, leverage to demand a higher wage. If his productivity has in fact not risen to two birdhouses an hour, then the higher wage he gets will squeeze profits. Either that or companies will raise prices to preserve profits, pushing up the until- now languid inflation rate.
And if that happens, stock prices seem destined to fall, puncturing the larger economic boom. For workers, the world shakes. The very act of earning more threatens to consign them to doing worse.
Whatever the outcome, let the test begin. Indeed, it has begun. The first tentative signs that wages may be trending upward are starting to appear in Labor Department data. What's more, company payments to provide health insurance for employees, which had been held down as a result of cost-cutting among hospitals and doctors, are beginning to rise again, adding gradually to labor compensation.
"All this upward pressure on labor costs means that profits can no longer grow as much as they have," Mr. Wyss said. "If productivity does not kick in, profits slow down."
Other factors have helped to postpone this showdown. In hindsight, they contribute to an understanding of how corporate profits could have grown so much over the last three years without a boost from productivity.
Interest rates on corporate debt have declined, and the savings have gone into profits. The debt itself has been paid down, further reducing corporate America's monthly installment payments, and this saving, too, has gone into profits rather than raises. Constant downsizing has cut costs, and again, the savings have fed into profits.
 
Faster and Faster
 The thriving economy has also helped. Many companies have stepped up production from existing machinery and personnel. Simply by eliminating the slack in their operations, they have been able to sell more without adding much to their cost. It is as if the carpenter actually turned out a birdhouse in 30 minutes and spent the other half-hour relaxing at the water cooler -- until a foreman got on his case. And the extra sales revenue from his harder work once again has gone mainly into profits rather than wages.
But all these lucky circumstances are wearing out. The final episodes in this particular history are just ahead. Either the new age of rising productivity shows itself, saving the day. Or that does not happen and, as profits fall back to more ordinary levels, stock prices fall back, too, and the economy weakens.
Or, alas, some inconclusive middle course unfolds. Mr. Jasinowski sees that possibility. Any number of companies, he says, still have room to fatten profits through cost-cutting, particularly downsizing. "The overwhelming reality of so many companies," he said, "is that you can't raise prices. So you eliminate waste, you downsize. Cost-cutting is still a big opportunity."

An Industry and Its Founders Grow Up

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
THE personal computer industry was created in the mid-1970's by a few hundred fiercely competitive, idealistic young men barely out of their teens. Their mission was to change the world by democratizing digital technology (and, yes, to get rich too). They pursued their goals with the energy and passion of youth. Disagreements had a way of escalating into shouting matches, and conflicts became holy wars.
Today, the computer industry has grown to become a $150-billion-a-year business and the people who built it have grown up as well. Most of them are now in their 40's, married with children. They have less hair and more pounds. Many are worth millions or, in a few cases, billions of dollars. 
 "It used to be that I was the youngest person in business meetings," Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., said recently, "But I'm an old man in this industry now, with a lot of experience and scar tissue."
Last week, the 42-year-old Mr. Jobs announced a surprising alliance between Apple and its long-time archrival, the Microsoft Corporation. It was a sure sign that those vigorous holy wars have been replaced by a kind of pragmatic maturity. Experience, scar tissue and a flair for imaginative deal-making prompted Mr. Jobs to save Apple by reaching out to a seemingly unlikely patron -- William H. Gates, Microsoft's 41-year-old chief executive. Microsoft is investing $150 million in Apple, and the two companies have agreed to cooperate on several sales and technology fronts.
For Microsoft, the $150 million is lunch money. But the deal was a striking symbol to the high-tech world that even Microsoft has a direct stake in Apple's future. The two companies have long competed and cooperated at the same time. Microsoft's Windows operating software -- a program that handles a computer's basic operations -- got its start by mimicking Apple's Macintosh software, and then went on to dominate the market. Yet Microsoft also makes word processing and other office programs that run on Macintosh computers, which are used by eight million customers and generate several hundred million dollars a year in business for Microsoft.
When Mr. Jobs announced the pact with Microsoft at the Macworld trade show in Boston last Wednesday, he was greeted with catcalls from some Macintosh loyalists. Mr. Jobs advised them to grow up. "We want to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose," he said. "We better treat Microsoft with a little gratitude."
Or at least with equanimity. Mr. Jobs, who was ousted from Apple in 1985 and returned last December as an adviser when Apple acquired his company Next Software Inc., clearly views Microsoft's dominance of mainstream personal computing as a fact of modern life. Railing against Microsoft, he suggests, is like complaining about the weather -- emotionally satisfying, perhaps, but pointless.
So finding a way to work with Microsoft, or make a living in its slipstream, is what strategy is in the PC industry today. "Every company, no matter how much they may dislike Microsoft, has to work with Microsoft as well," observed David Yoffie, a Harvard business school professor.
 
Gore and Doerr
 As they age, the computer industry's elite are learning to accept the necessity of working with Washington, too. For years, Silicon Valley's entrepreneurs would boast of their aversion to the Government. With their free-market libertarian bent, the architects of the high-tech economy used to view Washington as the last refuge of the industrial economy's losers, seeking protection and subsidies.
But today, Silicon Valley is losing its disdain for Washington. The spread of the Internet as a medium of communication and commerce raises the prospect of Government oversight, if not conventional regulation. And at the very least, the techies want to make sure the dunderheads in Washington don't mess things up.
So, last month a group of Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists formed a bipartisan political action committee, the Technology Network, to push their "new economy" agenda. The group is headed by John Doerr, senior partner of Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, a leading venture-capital firm, and James Barksdale, chief executive of the Netscape Communications Corporation. Mr. Doerr has become such a close adviser to Vice President Al Gore that a recent article in "Fast Company" magazine ran under the half-jesting headline: "Gore and Doerr in 2004?"
There was a time when Steve Jobs declined to even vote, a lingering effect, he said, of his reaction to the Watergate era. But now he has become politically engaged again. He played host to a dinner for Bill Clinton at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., last year. And he contributed enough to the Clinton campaign -- about $100,000 -- to have been invited to the sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Mr. Jobs says that having children made him realize how important some public policy issues are. Family life, too, has changed some of the tone and style of cyber business. In their talks about the Microsoft-Apple deal, Mr. Gates, who has a young daughter, said he and Mr. Jobs, who has three children, spoke not only of software and money but also of the miracle of watching firsthand as the brain of a young child gets wired.
At Pixar Inc., the computer animation studio behind the hit film "Toy Story," a company Mr. Jobs founded, the management style is not what it was like at Apple in the early 1980's. And family is a key reason. "If Steve calls you at home, you can tell him you'll call him back because you're reading a bedtime story to your kids," said Lawrence Levy, Pixar's chief financial officer. "Steve does it and he's totally tolerant of others doing it."
That's a far cry from the early 1980's, when Mr. Jobs headed the Apple team that developed the Mac, working around the clock, in a building with a pirate's flag flying outside.

HEADLINE: It's Wrong to Demonize China

BYLINE: By Jimmy Carter; Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, is chairman of the nonprofit Carter Center.

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
I spent the spring of 1949 in the seaports of China as a young naval officer on my first submarine cruise. Nearly 30 years later, Deng Xiaoping and I normalized diplomatic relations between our countries. We knew that even with this opening, decades of patience and persistence would be required before the bonds between our greatly different countries would be firm and predictable.
I consider sound Sino-American relations, along with the importance of maintaining human rights as a foundation of American foreign policy, to be legacies of my Administration. These two goals are not incompatible, but can be reached only if we try to understand each other. 
 Americans have benefited from the unprecedented stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region made possible by close ties among the United States, China and Japan. But the greatest beneficiaries have been the Chinese people, whose quality of life and human rights have improved enormously during the last two decades.
Both China and the United States continue to share many interests: maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, controlling weapons of mass destruction, preventing conflict on the Korean peninsula and fostering open trade. Unfortunately, many Americans and Chinese have lost sight of the original vision that brought us together. Ill-informed commentators in both countries have cast the other side as a villain and have even forecast inevitable confrontation between the two nations. The accomplishments of a quarter century are at risk.
Since my Presidency, I have been to China periodically to discuss world and domestic affairs and to visit rural areas. On my latest trip last month, I met with President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng, the chairman of the National People's Congress, Qiao Shi, and other leaders. They expressed concern that our leaders are encouraging Japanese rearmament and extending Japan's defense perimeter to include Taiwan. They also deeply resent American sales of F-16 jet fighters and other weaponry to Taiwan, saying that these deals seem to violate pledges made to them by Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and me.
We also discussed America's concerns, including the mounting trade deficit, human rights and particularly the treatment of the Tibetan people.
Mutual criticisms are proper and necessary, but should not be offered in an arrogant or self-righteous way, and each of us should acknowledge improvements made by the other.
Significant changes are taking place throughout China. There is no longer a single unquestioned government policy. Instead, China's top leaders have a wide range of opinions on such issues as the role of parliaments, expansion of the election process and privatization. Since normalization, an increasingly free economic system has transformed the lives of Chinese people. Farmers now retain profits on practically all crops planted on their land, and many villagers own their own businesses. Incomes and educational opportunities have also risen sharply.
Although congregations must still register with the Government, membership in Christian churches is booming. The pastor of the church we attended in Shandong Province knew of only 200 believers in his rural county after the Cultural Revolution, and they had no churches or Bibles. There are now 15 congregations in 11 churches, 3,000 members have been baptized, and Bibles are distributed freely.
A 1987 law mandates elections in nearly a million villages. Citizens can choose among multiple candidates, including those who are not members of the Communist Party, in a secret ballot, and many nonparty members have been chosen as village leaders. The Carter Center has observed some of these contests. Arbitrary power is still exerted by some political leaders, but progress is being made in promoting the rule of law. Some citizens are even bringing lawsuits against government agencies that violate their rights.
Citizens are more free to move from one place to another, and the nation has been opened to outside interests and influence. Until 1985, no outsiders were permitted to enter the rural county we visited; now village leaders are trying to expand their 45 joint ventures with foreigners.
President Jiang's long overdue state visit to Washington in October -- the first by a Chinese leader in 10 years -- will provide an opportunity to address human rights and other issues.
American criticisms of China's human rights abuses are justified, but their basis is not well understood. Westerners emphasize personal freedoms, while a stable government and a unified nation are paramount to the Chinese. This means that policies are shaped by fear of chaos from unrestrained dissidents or fear of China's fragmentation by an independent Taiwan or Tibet. The result is excessive punishment of outspoken dissidents and unwarranted domination of Tibetans.
But frank discussions on these and other issues can sometimes yield real progress. In private discussions in 1979, Deng Xiaoping agreed to address the issue of religious freedom, and great improvements were made. In 1987, after a visit I made to Tibet, and after subsequent conversations with the exiled Dalai Lama, discussions were arranged between his emissaries and Chinese Government officials. Unfortunately, the Tiananmen Square tragedy aborted the initiative.
In spite of our differences, China and the United States must continue to pursue ways to co-exist peacefully and productively. In addition to summit meetings, ordinary Americans and Chinese can help. For example, more than 100,000 Chinese students have attended American universities since 1979, providing an invaluable cultural and intellectual exchange for both countries.
Only through continued dialogue at many levels can we resolve differences and build a foundation for better understanding.

HEADLINE: Summary of Major Actions in the 220th Session of the Legislature

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 9

 BODY:
As the New York State Legislature sleepily stumbled to the close of its 220th session at 3:40 P.M. on Aug. 4, party leaders in both houses rose to give valedictories expressing their abiding affection for their staffs, their colleagues, even their opponents.
What they failed to mention were the nerve-jangling confrontations, the harsh invective and the simmering distrust that had been the session's real trademarks. This was not merely one of the Legislature's longest sessions ever -- 210 days, or seven months -- but also among its most contentious and least productive in recent years. 
 The year began with a bruising fight over a proposal to amend the State Constitution to allow casino gambling in places other than Indian reservations. The measure had the support of Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. But opposition from religious leaders, environmental groups and Donald Trump, the New Jersey casino owner, killed the measure in the Senate.
The defining battle was over laws that limit rent increases on more than one million apartments in and around New York City. The laws were scheduled to expire on June 15, and Mr. Bruno, supported by landlord groups, had vowed to let the laws lapse unless Democrats agreed to scale back many tenant protections. After months of intense public relations campaigns by both sides, Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders reached agreement shortly after midnight on June 16 to extend the laws, but with changes allowing landlords to charge significantly higher rents on vacant units.
The Assembly passed 1,498 of the roughly 8,000 bills introduced into that house. The State Senate passed 1,418 of 5,793 bills. A total of 749 bills passed both houses. Of those, the Governor has signed 255 and vetoed 30. The remaining 464 bills are awaiting Mr. Pataki's decision on whether to sign them into law.
The following were the major actions of the session.
 
The Budget
 This year's budget was the latest in history, enacted 126 days after the April 1 start of the fiscal year, and it contained none of the austerity that was seen in Mr. Pataki's first two years in office or in the spending plan he proposed in January.
Despite the tardiness, the budget was negotiated this year with considerably less rancor than in the previous two years; the fighting that delayed it was primarily over the state's rent regulations and the new welfare laws.
The process was made easier by an extraordinary influx of cash, largely generated by the stock market boom, that led to a significant increase in spending.
Overall spending, which includes Federal aid for programs like welfare and Medicaid, rose 4.2 percent, to $67.4 billion. The state-funds portion of the budget, financed by taxes, fees and tuition, rose 2.5 percent, to $45.1 billion. And spending from the state general fund, financed just by state taxes, rose 5.2 percent, to $34.6 billion, after declining slightly for two consecutive years.
Most of the general fund increase was in aid to local school districts, which rose 7.3 percent, to $11 billion, the largest percentage increase since the 1980's.
The Governor and the Legislature also locked the state into a series of school aid increases for prekindergarten education, smaller elementary class sizes, and other measures, that will, by 2001, cost an additional $1.5 billion a year.
They also placed a $2.4 billion bond measure on the November ballot to build new schools and rehabilitate old ones.
Lawmakers enacted a broad range of tax cuts, which will be worth $4.8 billion a year when fully implemented in 2001, but most of them will not take effect in this fiscal year.
For the third straight year, the Legislature largely rejected Mr. Pataki's attempts to make deep cuts in Medicaid spending, the single biggest portion of the budget; indeed, when it became clear how much income tax revenue was pouring into the state's coffers, the Governor, himself, abandoned the proposed cuts.
The Legislature also turned back the Governor's proposals for a $400-a-year increase in public college tuition and deep cuts in tuition aid to poor students.
On welfare, the parameters were largely set by the Federal Government, which last year mandated a five-year lifetime limit on aid to families with children and required that the states place half of all recipients of Federal aid into work programs or work-related activities, like job training.
The Legislature rejected Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts in Federal benefits. The Governor wanted to eliminate the state's cash assistance program for people who do not qualify for Federal aid, and replace it with a system of vouchers for basic needs. Instead, the changes enacted limited cash assistance to two years, followed by a combination of vouchers and cash.
 
Taxes
 
LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Lowers residential property taxes to support school systems by about 30 percent -- an average of about $500 a year for each homeowner, a total of $2.2 billion -- by 2001.
Lowers the New York City income tax by 10 percent, or $62 a year for a person earning $36,000, by 2001.
Extends for two years a 12.5 percent surcharge on the New York City income tax that has been used to pay for policing, which costs $78 a year for a person earning $36,000.
Eliminates the gross receipts tax on hospitals, nursing homes and home care providers, saving $530 million a year by 2001.
Lowers the gross receipts tax on utility bills by 30 percent, or $440 million a year, by 2001.
Reduces estate taxes by a total of $440 million a year by 2001.
Eliminates the 4 percent state sales tax on clothing, except shoes, up to $100 per article in 1999, for a total of $430 million a year.
Increases the child care tax credit in 1999, primarily for low- and middle-income families, raising the maximum credit to $536 a year from $211 a year for a two-income family earning $25,000 a year.
Allows a family to exempt from personal income taxes money invested in a state-run fund for a child's college education. A family can invest up to $5,000 a year, up to a maximum of $100,000, in an investment account managed by the State Comptroller.
Eliminates a 1-cent tax on drink bottles and cans.
Eliminates the sales tax on coin-operated devices like vending machines, car washes and copying machines.

HEADLINE: In U.S. Deportation Policy, a Pandora's Box

SERIES: DEADLY EXPORTS -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: QUEZALTEPEQUE, El Salvador

 BODY:
On a stifling afternoon, Luis Arnoldo Lopez, late of Los Angeles, gathers with members of the Mara Salvatrucha gang to smoke marijuana, sniff glue and inscribe gang tattoos on one another's skin. Suddenly, their conversation shifts to the rival 18th Street gang.
"They killed Cuchillo, so we have to kill them," a teen-ager nicknamed "Snoopy" complains to Mr. Lopez. "They have been robbing and killing us, so we have to protect ourselves." 
 Wearing gray pants that say "L.A. County Jail," Mr. Lopez, 18, nods in agreement and begins to goad his comrades.
"We've got to defend each other and our barrio," he tells them. "Every time they kill one of our homeboys, one of theirs should also die."
If Mr. Lopez speaks in a peculiar mixture of American and Salvadoran street slang, it is no accident. For he is one of a growing number of immigrants whom the United States has shipped back to their countries of origin under an effort mandated by Congress a decade ago and strengthened with new financing in the last four years. It requires the deportation, at the end of their prison sentences, of those immigrants, legal or illegal, who have been convicted of a broad range of felonies, from murder to drug possession.
The policy is having a profound effect here in El Salvador. Since January, just in this dusty town of 13,000 people at least 7 people have died in gang violence, the police say. The victims included a 3-year-old girl killed when she and her family came out of church and walked into the middle of a grenade fight between two gangs, each with roots in the United States.
In the last fiscal year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service reports having deported about 37,000 criminals, up from about 27,000 three years before. And in the first half of this fiscal year, it has stepped up the pace further, deporting more than 23,000, for an annual rate of more than 45,000.
The program was intended to lower the American crime rate, free up prison space and save American taxpayers money by getting rid of people who were not citizens and were considered likely to commit new crimes after having served their sentences. The policy may have had a small effect in those directions, officials in the United States say, but it is also having a set of far more noticeable unintended side effects, including these:
*American gang habits -- and branches of the gangs themselves -- are being exported to El Salvador and other countries in and around the Caribbean. In these smaller cultures, weak police forces already have their hands full struggling to control individual crime or politically motivated violence. Now the police face slick, organized, well-armed gangs that operate with all the truculence of their parent groups in Los Angeles and other American cities. Political leaders fear the effect on their lands' stability, and they are complaining to the Clinton Administration about it.
*In the United States, law enforcement officials are contending with a "boomerang" effect -- the rapid return to America of criminals who were recently deported. Deportation has given them opportunities to forge new connections to drug and other crime rings in their own lands. In turn, this only compounds their ability to commit new crimes in the United States.
*Inflexibilities built into the law have trapped and marked for deportation a small but significant number of people who under other circumstances would be considered good candidates to become law-abiding and productive.
Perhaps the most dramatic of these side effects was in plain view in the safe house where Mr. Lopez and the Mara Salvatrucha gang were talking so matter-of-factly about murder. Five years after a peace accord ended El Salvador's long and brutal civil war, gang warfare transplanted from the United States has emerged as a new threat to security.
Throughout the country, thousands of young men, recruited and led by deportees who learned their trade on the streets of American cities, have been joining the gangs, which officials blame for much of a marked postwar increase in violence and criminality. Subcommissioner Carlos Ramirez Landaverde, deputy director of the department of criminal investigation, said there have been dozens of gang-related deaths in the last year.
The gangs bring with them a deadly rivalry that dates back to their founding in Los Angeles. And when not trying to kill each other, their members rob travelers, rape women, steal cars, deal in drugs and extort businesses.
Since 1993, more than 4,000 Salvadorans, mostly teen-agers and young adults, with United States criminal records have been forcibly repatriated to a homeland that many of them barely remembered, since most were children when they fled this country as refugees during the civil war.
"As the deportations have increased, so has crime, and the deportees are responsible for a disproportional amount of that," Mr. Ramirez Landaverde said. "Many of the most violent offenses, like murder, kidnapping and robbery, are committed by people who have been in the United States and are sent back here without any prior notice, with all the bad habits they developed there."
 
The Villages
Armed Gangs, Outgunned Police
That crime wave extends even to the most remote peasant villages, which are now blighted with graffiti, much of it in English. Local branches of two Los Angeles gangs -- Mara Salvatrucha and 18th Street -- and their allies in the similarly transplanted Crazy, Mau-Mau and White Fence gangs, use the scrawled messages to threaten vengeance on each other and express their contempt for a police force that is undermanned, underarmed and undertrained. "We control the nation," the Mara Salvatrucha brags in graffiti here, an hour's drive from the capital.
"The cops up there are real tough, but the ones here are a joke," said Mr. Lopez, who says he joined the White Fence gang, an ally of Mara Salvatrucha, when he lived in California. He was deported to Quezaltepeque in November after being convicted of armed robbery and drug trafficking charges. "Up there, if you do a drive-by, at least there is an investigation. Here, there is nothing."
For their part, the police bitterly acknowledge that the deportees and their gangs often have them outmaneuvered and outgunned. "Our weapons are lousy, and they're running around with M-16 rifles and guns they have smuggled in from outside the country," said Antonio Cruz Preza Sanchez, a police inspector who is leading the investigation into the April slaying of a police officer in the town of Conchagua, in which a deportee is accused.
El Salvador's traditional police force, accused of widespread human rights violations, was disbanded as part of the 1992 peace agreement that ended the 12-year civil war. Thousands of soldiers and guerrillas were demobilized, and many of their weapons were destroyed. A new Civilian National Police was established, but it is still not operating at full strength and has been plagued by recruitment, budget and other problems. In part to instill confidence among civilians, its members have not been given the same kind of routine access to heavy armaments that the national police forces had during the civil war. Today the police on patrol carry pistols and nightsticks, not assault rifles.
One result of the inability of the police to contain the new gang activity is a re-emergence of death-squad activity in El Salvador -- not against political enemies, but against suspected gang members. During the civil war, right-wing death squads linked to the military were responsible for the deaths of many of the 75,000 people estimated to have died. Now new squads with names like The Black Shadow and The Lightning Command have sprung up. But this time, ordinary citizens weary of crime have largely applauded their efforts.
In April, three men said to be members of The Black Shadow went on trial in the eastern city of San Miguel, charged with "illicit association" and the 1994 slaying of three Mara Salvatrucha members. Part of a larger group of 12 civilians and four police officers who had initially been arrested in connection with the killings, they were praised by the Mayor, who said that crime was "devouring" his city. A jury quickly absolved them.
"This is a very serious problem," said President Armando Calderon Sol, who was one of several Central American and Caribbean leaders who raised the issue of deportees when President Clinton visited the region in May.
"The United States lets these dangerous types out and tells them 'Go back to where you came from.' But we have no way to try them or jail them" for crimes committed on foreign soil, he said, "and so we must not only let them in, but let them go free."
The situation may be especially serious here, but El Salvador is by no means alone in its alarm at Washington's policy on deportees. Throughout Central America and the Caribbean, from Guatemala east to Guyana, government officials have expressed anger and frustration at a crisis they regard as foisted on them by United States and beyond their ability to control.
 
The Nations
Lands Inundated By Tough Outlaws
 The overwhelming bulk of "criminal removals" by the I.N.S. have been to Mexico, Central America and Caribbean countries. In Jamaica, for example, more than 3,000 such deportees have arrived since the agency began increasing its effort four years ago, said Keith D. Knight, that country's Minister of National Security.
In general, "these are persons who have severed all ties to Jamaica and are sent back to us destitute, with convictions for the most violent offenses, like murder and assault and trafficking in drugs and firearms," Mr. Knight said in an interview in Kingston earlier this year. "They simply become part of the criminal fraternity, and the intelligence we have suggests deep involvement in serious and sophisticated crime activities here."
The English-speaking island nations of the eastern Caribbean, with their small populations and limited resources, have similar complaints. They are under increasing pressure from the United States to help Washington fight the boom in drug trafficking noticeable throughout the region, but they are being inundated with deportees they say are likely to gravitate to exactly such ventures.
"If they are sending the worst criminals back to us, that is a bit cold, calculating and uncaring, and certainly not the action of a fair and concerned friend," Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister and Minister of National Security of Grenada, said in an interview in April. "If a man was born in Grenada but has spent 30 years in the U.S., he is not going to know one person here, and with no means of supporting himself, the chances are he will commit a crime."
Even after they are returned to the countries of their births, officials throughout the region note, deportees maintain ties to the gangs to which they belonged in the United States and continue to cooperate with them in criminal activities. Here, for instance, gang members are reported by the police to receive and resell cars stolen by former comrades in California and Texas and to be involved in illegally transporting would-be immigrants to the United States.
In addition, gang members here are said to buy and smuggle weapons left over from the civil war, including rifles, pistols, grenades, ammunition and rocket launchers, to and from the United States and neighboring countries. Salvadoran police officials also say that gang leaders here and in the United States have formed alliances with cocaine and marijuana traffickers from Mexico and Colombia to move drugs through El Salvador and neighboring countries.
The flourishing gang network here also provides an underground railroad of sorts for gang leaders still living in the United States when they need to evade charges there. El Salvador does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, so gang members facing arrest in an American city can simply vanish into the protective structure that their branches here offer.
"That's what I'm doing right now, chillin' with my homeys," a leader of the Mara Crazy in the eastern city of San Miguel, who identified himself only by his street name, "Dreamer," said this spring, speaking in bilingual gang argot. "I've got some problems in the States, so I came down here to hang for a while."
 
The Friction
Calls for Warnings And Rap Sheets
That reverse side of the flow of deportees, wanted outlaws taking refuge in their home countries, has become a source of tension between the United States and its neighbors in Central America and the Caribbean. Washington says that these countries do not make enough of an effort to arrest such criminals and that they have antiquated extradition laws, and is pressing for constitutional changes.
But the receiving countries have complaints of their own, noting that the United States has sent most of the deportees to them without any advance notification or warning.
In an interview at the National Palace in San Salvador, Mr. Calderon Sol said his Government needed greater cooperation. "They send us deportees without any prior warning, and that complicates things," he said.
The Salvadoran Government has proposed legislation that would require deportees with foreign criminal records to register with Salvadoran immigration authorities immediately upon their return to the country. Once they find a place to live, they would also be required to report regularly to the local police.
"We can't deny any citizen the right to return," Mr. Calderon Sol said. "We have to take them back, and we can't ask the United States to take charge of them. But we need measures that require these dangerous types to report every week or fortnight."
As things have stood until now, Salvadoran law enforcement officials say, often they have learned of a deportee's return only after a crime has been committed and a suspect apprehended. Except in a few extraordinary cases, they say, there has been no prior notification from American immigration or police authorities that a criminal deportee is on the way, which only makes their job more difficult.
"It would help us a lot to know in advance, especially in cases of the type where they are involved in a crime just as soon as they arrive," Mr. Ramirez Landaverde said. "It is important for us to be able to have an album of photos that we can show to people, to have fingerprints and a rap sheet of the crimes these people have committed in the United States, to know what tattoos or other identifying features they may have."
Just before Easter, for example, Jesus Enrique Flores was deported to his home town, Conchagua, after living in the United States for 11 years, jail terms for gang-related drug and assault convictions included. Less than two weeks later, the police in his hometown said, he shot and killed one police officer and gravely wounded another outside a local bordello.
In an interview at the ramshackle jail where he was being held, Mr. Flores, stocky, shirtless and with a large "18" tattooed on his chest, maintained that local the police had singled him out merely because he was a deportee. "I am innocent," he said. "They have accused the wrong person."
Mr. Flores, a 26-year-old who said he had worked as a gardener and construction worker in Washington and Los Angeles before being jailed, acknowledged being a member of the 18th Street Gang. After serving his most recent term in a California prison, he said, he was handed over to the I.N.S. early this year and held while his deportation order was being processed.
Then, Mr. Flores said, "they just put me on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles." Asked if he had been shackled or held under guard, he said that he had not, but had traveled as an ordinary passenger.
On his arrival at the international airport outside San Salvador, he said: "I gave the immigration and customs people my passport, it was stamped like anybody else's, and I came home here. I'd never had any problems with the law here, so there was no reason for them to hold me, and my name wasn't on any blacklist that the Government had of people who were to be detained."
A spokesman for the immigration service in Washington, Russ Bergeron, acknowledged that the agency has not systematically advised foreign immigration or law enforcement officials when their citizens are deported.
"We recognize that these countries want more information, and we are working with foreign governments to provide them with new mechanisms" for prior notification, he said.
On Aug. 1, the agency began using new notification guidelines intended to address some of the complaints of countries being sent deportees. Under the new procedures, foreign governments are to be supplied the name, date of birth, birthplace, criminal record and expected date of arrival of deportees, though not their photographs or fingerprints, Mr. Bergeron said.
The Salvadoran police said the background of Mr. Flores, the man accused of shooting two police officers in Conchagua,matched that of the typical deportee: male, in his late teens to mid 20's and from a poor and broken family. The gang problem is nationwide, they add, but most acute in those areas of the country where heavy fighting, human rights abuses and forced flight were most prevalent during the civil war.
"In 1981, the death squads came to our house, yanked my uncle out of bed and shot him and tried to kill my mother, my sister and me, so my mother went to Houston and left me with my grandparents and cousins," said Edwin Castillo, a 25-year-old member of the Mara Salvatrucha who was deported to Quezaltepeque late last year. "She brought me up north later, and the seed of my liking for the gangster life was planted there, and just kept on growing."
But once back home, Mr. Castillo and other deportees said, it is easy to recruit local teen-agers into the gang life. Unemployment is high, school is expensive, amusements are minimal, and, thanks in large part to the gangs, drugs are increasingly available.
"If you keep sending these guys back, we're going to have another civil war on our hands," Mr. Preza Sanchez, the police investigator, warned. "People will arm themselves again, and this new police force will be nullified. We are very worried."
Next: Surprisingly hard to track down, many criminal aliens return to the United States with ease after being deported.

HEADLINE: Mud From Clogged Harbor May Be a Resource in the Rough

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
In an experiment to try to solve several serious environmental and economic problems, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have agreed to use mud dredged from clogged channels in New York Harbor to seal some of the abandoned coal mines that scar the Pennsylvania countryside and leach acid runoff into thousands of rivers and streams.
If successful, the procedure could clear the harbor's channels by providing a near boundless repository for dredged mud, while helping Pennsylvania fix a centuries-old environmental problem for less than the current estimated cleanup cost of $15 billion. 
 Some mud could begin moving to Pennsylvania from the harbor before Sept. 1, if suitable dredging projects are settled on, and if New York, New Jersey and Federal harbor officials agree on how it should be paid for. Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection issued a permit in June allowing a test of as many as 500,000 tons of harbor mud.
Shoals of river-borne mud are threatening maritime commerce in New York Harbor, the East Coast's biggest seaport. For decades, the mud, most of which contains traces of dioxins, heavy metals and other pollutants, was dumped at sea, but new Federal rules protecting marine life now prohibit that practice.
Efforts by New Jersey and New York to find places to dump or use the mud on land have been hampered by public fears of harmful effects, even though Federal and state environmental officials agree that the material poses no significant risk to people or the ecology on land.
Now, though, environmental officials in Pennsylvania see use of the same, often maligned, mud, after it is mixed with ash and other materials to form cement, as a way to erase two centuries of scars from surface coal mining. New Jersey and New York would pick up the cost of shipping the mud, which is likely to cost less than almost any other option.
Pennsylvania's director of mine reclamation, Ernest Giovannitti, toured New York Harbor last week to see dredging operations and discuss ways to move the mud. "It's potentially a win-win for everybody," he said. "The harbor benefits, and we get some reclamation accomplished for nothing that we probably wouldn't get to do otherwise."
Pennsylvania residents have given the planned test sharply mixed reviews, with some private environmental groups attacking it for adding to the flow of waste into the state -- which already leads the nation in taking other states' garbage and hazardous waste.
Jeffrey K. Schmidt, a lobbyist in Harrisburg for the Pennsylvania chapter of the Sierra Club, said the project appeared to be hastily approved and poorly defined. He added that the Sierra Club was concerned that some of the ash for the project would come from incinerators in New Jersey.
But Susan Wilson, the executive director of a citizens' advisory committee for the state's environmental agency, said that state environmental officials had addressed many concerns of committee members -- for example, allowing the nearest town to the planned test, Penfield, to have its own inspector monitor the project.
Other groups that are focused on the need for mine reclamation have welcomed the test, as long as it is carefully run.
The project is still in the planning stages and can go forward only if it is chosen over a host of competing proposals for using the dredged mud in construction projects around the harbor or for sealing landfills or toxic waste sites. But environmental officials from all three states said that no single option offered a solution to the dredging problem on a scale remotely like that of the coal-mine cleanup.
Pennsylvania is pocked with more than 9,000 abandoned surface mines, including more than 5,000 barren pits and miles-long trenches that leach more than 100 million gallons a day of highly acidic water, damaging 2,400 miles of streams and rivers and ruining ground-water supplies.
Much of the mining in Pennsylvania in the past took place where foot-thick beds of coal were within 60 or 80 feet of the surface, allowing mine operators to scrape the earth away to reach the coal without digging tunnels.
In some places where coal seams emerged along the sides of hills, the overlying dirt was excavated all along the seam in a strip, leaving some 80-foot-high scars that ran for miles.
The acid problem is created when water percolates through iron pyrite, or fool's gold, a mineral that lies exposed in shattered rock left behind after coal has been extracted.
The budget for the test project is confidential, because the plan to take harbor mud to Pennsylvania must compete in a Federal bidding process with plans to dispose of it elsewhere, said Andrew T. Voros, who helped negotiate aspects of the pilot project. Mr. Voros is the executive director of the Clean Ocean and Shore Trust, a commission created three years ago by the New York and New Jersey State Legislatures to find solutions to shared pollution problems.
The mud-into-mines disposal option is expected to be economical, because many of the mine sites have rail lines leading to them.
The cost of the pilot project would probably be borne primarily by New Jersey and New York, which have substantial amounts budgeted for the dredging problem, Mr. Voros said.
The mud would be blended with other materials to stiffen it sufficiently to transport it in containers.
It would then be carried by train to Bark Camp, a former mining site in west-central Pennsylvania that has been turned into a laboratory for mine cleanup techniques.
There, lime would be added to solidify the cement, in a simple process similar to one the Romans used to build the Colosseum, officials said.
The cement's alkaline properties could buffer the acidity in the mines and help break down some of the industrial contaminants in the mud, said Barry E. Scheetz, a professor of cement chemistry at Pennsylvania State University who has helped design the pilot project.
Like the Colosseum, the plugs in the mines would probably "be stable for thousands of years," Dr. Scheetz said. He said the project would proceed in steps, first testing the mud-ash mix on the surface before trying to seal seeps of tainted mine runoff.
Darlene Crawford, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, said the test would be carefully monitored to be sure that any contaminants in the mud remain locked in the cement.
She said Pennsylvanians wanted to make sure that no new pollution problems would be created in a state that has suffered so much already. "First they've seen their land raped by the coal barons, and now they don't want to see it as a dumping ground for New York's sludge," she said.
But more and more, officials from the participating states said, people are recognizing that the dredged material can be useful. Once the mud is mixed with ash, the resulting substance meets environmental standards for construction fill or landfill cover.
"This isn't municipal waste," John Cahill, New York State's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, said. "It's a resource."
More than one million tons of a similar mixture of harbor mud and other materials have already been used to create a parking lot for a new mall in Elizabeth, N.J. But the Pennsylvania mines could provide a repository for perhaps hundreds of millions of tons of dredged mud, more than enough to absorb the mud from dredging for decades, Mr. Voros said.
The project grew out of discussions among the three states during the last two years, Mr. Voros said. From these talks grew the realization that New York Harbor's problem might be Pennsylvania's solution.
"It's as if your basement is flooded and your neighbor's house is on fire," Mr. Voros said. "There's an answer there."

Chart: "HOW IT WORKS: From New York Harbor to Pennsylvania's Mines"
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania plan to use sediment dredged from New York Harbor to seal abandoned coal mines in Pennsylvania, which could resolve difficult environmental problems in all three states.
 
1. Sediment
Millions of tons of sediment from rivers and streams feeds into New York Harbor each year. Much of it is contaminated by dioxins and other pollutants.
 
2. Dredging
To keep the harbor open to big ships, the sediment is continually dredged. New laws prohibit disposing the mud at sea.
 
3. Adding ash
Under the plan, the sediment would be mixed with ash waste produced by coal burning plants to stiffen it sufficiently to transport it. It would then be sent to Pennsylvania.
 
4. Adding lime
In Pennsylvania, the ash and mud would be mixed with more ash and lime to make cement. The cement's alkaline properties make it an excellent buffer for pollantants.
 
5. Strip mines
The cement would be used to fill in old coal strip mines in Pennsylvania. The mines are an environmental risk, having leached acid runoff into rivers and streams. (Source: Clean Ocean and Shore Trust)(pg. 32)

HEADLINE: Wanted Now in New York: 3,000 (or 9,000) Teachers

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Forgive Caryl Cohen if she reached for an antacid last week, as talk swirled that bills just passed in Albany may force New York City to hire as many as 6,000 new teachers over the coming year.
Ms. Cohen, who oversees recruitment for the Board of Education, had a more pressing problem: filling the 3,000 teaching positions already open, before the new school year begins three weeks from Wednesday. 
 Despite an intensive recruiting campaign that has met with moderate success -- college seniors were buttonholed in teacher-training programs as far north as Plattsburgh, state-certified teachers across New York were flooded with enticement letters, and subways were plastered with recruitment posters -- the city's public schools will open with hundreds of teachers who have not met state standards and who have never stood in front of a classroom.
In New York City's suburbs, where teacher salaries are generally higher and the classes are smaller than in the five boroughs, there is a glut of qualified applicants for precious few teaching jobs this summer: in Mamaroneck, N.Y., alone, there were nearly 1,000 resumes submitted for seven elementary-school positions.
But in New York City, the schools have gone begging for qualified teachers -- particularly in math, science and bilingual education. And that has left Ms. Cohen wondering where to look to fill the 6,000 jobs that the board estimates would be created by two measures passed by the Legislature in its final days: one to reduce class sizes (an estimated 3,600 jobs over the next 12 months) and another, still awaiting Gov. George E. Pataki's signature, to allow teachers to retire at 55 rather than 62 (an estimated 2,000 jobs, some of which would open immediately).
"I feel we've just about exhausted every available resource, through a multitude of strategies," Ms. Cohen said, her eyes bleary. "If this happens, I don't know where we'll find certified people."
The estimated 3,000 teaching vacancies that must be filled by the start of the new school year are largely the result of retirements, maternity and other leaves, and a projected growth in enrollment of about 18,000 students systemwide -- an increase that, by itself, calls for 600 more teachers.
Many of the vacancies represent the loss of some of the system's most seasoned professionals. But others offer schools a welcome opportunity for a new beginning. About 500 vacancies were created by the dismissal of teachers who had taken more than four years to attain state certification -- passing a state teaching examination and completing concentration of courses in a particular subject area and in the practice of teaching.
Some of the lag in filling the jobs is out of the board's hands. Few college graduates with math and science degrees are choosing to teach, preferring industry or business. And many of the vacancies in bilingual positions reflect the city's burgeoning immigrant enrollment -- and an inability to find teachers who can, for example, speak Haitian-Creole and instruct special-education students.
But part of the problem remains a convoluted bureaucratic system in which teachers are recruited and screened centrally, then interviewed at the local districts (which administer the city's elementary and junior high schools) before being hired, often just days before school begins.
"Teachers would be more willing to come here," said Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, "if they knew what classroom they would be in and could look at the place."
While shortages persist in hard-to-staff specialties and districts, the board can boast some progress this year in recruiting certified teachers -- a perennial challenge in a system where roughly 7,500 of 65,000 teachers lack certification.
Last spring, for the first time, the board held two job fairs at a Manhattan high school, bringing together superintendents from all of the city's community school districts, and many of their principals. The timing was critical: while suburban districts do much of their hiring in the spring, the board had always waited until August, when the burdensome task of surveying the needs of all of its 1,100 schools was nearly complete.
This year, the board felt confident it could better anticipate some of its needs earlier, and sent invitations to the hiring fairs to thousands of teachers who, according to state records, were either about to graduate from teacher-training programs or had not yet found employment. All had been certified by the state.
All told, 2,000 certified teachers attended the sessions, 900 were offered jobs and school officials expect as many as 600 to accept positions, although they have until the day before school begins to decide.
Barbara Baltz of Rye Brook, N.Y., attended a fair and came away impressed. A former human resources administrator at several area companies, she recently received her master's degree in elementary and special education at Manhattanville College, in Purchase, N.Y. Ms. Baltz left the job fair with an offer to teach third-grade special education at a Bronx elementary school, and, she said, she expects to take the job.
"I need to feel comfortable where I am working," said Ms. Baltz, 46. "I really liked the people I met from the school. The special-ed department seems really well organized."
The board also intensified its talent searches this year at colleges and universities in the metropolitan region and upstate, with Ms. Cohen, the director of recruiting, making dozens of personal appearances and netting about 100 applicants.
With a personality that is equal parts cheerleader and used-car saleswoman, Ms. Cohen told seniors graduating from education programs, all of whom had secured certification, that they should not fear for their safety if they choose to teach in New York City (after all, the crime rate is way down), that millions of dollars had been committed to fixing up the classrooms and that the city offered ample opportunities for class field trips to some of the world's greatest museums.
Vincent Ambrosio, 22, who graduated in the spring with an education degree from Ms. Cohen's alma mater, the State University College at Cortland, said her pitch was enough to persuade him to apply for a job teaching high-school English, and he is awaiting word on his placement.
"She said they needed people who care, who want to teach," he recalled. "The straightforward attitude about the whole situation impressed me."
In recent weeks, hundreds of candidates have also responded to advertisements in city newspapers imploring them to "Shape the Future. . . . Teach New York!" and alerting them to September vacancies in subjects like general science, earth science, Spanish, biology and reading.
Many of those who have responded and come down to the board's hiring headquarters, at 65 Court Street in downtown Brooklyn, are certified teachers, but have turned to New York City only as a last resort, when jobs in suburban schools did not materialize.
Ms. Cohen said she was happy to have them anyway.
"You can't blame someone who lives in Suffolk and wants to work in Suffolk," Ms. Cohen said. "If they are qualified, I will take them."
After five years of hanging on in the Mineola, N.Y., public schools, hoping in vain that her part-time job as a reading teacher would become permanent, Jennifer Phillips made the two-hour trip last week to 65 Court Street and applied for a job.
An hour later, Ms. Phillips, who is certified, walked out the door with a referral for placement in an elementary school in Community School District 19 in East New York -- a district she had requested because a friend teaches there and had described "changes going on for the better, like renovations."
Having avoided applying for a New York City job because of "the travel, the commute and the classroom overcrowding," Ms. Phillips said she had ultimately been persuaded by economic reality: "I just got married, bought a house and I need the benefits."
Ms. Cohen says she will have to hire hundreds of candidates who have college degrees, but little or no experience teaching, but at least she has enough candidates so that no classroom will go unsupervised.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. and Union Break Off Negotiations

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Negotiators for the teamsters' union and the United Parcel Service broke off talks yesterday just two hours after returning to the bargaining table, with both sides signaling that they might be digging in for a long strike.
U.P.S. and the union said the talks had broken off indefinitely, dissipating hopes of a quick end to the six-day-old walkout by 185,000 drivers, loaders and sorters. 
 After emerging from the talks at a Federal mediator's office in Washington, James P. Kelly, the chairman of U.P.S., said: "The position of the teamsters continues to be unrealistic. That position does not allow us to compete. We're heading back to Atlanta to make the difficult decisions that we have to make going forward."
The two sides held their brief negotiating session yesterday after they met for a total of 19 hours on Thursday and Friday without reporting significant progress.
Ronald Carey, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said: "At this point it appears it's just senseless to continue any discussions. It's time for us to start digging in."
The two sides do not even agree on what is the main stumbling block to reaching a new contract. U.P.S. officials say it is a dispute over pensions, with the company pushing to set up a new pension plan and pull out of the teamsters' multi-employer plan. But the union insists that the main obstacle is the company's refusal to turn more part-time jobs into full-time ones. The union complains that part-timers do not earn enough to support a family.
"This issue is vital not just for teamsters and their families, but for every American family," Mr. Carey said. "Part-time America won't work."
Officials close to the talks said the negotiators spent 21 hours at the bargaining table over the last three days explaining and defending their positions and feeling each other out for how the two sides might barter items -- the company might abandon one of its demands if the union did likewise. These officials said the negotiators had made some progress on minor points but remained far from an overall package.
"This is the biggest strike in our nation in a quarter century," said John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. "There are issues of enormous complexity."
Assessing the likelihood of a settlement, he said, "It ain't going to happen overnight."
With the talks broken off, the union vowed to rally the public behind it, saying that millions of Americans identify with its concerns that U.P.S., the world's largest shipping company, should not create so many part-time jobs. Over the past four years, U.P.S. has added 46,000 unionized workers: 38,000 part-timers and 8,000 full-timers. Part-time workers average $9 to $10 an hour after two years, while full-timers average $19.95.
At baseball stadiums this weekend, union members are distributing thousands of score cards that say the teamsters are fighting for full-time jobs. The union also plans a big rally on Wednesday in Liberty State Park in Jersey City, and another large rally outside U.P.S. headquarters in Atlanta on Thursday.
Before the talks resumed yesterday, Mr. Carey said: "If the company is prepared to move, I'll be here until tomorrow morning. If they're not, we've got work to do. We've got to get out there and get together with the members."
U.P.S. said it was sticking with what it called its "last, best and final offer," one that called for a 1.5 percent raise a year for full-time workers and a $3,060 bonus this year. Under the company's proposal, a part-time worker who started at $8 an hour would earn $10.50 after five years and get a $1,530 bonus.
"We continue to believe we made a very good offer," said Gina Ellrich, a U.P.S. spokeswoman.
The union faults the company's proposal because it would not raise the part-timers' starting wage, which has not risen since 1982.
After the talks broke up yesterday, Mr. Kelly seemed to leave open the door to hiring temporary or replacement workers, a practice that would certainly step up pressure on the union.
"We're willing to do whatever it takes to keep our business strong and provide security for our people," he said.
U.P.S. officials acknowledge that the strike has paralyzed their operations, reducing their daily volume to less than 10 percent of the 12 million packages the company handles on an average day. The company is urging President Clinton to seek an injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act to halt the strike on the ground that it is causing severe economic damage.
But Mr. Clinton said at a news conference on Wednesday that the Taft-Hartley Act sets a high standard for Presidential intervention and that the strike was not yet imperiling the nation's safety or health.
In recent days, teamster leaders have sent urgent letters to hundreds of union halls telling them to be prepared for a long strike. Teamster officials say the company might think that the strikers cannot weather a long walkout because the union's strike fund is nearly depleted, but union officials insist that members can withstand a protracted walkout.
The two sides also have differences over pay, subcontracting and the company's demand to delete a provision from the old contract that allowed U.P.S. drivers to honor other unions' picket lines.
Indicating a hardening of positions, Rand Wilson, a teamsters' spokesman, said, "It's clear that full-time jobs and the other issues that teamster members want to see addressed are to be won on the picket lines and in the community, not at the negotiating table."

HEADLINE: Deeper Shade of Blue Collar

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Until now, almost every strike that has commanded the nation's attention has involved organized labor's high-paid elite: the four-month steel strike in 1959 involving 650,000 workers, the two-month General Motors walkout of 1970, the air controllers' strike of 1981 and the unpopular baseball players' strike of 1994. But the week-old walkout at the United Parcel Service is the first strike to capture the national spotlight that involves labor's lower castes, in this case part-time parcel sorters and truck loaders who earn about $10,000 a year.
This high-visibility walkout by 185,000 teamsters reflects not just deep changes in the makeup of the labor force and the labor movement but also a profound shift in the focus of organized labor. Labor has now directed its attention to lifting up those at the bottom of the heap, like janitors, supermarket clerks, hotel maids, farm workers and even workfare participants. 
 This new focus is in part a natural response to underlying changes in the work force: The number of manufacturing jobs is stagnant, and the number of service-sector jobs, especially low-wage ones, has mushroomed. Organized labor is concentrating on the low-wage sector because that is where so many workers are. The shift in focus also reflects the vision of John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who brings to his job deeply held Roman Catholic beliefs about the importance of helping the humble and meek. He climbed to the top of the labor movement after heading the service employees' union, which used strikes, sit-ins and slogans like "Justice for Janitors" to win higher pay for low-wage workers.
Mr. Sweeney, to be sure, recognizes that helping those on the bottom rungs makes not just moral sense but strategic sense in his crusade to reverse labor's decades-long slide. Those at the bottom are, understandably, often the most receptive audience to labor's appeals. And unions stand a better chance of winning public sympathy and of becoming a broad social movement, one of Mr. Sweeney's goals, if they focus on assisting low-paid nurses' aides or truck loaders instead of labor's elite.
Organized labor no doubt lost a lot of sympathy when baseball players making $2 million a year paralyzed America's pastime and broke children's hearts while uttering Samuel Gompers's famous motto: More. The U.P.S. strike is not about winning $50,000 more a year for pampered workers but about full-time jobs and better wages for the $9-an-hour part-timers who sort 2,000 parcels an hour or load several tons of goods into a truck each three-hour shift.
The U.P.S. strike, said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University, "resonates with a large segment of our society that is concerned that corporations have reduced their commitment to their workers, that they're doing too much downsizing and using too much contingent labor and temporary agencies."
The U.P.S. showdown dovetails neatly with Mr. Sweeney's vision and strategy, and it is no coincidence that he pledged as much of labor's energy and resources as it takes to make sure the teamsters win.
U.P.S. argues that it makes sense to hire so many part-timers -- four-fifths of the 46,000 unionized workers it has added since 1993 are part-timers -- because it needs flexibility and because much of its work comes in three-hour bursts. U.P.S. officials argue that because their full-time drivers are the best paid in the industry, the company needs lower-wage part-timers to compete with nonunion shippers like Federal Express. At U.P.S., full-time drivers earn $19.95 an hour after two years, while part-time sorters earn $10 an hour and part-time loaders, $9 an hour.
"If the teamsters win," said Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New York, "it's going to send a signal to the rest of the labor movement that you can succeed in fighting for low-wage and part-time workers. It will fulfill John Sweeney's commitment that 'America needs a raise' in a way that any salary increase for pilots or auto workers cannot."
There is another reason unions are focusing more on low-wage service jobs and less on high-paid manufacturing, the one-time stronghold that gave labor its swagger but whose workers now account for only 17 percent of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s 13 million members, down from 46 percent three decades ago.
Labor leaders see that when they try to organize, say, an apparel factory or an electronics factory, the workers often vote against unionizing because they fear the employer will close the plant or move it to Mexico if the union is victorious.
And when the union wins, employers often do move operations to Mexico or other low-wage countries, causing union leaders to question why they spent thousands of hours and dollars on an organizing drive. Labor leaders often say one reason they are focusing on organizing workers in supermarkets, hotels and hospitals is that those operations cannot jump south of the border.
"There's hardly anything going on in organizing manufacturing," Professor Aronowitz said. "In manufacturing, you organize a factory, and a day later it goes away."
In many ways, labor's focus on low-paid employees is a big gamble. Employers often find these workers easy to intimidate. And many cannot afford to weather a strike.
"This is the wrong approach from a historical standpoint," said Leo Troy, an economics professor at Rutgers University. "Organized labor always focused on the better-paid workers. Low-paid workers have a higher turnover. They are often low-productivity workers, and it doesn't make much economic sense for the employer to raise their wages."
But Professor Hurd said the new focus made sense. "There is a recognition in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.," he said, "that if you want to change the image and the appeal of labor, it's necessary to change what it's fighting for. Working on behalf of low-wage workers certainly fits into that."

HEADLINE: Health Care Law Shows Big Government Lives;
No Increase in Uninsured

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Douglas J. Besharov (Op-Ed, Aug. 5) cites only one of four studies examining whether public insurance "crowds out" private insurance. 
 In contrast to the cited article, the three other studies show that previous expansions of Federal health insurance decreased the number of uninsured poor and near-poor children. Furthermore, there was little switching from private to public insurance.
More important, the social costs associated with the absence of health insurance motivate government action to correct the private sector's failure to consider these costs.
Mr. Besharov disguises a political argument with a scientific veneer. If he wanted to make a scientific argument, he might have noted that there is little empirical evidence showing that insurance improves children's health.

Congress Should Act

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Douglas J. Besharov (Op-Ed, Aug. 5) complains that even in this "hot" economy, business will respond to public health insurance for children by eliminating benefits for the children of low-paid workers. 
 This problem has a straightforward solution.
That is for Congress not only to establish a minimum wage sufficient to raise a family but also to require that every employer provide children's health benefits that meet the preventive health standards set out by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Government's objectives for the year 2000.

HEADLINE: ART;
Giacometti, Haiti in Norwalk

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
WHEN reviewing two shows in the same article, art writers will usually try to cleverly make the transition from one to the other. Sometimes the best transition is no transition, for there is little linking the graphic work of Alberto Giacometti and a raft of paintings from Haiti. The bond between them is that they are complete opposites, but the city of Norwalk is big enough to hold them both.
The Giacometti prints are lithographs plus a few etchings at Connecticut Graphic Arts Center. They come from the collection of Herbert C. Lust of Greenwich, who knew Giacometti well from 1949 until his death in 1966, and from the collection of Judith and Stephen Wertheimer, also of Greenwich. Viewers will find that the Swiss artist's graphics are as austere as the tall thin sculptures that are his major work. 
 Mr. Lust, who has written the definitive catalogue of Giacometti's prints and drawings, contends that it wasn't until 1954 that Giacometti emerged as a major graphic artist. Several etchings, particularly the 1934 "State For: Andre Breton," subtitled in the confounding way of Surrealism, "L'Air de L'eau," are reminders of Giacometti's Surrealist beginnings. In the lithographs from the mid-1950's, though, he emerges as established and comfortable in his characteristic idiom. His black lithography crayon seems almost to be self-directed. Its meanderings resemble nothing so much as an unraveling ball of yarn that somehow makes pictures with a precise descriptions of objects.
In a lithograph like "Studio II" Giacometti describes an inventive artist's requisite paraphernalia, and his line's tendency to tangle is appropriate for this. When some of Giacometti's sculptures show up in a work it's a matter of art about art. In "Studio" two sculptures are readily seen, especially a tall one making histrionic gestures.
But signs of sculpture aren't as sought after by viewers as are two animals, appearing in such works as "Head of a Cat," and "Dog, Cat Picture." It is the dog alone in "Studio II." The dog is a lean Afghan often drawn with its head lowered, while the cat is pluckier. The presence of these animals does much to ingratiate Giacometti with viewers; the artist becomes less remote. It is said that Giacometti was once asked if his house were burning and he had to choose between saving a Picasso or his cat, which would it be? Some of the lithographs confirm the creatures as animating spirits.
Full-fledged human figures often appear, doing ordinary things. In this respect Giacometti might be in the tradition of Pierre Bonnard, ennobling the commonplace. It's interesting that the lithograph of a man evidently reading at a desk under a chandelier is titled after the fixture, not the person. With the chandelier, Giacometti had the chance to draw a complex and voluminous piece of sculpture.
Two specially spare lithographs of heads are especially powerful in conveying solitariness. Giacometti's mature work has been called an embodiment of existentialism, but he also seems to be allied with Edward Hopper, who at the same time was also exploring isolation.
"The Evolution of Haitian Art in the Twentieth Century" is the ambitious title of an exhibition of 50 paintings packed into the art gallery at Norwalk Community-Technical College. Surveying the show, viewers can see a lot of change but nothing like a discernible evolution. After all this is essentially folk art, prized for staying true to its roots. In fact the evidence of the show might be to illustrate that a retrenchment is occurring. As a group, the older painters in this survey are livelier than many of their younger counterparts, who seem to be caught up in a unimaginative academic mode.
Viewers are better off forgetting about tracing development of a national style, and concentrate instead on individual sensibilities, many of which are fantastic. Prefitte Duffaut, for instance, conjures a couple of "imaginary cities" built on a futurist-like zigzag pattern and peopled with scores of ciphers standing for humans. The number of these abstract marks swells enormously in the third painting, "Exodus," in which the city is being emptied.
But most of the paintings tap traditional themes. The marketplace persists as a symbol of normality and relative abundance in paintings by Gary Rochebrun, Simeon Victor and Jean Masden Gilles. The jungle is an occasion for wildness and color, and Jackson Charlot's "Jungle" is full of animals huddled together in a kind of peaceable kingdom. Wilson Bigaud uses the jungle as a setting for his version of Eden. Viewers scanning this enormous bountiful earthly paradise may feel regret that the first couple had to give up all that. Patrice Piard and Yves Rigaud display an ability to paint nocturnes, which adds mystery to what should be ordinary, as in Mr. Rigaud's "Dancing at Moonlight." The harsh light from candle flames helps.
Some rueful paintings should be expected, given Haiti's wrenching political history. Haitian painters usually don't render political subjects directly, but rather show the effect of politics reflected in ordinary lives. In this show, Yveson Celadon fills the cynicism bill but hysterically. One of his paintings is bluntly called "Among Crazy People." In it a young married couple clinging to each other is surrounded by family members portrayed as snarling beasts in street clothing. But viewers may be distracted by incidental images such as a comical-looking bird perched proudly on an expensive-looking watch.
The exhibition is sponsored by the Norwalk Community-Technical College Haitian-American Student Association, and Haiti Beyond 2000 Inc., based in Fairfield, which is devoted to economic development in Haiti.
The Giacometti prints are on view through Aug. 30; the show of Haitian paintings closes Aug. 20.

Foot Doctors Try to Ease Pain of H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
HIRAM CHIREL is executive director of the 1,400-member New York State Podiatric Medical Association, the nation's largest state organization of foot specialists. In February the group voted to join the nation's first labor union for doctors, the First National Guild for Health Care Providers of the Lower Extremities. The move is an attempt to increase their influence against what the doctors see as restrictive rules imposed by managed care associations. Dr. Chirel, 66, was a president and board member of the medical association before becoming its executive director. He received his Doctor of Podiatric Medicine degree in 1956 from the New York College of Podiatric Medicine, and served on the faculty there as well as at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dr. Chirel and his wife, Elba, also a podiatric physician and who is president of the Nassau County Podiatric Medical Association, live in Port Washington. They have two grown children.
Q. The idea of doctors becoming unionized seems kind of strange. 
A. Traditionally, unions have been for employees, not employers. But situations have occurred in the health care delivery system and we are trying to find some other avenue for accomplishing some of the things we are trying to do.
Q. What are you referring to?
A. The H.M.O.'s, health maintenance organizations, whose whole objective is to reduce the cost of health care. However, in order to reduce cost, they reduced the number of health care providers and benefits to subscribers because most of them set up what is called a gatekeeper system. In order for the patient to go to a specialist, he has to go to the gatekeeper first. The gatekeeper has a financial incentive not to refer. So what is happening is that there are less referrals than before.
Q. The gatekeeper is the primary care physician.
A. That's correct.
Q. And he has a financial interest not to refer to specialists?
A. The H.M.O.'s withhold 10 or 15 percent of his fee and it goes into a pot. If he does a lot of referrals -- and they figure it has cost them more money because of all those referrals -- he's not going to get it back. If he's a nice guy and he doesn't do a lot of referrals, he is going to get that money back. So that's the incentive not to refer.
Q. How much are we talking about?
A. It could be a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year.
Q. Is that across the board with all of the H.M.O.'s or just a few?
A. Most of them have a gatekeeper and most of them have the withhold, which is financial protection for them at the end of the year. The H.M.O.'s are big business in the United States. In order for the H.M.O.'s to make money, there are two people they can squeeze -- the provider, by cutting down the reimbursement to them, and the patient, by not giving them the care they ordinarily would get if they were in an imdemnity plan where they could go to any provider they chose. So the finest health care system we had years ago is slowly deteriorating.
Q. How competent are the primary care physicians to handle problems that used to be handled by specialists?
A. In many instances, the primary care physician doesn't know what he's talking about. That's why specialists developed in this country, because they are more qualified to treat specific conditions of podiatry.
Q. Are all of your members in H.M.O.'s?
A. No, about 20 to 30 percent were not taken in to any H.M.O. So the patient who was seeing a doctor regularly in the past can't continue to go to him.
Q. Why were some podiatrists excluded from H.M.O. panels?
A. One of the ways H.M.O.'s keep costs down is to limit the number of doctors in the panel. So it becomes more difficult to see a doctor.
Q. How do the H.M.O.'s go about determining which doctors to accept in their panel? Is it based on the quality of the physician?
A. That's what they would like you to believe. They have certain criteria that really don't hold water. You may be a great doctor but not meet their criteria. There may be somebody who is a poor doctor who meets the criteria..
Q. If there is a gatekeeper handling referrals, why not add all specialists to the panel?
A. By limiting the number of specialists, those in the H.M.O. will become very busy and you may have to wait two months to see a doctor. In that way the H.M.O.'s are limiting the number of patients who can come into the office. And they have established a fee that in most cases is less than what the specialist was accepting before. The doctor accepts it because he is afraid he will lose patients.
Q. What about patients who do not belong to an H.M.O.?
A. Somebody was telling me yesterday that he called his internist to make an appointment. The nurse said the doctor couldn't see him for a month. When he told her that he was a paying patient who did not belong to an H.M.O., she said, "When would you like to come in, this morning or this afternoon?"
Q. What is the difference between what the H.M.O. will pay the doctor and his normal fee?
A. Fifty percent.
Q. Of podiatrists in H.M.O.'s, what percentage of their patients come from primary care physicians?
A. In New York State, there has been quite a proliferation of H.M.O.'s in the last two years. So I would say that probably 50 or 60 percent of their patients come from H.M.Os.
Q. What has happened to the practice of some podiatrists?
A. I've had some members call me and say they used to see 120 patients a week; now they see 20. Some podiatrists are actually going out of practice because they cannot economically make it.
Q. What percentage of your membership has come to that conclusion?
A. The 20 percent who are not included in the H.M.O.'s are being forced to drastically curtail their practice or close the door.
Q. And what about those who are included?
A. It's happening to the M.D.'s too. I'm not crying for them, but they are having to work harder to maintain the volume that they had before in terms of dollars. Their income has been reduced and they see more patients because of it.
Q. So they have to see twice as many patients because the reimbursement rate is cut in half?
A. More or less.
Q. Are the H.M.O.'s saying there are too many podiatrists out there and this is a way to weed them out?
A. Yes, and many other specialists are in the same position.
Q. Is there something wrong with that?
A. In a number of years from now, I don't know how many, there are not going to be that many specialists and we're just going to rotate back to where we were before and there won't be anybody here to properly use the diagnostic machines.
Q. How did the union idea come about?
A. In the United States we have the American Podiatric Medical Association, which is the umbrella organization, and each state has its own chapters. Each decided individually whether it would join the union. It's not really a union, it's a guild. So far 17 states have signed up.
Q. What are you hoping the union will do for you?
A. We're looking for the union to help us legislatively to correct some of the problems that have occurred.
Q. The association could have hired lobbyists, why was the guild necessary?
A. We have our own lobbyists, of course, but our union lobbyist represents us in New York State, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. union lobbyist represents 2.5 million members, plus their families. So politically they represent a large number of voters.
Q. How has Medicare been affected?
A. It has contracted with some H.M.O.'s to allow them to sign up Medicare patients. It's become a contest with some of the H.M.O.'s to see how fast they can sign up Medicare patients. So they have breakfasts for Medicare beneficiaries and explain to them that if they sign up with them, there won't be any out-of-pocket expenses for them. Now, if a doctor were to tell a Medicare patient you don't have to pay me the co-insurance and deductible, they could go to jail. But with these H.M.O.'s, they are forgoing the co-insurance and the deductible. So now the same thing happens in which the patient cannot see the doctor that he has seen for years.
Q. Have there been cases in which a patient has suffered needlessly because he was not referred to a podiatrist?
A. Yes, we had instances in which the primary care physician has prescribed antibiotics for severe infections in the toe when the patient really needed a surgical correction. Only after playing with it for a couple of visits and getting nowhere is the patient sent out. And you've heard stories like the one in California where a patient who had cancer was not referred out until it was too late. It doesn't happen every day, but patients are not being referred because the primary care physician has an incentive not to refer him.

HEADLINE: ON THE SOUND: Mary Parker Buckles;
Quest for the Spirit of L.I. Sound

BYLINE: By MARJORIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
"I AM absolutely a muck nut," Mary Parker Buckles said as she picked her way through grasses, sand and rock near Long Island Sound.
Mrs. Buckles said she had found an antidote to the stresses of the modern world -- developing a relationship with intertidal zones. 
 "There is beauty to be discovered in this waterscape, beauty that can renew us like the mountains and contain us like the sea," she said. "In addition to being a place and a process, it is a metaphor for a state of mind. An ambiguity itself, it is a model for the human tolerance of ambiguities."
A book by Mrs. Buckles, "Margins" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), is an idiosyncratic appreciation of the Sound. The premise for "Margins," she said on a visit to Glen Cove, was as much a spiritual quest as a "physical chase."
Her concern, she added, was not to provide information on sewage and oxygen problems, but to contribute an intimate perspective for understanding the ecosystem to celebrate what is worth saving.
"The Long Island Sound is not dead," Mrs. Buckles said. "Today's Long Island Sound is probably as clean for swimming and for harvesting seafood cautiously as it has been at any time in the 20th century."
On a walk along the shore Mrs. Buckles discussed the life just below the surface that provides clues to the importance of the Sound. "Becoming aware of the coming and going of the tides are as useful as learning to use a watch or a calendar," she said. "They have changed my life, made me less rigid. They have taught me about the importance of fluidity and constant change."
The technical director of the Long Island Sound Study for the Environmental Protection Agency, Mark A. Tedesco, agreed that the Sound was at its cleanest in 50 years.
The study, Mr. Tedesco said, aims for a regional focus, with assistance from environmental and other groups, including governments, to reduce the nitrogen in the water. Excess nitrogen causes algae blooms.
Mrs. Buckles, who is not a scientist, a boater or a swimmer, said she based her observations on years of curiosity, patience and a fascination with details. She is intrigued by medicinal research that involves horseshoe crabs, and she observes shorebirds and lunar gravity.
Mrs. Buckles has a love of music that she links to her career as a naturalist. Between observing ospreys and fiddler crabs, she performs at Carnegie Hall as a member of the New York Choral Society.
To Mrs. Buckles there is a connection between the rhythm of the tides and jazz. "Salt tides' embrace of the land's margins and the land's acceptance of that advance tap out a beat on the globe, a 'MON-day' rhythm played against a 'SUN-day' time," she said. "The mix is jazz, like the syncopation of our own breaths and heartbeats. It rewards careful listening. And the voice heard above it in the wing beat of swans, in the kingfisher's rant and the gull's cry is the ancient voice of flux, forever new."
Mrs. Buckles was born in Jackson, Miss. Her father, Carter Harmon, was a biologist and a photographer, and her mother, an avid gardener. After graduating from Millsaps College in Jackson, she met her husband, an economist, while they were graduate students at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
Arriving in New York City, she was an educational writer and editor for the National Audubon Society. To ease the transition to city life, she said, she hauled in dirt from New Jersey for a roof garden for Southern vegetables.
Her position at the Audubon Society fostered her career as a naturalist and led to the publication of three books on natural history, including a children's primer on mammals.
The book, "The Flowers Around Us," a photographic essay on their reproductive structures, was a collaboration with her father that was published in 1985, a few years after he died.
"That book was most like 'Margins' in the personal text that I wrote to accompany my father's photographs," she said.
When she settled in 1989 in a cottage along the coast in Darien, Conn., she began a journal about her new environment. "Though I didn't grow up on the water I've always been drawn to it."
Searching bookstores and libraries for information about the Sound, she recalled, she found little aside from social and commercial history combined with geology. Gradually her impressions and discoveries became the basis for her book.
Her collection of essays is meant as a tribute. "Love letters," they are divided into four life zones, land, air, water and intertidal zones.
Filled with literary references from nature writers, poets and musicians, the book says, "The sea and the marsh are one," as Sidney Lanier, a Southern poet, wrote. Memorizing Mr. Lanier's poem "The Marshes of Glynn" was mandatory for high school students in the South in the 1950's, she said.
"Mr. Lanier perceived that the entire marshlands-tidewater ecosystem is the moist yin and yang of a process, as well as a place, a mutual embrace and interchange," she said.
A review in The New York Times Book Review said the book was "essentially a tribute," adding that Mrs. Buckles "reacts with a delightful mix of elation and deprivation."
"She sees our obligation not so much to be worthy of it as to love and nurture it, and to infuse it with a human music that makes it perennially fresh," the review said.
Mrs. Buckles will be reading and signing on Friday at the Barnes & Noble bookstore in Huntington and on Saturday at the Garvies Point Museum and Natural Preserve in Glen Cove.
The museum, which celebrated its 30th anniversary last month, is on land occupied by the Matinecock Indians as early as 2500 B.C. It was purchased as part of a larger tract of land in 1668. Later 62 acres became part of the estate by Dr. Thomas Garvie, who emigrated from Scotland in 1803.
The museum has permanent exhibitions on regional geology and Indian archeology and offers many programs for schoolchildren. The preserve has five miles of marked trails, including one for people with sight problems.
It is also the new Long Island branch headquarters for Save the Sound, founded in 1972 as a bistate organization to protect, restore and appreciate the Sound.
Mrs. Buckles has developed what she calls "crab eyes," an ability to spot a male fiddler crab from afar simply by locating his pale lure.
Her descriptions of birds are inspired by a friend and mentor, Roland Clement, former vice president of the Audubon Society.
Inspiration also came from a Gulf Coast artist, Walter Anderson, who recorded the gulf's intricate life through line drawings and watercolors.
Mrs. Buckles recalled visiting his widow at his home. The house was filled with shells, bones and natural objects, and she returned with a keen appreciation for his passion.
Mrs. Buckles said she hoped that "Margins" would be a catalyst for others to celebrate the Sound. Hers is one written attempt, she said, to relate the discovery of "snails and webbed feet and granite, of tentacles and feathers and mud and clouds with more than 100 miles of salty liquid in a way that guides the reader into what Walter Anderson once described as a 'constant state of applause' for the natural world."
"In this way," she said, "the work is about both science and magic. But it is about belief first."

HEADLINE: A Handmade Boat Meant for Everyone

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
NEVER mind that it's downtown Hartford, right out in the open with the Old State House as a backdrop and the towering Fleet Bank building right across the street; more than a dozen teen-agers have been building a boat. And this week, after applying some finishing touches to the 32-footer and painting it blue, members of the Riverfront Rangers program will launch the vessel and take it out for a cruise on the Connecticut River.
"After all this work, I just hope it doesn't sink," said 14-year-old Damion Campbell, who will be a freshman this fall at Prince Tech High School in Hartford. "It's been great learning how to measure things and use all these tools. Now I just hope it stays afloat." 
 Seventeen-year-old Jamaa Parks said that when he applied to the city for a summer job he figured on being hired for some kind of parks or recreation program.
What he never imagined was being among a group of young people -- most of whom had never even been on a boat -- assigned to build one in the middle of the state capital. "This is probably the last thing I thought I would be doing this summer, but it's been really cool, one of the best experiences I've had," said Mr. Parks, who will be a junior this year at Bulkeley High School in Hartford. "It's been a lot of fun working with the other kids, but I never knew that building a boat was such hard work."
The work -- which involves measuring, calculating, sawing, drilling, sanding and painting 30 hours a week -- is all part of the Rangers program sponsored by Riverfront Recapture, a nonprofit organization leading a $35 million project to improve the quality of the Connecticut River and re-establish it as a vital economic and recreational resource for the greater Hartford area.
The group, which has been working for 16 years to develop a network of riverfront parks and public recreational centers, is also trying to create a regional park system that will combine the efforts of four riverfront towns: Hartford, East Hartford, Wethersfield and Windsor.
The summer boat-building project, which pays $5.25 an hour, is designed to give young people practical work and job training, while at the same time providing the city with a fleet of vessels for recreational events such as its community rowing program.
Boat-building also offers lessons about the city's rich navigation history. "This opens up inner-city kids to an adventure they never thought they would have," said David Gilroy, an amateur boat-builder who is overseeing the project. "They also get job training skills that they'll be able to use for the rest of their lives, and maybe most important of all, learn how to work together as a team."
Mr. Gilroy, a psychotherapist with a "compelling fascination" for boats, said that "this is a program that encourages these kids to go after their dreams, to do something they might have thought impossible."
He said that building the type of boat that was once common in Colonial America also helps to bring the city's waterway history alive, much more than any classroom lesson or description in a book.
"These are the kinds of boats used to carry passengers and freight up and down the waterways," Mr. Gilroy said. "They were the main mode of transportation in those days -- kind of like the pickup trucks of their time. I think that working to create that kind of boat, and then actually taking it out on the river is a tremendously valuable teaching tool."
But it is the tools of the boat-builder's trade that make the biggest impression on the students.
Joey Texidor, 16 and soon to be a sophomore at Wethersfield High School, he lined up two long wooden planks alongside the hull. As an aspiring architect, he said the training he's getting this summer is more valuable to him than anything he's ever learned in a classroom. He also likes the attention from a steady stream of downtown workers and passersby. "It's really cool," he said, "because people walk by and are curious about what we're doing out here and it's a great feeling to explain that we're doing it for the city, that the boat is for everyone."
Paul Birchette, 15, who will be a junior this year at Bulkeley High, said the program has been a good training ground for him, too, because he wants to be a carpenter. But when he first heard about building a boat, he wasn't so sure. "I thought at first that it might be kind of boring. But was I ever wrong about that!" he said, "I've learned a lot that I'll be able to use someday, and it's been a great way to spend the summer -- a lot better than just hanging out on the streets doing nothing. And it's nice to be making some money too."
Jessica Santiago, 15, agreed with that. "I like the idea that I'm actually learning how to build a boat," she said. "It's something I'll be able to tell my kids about someday."
Mr. Gilroy, along with his professional boat-building assistants, said the toughest part is "convincing these kids that they can build a boat -- and that it won't sink."
"They're very skeptical at first whether they can really transform all these piles of wood and nails into a real boat that will stay afloat in the water," said 31-year-old Andres Bermudez, a professional boat builder who has tried to instill in the students a feeling of pride in creating something of artistic and practical value.
"What we try to stress to them is patience and as the weeks go by and it really starts looking like a boat -- they gain a lot of confidence and become very dedicated," he said. "By the time we're finished, they realize that it feels good to have accomplished something that will last for years to come."
Craig Mergins, director of programs and operations for Riverfront Recapture Inc., said "It's an amazing process to watch these kids learn how to build a boat from absolutely nothing and with absolutely no experience. Most of them have never even been on a boat before and here they are building one that the city will be able to use for a long time."
Joseph Marfuggi, executive director of Riverfront Recapture Inc., added, "We're not expected to create a new generation of boat builders -- but what we are helping to create is a generation of teen-agers who know how to work with tools and with each other." The public site of the project was carefully selected, he said, to showcase the students' work.
"Here we have a rare opportunity for suburban people who work in the city stopping by to talk to urban kids, which gives both groups a chance to understand each other better," said Mr. Marfuggi, adding that "It is especially empowering for the kids as they explain details of the project."
Many downtown office workers said that at first they were amused, but then very much impressed as they watched the boat take shape.
"I would buy the boat myself if it were for sale," said Ronald Kiley, an insurance company sales representative who calls boating his most passionate hobby. "Every day I pass by there and watch the progress they're making -- and it's truly astounding to me that these inexperienced kids are doing such a good job. It's not easy to steer a boat, let alone build one."
A Bulkeley High School senior, Anthony Almedina, 18, agreed that the project has drawn a lot of attention downtown.
"People ask what we're doing all the time and it's a good feeling to tell them about it," said Mr. Almedina, who added that while he had hoped for a summer job in an air-conditioned office, "working out here in the sunshine building a boat in the middle of the city was probably the next-best thing."

HEADLINE: Strong Economy Leads to Land-Sales Boom

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
THE current demand for land in Westchester is unlike anything seen in the region in many years, brokers and developers involved in land sales say.
"By contrast to the early 90's when no one was buying and land was literally lying fallow, this market is just amazing," said Ebie Wood, a regional vice president of Houlihan/ Lawrence real estate. 
 Ms. Wood, who oversees the company's offices across northern Westchester, said vacant land in the region, including individual lots and large parcels, are selling at an unprecedented rate.
"For example, take Rock Rim Ponds in Pound Ridge," she said, "one of the last rural enclaves of 266 acres, comprising 52 home sites ranging in size from 3 to 12 acres, selling from $250,000 to $400,000: it has been thoughtfully developed, preserving the intrinsic character of the land."
She continued: "In 1996 we closed on 5 parcels at Rock Rim, but during the first six months of this year, we have already sold 5 parcels, and 10 sales are pending."
Overall, land sales in the northeast corner of the county totaled 72 last year. This year, 50 land sales were recorded in the first six months. "And an additional 15 sales are pending in our one office alone," Ms. Wood said.
The land rush is directly tied to the economy. "With a strong economy, buyers become future oriented," she said. "In the early 90's, the economy made them apprehensive about making long-term commitments. Today, people seem to have no qualms about building a custom house, which won't be completed for eight to nine months down the road."
The buyers, Ms. Wood said, are "affluent, Wall Street types in the 35-to-45-age range, very specific and savvy" about what they want. "For most, it's their first house, and they want quality," she added.
Environmental awareness is a big part of today's land buyers' outlook, with developers responding by "treating the land with respect," she said.
Rock Rim Ponds, for one, won the American Nurseryman's Award for environmental landscaping, Ms. Wood said.
In Waccabuc on Rock Shelter Road, a new offering of 21 parcels on 100 acres recently came on the market after 10 years of navigating through a sea of local and state environmental regulations.
"It is almost impossible for anybody to win environmental approval to subdivide anything," said John Ciardullo, a partner in the project. "The process in New York State is abstruse."
Mr. Ciardullo, an architect with a successful business in Manhattan, said he and his partner, Arthur Samberg, originally bought the land simply because it was so beautiful.
"Land like this is finite," he said. "When it's gone, you can't make more. The vision I had was very simple: we would do a subdivision that didn't look like a typical subdivision but one that blended into the land, preserving the stone walls, mature trees and the rock outcroppings."
Now, 10 years later, Mr. Ciardullo has found there is a large market for old stone walls, rock outcroppings and narrow, meandering roads.
"There has been a tremendous interest from all types of potential buyers," he said. "Wacabbuc is an affluent, prestigious community, extremely desirable to a lot of people."
Four-acre parcels are selling for $300,000 to $350,000. "We're building a model on one of them to show buyers what we can offer them, a custom house designed by an architect, built on the lot of their choice," Mr. Ciardullo said, adding that buyers can also engage their own architect or builder, subject to approval.
Single parcels of land in northern Westchester are still available, ranging from modest building lots that meet minimum zoning requirements to extraordinary parcels like Cross Winds in Pound Ridge, a spread of 212 acres, which includes a 9-acre lake, being marketed in its entirety at $5.75 million.
In southern Westchester the situation is very different. Even single parcels of land have all but disappeared there.
"Land is at a premium and so scarce that a good lot in the estate area of Scarsdale will fetch almost $1 million," observed Mary Ellen Tolan, branch manager of the Houlihan/Lawrence office in Scarsdale.
Scarcity of land has created a new phenomenon, the demolition derby.
"What is happening is that buyers will find a 40's or 50's so-so house on a beautiful piece of land in a neighborhood they like," Ms. Tolan said. "They buy it, only to demolish it and build a house from the ground up on the lot. Believe it or not, it usually costs less than extensive renovating."
In areas like the Fox Meadow section of Scarsdale, with quarter-acre zoning, Ms. Tolan said land is being subdivided from an existing parcel and sold to builders.
"Some owners go so far as to remove a porch on an existing house in order to portion off the land," she said. "In one case, a large old Tudor, on an acre, was torn down and two houses were built in its place."
Buying a house for demolition is not as outrageous as it appears if the land and location warrant it, Ms. Wood said.
"In the Guard Hill estate area of Bedford, for example, a modest house on beautiful land with fabulous views was razed, not remodeled. In its place is a beautiful carriage house built on speculation by Glazer Builders of New Caanan who are offering it at slightly over $3 million."
Louise and Joseph Paolicelli, who live in East Northport on Long Island, are about to go to contract for a parcel of land at Rock Rim Ponds.
"We started by looking at houses and land on Long Island, and when we didn't find what we liked we came to Westchester," Mrs. Paolicelli said. "We found it to be much more rural. The land we bought is beautiful, unspoiled. We're very excited and hope to be in our new house a year from now. Rock Rim doesn't look like a subdivision. In a few years the houses should look as if they've been here forever."
The Paolicellis are typical of Rock Rim Ponds buyers, said John Gutleber, president of Castagna Realty, the developer.
"The dearth of residential properties has helped create a strong market for us," he said. "When people can't find an existing house they really like, they buy some land and build exactly what they want."

HEADLINE: Mall Site Receives Approval

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WITH news that the Common Council here gave the nod to yet another shopping mall late last month, hope grew that this central Westchester municipality would once again live up to an earlier nickname.
Once touted as the City of a Thousand Stores, it frayed at the seams in the late 1980's and early 90's as the recession took its toll. Some shops in the downtown area closed, and many of those that remained fared poorly. One large mall, the Galleria, hung on, although barely. 
 But, increasingly, that all seems like ancient history. In 1994 the Westchester Pavilion, a 275,000-square-foot power center, opened along Maple Avenue here with competitive-priced merchandisers. A year later, The Westchester, an upscale million-square-foot mall anchored by Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, also opened on Maple Avenue, with a glittering array of expensive merchandise.
Contrary to predictions, the two new malls did not detract from the existing 883,000-square-foot Galleria, which spent $11 million for a face-lifting and held its own in the growing constellation of shopping options.
Now the way is clear for yet another developer, Alexius Conroy, who plans to anchor the new mall with Saks Fifth Avenue, an existing 120,000-square-foot store.
Late last month, Mr. Conroy and Saks officials won city approval here to build the $65 million open-air mall at Bloomingdale Road and Maple Avenue -- directly across the street from The Westchester and barely a stone's throw from the Westchester Pavilion.
The Saks store, which has been faring poorly against the competition, is planning to modernize.
"We are all fired up," Mr. Conroy said last week, outlining his plan for 30 stores and several full-service restaurants. "We will be complementary, not competitive, with the other malls."
Rather than worry about the competition across the street at The Westchester, Mr. Conroy said he was encouraged by it. He predicted that shoppers would patronize both malls.
Robert T. Guerra, assistant general manager of The Westchester, agreed that the two sites would be drawing similar upscale customers, who could cross the street to shop at either mall.
Most retailers believe that the county has not yet fully tapped the high-end retail market.
"Before, shoppers were leaving Westchester to go elsewhere, like New York City," Mr. Guerra said. "Now the dollars are staying in the area. This establishes White Plains as a shopping mecca."
He added, "It's terrific. The competition is healthy."
Not to be left out of the burgeoning retail scene, Bloomingdale's, which is less than a mile away, recently announced plans to expand its 20-year-old, 250,000-square-foot store. It leases land from New York Hospital and has suggested that it might situate one of the entrances to its park-like shopping area near the main entrance to The Westchester to reduce the apparent distance between them.
Meanwhile, Mr. Conroy said he expected to open the new fashion mall, called the Shops at Saks Fifth Avenue, by late 1998. He said he would break ground this year.
The developer said that he once considered bringing Bloomingdale's to the Saks site, but that plan never materialized.
At the county's offices here, Eric Langeloh, Finance Commissioner, said sales tax receipts for Westchester have reflected the increased shopping activity in White Plains. Retail sales generated $200.5 million in tax revenues for the county last year, up from $184.7 million in 1995, he said.
"Certainly a piece of that has to do with the opening of The Westchester and the other stores," Mr. Langeloh said. "The spending climate is encouraging."
Looking ahead at the Saks mall,Mr. Langeloh said the additional shopping mall would most likely generate even more income for Westchester.
"But how many more stores we can absorb, I can't predict," he said. "But as new stores and malls come on line, others go out of business. There are usually adjustments in the cycle."
Similarly, sales tax receipts for White Plains have grown to $31.8 million in the fiscal year 1996-97 from $26 million in 1994-95.
Joseph R. Potenza, the White Plains Planning Commissioner, said the city anticipated $1.6 million a year in sales tax revenues from the new mall. The Westchester generates about $5 million a year in sales tax revenues.
The newest mall is also expected to generate about $150,000 annually in property taxes for the city and $375,000 in property taxes for the school district, Mr. Potenza said. And it will lead to about 300 new retail jobs.

HEADLINE: Blacks Seeing Economic Growth

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
AS a successful black architect and political leader, Ernest D. Davis relishes the trappings of the upper-middle-class status he has worked so diligently to achieve: his five-bedroom house with manicured grounds here, an extensive art collection acquired over the years, membership in the same college fraternity as the television star Bill Cosby and acceptance in social circles where other prominent political and business leaders congregate.
Yet he worries. 
 Like other blacks who have achieved middle- and upper-middle-class status, Mr. Davis, the 59-year-old Mayor of this city, fears that those gains may be short lived.
"All this can change tomorrow," he said one recent sunny afternoon, sprawled on a porch chaise outside his home, as he pointed to his gracious garden, the renovations under way on the house and the driveway lined with vintage automobiles.
"Blacks don't have the cushion that whites do," he said, warning against putting too much emphasis on the accouterments of prosperity. "We haven't yet learned to perpetuate our successes, to dominate certain industries, to get a strong foothold any place. That's why we idolize basketball players and other sports figures, even though their successes aren't long lasting."
Uncertainties about tomorrow notwithstanding, all indicators are that increasing numbers of blacks, in Westchester and around the country are faring better economically than ever before.
As testament to that trend in Westchester, the Carver Federal Savings Bank, the largest black-owned financial institution in the country, opened a mortgage and loan center here last year "to sow the seeds for yet more growth," said Thomas L. Clark Jr., the bank's president and chief executive officer.
The loan center is offering commercial, residential and auto loans, secured and nonsecured credit cards and other services.
The financial institution, which opened in a storefront in Harlem in 1949, was founded by an association of community advocates, church leaders and small business owners, who established Carver in an area that white-run banks had turned their backs on. The $363 million institution, named for the black scientist and educator George Washington Carver, now has two locations in Manhattan, three in Brooklyn, two in Queens and one in Roosevelt on Long Island. More are on the drawing board.
Speaking of the decision to open a loan center in the heart of the business district here, Mr. Clark, a Greenburgh resident and another of Westchester's more affluent blacks, said: "We're going where the market is. This isn't for charity. The numbers are showing it to be a good business move."
While the national median household income for blacks in 1989 was $19,758 (for whites it was $31,435), according to the 1990 census, Westchester's numbers were much higher.
The median family income for blacks in the county more than doubled in less than a decade to $36,537 in 1989 from $16,485 in 1980, the county's Planning Department reported. That was, however, still significantly less than the average median family income for all Westchester residents -- $58,852 in 1990, up from $27,278 in 1980.
Despite the gains, there is a long way to go.
Some middle-class blacks like William Brown Jr., a management consultant in White Plains, worry that the advances they fought for are in danger of being undercut because affirmative-action policies continue to come under attack.
"It's upsetting, because my children are now experiencing some of the problems that I did 25 years ago," said Mr. Brown, who is running for White Plains mayor on the Democratic ticket. "I was hoping that would have gone away."
Mr. Brown said that his grown daughter is a lawyer who still battles racism in the job, and his son is a salesman who has been denied promotions because he is black.
"It's a great disappointment for me to hear about their problems," he said. "It holds us back."
Gene A. Capello, a Yonkers resident and vice president and assistant general counsel for a major financial services concern in Manhattan, said that while "people of color have had better entree into the corporate world in the past 25 years," they are still grossly underrepresented at the policy and major decision-making levels.
"Until that changes, our opportunities are limited," he said. "We've hit a ceiling."
In periods of layoffs, too, blacks suffer disproportionately, Mr. Capello said, because as the most recent hires, they are often the first to be discharged.
Because of blacks' fragility within the corporate structure, the trend of late has been for increasing numbers to start their own businesses.
In 1982, there were 1,640 black-owned companies in Westchester; by 1992 that number had risen to 3,397, according to county records.
The road, however, has been a rough one for black entrepreneurs, said Robin Douglas, president of the African-American Chamber of Commerce of Westchester and Rockland.
"We're playing catch-up," Ms. Douglas said, explaining that many black companies are still learning basic business principles, like the concept of becoming partners with competitors to get more business.
"In past years, the attitude of many small- and mid-sized black companies has been win, lose or draw, they'll do it their own way," she said.
"Now they're having to learn that that doesn't always work," she added.
Education, too, continues to be an area of concern for middle-class blacks, who want their children to receive the same quality schooling that affluent whites do.
Gerald M. Coleman, a member of the Mount Vernon School Board, worried that blacks' hopes for the future were being undercut in the classroom.
"The danger is that kids in school districts like Scarsdale will become the technical masters of the future and our kids in the urban settings will become just the workers," he said.
Kenneth W. Jenkins, a former chapter president of the Yonkers branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has similarly focused on education as a yellow brick road to the future for middle-class blacks.
"Success for any ethnic group doesn't happen by luck," said Mr. Jenkins, who is running for City Council president in the state's fourth-largest city. "Education is the key, and if you don't have that, then you're working with a truly serious handicap."
Mr. Jenkins was ousted from his position by the N.A.A.C.P. because he took an unorthodox stand on busing. He said more emphasis should be placed on upgrading neighborhood schools in black areas than in transporting young students to white areas.
As blacks have moved up economically, they have also sought better housing, but studies have shown that with success they do not necessarily move far away from others of their race.
Researchers at the Urban Studies Group at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University in Albany, studied nine metropolitan areas in the United States and found few high-income, residential areas that have black majorities.
"Why this is happening we don't yet know," said Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute.
In part, the study suggested, it is because the number of blacks that are getting ahead remains small proportionately: as of 1990, 13 percent of black households in the country earned more than $45,000 and only 6 percent earned more than $75,000.
But, also, it is because blacks do not always feel welcome in white neighborhoods, Mr. Capello said, recalling a May 12 bias incident in Yonkers in which a white man set off a super M-80 firecracker on the windshield of a vehicle owned by another white man who had sold his house to a black woman and her three children.
Mr. Capello, who said he earns six figures a year, lives in a gracious residential area not far from Yonkers' poorest neighborhoods in the city's southwest quadrant.
Mr. Jenkins observed that getting ahead, for all of its pluses, put many successful blacks in stressful positions.
"On the one hand, members of your own race accuse you of forgetting where you came from, of moving out of the neighborhood, literally and figuratively," he said. "On the other hand, you have to do things twice as well in the white world. You have to really always cross your T's and dot your I's. It's a hard burden to carry."

Traffic Plan
To accommodate an expected 25,000 spectators a day for the Professional Golfers' Association Championship at the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck tomorrow through next Sunday, the county has set up a special traffic plan. The goal, said James P. Doughty, a spokesman for County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, is to keep all but a small amount of traffic away from the narrow, winding residential streets that surround the tournament site. 
 The County Executive's office said there will be no spectator parking at Winged Foot, and violators will be towed away.
Those attending the events are encouraged to use Metro-North's New Haven Line to Mamaroneck, where they can board a free, five-minute shuttle to Winged Food. For train information, call (800) 638-7646.
Ticket holders who intend to arrive by car are being notified by mail to park at one of two satellite sites: Westchester Community College in Valhalla or Yonkers Raceway. There will be free, continuous bus service to Winged Foot from those sites.
 
Poll Results
In a recent poll, Manhattanville College found that taxes and education topped the list of Westchester voters' concerns.
The voters were asked to identify the issue facing the county that most concerned them. Of the 450 people who responded, 31 percent identified taxes as the primary concern, with half of those respondents referring to school and property taxes.
Another 16 percent singled out education. And 8 percent of respondents said crime and drugs were major concerns. Seven percent cited the environment, and 6 percent listed poverty and the needs of the elderly. The rest mentioned overcrowding, affordable housing, jobs and the economy, rent control, welfare, government spending and the privatization of county services.
In another question, 6 percent rated the county's economy as excellent, 54 percent said it was good, 33 percent said it was fair, and 7 percent said it was poor.
Those who rated the county's economy favorably included residents making more than $100,000, people with a postgraduate education, those who lived in the southern half of the county but outside the cities and those older than 51.
Those who held more pessimistic views included residents with a high school education or less, people with a yearly income of $24,000 or less and those who lived in a larger city.
 
Texaco Cites Progress
Texaco's chief executive officer, Peter I. Bijur, reported recently that the company has taken major steps toward diversifying its work force.
"Last December, Texaco made a commitment to a more inclusive and diverse work force and to broader relationships with women- and minority-owned businesses," Mr. Bijur said. "In the first six months of the program, the people of this company made excellent progress toward the goals we stated in our plan."
In the first half of this year, 50 percent of the company's 4,400 new employees in the United States were women and 38 percent were from minority groups. The breakdown among minority employees was 16 percent black and 15 percent Hispanic. Of the 325 employees promoted in the first half of the year, 47 percent were women and 24 percent were from minorities.
Mr. Bijur also said that the number of minority- or female-owned law firms that Texaco does business with rose to 21 this year from 6 last year, and the number of advertising agencies owned by members of a minority group is up to 2 from none.
 
O'Rourke Son Arrested
Andrew P. O'Rourke Jr., 41, the son of the County Executive, was arrested last month in the village of Ossining after he failed to pay a fine for maintaining a substandard apartment house there, the police said. He had pleaded guilty in April to violating building codes, Sgt. Michael Brown said.
George Pires, the village's building inspector, said the younger Mr. O'Rourke, who lives in Yonkers, had a "history with our department" and had been issued a summons for building-code violations twice since last year. Mr. Pires also said he fell on a step of a house owned by the County Executive's son because it was in disrepair.
Mr. Pires said that at another point, the building had been declared unfit for habitation because the utilities had been turned off. After that, the younger Mr. O'Rourke rented out a first-floor apartment in the building before he had approval from the Building Department to do so.
In the most recent violation, he was fined $250, but did not pay it, Mr. Pires said. The younger Mr. O'Rourke was summoned to court but failed to appear. He turned himself in on July 22, posted bail of $250 and was released, Sergeant Brown said, in effect paying the fine.
The younger Mr. O'Rourke, who is a journalist, said last week that he had been in the hospital with spinal meningitis and had been out of work for a year. He also said the tenants had damaged the house.
The County Health Department, too, has had problems with the County Executive's son. Mary Landrigan, a spokeswoman, said the same building, which has two three-bedroom apartments, had past asbestos violations. But those problems have since been fixed, she said.
 
Patients' Rights
Support is growing for a state bill, the Patients Fair Appeals Act, which would amend New York's current medical insurance law.
Most recently, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, who supports the bill, and State Senator Catherine M. Abate of Manhattan, who has introduced it in Albany, were at Greenburgh's Town Hall to discuss the bill with residents. The proposal would provide a statewide standard for health insurance coverage for experimental drugs and those in trial. It would also cover devices and treatments prescribed by doctors for patients with life-threatening, degenerative or permanently disabling conditions. In addition, the bill would provide patients with a timely right of appeal when insurance companies deny coverage for care that doctors have prescribed.
"The proposal is designed to make sure that insurance companies do not control the fate of patients for the sake of profits," said Paul J. Feiner, Greenburgh's Supervisor. He had extended the invitation to the Lieutenant Governor and Ms. Abate.
In addition, the bill would create a new position of consumer advocate, whose job it would be to help people choose appropriate health insurance and assist them if they are dissatisfied with their coverage. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: Charitable Giving Taps New Donors

BYLINE: By GITTA MORRIS 

 BODY:
TWO new funds at the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven have captured the imaginations of a new breed of philanthropists who want to become more involved in the decision making.
One, the Women and Girls Fund, was started two years ago with the goal of helping women learn more about philanthropy. "Traditionally women give time, men give money," said Sherry Mordecai, the foundation's development and donor relations officer. "When it comes time to make the charitable gift in the family, the husband's college, his interests, get the most." 
 Things have changed, however. "Women are making their own money and are capable of making the gift on their own," Ms. Mordecai noted. "We wanted to build on that."
The second new venture is the Catalyst Fund, which was started last year. It brings together younger leaders of the community who, while they are not yet ready to making major financial gifts, like the idea of having a voice in how their charitable dollars are spent.
The New Haven Foundation was developed in 1928 by trustees of the banks that were handling various charitable funds. Four years ago the name was changed to the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven, to better reflect the donor base and grant range from Clinton to Milford, and as far north as Cheshire and Wallingford. According to the Council on Foundations in Washington, D.C., in comparison with similar-sized community foundations, it is among the 25 top community foundations in the country.
Serendipitously, shortly after the Fund for Women and Girls was set up, a donor appeared. "This was a teacher who was very concerned about women's issues," Ms. Mordecai said. "She had received a small inheritance from her father, and she wanted to do something special with it. She thought a woman's fund was a terrific idea."
"Awarding money is very difficult. It's hard to believe but true," Ms. Mordecai noted. "It's not unusual for people who are contemplating a family foundation, or currently have one, to consider transferring it over to a community foundation. They don't have to deal with tax forms or other details. It streamlines the process and cuts the cost tremendously."
The fund, which was designed to be affordable, calls for a minimum contribution of $1,000, which can be pledged over a five-year period. "I've been a professional fund-raiser for 17 years, and I've never seen pledges coming in like this," Ms. Mordecai said. "There have been no defaults."
Phyllis Seton, a North Haven resident and one of the founders of the fund, said the new fund now has $100,000. Among the beneficiaries of the Fund for Women and Girls are Elm City Girls Choir and the Martin de Porres Quilting Workshop. The rational is not singing or quilting, rather, the objective is bringing together women of diverse economic, racial and age groups as friends and mentors. Another award went to the Survivors of Domestic Violence shelter for a playground.
"Who knows," Mrs. Seton said, "maybe the people who benefit from these grants will continue the idea of giving, if they have the means, not only financially but also by volunteering."
Last year, the foundation felt it was once again time to expand the donor base. Peter Culver, a 45-year-old lawyer who lives in Guilford, formed a group called Catalyst, with an annual membership contribution of $500. "Typically, to start a fund at one of these foundations, you have to give $10,000," Mr. Culver explained. "That's more of a commitment than many people want to make. So the first thing is to give people, who want to give at a significant but not ultra-rich level, a chance."
Catalyst has two unusual components, Mr. Culver noted. "We are going to meet at least once a year to have a forum about issues that are pressing needs in the community, with people who are knowledgeable in that area to talk to us," he said. "And we will be involved in the decisions about where the funds that we raise actually end up being directed."
Also appealing to the Catalyst donors is that the foundation acts as a clearinghouse for potential donees, with knowledge that the average prospective donor does not have. "It's important, too, that the New Haven Foundation is an endowment and builds over time," Mr. Culver said.
From six areas of giving or interest, the Catalyst group has selected food, shelter and education for grants this year. Awards will be granted in December. The foundation awards around 500 grants a year. In 1996, $4.9 million was raised in new money and 18 new funds.
"One thing that the donors in the Women and Girls and the Catalyst Funds want is to see tangible results," said Joan Huwiler, the foundation's communications officer. "They want to know their check isn't lost in the shuffle. When you see your mailbox full of appeals, they all sound so compelling. The key to the foundation is, we can fully educate the donor and provide that follow up."

HEADLINE: THE NEW TAX LAW: Amid Complexity, Opportunities Abound;
Socking It Away for College, With Uncle Sam's Help

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
For all Washington's celebratory mood over the nation's first major tax cut in 16 years, Congress and the Clinton Administration hardly issued an open invitation to the party. Rather than an across-the-board tax cut, the $96 billion package is a series of narrowly focused measures intended to achieve specific goals. How much you benefit depends on your personal circumstances. Here is a guide to achieving key financial objectives under the new rules.
THERE are few parents who have not looked at tables showing how much they will have to save each month to pay for their children's college educations without some combination of horror and guilt. Several measures in the tax bill may take the edge off those feelings, although not eliminate them, especially not with tuition costs rising faster than inflation.
The law creates a new class of educational savings accounts modeled on Individual Retirement Accounts. It allows contributions of $500 a child a year. The contributions are not tax-deductible, but earnings in the account accumulate tax free, and withdrawals are tax free when used for undergraduate or graduate-level tuition, room, board or books. 
 Because of the $500 limit, the new educational I.R.A.'s alone will not be enough for parents intent on saving all or most of the money needed to pay for four years of college. According to Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, a $500 annual contribution from birth through age 18, earning 8 percent a year, will grow to $22,381 -- less than the costs of a single year at a private university even today.
The educational I.R.A. is subject to income limits, which affect couples filing jointly with modified adjusted gross income of $150,000 and single filers with modified adjusted gross incomes of $95,000. But it is unclear whether the income limits will really have much meaning. Some financial advisers said the law appears to allow parents whose incomes exceeded the limits to give $500 to another family member whose income fell within the limits, who, in turn, could use that $500 to establish the educational account for the child.
"It's a nice tool to shift resources from high-tax individuals to lower-tax individuals," said Joan Vine, the national director of employee benefits tax services for Grant Thornton, the accounting firm.
There is a penalty for people who do not use all the money accumulated in the account for college expenses. Such money would be considered income and taxed at ordinary income-tax rates -- plus a further 10 percent tax.
For some people, the tax bill provides other relief from college expenses. That includes a credit of up to $1,500 for the first two years of college, and then a credit of up to $1,000 -- increasing to $2,000 after 2002 -- for additional years of college. The credits would be fully available for families with incomes up to $80,000 a year and partially available for families with income up to $100,000 (phasing out for single filers would be between $40,000 and $50,000).
But for the most part, people will have to choose between the credits and the educational I.R.A., because the two cannot be employed at the same time. For families in the 15 percent income-tax bracket especially, the credit, which reduces taxes dollar for dollar, could be much more attractive than tax-sheltered savings, said Clint Stretch, a partner at Deloitte & Touche. For families in higher tax brackets, the education I.R.A. would probably be more attractive.
The tax law also would allow tax-free, penalty-free withdrawals from both traditional I.R.A.'s and Roth I.R.A.'s for higher education expenses of the account's owner, a spouse, a child or a grandchild, Ms. Vine said. Such withdrawals would mean that the money saved would not be available for the contributor's retirement -- the original purpose of the account -- or for the purchase of a first home.
The law is written in a way so that it would be difficult if not impossible to set up a traditional I.R.A. or a Roth I.R.A. in a child's name.
 The article also misattributed the reference to the provision. While Joan Vines of the Grant Thornton accounting firm described some permissible uses of the money, the reference to the tax status was not hers but The Times's.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 10 about the effects of the new tax law on saving for college referred incorrectly to a provision concerning withdrawals from individual retirement accounts for higher-education expenses. Under the law, such withdrawals from traditional I.R.A.'s are penalty-free, but not tax-free. With the new Roth I.R.A., the withdrawals are both penalty-free and tax-free, but only if the money has been held in the Roth I.R.A. for at least five years.

With the new education I.R.A., the maximum annual contribution is $500 a year. The intended recipient must be named as beneficiary; benefits phase out for single parents with incomes of $95,000 and couples with incomes of $150,000. The chart shows the expected balance in an education I.R.A. at age 18, assuming maximum annual contributions of $500 made each year on the beneficiary's birthday, and presuming an 8 percent annual rate of return.

Ruth W. Messinger was forced last night into a runoff for the Democratic mayoral nomination with the Rev. Al Sharpton, as a low voter turnout in a three-way race, combined with a strong performance by Mr. Sharpton, dashed her hope for a jubilant primary night sendoff into the fall campaign.
With all 5,627 precincts reporting, Ms. Messinger had 155,913 votes or 39 percent, to 126,799 votes or 32 percent, for Mr. Sharpton. The third major candidate in the race, Councilman Sal F. Albanese, had 83,402 votes, or 21 percent. 
 Under state law, a candidate in a mayoral primary is required to win 40 percent of the vote to capture the nomination. The runoff, to be held on Sept. 23, will be the first Democratic runoff since 1977, when Edward I. Koch defeated Mario M. Cuomo.
Ms. Messinger's aides attributed the result last night to the case of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who prosecutors said was assaulted while in police custody in Brooklyn on Aug. 9. Mr. Sharpton -- who had nowhere near the organization or financial resources of Ms. Messinger or Mr. Albanese -- quickly identified his campaign with the Louima case, and Ms. Messinger's aides pointed to Mr. Sharpton's victory in Brooklyn as proof of the success of that strategy.
But Ms. Messinger was also hurt by Mr. Albanese's healthy showing, which interviews suggested drew support away from Ms. Messinger, and from what may have been the worst voter turnout in a Democratic primary since World War II. Only 395,395 of the 2,246,987 registered Democrats voted, about 18 percent.
Mr. Sharpton, beaming in the brightest spotlight he has enjoyed in a high-profile career as a protest leader and civil-rights advocate, pledged to adhere to the traditional values of his party. In an energetic, televised speech to supporters last night, he also scolded Democrats who he said had sought to abandon those values.
"This is our day. This is our time. I can fly! I can fly! I can fly!" Mr. Sharpton declared exuberantly, repeating the words of the popular song, "I Believe I Can Fly," by R. Kelly, the hip-hop artist, which he plays in his car, in his home and at most campaign stops.
Turning his attention to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- who has until now refused to engage Mr. Sharpton in any debate -- the candidate declared: "Whatever skirmish Ms. Messinger and I have, Mr. Giuliani, at the end of the skirmish, we're coming to City Hall and one of us is going to take your seat in 1997."
A few blocks away, Ms. Messinger, standing next to a glum David N. Dinkins in the ballroom of the Grand Hyatt, presented the outcome as just a small setback. "Well, friends, they never said this would be easy," she commented. There was a scattering of boos when she said that there would probably be a runoff. "We're going to have to win this the hard way, but win it we will,' she said.
Still, by any measure, the runoff appears to be a huge setback for Democrats seeking to unseat Mr. Giuliani. It will delay for two weeks the general election assault on Mr. Giuliani, forcing Ms. Messinger and Mr. Sharpton to devote resources against each other instead.
A runoff against Mr. Sharpton is likely to prove particularly uncomfortable for Ms. Messinger. She will now be forced to run head-on against a candidate with a strong following in some parts of the black electorate, but without alienating the black voters who are critical to any hope she has of defeating Mr. Giuliani.
The runoff is also likely to complicate Ms. Messinger's efforts to position herself on the center of the political spectrum in anticipation of a race against Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Sharpton has repeatedly scolded Ms. Messinger for trying to win election by abandoning the liberal wing of the party. Until now, she has been able to ignore him, but that might be difficult starting today.
Ms. Messinger herself seemed unprepared for the outcome yesterday. Right up to the eve of the election, she had been predicting that she would not only avoid a runoff but win easily. She in effect raised expectations for herself, which made her showing last night appear even more damaging. Mr. Sharpton's showing, on the other hand, was almost exactly what he predicted it would be.
There were two other candidates on the ballot: Eric Ruano-Melendez, who received 18,940 votes, or 5 percent, and Roland Rogers, with 11,061 votes, or 3 percent.
Ms. Messinger was almost certainly hurt by the presence of Mr. Albanese on the ballot. Still, her performance was a startling setback for a woman who has been a fixture on New York's political scene since she emerged on the Upper West Side 25 years ago, running first for school board, then for the City Council and then, in 1989, for Manhattan borough president. Her history, base of support and fund-raising ability had led Democratic leaders across the city to view her as the almost certain nominee from the day Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, dropped out of the mayoral race in early May.
Even before the polls closed, Democratic leaders across the city were criticizing the campaign Ms. Messinger and her advisers had run as they began seeing signs of her defeat.
In particular, they were critical of one central tactical decision by the Messinger campaign: to forgo the heavy "get out the vote" operation that has always been integral to winning primary elections in this city. The campaign instead devoted its resources to a television advertisement. And that ad spoke only about what Ms. Messinger had presumed would be her contest with Mr. Giuliani -- thereby not even alerting her supporters to yesterday's vote.
Influential Democrats in Ms. Messinger's own neighborhood, reporting during the day on signs of duress in her backyard, said they had been constantly frustrated in their attempts to persuade her staff to turn its attention to what is known as street campaigning. "All we got on the West Side was 150 pieces of literature on Saturday," one Democrat supporting Ms. Messinger said last night. "This has taken a media strategy to a new dimension."
The result last night underscored questions raised by several political analysts over Ms. Messinger's decision to staff her office with political professionals who had little or no experience in New York. Her campaign manager, Jim Andrews, is from Chicago; her media consultant, Mandy Grunwald, is from Washington, though her clients include Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
The difficulties of the comparatively well-financed Messinger campaign seem all the more stark when put up against the bare-bones campaign waged by Mr. Sharpton that has forced Ms. Messinger into this position. He broadcast no television advertisements, hired no campaign consultants and did not retain a media adviser. Instead, he adhered to a relentless schedule of campaigning across the city.
And he raised so little money that he could not even meet the $250,000 threshold for qualifying for city campaign finance money.
But Mr. Sharpton's campaign benefited from the Louima case, as evidenced by the vote in Brooklyn. And he also may have been helped by the primary for Manhattan borough president. Democrats said there was a high turnout in black communities for C. Virginia Fields, who won the Democratic nomination yesterday.
Beyond that, Mr. Sharpton offered what many Democrats saw as a far more extensive -- and, from a Democratic perspective, traditional -- view of what he thought the party was about. He repeatedly criticized Democrats who moved to the center, arguing that the party should not abandon its traditional position of helping the poor and oppressed.
Mr. Sharpton discussed that last night, taking full advantage of his suddenly huge platform to present his view of the Democratic Party. But he also took care, at least initially, to frame his challenge as one to Mr. Giuliani, rather than Ms. Messinger.
"Ruth Messinger is not the loser at all tonight," Mr. Sharpton said. "The real loser is Rudy Giuliani." Addressing his remarks to Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Sharpton said: "You will not be able to ignore the issues and the constituency that I've tried to represent. Those days are over. The issues of unemployment and police brutality and schools' not working are on the front burner. And you can run, Rudy, but you can't hide."
Ms. Messinger has framed her campaign around the condition of the schools, which she says have deteriorated under Mr. Giuliani's watch. She visited a public school yesterday, before the polls closed, and spoke of the issue again last night.
But mostly, Ms. Messinger seemed to be trying to reassure her supporters that the results last night were nothing more than a small setback, and not the end of what even her own friends had come to see as a troubled campaign. In doing so, she for perhaps the first time acknowledged the existence of strong opponents for the nomination.
"Tonight, my friends, is just a first step," she said, smiling. "When I decided to run for Mayor, I knew that we would have a fight on my hands. A tough fight against a bully of a Mayor, and yes, a tough fight against my rivals in the Democratic party."
Mr. Albanese, speaking at his early concession speech, declined to say last night whom he would support in a runoff. He could barely disguise his disappointment.
"We campaigned for a year and half," he said after his concession speech. "We shook a lot of hands. But you have 8 million people in this city; you have 2.5 million registered voters. You have to get on the air. But we rallied a lot of people together around the same issues. It was a good campaign. I have no regrets about it."
Interviews with Democrats around the city yesterday suggested that many had decided to skip the primary because they had concluded that the candidates had simply said and done too little to motivate them. Others said they were not at all eager to throw Mayor Giuliani out of office, so why bother voting in the primary?
Sol Sobel, a 73-year-old lawyer, said he had never passed up an opportunity to vote in a Democratic primary. Until now.

HEADLINE: The Real-Estate Royals. End of the Line?

BYLINE: By David Samuels; David Samuels is a contributing editor at Harper's Magazine. This is his first article for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
It is not a sight for the faint of heart: a ballroom full of tuxedo-wearing owners, builders and managers of the city's prime real estate shouting at the top of their lungs at lenders, lawyers and assorted factotums as white-jacketed waiters stagger by beneath silver trays of salmon roulade. If the 101st annual banquet of the Real Estate Board of New York lacks the laid-back charm of dinner for two at the Rainbow Room -- there are few spouses, no dancing, and only a handful of the guests bother to sit down -- the importance of tonight's event can be seen from even a quick glance at the dais. Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are here, along with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, various City Council members and a youthful-looking official in a sharp blue suit whose game but puzzled expression indicates that he is happy to honor his distinguished constituents in the real-estate business but has never seen anything quite like this before in his life.
The roar that fills the Grand Ballroom of the New York Hilton tonight, loud enough to tinkle the glass chandeliers and to overpower all attempts at conversation in the balcony above, is the sound of Manhattan's $90 billion real-estate market in the first flush of exuberance. New construction is up. Midtown vacancies are down near the single digits. As the ceremonial part of the evening continues on -- the Governor; the Mayor; Samuel (Sandy) Lindenbaum, the knife-thin lawyer who helped make so many of these people rich; Joseph B. Rose, head of the City Planning Commission and a son of the developer Daniel Rose, mounting the dais one by one -- the small fish swim in frantic circles, darting anxious glances at the big-deal owners who won't return their calls during the rest of the year. 
 And there they sit at the center of the room, the royal families of Manhattan real estate: the Rudins, Dursts, Roses, Fishers, Tishmans and Resnicks. Unlike Donald Trump (who, the families like to point out, is not a member of REBNY) or the late Harry Helmsley (more an owner-manager than a builder), the names of these men barely ring a bell. Yet the families are to New York what the oil barons are to Houston or the steel bosses were to Pittsburgh. With their careful blend of dynastic savvy, wealth and behind-the-scenes clout, they have shaped the city through good times and bad. Let the Wall Street bonus babies squirm and jump with every flutter of the Dow. The rulers of Manhattan's prime real estate are a throwback to the distant, more family-oriented age when Wall Street was ruled by Lehmans and Loebs and Hollywood was run by Warners and Mayers.
The Rudins are represented tonight by William C. Rudin, heir apparent to an empire of some 39 buildings currently valued at more than $1.5 billion. Jack Rudin, his uncle, is the family builder. William's father, Lew, who combines a streetwise Rodney Dangerfield voice with the broad sentimental streak of the successful Jewish machers in Saul Bellow novels, is the Rudin who speaks to the press. The Dursts, some of whom are seated nearby, are olive-skinned with big brown eyes, known in the business for saying very little and for pursuing a disciplined program of acquisition and construction that has transformed the area near Grand Central Terminal into a family-held principality. The latest Durst contribution to the city's skyline, 4 Times Square (the first new Manhattan office tower in nearly a decade), is being built by John Tishman and his son, Daniel; John is a wry, inquisitive man whose Tishman Realty and Construction is the descendant of the company founded by his grandfather Julius in 1898. Daniel Rose, seated nearby with his nephew Adam and his niece Amy, is the house intellectual, more likely to be found at a reading on the Upper West Side than at an industry event like this.
With a few additions and subtractions, these are the same families that dominated the city's real-estate market 40 years ago. They have survived the assaults of the big insurance companies of the 60's, the near-bankruptcy of the city in the 70's, the entry into the market in the 80's of well-capitalized foreign giants like Sumitomo and Ladbroke and Olympia & York. They have expanded their fortunes as arriviste competitors have come and gone. They are as close to a stable ruling class as New York has enjoyed since the beginning of the century, when Manhattan was owned by the Astors and the Rhinelanders, and Sam Rudin, David Rose and other family founders were cutting deals on Court Street in Brooklyn or 149th Street in the Bronx. And though factions and alliances still exist (Roses and Rudins; Tishmans and Dursts; Tishmans and Rudins), the families are more likely to do business with one another now than at any time in their collective history.
While the understated permanence that the families bring to the city is impressive, this group portrait of wealth and power handed down from generation to generation is hardly carved in stone. Indeed, some analysts believe that Manhattan's prime real estate, and the social and political power that goes with it, will soon be owned not by the families but by real-estate investment trusts, or REIT's -- publicly owned and operated companies that invest in and manage real estate. REIT's have already made inroads into property markets in Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco, Houston and Dallas. Now that New York State's 10 percent tax on property transfers has been abolished, there are hints that prominent Manhattan developers are preparing to take their holdings public, too.
Those who believe that the families' glory days may be numbered do not have very far to look. The revolution -- if that's what it is -- began on March 12 of this year when Bernard H. Mendik, chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, announced that he would merge his family-held company and seven Manhattan office towers with the publicly traded Vornado Realty Trust, headed by Steven Roth. Vornado already controlled a prime midtown development site at 58th Street and Lexington Avenue, once occupied by Alexander's, and is one of five bidders for the Coliseum site at the southwest corner of Central Park. With the addition of Mendik's holdings, Vornado now controls more than five million feet of prime Manhattan office space. "The financial strength of our combined companies," Roth promised in a written public statement on the day the deal was announced, "will enable us to capitalize on opportunities, including those in the Manhattan office market." Roth has proved as good as his word. On April 25, he bought 90 Park Avenue for $185 million. In a $160 million joint venture in June, he bought a half interest in the Hotel Pennsylvania and paid $75 million for a parcel of property around Madison Square Garden. According to an article in The New York Times, the developer has told friends that "he intends to become the largest owner of commercial real estate" in all of New York.
 Of course, the families have heard this talk before. nurtured over three and sometimes four generations, their sense of connection to the city they built carries with it a touch of the seigniorial feeling with which noblemen of a different century must have regarded their estates. "This is the farm," says Richard L. Fisher, the elegantly dressed heir to the Fisher Brothers fortune, who also holds a master's in English literature from the University of Pennsylvania. "It's not just an asset. It is family and business joined as one."
Meanwhile, the frequency with which real-estate-family names appear on major boards is a very public sign that the current generation of Jewish owner-builders has achieved the place in the city that their parents were denied. The Roses, Rudins, Tishmans and other families support such institutions as Mt. Sinai and Beth Israel Hospitals; Columbia and New York Universities and the New School for Social Research; Lincoln Center; Carnegie Hall, and in recent years, the Metropolitan Museum, the Asia Society, the Museum of Natural History and the Whitney. They do their best to keep out of the papers. "Real estate was not very high profile until the late 70's, early 80's," says Adam R. Rose. "The big-name developers, whose names I'm not going to use, dragged the rest of us out of the closet, if you will, because they were very high-profile people with very flashy, expensive projects, who pronounced on every subject and were in the headlines with their divorces and this and that."
The families' political influence -- whether helping to get city loan guarantees through the Senate in the 70's or pushing for more cops on the street during the Dinkins era -- is also considerable. "Whoever the mayor is, they want that person to succeed," says former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a friend of the Rudins. "I knew I could call on all these people, and I always did." Through a broad and influential network of contacts, the families and their fellow developers exercise their influence through elected officials, through REBNY, through industry-led coalitions like the Alliance for Downtown New York and through the city's Business Improvement Districts, which provide once-basic public services like security, street lighting and trash removal for an increasingly large portion of Manhattan.
"The real-estate tax is the largest thing that comes into the city's budget," says Hadley W. Gold, whose service as first assistant corporation counsel during the Koch administration gave him a wide-open window on the families' dealings with the city. "These are very smart people. Do you follow what I mean? They know what makes the city function, they know how to make people comfortable and they don't overreach." More pointed development questions, meanwhile, are handled by lawyers like Sandy Lindenbaum, whose father, the late Abe (Bunny) Lindenbaum, served as a political broker between the Brooklyn Democratic machine and developers. "They don't need me to call the Mayor," says Sandy Lindenbaum, who, like Howard J. Rubenstein, the public-relations expert, has been a venerable aide-de-camp to the families. "They get on the phone and call the Mayor themselves. But if what they need is a change in zoning, you don't call the Mayor -- so they call me."
Yet after decades of building, borrowing and exercising clout, the families' place in the city may finally be up for grabs. With their huge reserves of public capital, and their investor-friendly corporate governance, real-estate investment trusts offer the virtues of liquidity and transparency in a market that has often resembled a high-stakes Monopoly game, where properties are bought and sold among the same small group of players. Martin Cohen of Cohen & Steers, which manages more than $5 billion in REIT's, says of the families: "They weren't so smart. They just had dumb financial partners. So now that they've bankrupted their partners, they're proud to say, Well, we're left standing. But they still need financing. One, because their loans have matured and they have obligations" -- a reference to the borrowed money on which so many real-estate empires were built. "And two, because the proceeds of selling their properties wouldn't be great enough to pay their taxes."
A former partner at a well-known Wall Street firm, who declined to be named, takes a similar view. "The empires you're talking about were all based on the fact that for many years, private ownership of real estate was rewarded with these ungodly tax breaks sponsored by the Government," he says. "As an individual owner, you could make money in any one of dozens of ways. You could deduct your losses at the highest rate and keep whatever you earned in rents. You could sell your losses to other wealthy individuals. When the value of the building went up, you could borrow against that and deduct those payments, too. To invest in real estate as a public entity meant you were crazy." With the 1986 Federal tax reforms, however, the real-estate playing field was abruptly leveled. "The smart ones will always survive, of course," the banker says. "For the rest of them, the ride is over."
Even developers who have no plans to go public anytime soon are impressed by the speed with which the REIT's have moved. "Large institutions will play an increasing role," predicts Daniel Rose. "I would not be surprised if some of the family companies you see today do not survive in their present form." Marty Cohen takes Rose's prediction one step further. "Within the next 20 years or so," he says, "I would not be surprised if half of the visible buildings in Manhattan are owned by public companies."
Richard Fisher is not quite so sure. "I remember the recession in the 70's," he recalls, with a faraway look in his eyes. "I remember credit drying up. I also remember one lender walking into this office and suddenly demanding that a loan be paid off. I sent a messenger over there, and I enjoyed that experience immensely. I might also note that bank is out of business now. And that becomes part of your memory, too."
 On any weekday morning at around 8 o'clock at the Regency Hotel, you might find Henry Kissinger conversing with Bob Tisch while men at the surrounding tables get the inside scoop on the latest hot I.P.O. over egg whites and coffee. The atmosphere is understated and cozy, a combination of private club and neighborhood coffee shop for New Yorkers whose net worth numbers in the hundreds of millions. For anyone hoping to understand the role the family real-estate dynasties play in New York, Lew Rudin's table at the Regency is a good place to start.
The ambassador-at-large of Manhattan real estate, Rudin, 70, is a gruff, streetwise man known in the business as a compulsive talker and a soft touch. The first Rudin to own property in Manhattan was his grandfather Louis Rudinsky, an immigrant from Volozhin, Poland, who became a grocer on the Lower East Side. "What his father instigated in him," Rudin says, "was the love of freedom of religion and the freedom to own property, which he couldn't own in Europe." In 1902, Rudinsky invested his savings, site unseen, in an apartment house on 54th Street, on the wrong side of the tracks from the Rockefeller mansion. "We still own and operate that property," Rudin adds, "although now it's a 32-story office building."
As the founder and chairman of the Association for a Better New York, Rudin has also been a significant power behind the scenes -- eminence grise would be too geriatric-sounding a term for a man who can hit a half-dozen board meetings, cocktail parties and dinners in a single evening -- in the administrations of every Mayor since Abe Beame. "The secret of my relationship with the political world is, I never ask them for anything," he says. "So I owe them nothing. Most of the time, they owe me something."
Evidence of Lew Rudin's political muscle is not hard to find. Under his leadership, the families prepaid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, as did other major real-estate taxpayers, during the 70's to keep New York afloat. When Morgan Stanley threatened to jump ship in the 80's, Rudin and Bob Tisch (whose own Manhattan holdings are considerable) convened a meeting to convince the bankers that leaving the city would be a mistake. "Moynihan, Rangel, the Cardinal, David Rockefeller -- it was intimidating," Rudin says. "Moynihan got up and said, 'I'm going to be the chairman of the Finance Committee.' Rangel got up and said, 'I'm the No. 2 guy on Ways and Means in the House.' In any event, we did them a favor. And they recognize it now."
Was the Mayor at the Morgan Stanley meeting? "I don't know who the Mayor was then," Rudin says, swatting the question away with the flat of his hand as he leans over the table. "Dinkins? Koch? I don't know if the Mayor was there." The look on his face is easy to read: Who cares?
The Rudins' latest development project, 55 Broad Street, is a textbook example of the families' ability to combine enlightened self-interest and political acumen to shape the city's future and to insure their prosperity for decades to come. The aging, asbestos-ridden, Rudin-owned building went dark for five years after the real-estate bust of 1990. Last year, 55 Broad Street was reborn as the Information Technology Center, a hive of flexible office space where content providers from companies like N2K, Sun Microsystems and I.B.M. sit in front of glowing blue computer screens -- thanks to a plan developed by the New York City Partnership, investments like the $40 million by the Rudins and generous incentives from the city and the state for tenants.
Padding around his office, showing off his pictures of Presidents and mayors, children and grandchildren, Rudin notes that this very office building was constructed on the site of the grade school attended by his father, Sam, at the turn of the century. It was completed in 1969 with a 120-year ground lease held by the U.S. Steel pension fund. Twenty years later, in the late 80's, the Rudins purchased the lease for $25 million. What does the future hold for the Rudins? "Owning the land here is going to be very good for my children and grandchildren," Rudin says. "I would say we got a very good deal."
 The Prudential Insurance Company's March 17 announcement that the three remaining sites it controls in Times Square are up for grabs set off an immediate scramble for financing and tenants among the families and their corporate rivals, REIT's included. As the latest battle in the Manhattan real-estate wars began, however, one winner was already apparent: the Dursts. "All of us here grew up involved not just with real estate but with New York City and its operation," says Douglas Durst as various cousins and nephews and in-laws, gathered around a polished conference table in one of the Durst Organization's buildings, nod their assent. "And because this is a family business, we're not thinking about tomorrow or next week. We're thinking about our children and grandchildren, and so we do develop buildings and begin planning them 20 and 30 years before they are actually built."
The Dursts are pleasant but shy, communicating in sentences of three or four words punctuated by the occasional glance or stare. If they are not the most colorful real-estate family in New York, they are, next to the Fishers, the richest, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $650 million.
"I look at it as a puzzle -- putting all the pieces together," Douglas Durst says. "That's what interests me. Putting together the 4 Times Square site, for example, was an incredibly complicated puzzle." Eighty-six percent leased before the ground was broken last August, the 1.6 million-square-foot building will be the largest Durst-owned building yet. The tower itself, a model of which sits on the table at the far end of the room, reflects the family's emphasis on state-of-the-art materials and boiler plants over glitzy architecture and show. Durst says that the tax benefits attached to the site add up to $70 million. (Published reports put that figure at more than four times as high.)
"With that site," Durst says, "part of the puzzle was that the footprint was too small, although there were tax advantages that convinced me that it would be the next place somebody could develop. So we had to enlarge the site. We had to buy the main property from people we had spent the last couple of years suing and who weren't very fond of us, we had to buy more property we didn't own, we had to find financing and we had to do it all concurrently." Another part of the puzzle was the developer's apparent use of the press to send confusing signals to his rivals, first telling reporters that the days of large-scale building in the city were over and then, once the acquisition was announced, flatly denying that Conde Nast would be a tenant. (The publisher will be sharing the building with the law firm of Skadden, Arps.)
Durst's foxy, chess player's approach to the development business is, like the buildings he owns, an inheritance from his father, Seymour, who helped build the Durst Organization on the properties accumulated by his father, Joseph, a cobbler's apprentice from Poland who purchased his first building in Manhattan in 1915. A puckish man known among his peers for his sly humor and eccentricities, Seymour Durst turned his Manhattan townhouse into a shrine for his private collection of New York City historical materials (including a room lined with billboards from the old Times Square) and indulged what appears to have been a case of true graphomania by sending countless letters to city newspapers and serving as a columnist for Street News, the publication distributed by the homeless. Seymour Durst was also the premier site assembler of his generation, using byzantine chains of shell companies to disguise his intentions from sellers and rivals. Insisting that he would never buy anything he couldn't walk to, he built an empire that is currently unrivaled in its profitability, strategic concentration and 98 percent occupancy rate.
Which may explain why, when it comes to the REIT's, the latest in the family's long line of competitors, Douglas Durst does not seem worried at all. "Our goal is to be the last company being fought over by the REIT's," he says. Around the polished wood conference table, the Dursts look at one another and smile. "My own feeling is," Douglas continues, as if stating the obvious, "that the REIT's will get into trouble, the public will get disenchanted and they will disappear off the face of the earth."
 Whether the real-estate families of Manhattan will survive the passing of the current generation with the power and glory of their empires intact, however, remains an open question -- and not just because of the arrival of the REIT's. Outside the sleek modernist conference room of the Rose Associates' office hangs a black-and-white photograph of Manhattan as seen from the sky immediately after World War II. Shaded pathways wind through Central Park. The Chrysler Building glints in the sun. Other features of the landscape, however, are not so familiar. The saw-toothed piers are filled with dozens of ships unloading passengers and cargo onto bustling docks. The peaks of midtown and Wall Street, an Everest-like mountain and its smaller, no less ambitious cousin, tower over a landscape that seems startling in its flatness. "Every street corner had a crane," instructs Elihu Rose, standing in front of the picture and slipping into his familiar role as family historian. "And we had our share," adds his older brother, Fred.
The office towers that line the avenues of the city today, rising 40 and 50 stories into the sky, are impressive symbols of the families' rise from immigrant poverty to wealth and power. Nearly a century after that rise began, however, perhaps the most telling criticism of the city that the families have built is that part of it is missing. The buildings are bigger and the families are richer, but the legions of artisans who did the millwork, made the door bucks and windows and lent their skills to Manhattan's once vibrant building trades are gone. Where 60,000 residential units were built in the city in 1963, residential construction in 1995 was just over 7,000 units. Among the surprisingly large number of those in the families who agree with at least some part of this critique is John Tishman, whose family construction business built the World Trade Center, the Hancock Tower in Chicago and Century City in Los Angeles. "It's no coincidence that all of a sudden we have no good housing," Tishman says. "The Government gave these incentives for commercial buildings, whereas good planned housing, as a social thing, is what the Government should have been supporting."
As the current generation of real-estate moguls dies off or retires and family estates are divided, it seems safe to predict that at least some of the mammoth glass-and-steel towers so lovingly pictured in the family brochures will appear someday in shareholders reports sent out by the REIT's. As REIT holdings grow, families that stay in business are ever more likely to form REIT's of their own, or to merge their holdings with those of existing REIT's in exchange for cash and a share of the power. It is also true that REIT managers, with shareholders to satisfy, will have even less of an incentive than the city's current landlords to worry about new street lamps or after-school programs or multimillion-dollar donations to hospitals and museums. For REIT investors, however, Manhattan real estate will continue to look good -- as long as the current boom continues.
But as the families know only too well, no boom lasts forever. When the dust settles on the next Manhattan real-estate bust -- and eventually there's always a bust -- chances are that with a few additions and subtractions, the landscape will look very familiar.

HEADLINE: New Petersen Owners Take Aggressive Stance in Magazine World

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
Less than a year after taking control, the new owners of the Petersen Companies are preparing to seek the rewards of reshaping the company that publishes Motor Trend, Hot Rod, Teen and 70 other special-interest magazines.
With its automotive focus, Petersen was better known in Detroit than in traditional publishing circles. Now, its new owners, a coalition of private investors and publishing executives, are working to raise the company's profile on Madison Avenue and Wall Street. 
 Since emerging last August as the surprise winning bidder for the Los Angeles-based magazine empire begun by Robert E. Petersen in 1948, its new top executives, D. Claeys Bahrenburg and Neal Vitale, are decisively reshaping the company.
Mr. Bahrenburg, the former president of Hearst Magazines, and Mr. Vitale, the former general manager of the Hollywood trade paper Variety, folded the money-losing Sassy into their other youth title, Teen. They moved their sales team to New York and met with ad agency executives. And they struck such licensing deals as a Motor Trend cable television show, and rolled out 11 new publications, including ones for shotgun lovers and Volkswagen die-hards.
"Historically, Petersen undermarketed itself," said Steven R. Greenberger, vice president and director of print media for Grey Advertising. "The old owners felt the magazines sold themselves."
The new management's more aggressive stance, along with strength in the magazine market, is already improving Petersen's operations. Last week, Petersen signaled its intent to take that good news to investors with a first-time public offering of as much as $172 million in stock in the next few months. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it planned to use the proceeds to repay some of its $277 million in debt and redeem some preferred stock.
Before the S.E.C. filing, some industry executives had estimated the company would be valued at more than $700 million. That sum would surprise industry skeptics, who last fall were quick to deride as excessive the $463 million price agreed to by Petersen's buyers, which include Willis Stein & Company of Chicago and the Dunning Group, based in Stamford, Conn.
There was reason for skepticism, since Petersen in its peak year of 1994 posted profits of only $19 million. In 1996, Petersen lost $47.7 million as a result of the debt load from the buyout of the company.
This year, though, Petersen's new management has made significant strides. For the first six months of 1997, revenue rose 4 percent, to $120 million, compared with the first half of 1996. Moreover, the company's operating cash flow before taxes, interest and other items rose threefold, to $30 million, the company said in a statement last month.
But $31.3 million in interest and payouts to preferred stockholders left the company with a $20.4 million loss in the half-year period, said Mr. Vitale, Petersen's president and chief operating officer.
Still, "it's more of a windfall than they bargained for," said one executive whose company dropped out of the bidding for Petersen.
Asked about the company's rationale for making a public stock offering so soon, Mr. Vitale said: "It's a strong market. Who knows how long it will last."
Brad Freeman, a founder of Freeman Spogli & Company, a Los Angeles buyout firm that acquired Vibe and Spin magazines and also bid for Petersen, had a similar view. "You raise money when you can, not when you need it," he said.
Mr. Vitale said proceeds from the stock offering would be used to retire $60 million in debt and $50 million in preferred stock. "With less leverage, our debt capacity would rise," he said.
Some magazine industry executives expect Petersen to use part of the proceeds to buy other periodicals. Petersen has been mentioned in the advertising press as one of the companies interested in the six tennis, sailing and ski magazines put up for sale by The New York Times Company in March.
Mr. Vitale declined to say if any remaining proceeds from the stock offering would be used to expand Petersen's portfolio of titles.
Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for the Times Company, said the company's policy was not to comment on potential deals of any kind.
While the magazine industry has generally benefited from a rising economy and increasing advertiser spending, circulation figures for big glamour books have stagnated in recent years. One of the few areas of real growth are niche publications that cater to special-interest audiences, such as the teen-age girls and automotive buffs that Petersen reaches. Its best-known magazine, Motor Trend, has a circulation of 1.15 million, making it the best-selling auto monthly.
In the last year, the K-III Communications Corporation, a rival media company, has also begun mining this vein, focusing on the automotive sector that Petersen had dominated. In recent weeks, K-III acquired such titles with tiny cult followings as Low Rider, Muscle Mustangs and Vette, and now boasts it is the nation's largest automotive enthusiast publisher by number of titles and advertising pages. The category caters to those whose passion is customizing their vehicles and to advertisers whose gadgets are not driven by Detroit's economic cycles.
Luck helped make the new owners of Petersen look prescient rather than profligate. Prices for the 84 million pounds of paper Petersen bought annually rose sharply in 1995, cutting into Petersen's earnings. But paper prices have since declined, and that cut $4.2 million from Petersen's 1996 operating costs, part of $25 million in expenses eliminated by the new owners in the first quarter, according to a securities filing in January. Other savings included $11 million in personnel costs, $3 million on bad software and nearly $1 million for "excess travel and entertainment expenses."
Such expenditures were part of the old company's culture. Bob Petersen, the company's founder, was known for his hunting expeditions, in which he would bring an entourage of advertisers and editors along to Africa or the Arctic. The seventh floor of Petersen's old headquarters on Sunset Boulevard was known as Polar Bear Square for its game trophies that included a seven-foot-tall white bear.
"It was his personal playground," a former Motor Trend editor said. "He went on his own instincts. His passions were cars and guns."
Mr. Petersen, who grew up in California desert towns where his father was a mechanic, began with a single title, Hot Rod, that he hawked from his motorcycle at race tracks. Over the decades, Mr. Petersen repeated that formula, creating periodicals that catered to his interests like Guns and Ammo and Dirt Rider.
Now nearly 71, Mr. Petersen has no heirs to whom he could pass along his magazine empire.
Even before the sale, Forbes magazine said Mr. Petersen was worth $400 million. He retains a 15 percent stake in his old company.

HEADLINE: A Newspaper for Half a Hemisphere?

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Long before the first copies of Tiempos del Mundo ever hit the newsstand last year, the flashy, Spanish-language newspaper that is linked to the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church was making headlines of its own.
At the newspaper's gala inauguration, former President George Bush called Mr. Moon a "visionary" for creating Tiempos del Mundo, or Times of the World, an 80-page tabloid that its backers said would be distributed by satellite to almost every country in North and South America. 
 But critics strongly denounced Tiempos del Mundo as just another vehicle for the Unification Church to proselytize Latin America, where the Korean-based sect has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate, hotels, banks and other businesses.
Today, nine months after its introduction and $10 million in start-up costs, Tiempos del Mundo is struggling to get off the ground, burdened by logistical problems and its association with Mr. Moon's church, which is viewed with great skepticism in Latin America. Its proprietors say it has a circulation of 5,000 in Buenos Aires and 5,000 around the rest of the continent, but those figures are unaudited.
"Tiempos del Mundo is insignificant as far as the newspaper market is concerned here in Buenos Aires," said Pepe Eliaschev, one of Argentina's most respected journalists. "I've never seen a colleague of mine reading that paper or even talking about it. It's very clear to everyone that this paper is a Moonie outlet, and no one here has forgotten that in the name of anti-Communism, his church supported the military dictatorships of the 1980's."
While media experts believe the market is ripe for Spanish-language publications like Tiempos del Mundo that exploit growing economic, political and cultural links between countries in the hemisphere, the Moon publication seems far from reaching its ambitious goal of publishing daily local editions in every country of the Americas from Canada to Chile.
The paper's front page does, however, reflect its larger ambitions. Tiempos del Mundo typically has one main story with a banner head, a large photo, and five or six lines of type summarizing the story. Above and below the lead story are headlines from around the region and to the left is a digest of sports, business, arts and technology reports from various countries.
The newspaper, which is edited in Buenos Aires and distributed in 17 countries, is currently printed only weekly. There has been little advertising -- most of what there is comes from local businesses, including a Uruguayan bank, some continuing education programs, a few restaurants in Buenos Aires and some Argentine radio stations.
Meanwhile, other regional publications oriented toward Latin America have been relatively successful in capturing large readerships and advertising dollars, including Newsweek in Spanish, an expanded Reader's Digest in Spanish and The Wall Street Journal Las Americas.
Started in 1994, The Wall Street Journal Las Americas publishes two pages in Spanish or Portuguese inside the business sections of 20 leading Latin American papers with a total circulation of 2.5 million. Newsweek began publishing an edition in Spanish in May 1996. It has a circulation of about 54,100.
In addition, Latin America has seen an explosion in the number of 24-hour Spanish news services that are also seeking to tap what analysts say is a growing demand for regional news in Spanish. Among the leading players in the television news market are CNN en Espanol; Eco, a subsidiary of Televisa Group of Mexico, and Telenoticias, which is owned by CBS.
Establishing a pan-American newspaper with a common voice and identity will not come easy, mainly because Latin America is not a Spanish-speaking monolith but a mosaic of distinct countries, each with its own culture, nationalistic fervor and journalistic tastes.
Beyond those questions, concerns about the paper's ownership persist. "Certainly there is a market for hemispheric publications like Tiempos del Mundo, but what concerns me and many readers the most is whether this is a legitimate journalistic operation or a proselytizing instrument of Rev. Moon's sect," said Rosenthal Calmon Alves, a professor of journalism at the University of Texas College of Communications who specializes in Latin America.
"That's the biggest obstacle this paper will have to overcome," the professor said. "I get scared when I hear that Rev. Moon is involved."
The paper's editors maintain that Mr. Moon, who has suggested in his religious teachings that he is the Messiah, has absolutely no influence on the publication's editorial content and that his investment and civic activities are independent from his spiritual leadership.
"We have absolute freedom to pursue whatever story we please, and there will never be any intervention from Moon or the church," said Jose Cardinale, the paper's editor in chief. "If we didn't have such freedom, we couldn't have convinced so many well-established journalists to come and work for us."
But critics have expressed concern that the church's connection with big business will give the church undue influence in Latin America.
Tiempos del Mundo is published by News World Communications Inc., which owns The Washington Times, a conservative daily; the Spanish-language Noticias del Mundo of New York and the evening newspaper Ultimas Noticias of Montevideo, Uruguay. News World Communications is controlled by a board that has close ties to Mr. Moon.
Officials of Tiempos del Mundo said that the publication had been unfairly selected for criticism because of its association with the church but that Tiempos del Mundo was back on course and expected to be publishing daily local editions in every country of the hemisphere by the end of the year.
"We want to be to Latin America what USA Today is to the United States," Mr. Cardinale said. "Our target audience is the middle- and upper-class business traveler who is somewhat family oriented. Since our paper will be in every hotel and airport and newsstand, readers will become familiar with us."
Newspaper officials said that they expected circulation and advertising to rise quickly once Tiempos del Mundo was up and running throughout the region. To be profitable they said the paper should gain between 200,000 and 500,000 subscribers within the next five years.
"We knew the first year would be weak in terms of advertising because basically we couldn't sell what hadn't been launched yet," said Richard Pera, who is the continental coordinator for Tiempos del Mundo. "Once all our countries are on line, we will be in a position to capture both local and regional advertisers who want to market their products to a wider audience."
Mr. Pera said that, as it did with The Washington Times, News World Communications was prepared to sustain heavy losses to underwrite Tiempos del Mundo until it could stand on its own. He said that the company planned to make another $10 million investment to introduce local editions and go daily and that its total investment in the publication could run as high as $50 million over the long term.
"The reason nobody has introduced a daily product like this before is because it would be foolhardy to do so without having something to get people hooked," Mr. Pera said. "I think our association with Rev. Moon gave us more promotion than we could have bought. And over time people will begin to focus on the product and forget about Rev. Moon."

HEADLINE: United Parcel Asks Clinton To Intervene In Walkout

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Officials at the United Parcel Service stepped up their calls yesterday for President Clinton to intervene to end the week-old teamsters' strike, but Administration officials said Mr. Clinton was leaning strongly against such action.
Because the negotiations broke down indefinitely on Saturday, United Parcel executives said Mr. Clinton should use his powers under the Taft-Hartley Act, which authorizes the President to seek a court order to end a strike when the nation's economy or safety is imperiled. 
 "Certainly the strike has had a devastating impact on our customers and our people," James Kelly, the company's chairman, said yesterday on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." Then, referring to President Clinton, he added, "We would certainly encourage him to become involved."
But the leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters insisted that invoking Taft-Hartley would be improper interference in the collective bargaining process.
Last Monday, 185,000 drivers, loaders and sorters went on strike against U.P.S., the nation's largest shipping company, in a dispute over pay, pensions and part-time jobs.
Appearing on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman indicated that the Clinton Administration was not seriously considering seeking an injunction against the walkout.
"We don't believe that this situation has reached the state of what we define as a national emergency, as it is defined in the Taft-Hartley legislation," she said.
On the ABC News program "This Week," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin added that Taft-Hartley "has very stringent requirements. It hasn't been invoked in over 20 years. In fact, the last time a President tried to use it, he was rebuffed by the courts."
Mr. Rubin insisted that the Administration was following the proper course by pushing both sides to return to the bargaining table to resolve the dispute, which involves more workers than any other strike in this decade.
Both union and management said they would be happy to confer with Administration officials, but neither indicated that formal negotiations would resume soon. The two sides had held 21 hours of talks on Thursday, Friday and Saturday with a Federal mediator, but they broke up when both sides said it was useless to continue the negotiations.
Also appearing on "This Week," John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, made it clear that organized labor was opposed to invoking Taft-Hartley. "There's no national emergency right now, and we have a right in this country to bargain collectively," he said. "We have a right to strike."
Both labor and management sought public support yesterday.
Appearing on "Face the Nation," Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president, said, "We're talking about vital issues that are so important to Americans, issues about part-time workers. What we have going on in this country -- and U.P.S. is the biggest violator -- is that more than half of their work force are part-time workers with low wages."
The union is angry that 38,000 of the 46,000 union jobs the company has added over the past four years have been part-time jobs, which teamsters officials say do not pay enough to support a family. Full-time drivers average $19.95 an hour after two years. Part-time loaders average $9 and part-time sorters $10, with pay rising to about $11 after five years.
Mr. Carey argued that the company could easily transform thousands of part-time positions into full-time jobs because in an average week, some 10,000 part-time U.P.S. employees work at least 35 hours.
Mr. Kelly, the company's chairman, insisted that the union was blowing the part-time issue out of proportion. He said that many of the company's workers were college students or others who wanted to work part time and not full time.
He also defended the company's part-time jobs, contending that they were better than those at many other companies.
"We've created tens of thousands of jobs during the course of this last contract," Mr. Kelly said. "Some of them have been full-time jobs. Some of them have been part-time jobs. The part-time job at U.P.S. is a great job. The average wage is $11 an hour. They receive a full level of benefits. They have 25 paid days off."
The strikers welcomed Mr. Kelly's statement that the company did not plan to hire replacement workers. Such a move would have turned up the pressure on the strikers, but the company might have found it hard to replace 185,000 workers while the unemployment rate was so low.
"The last thing we want to do, the last thing I want to do, is replace U.P.S. workers," Mr. Kelly said. "We want the strike to end and we want them back on the job."

HEADLINE: U.S. Increasing Its Dependence On Oil Imports

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
American drivers are consuming record quantities of gasoline so far this year, with about half refined from imported oil.
Indeed, the nation's dependence on imported oil is also setting records as domestic production of oil slowly declines. 
 The prospect, oil industry experts say, is for all these trends to continue robustly, at least as long as the economy remains strong. But the heavy demand means that any sharp increase in gasoline prices would have an even bigger effect on the American economy.
The soaring gasoline consumption is driven by more than just the strong economy, though. A long period of relatively low oil and gasoline prices has led to a change in the types of vehicles on the roads: The cars and trucks reaching the junkyards this year have higher gasoline mileage, on average, than the new ones rolling off dealers' lots, for the first time on record. As a result, the introduction of new cars and trucks, which had previously helped conserve gasoline because of the vehicles' fuel efficiency, is now adding to the demand.
Because of that shift, and because an increase in the car population is swelling the total miles driven by 2 percent to 3 percent every year, gasoline consumption in June was the highest ever for that month. The same was true for May and will probably be true for July, although statistics for that month have not been reported.
Despite the increased consumption, the Government reported on Tuesday that gasoline prices on average have fallen by 7 cents a gallon since January and could drop more this year. According to the Energy Information Administration, the national average price of a gallon of regular unleaded self-serve gasoline was slightly more than $1.19 as of Aug. 4.
Oil imports, which account for about 50 percent of consumption, fill far more of Americans' petroleum needs than they did at the beginning of the first oil crisis in 1973, when they accounted for 36 percent of the oil supply. American production is declining because it is easier to obtain oil from other countries than from the dwindling reserves in the United States.
Imports reached more than 10 million barrels a day in April. They may decline when the peak summer driving season ends, but for the first half of the year they averaged 9.9 million barrels a day, according to the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's trade association. In contrast, imports were less than two-thirds as large, about six million barrels a day, in the last two oil crises, in 1973-74 and 1979, both of which provoked recessions because crude oil prices soared.
The rise in imported oil means that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- which was established after the first oil crisis as a hedge against future shortages -- is becoming a smaller and smaller shield. The reserve is not growing despite rising demand; indeed, it has shrunk several times after Congress voted to sell oil to help balance the budget.
While oil experts say that the United States is not vulnerable to a single country's cutting off supplies because oil comes from so many countries, the increase in fuel consumption means that any increase in gasoline prices most likely would have a bigger effect on the economy.
Behind the surge in demand for gasoline is a big change in consumption patterns. The Environmental Protection Agency recently estimated that over the lifetime of the vehicles in the 1996 model year, the mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles would together use more gasoline than the cars. If that trend continues, within a few years all the cars on the nation's roads will be consuming less than half the gasoline that is sold.
Two decades ago, Congress required that the average car get 27.5 miles a gallon, but mileage of the 1996 model year has declined to 24.6 miles a gallon because cars make up only 60 percent of the fleet.
"Back in 1975, when the statistics started, trucks were a 19 percent market share," said John M. DeCicco, a senior associate at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. "They felt it was such a small and insignificant part of the market, they would just leave it to the Department of Transportation" to set a standard.
But such light trucks, which include mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, have since doubled their share of the automotive market. At the same time, auto makers have persuaded Congress to bar the Transportation Department from raising the minimum fuel efficiency on light trucks, which is 20.7 miles a gallon.
In response to the oil shortages of the 1970's and the price spike of 1979-80 after the revolution in Iran, auto makers shifted their production to more-fuel-efficient vehicles. As a result, by the time oil prices crashed in 1986, these cars and trucks dominated the market, bringing the fleet's average gas mileage to its highest, 25.7 miles a gallon in 1986 and 25.9 miles a gallon in 1987 and 1988. Then it began falling again.
By 1994, 1995 and 1996, the fleet average for those model years had fallen to 24.6 miles a gallon, and E.P.A. experts say the number will be the same, or perhaps slightly lower, when the 1997 numbers are calculated later this year. For years, fleet economy improved because vehicles that got more than 20 miles a gallon were replacing the inefficient pre-1973 models that got less than 20. But most of those old cars have long since been junked, and those that remain are not used much.
The average car or light truck lasts about 12 years, so the vehicles leaving the fleet now are the ones from the mid- to late 1980's, which had the highest fuel efficiency.
And new vehicles are driven more than old ones, experts say, with multi-vehicle households taking the newer car or truck on the longer trips, so the least-fuel-efficient models are already racking up most of the miles.
With a booming economy, the demand is also strong for jet fuel. Diesel is in big demand, too, because of the economy and a shift to just-in-time manufacturing that has helped create a boom in trucking.
In the face of this rising demand, Congress and the Clinton Administration are debating about what to do with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was established after the Arab oil embargo of 1974 to cope with interruptions in supply. But the debate is not over whether to add to the reserve, which has not happened since 1994. Instead, the question is whether to continue draining some of the oil from the underground salt domes in Louisiana and Texas where it is stored and selling it to pay the reserve's operating costs. The Government has sold 28 million barrels in the last two years.
Earlier this year, the House of Representatives and the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to sell $200 million more worth of oil, or about 10 million barrels. But under the Federal budget agreement signed into law last week, no more oil will be sold, although Congress has still not resolved how to pay the reserve's operating costs.
Even without sales, the reserve is shrinking, as measured by the number of days of imports it could replace, because imports are on the rise. Measured that way, the reserve reached its peak in 1985, when it had 493 million barrels but was equal to 115 days. Now, at 566 million barrels, it equals 67 days. Federico F. Pena, the Secretary of Energy, told the Energy and Natural Resources committee in May that this would dwindle to 46 days by 2002.
In addition, the reserves are getting smaller relative to world oil production, which was 52 million barrels a day when the American reserve was established. Now production totals 74 million barrels a day and is expected to rise by 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day each year.
C. Kyle Simpson, senior policy adviser to Mr. Pena, said the reserve was no longer intended to physically replace oil that had been blocked by, say, another Middle East war. Rather, he said, an interruption anywhere in the global oil market would be followed by a worldwide price increase. Gas lines would not develop again in the United States, officials say, because prices would rise until demand adjusted to reduced supply.
But a sale from the reserve could push prices down again, experts inside and outside Government say, as was the case when President George Bush sold oil from the reserve in 1991 after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Mayor Extols the Benefits Of Tax-Free Shopping Week

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Making the most of an election-year gift from the Legislature, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ventured into the Manhattan Mall in Herald Square yesterday to announce the suspension of the sales tax on clothing purchases during the first week in September -- just in time for back-to-school shopping.
Taxes will not be charged Sept. 1-7 on individual clothing purchases under $100. Mr. Giuliani said the effort will help keep New Yorkers from shopping in Connecticut or New Jersey, where there is no sales tax on clothing. 
 Last month, the Legislature agreed to abolish the 4 percent state sales tax on clothing purchases of $100 or less beginning in 1999, after a persistent campaign by Mr. Giuliani. Legislators also agreed to allow two tax-free weeks for clothing sales: one this September -- two months before the mayoral election -- and another in September 1998.
The city held its first tax-free week in January, when clothing costing less than $500 was free of sales tax in much of New York State. Though Mr. Giuliani called the effort a resounding success, some economists said the impact of the experiment was likely to be more political than economic, with the Mayor benefiting the most.
All three Democratic mayoral candidates -- the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, City Councilman Sal Albanese and the Rev. Al Sharpton -- denounced the Mayor's attempt to shine the spotlight on his efforts yesterday, saying it was the lawmakers in Albany who made the actual decision.
Mr. Giuliani has waged a campaign against the unpopular 8.25 percent tax, which is made up of the 4 percent state tax, a 4 percent city tax and a one-quarter of 1 percent tax levied by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Appearing at the gleaming nine-story Manhattan Mall yesterday, Mr. Giuliani urged middle-class buyers to take advantage of the tax-free week.
"Traditionally this sales tax hits poor families hardest because they spend a large percentage of their incomes -- sometimes as high as 12 percent -- on clothes," he said. "As a result of our efforts in Albany, this sales-tax-exempt week will occur again next year and will become permanent on Dec. 1, 1999."
Appearing with the Mayor, Jack Perlman, a spokesman for Modell's Sporting Goods, said Modell's will try to make it easy for shoppers to determine which items are included in the exemption. The store will put signs above items that are exempt, he said, urging other stores to do the same.
The exemption applies to most clothing that is worn on the body, but there are exceptions that can be confusing: hair barrettes are taxable, for instance, but head scarves are not.
Mr. Giuliani said that he would work hard to get the message out about the tax-free shopping week, but he did not say how he would go about it.
During the tax-free week in January, Mr. Giuliani was criticized for using taxpayer dollars to take out radio and print advertisements encouraging people to shop. He defended the ads as a legitimate governmental effort to stimulate the city's economy.
In the weeks leading up to the next tax-exempt week, Mr. Giuliani said, "We'll figure out the best way to do it."

HEADLINE: Medicine Is Altering Tie To Government

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
When New York State announced last month that it had negotiated a $1.25 billion Federal aid package to help its hospitals and clinics make the adjustment to managed care, critics said an industry with intimate connections to the highest levels of state and local politics was being coddled once again.
In many ways, however, the aid package does not tell the story of a marriage, but of a breakup. Economists and health care experts say it reveals the cracks in an industry that is being forced to give up its decades-long dependence on planned, predictable, government-coordinated growth. The transition money, intended as a bridge into a new era of health care, will also hasten that transition, the experts say, undermining the old stability even as it clears the way for innovation. 
 New York medicine has often been compared to the subsidy-drenched agriculture industry: just as farmers are paid not to grow certain crops, medical schools in New York are paid not to train new doctors, to stave off a glut. A stark example of the industry's disconnection from market forces is the recession of the early 1990's: as much of the rest of the state's economy wilted, health care -- particularly in New York City -- was the only major industry to add jobs.
But the old system has had a tough time as big government's role has shrunk. In agribusiness, the retreat of subsidies has prompted farmers to experiment -- cotton farmers have planted corn and wild-rice growers have tried cranberries. In New York, the Medicaid adventure is likely to produce unforeseen spinoffs and experiments, too -- as well as some dead ends -- health experts and economists say.
The expected consequences of the Medicaid agreement are profound enough. It will shift 1.6 million people into managed care over the next three years, making it the largest such experiment in the nation. Health experts say that local neighborhood doctors' offices should increase in number as managed care takes hold, and that the job mix of the health industry will change; there will be fewer low-skilled workers in fields like hospital food service and more computer workers handling claims for health-maintenance organizations.
The stakes are enormous: New York takes in nearly one-sixth of the entire Federal Medicaid budget and educates one in five of the nation's doctors and dentists. Across the state in 1996, more than 1 in 11 jobs was in private health care, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1995 said that the New York metropolitan region had a higher dependence on health care business -- about one in eight jobs -- than Boston, Chicago, Houston or Los Angeles. Statewide, the health care system was by far the largest employer last year, with 741,000 employees of private businesses alone.
Jarring changes certainly have been occurring in New York health care for years, as hospital consolidations, cost-cutting pressures and a competitive price setting structure for hospitals -- established earlier this year -- have shaken many of the old patterns.
The Medicaid agreement is expected to accelerate the pace of change sharply. This is partly because it is in the care of the poor that New York has been most generous to hospitals, and because a huge new enrollment in managed care will greatly expand the power of the managed care companies to press doctors and hospitals to cut costs.
Health care economists say managed care commonly moves the location of treatment away from hospitals and hospital-based clinics to local doctors' offices. The $1.25 billion in transition money is directly aimed at helping hospitals establish those off-site offices and train people to work in them. But James R. Tallon Jr., the president of the United Hospital Fund, a 118-year-old research and philanthropic organization, said that local neighborhood medical care had never been a tradition in New York, especially in poor areas.
For generations, beginning well before the social programs of the New Deal, health care for the indigent in New York has been based around institutions rather than doctors, Mr. Tallon said. When Medicaid was created, it solidified and codified a hospital-based system that was already deeply embedded. How the essentially suburban-bred system of managed care is to be grafted onto those old systems and traditions will be an exploration in itself, Mr. Tallon said.
New York's next recession is also likely to be different in the new era. Whenever the next downturn occurs, and whatever its severity, the health care industry's stalwart stability of years past may not be as bankable as it once was.
"Is health care still the ace in the hole for New York?" said Howard S. Berliner, a professor of health policy at the New School for Social Research. "The answer, I think, is probably not."
Professor Berliner said the main economic effect of Medicaid's shift to managed care would be felt in the job market. Health care will still be a large employer with a large economic presence, he said, but as a mass employer of people on the lower economic rungs -- low-wage, low-skill workers in 24-hour hospitals -- its best days are probably already a memory. Demand for such workers, Professor Berliner said, will decline along with the length of hospital stays and the shift to outpatient treatment. Jobs under managed care generally require better education and communication skills, he said.
Countering those fears somewhat is the fact that despite the Medicaid agreement, much of the state's stable old government medical system remains firmly in place. Of the $24 billion in combined Federal, state and local Medicaid money that is spent in New York each year, 40 percent will not be affected at all. That untouched sector is also one in which New York has been particularly tenacious and successful in getting matching Federal Medicaid dollars -- for services like long-term and psychiatric care.
And that sector could, in fact, grow. Health experts say that while managed care tends to shorten hospital stays for acute care, it often increases the demand for long-term care and rehabilitation. What the shift to managed care takes away with one hand may thus be given back by the other.
"There are going to be winners and losers," said Mr. Tallon at the United Hospital Fund. "Long-term is going to get bigger."
Federal aid to New York will also increase in a little-noticed health program called Home Relief, which serves about 370,000 poor people around the state. New York was able to negotiate a provision that will bring Home Relief, for the first time, under Medicaid and its provision for Federal matching funds. It will save New York State money, but Federal health care spending, at least in the short term, will go up.
New York State health officials say that New York has always received more of the Federal Medicaid budget because the state has been willing to spend more itself, under the 50-50 matching formula: spend a state dollar and you get an additional Federal dollar. How the state got $1.25 billion in transition money -- something none of the 13 states that have received approval for Medicaid managed care were able to get -- shows how much more there is to the story than that.
The largest union representing hospital workers, 1199, which is closely connected to the national Democratic Party, and the Greater New York Hospital Association, which has ties to the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki, coordinated to lead the charge. The union's president, Dennis Rivera, worked on Vice President Al Gore. The head of the hospital association, Kenneth Raske, worked on Albany. The argument was always the same, state officials said: In New York, health care means more than just medical treatment.
The State Health Commissioner, Barbara DeBuono, said that other states could perhaps afford not to calculate economic consequences, but in New York, she said, everyone does.
"Unlike a lot of states, we had to think about the consequences on the hospital industry," she said. "We're all just sort of feeding on each other -- it's a big, big business."

The $68 billion budget approved by the New York State Legislature last week is crammed with special-interest items benefiting one regional interest or another at the expense of broader considerations. One such item authorizes $130 million for the design and construction of a new 1,500-bed maximum-security prison for violent offenders, smack dab in a valuable wilderness area of the Adirondacks.
There are several things to say about a proposal to quarantine murderers and rapists inside Adirondack Park, only one of them good. It would obviously bring new jobs to the northern town of Tupper Lake, a once-vibrant mill town that, like many poor Adirondack villages, needs an economic transfusion. That is why Ron Stafford, the State Senator who has long exercised almost total control over most legislation affecting the Adirondacks, worked so hard for this provision. The prison would be built in his district and would create, his staff says, between 400 and 600 jobs. 
 As is almost always the case in Albany, however, there were no public hearings on the idea and no attempts to reach out to environmentalists, planners and economists to see if there were better ways of increasing Tupper Lake's tax base or more benign sites to choose. Nor was there any public examination of whether the prison would damage the region's wilderness value.
Tupper Lake -- which already has a large state facility for retarded children -- is located in the northwest section of the park, known as the "Northwest Frontier." It is surrounded by large tracts of privately owned back country, which contain some of the most spectacular rivers and lakes in the park. If the state ever approves a plan to reintroduce the Eastern timber wolf to the Adirondacks, the Northwest Frontier is one place the wolves would go, in part because it replicates their original habitat.
More broadly, the prison proposal is yet another instance of the state's piecemeal, blinkered approach to the park as a whole. In his State of the State address last year, Gov. George Pataki promised to bring together local citizens, politicians and environmentalists to develop a comprehensive strategy to satisfy the economic needs of local residents without undermining what is still a largely unspoiled environment. That was precisely the approach he took to New York City's watershed. But so far there is no plan for the Adirondacks, just isolated initiatives that seem to come from nowhere, like the prison.
The prison proposal must still clear a few hurdles. The state's Department of Correctional Services must certify that the prison is in fact needed to house the state's violent offenders, and the State Comptroller, Carl McCall, must sign off on any spending contracts associated with the prison. But if the prison does go forward, it is crucial that Governor Pataki intervene to insure that it is sited in a way that does minimum damage to the town and the surrounding area.
In a jab at the environmental community, Mr. Stafford said that "reason and understanding" rather than "elitist arrogance" should prevail on the prison question. Fair enough, but so far environmentalists have had no real chance to sit down and reason with Mr. Stafford.

HEADLINE: Philosophies Differ on Future of Socrates Sculpture Park

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
In a Queens neighborhood of abandoned warehouses and scampering rats, Socrates Sculpture Park rises as a kind of crazy vision, a surreal space where gigantic contortions of steel, stone, wood and plastic sprout.
A caterpillar made from the yellow fenders of old taxicabs appears to squirm on the patchy grass. An array of logs forms a monumental bouquet. Immense steel beams seem almost ethereal in a work by the sculptor Mark di Suvero. Hundreds of mirrors transform an ordinary chain-link fence into an optical extravaganza. 
 But if artists supply the wonder, it is the location of this patch of city-owned land -- on the edge of the East River in Astoria, facing Manhattan's jagged, imperial skyline -- that makes for the majesty. This is at least a million-dollar view. In fact, it is a $100 million view, according to a neighborhood boy made good who is the latest in a long chain of developers trying to claim it.
And so, everything has come down to this: Can New York afford the luxury of allowing a bunch of messy, however inspired sculptors to claim a prime slice of municipal real estate, a place whose development might spur the economy of a dilapidated waterfront?
Angelo Joseph Acquista, a doctor and investor, has been making the rounds of Queens bureaucrats, the City Council and the local community board to propose investing $100 million to build 300 enormous apartments (with balconies), a large catering hall and a marina where wealthy Manhattanites would keep boats that could be delivered minutes after being requested. "This may be a way to bring a little bit of Manhattan into Queens," he said.
The doctor's proposal has gained momentum in part because he has enlisted one of his patients, former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, to help by visiting politicians and organizing financing, though official requests for zoning variances and environmental clearance have yet to be made. Mr. Carey is also furnishing his signature rhetorical flourish, trumpeting the proposed development as "the Queens equivalent of Sag Harbor."
Dr. Acquista, whose parents still live a few blocks from the park, recalls playing on a pier that used to be on the site, and swimming in long-gone floating swimming pools off to one side. He promises to restore these, as well as to offer the public more usable, and certainly more elegantly landscaped, parkland than Socrates provides. And yes, he said, he is eager to display large sculpture -- though he draws the line at allowing artists to fabricate pieces on site.
For many, that alone would be an incalculable loss. The Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, characterized "a set of sculptures in a condo courtyard" as a "sorry substitute" for the park cum outdoor studio.
More than 200 pieces of sculpture have already been created at Socrates in full view of the public. A sculptor working there now, John Clement, spoke of working to the point of exhaustion and suddenly being refreshed by a fresh breeze, or welding in the falling snow. And Tadashi Hashimoto, another sculptor, suggested that the garden possessed "an intangible energy."
That may come from the energy that went into creating a sculpture garden at such an unlikely spot, along a dip in the Queens coastline known as Hallett's Cove, at the treacherous juncture of the East and Harlem Rivers.
But Mr. di Suvero's studio is to the north of what became the park, and just to the south was the late sculptor Isamu Noguchi's studio, now a museum. In the 1980's, the area was a prime site of illegal dumping; there was no fence, and broken steel and abandoned cars defined the landscape. Mr. di Suvero and Mr. Noguchi looked at the garbage and envisioned a protected park that could provide an "ongoing experimental narrative" in the medium of sculpture.
The city agreed to let the sculptors use the land, but only temporarily. Hundreds of neighborhood volunteers pitched in to clean out truckloads of trash. After a year's work, the first exhibit was held in 1986. Since then, there have been two shows of 20 or so pieces a year. Children's education classes, lectures, tours and concerts have also been offered.
Mr. di Suvero and others continued to push for more permanent protection for the park, because developers for years had hungered to build luxury housing there but had been defeated by real estate recessions, lack of local amenities, distant transportation and other problems.
In 1993, the city agreed to make Socrates a park for five years. Though the deal can be unilaterally revoked by the city with one month's notice, the artists saw it as a major step toward securing the park's future. And Mr. di Suvero hopes that City Hall will side with him, if the development plan creates the kind of zoning debate that make political hay. In May, before Dr. Acquista began circulating his plan, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wrote a note to those gathered for the opening of this summer's show. "I wish you the very best," the Mayor wrote, "and hope that you will continue your work for many years to come."
It may take a fight to decide who has rights to what. At the time Socrates was dedicated as a city park in 1994, Mr. di Suvero said that the city had wanted to develop the site, but "we fought nip and tuck to save it." But some insist that the park was never "saved" and had been only for temporary use until full-scale development could proceed.
"The problem is di Suvero has become entrenched," said George Delis, district manager of Community Board 1 and a strong proponent of development. "The problem is how to get rid of him."
It will not be easy. In a written message from Paris, where he is installing an exhibition of his work, Mr. di Suvero said he was deeply disturbed by anything that would threaten Socrates. "We hope to fly the Parks Department flag here forever," he said of the park.
The Parks Commissioner hopes so, too. "Socrates is a thriving park that has brought great sculpture to Queens," Mr. Stern said. "They should not be dispossessed."
Dr. Acquista says he will not proceed if his development proposal does not draw wholehearted support. "If the community doesn't support us, we have no business there," he said.
Walter L. McCaffrey, the City Council member who represents the area, said he was not convinced that Dr. Acquista would be any more successful than others who have tried and failed in the past. He pointed out that the area is home to several public housing projects, drug rehabilitation centers and homes for the mentally ill, as well as being a haunt of prostitutes. It is also nine blocks from the nearest subway station, and it is in one of the city's most overcrowded school districts, he said.
Instead, Mr. McCaffrey favors more development 20 blocks to the south, in Hunters Point, where the city has spent more than $30 million on sewers and other infrastructure and only one building of a planned luxury complex has so far been built.
Of the new development proposal, Mr. McCaffrey said, "It lacks substance."
Of Socrates, he said, "It's a world-class attraction."

HEADLINE: Behind a Bronx Council Primary, a 1998 Congressional Primary Warms Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Since his election to the City Council six years ago, Lawrence A. Warden has developed an image as a courtly, soft-spoken official who rarely stirs the political waters.
But as the Sept. 9 Democratic primary approaches, Mr. Warden is becoming considerably more combative. That's because he is not just campaigning for his position representing the Wakefield and Co-op City sections of the Bronx. Instead, the battle in the 12th Council District is widely viewed as a surrogate for next year's Congressional primary. 
 Mr. Warden's challenger, Shirley Saunders, a Democratic district leader, is an aide to Representative Eliot L. Engel, and Mr. Engel is backing her with uncharacteristic vigor. At the same time, Lawrence B. Seabrook, a State Senator who has made no secret of his interest in running against Mr. Engel in the Democratic primary next year, is Mr. Warden's campaign manager.
"The Congressman has clearly put up his staff member to challenge me because he feels that Larry Seabrook is going to be a candidate against him," Mr. Warden said. "He feels that if he hurts me politically, he will hurt Larry Seabrook politically too."
Or, as Mr. Seabrook put it: "This is an unusual stance for the Congressman, to take such an interest in a Council race. But I have all the intent to run for Congress. And I think that is what's behind Shirley Saunders's candidacy."
Ms. Saunders insists that Mr. Engel's political future played no role in her decision to run for City Council. "It has nothing to do with my decision to run," she said. She added that she had wanted to run for the seat four years ago, but had decided her timing was not right.
"Of course," she said, "whoever wins would boost the person who supported him or her. But I ran because I thought I could be a more effective Council member than Larry Warden."
Ms. Saunders describes Mr. Warden as an ineffective member of the Council who has been less than independent. She says he supported the construction of a large shopping mall in the district, adding that many residents oppose any such development. "He simply is out of touch with the people," she said.
Mr. Warden, 53, says that many of the initiatives he has supported on the Council have led to enhanced economic development in the district, and that he supports the development of a mall only if it is tied to jobs for people in the district. And he described his opponent as the political puppet of Congressman Engel.
Despite the assistance of Mr. Engel, Ms. Saunders, 50, said recently that she felt her campaign was an uphill one. "People have a tendency not to take you seriously unless they can see you," she said. "And I am working to be seen; to get my name out there. I have been very active in the community. But I hope the Congressman will do everything he can to give me entree to those areas where I'm not well known."
The primary is expected to be hard fought. Four years ago, Mr. Warden won the Democratic primary with only 48 percent of the vote in a three-way race in which his closest competitor, Samuel Burke, received 42 percent of the vote. And this year, he is fighting against the resources and prestige of Congressman Engel.
While Mr. Warden has the support of the Bronx Democratic organization, many politicians in the borough question how vigorous that support will be, since Mr. Warden and Mr. Seabrook have often been at odds with the organization, and at one point a few years ago, even joined in a dissident Democratic faction.
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic chairman, insists that the organization is supplying "whatever help we can possibly provide to the Councilman."
"We think he has been a good Councilman," Mr. Ramirez said, "and we like to avoid bruising primaries. I have let the Congressman know that, too."
Mr. Engel said that Ms. Saunders's candidacy should not be viewed as being linked with his. "People are going to vote for me or not vote for me next year based on the perceptions of the job I'm doing," Mr. Engel said. "That has nothing to do with Shirley Saunders. Some people might look at me putting her up to that. But that would be an insult to her."
In the last few weeks, Mr. Engel has made frequent campaign appearances with Ms. Saunders and says he plans more. She said she would probably spend more than $40,000 on the race. Mr. Warden, when asked how much he planned to spend, said "as much as it takes, because I intend to win."
The battle has already become intense. Ms. Saunders has accused the Councilman of fraud, charging in a lawsuit that a person who collected nominating signatures for Mr. Warden actually lives in New Jersey. Mr. Warden said that his petition collector is a bona fide, rent-paying tenant in a Bronx home owned by Mr. Warden's wife. "It's a frivolous lawsuit, nothing more than a fishing expedition," he said. A ruling is expected in State Supreme Court in the Bronx later this week.
Mr. Warden, normally not known for outspokenness, contends that he is eager to wage a political fight that he views as a test of strength between the two sides.
"I want to beat her in the streets," Mr. Warden said. "This will show the Congressman the level of support I have and the real mood of the community. This way, he will see what happens when the people speak."

HEADLINE: Apple Sending Clone Makers Mixed Signals

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
With all the momentous announcements at last week's MacWorld Expo trade show, Apple Computer executives were nearly silent on an issue of strategic importance to the future of the troubled company: Whether Apple would continue to license the Macintosh operating system to makers of lower-priced Mac clones.
The absence of any straight answers is fueling speculation that Apple executives -- starting, apparently, with Steven P. Jobs, the company's co-founder -- seem to think the clones do Apple more harm than good. Clone sales now account for one of every five Macintosh computers sold. 
 At the show, Mr. Jobs said nothing about Apple's licensing plans. But at a news conference later in the week, Apple's chief financial officer, Fred Anderson, told reporters that Apple would not prolong its licensing agreements unless clone makers demonstrated a commitment to expanding the Macintosh market.
In other words, analysts say, the clone makers would need to concentrate on Apple's weakest markets, like low-end consumer machines and certain geographic areas, and leave the higher-margin markets to Apple.
"This could mean significant trouble," said James Staten, an analyst at Dataquest Inc., a market research company in San Jose, Calif. "We're not getting the signal that Apple is willing to bargain."
It is not a message clone makers are eager to hear. To the contrary, they have been angling to increase the breadth of their offerings, not narrow them. Umax, for example, would like to sell clone notebook computers, and all the companies are eager to start selling machines based on the Common Hardware Reference Platform announced nearly three years ago by I.B.M. and Apple. CHRP is significant because it will allow customers to run both Macintosh software and software written to run on Microsoft Windows on the same machines.
And nearly every one of them already sells machines that compete with Apple at the high end of the market, where the profits are greatest. At the show, Power Computing, the leading clone maker with nearly a 10 percent share of all Macintosh computers sold, announced one of the highest-performing clone machines yet.
Apple's unwillingness to endorse extension of the licensing agreements right now can be easily understood in light of sales statistics. The market for Macintosh computers was roughly $900 million in revenues in the first quarter of 1995 -- the last period in which Apple had 100 percent of the Macintosh market.
Today, that market is worth $796.6 million (as of the second quarter of 1997), with Apple accounting for about 80 percent.
The licensing debate is occurring in two arenas. At issue in the short term is whether the clone makers' current contracts with Apple include the latest version of the Macintosh operating system, called OS 8, which became available late last month. Industry analysts say Apple is stalling as it scurries to reassemble its own management, and some speculate that the company overstated the advances in OS 8, positioning it as a major revision of the Mac operating system in order to argue that it falls outside current contracts.
The clone makers, a group that includes Motorola, Umax Computer Systems and a start-up, Power Computing, believe their current contracts with Apple include OS 8.
The second area open to question is whether Apple will allow the clone makers to sell Rhapsody, Apple's radical overhaul of the Macintosh operating system. Rhapsody is based on software Apple acquired when it bought Mr. Jobs's company, Next Software Inc. Also in question is when Apple is going to supply them with the technology they need to build machines based on CHRP.
Clearly, the clone makers have cause to worry. "If Apple is entertaining reversing its policy on licensing, it could be disastrous," said Mike Rosenfelt, director of marketing at Power Computing, based in Round Rock, Tex. Hedging its bets, Power Computing recently announced it would sell machines running Microsoft Windows and powered by Intel microprocessors.
"We have no confirmation from Apple there is any change," said Phil Pompa, vice president of marketing for Umax, whose American offices are in San Jose, Calif. "But if the rumors turned out to be true, we'd be worried about our ongoing business."
Rather than abandoning its licensing practices altogether, however, Apple could adopt a tiered licensing schedule, where it charges more for machines sold in the high end of the market. Still, depending on the fee, that structure could also have dire effects for some cloners, though it may help Apple reach a balancing point it can live with.
But negotiations are sensitive for another reason: I.B.M., which licenses the Macintosh operating system from Apple to supply to several other clone makers, is only one of two suppliers of the Power PC chip that serves as the engine for all Macintoshes sold today. The other is Motorola. If the current rift is left to fester much longer, I.B.M. could choose to stop selling chips to Apple, analysts say.
The possibility that Apple will reverse its clone strategy comes at a defining moment in the market, as clone makers start preparing machines based on the CHRP specification. Motorola showed a prototype CHRP machine that it hoped to start selling in September. The machine features a parallel port for connecting PC peripherals, a first for a Mac, and can be configured to run either OS 8 or Microsoft's Windows NT.
But Apple may already be seeing an upswing in its sales against clones. In the second quarter, clone sales accounted for 20 percent of all Mac hardware sales, down from 30 percent in the first quarter, according to Dataquest. Mr. Staten, the Dataquest analyst, said the surge was a result of Apple's release of new Macs in the second quarter that were more competitive in both price and performance with clones.
At the consumer end of the market, for example, Apple's Power Mac 6500 now costs only about $100 more than a Power Base 200, which is priced at $1,300.
For their part, the clone makers said Apple's apprehensions about the impact of clones were misplaced. "Apple is more competitive because of licensing," Mr. Rosenfelt said. "People want choice."
But in the meantime, there appears to be some movement. Just two weeks ago, executives from Umax said that Apple executives had conceded that the current contract between the two companies did indeed permit Umax to sell Mac OS 8, though they said nothing about Rhapsody or CHRP. But other clone makers said Apple was keeping them in the dark about whether they could do the same.
And Umax executives said the company was still waiting to receive the new software, which Apple was late in delivering.
"The last 30 days, there has been a vacuum of information," Mr. Rosenfelt said. "We're simply looking for clarity."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Rose 38.9% in June

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
United States orders for machine tools rose 38.9 percent in June from the month before, aided by a strong increase in orders from the South, according to an industry survey.
Orders from American companies for domestic and foreign-produced machine tools climbed to an estimated $894 million in June from a revised $644 million in May, according to a joint report from the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association. 
 June's gain, the fourth rise in the last five months, brought the total level of orders in the first half of the year up 19.7 percent, to $4.4 billion. While orders from the South accounted for the bulk of June's increase, orders also rose across most of the country, declining only in the West.
Initially, the industry groups reported that estimated orders fell 16.4 percent in May, to $678 million. Orders totaled an estimated $811 million in April.
Compared with June 1996, estimated orders for machine tools -- which are used to shape and assemble metal in products from diesel engines to dishwashers -- were up 81.3 percent.
The machine tools report -- which analysts watch to gauge industrial output, consumer demand and business investment -- is in line with a recent Government report on overall orders to United States factories for durable goods, a broader category than machine tool orders.

HEADLINE: Hey, Who Took the Office Doors?;
Rethinking Privacy vs. Teamwork in Today's Workplace

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Bill Rouady, a 32-year-old software programmer, speaks of his craft in the accepted vernacular of modern business. Teamwork, cooperation and shared knowledge, he explains, are essential ingredients of success.
This open style of work, insists Mr. Rouady, an employee of Netscape Communications, is best done in an open setting -- where workers are separated only by low partitions instead of being walled off behind closed doors in individual offices. "The programming code we write has to work together seamlessly so we should work together seamlessly as well," he said. 
 In corporate America as a whole, these are mainstream views. But in the high-technology world, from Silicon Valley to Seattle, Mr. Rouady's comments are fighting words. It is a contentious issue, with beliefs fervently held on both sides. Pick your workplace: open plan or enclosed office. Put bluntly, cube versus cave.
It is the issue that splits the computer industry's most powerful partnership, the so-called Wintel duopoly, named for Microsoft's Windows software and Intel's microchips.
Intel is unflinchingly cubist, a stance the company adopted shortly after its founding in 1968. The open-plan layout was embraced in the name of teamwork and egalitarian values, as an explicit rejection of the old-line hierarchy associated with East Coast corporations. Intel has no executive dining rooms, no reserved parking places and no exceptions to the cubes-for-all policy. Because of growth, the crowding at the company's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters has increased, so cube sizes have shrunk recently, including the one occupied by Andrew Grove, Intel's chairman and chief executive.
"It was done to maintain the consistency of egalitarian standards," said Patricia Murray, vice president for human resources. "If the rank and file has to do with less temporarily, so do the executives. There's no mahogany row at Intel."
Microsoft's corporate campus in suburban Seattle is inhabited by unrepentant cave dwellers. The company's private-office bias stems from the belief of its founders, William H. Gates and Paul Allen, that software programmers work best in the solitude of individual offices. No one has disagreed since.
"Every time we revisit the issue of having open-plan offices, it is roundly rejected," said Nick MacPhee, the general manager of real estate and facilities. "The reaction borders between horror and hysteria."
Yet the open-plan office -- ranging from Mr. Rouady's quirky digs, spanned by a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge built with soda cans, to the look-alike cubicles satirized in Dilbert cartoons -- continues to march through corporate America. An estimated 40 million Americans, nearly 60 percent of the white-collar work force, now work in cubes.
The cubist ranks are growing, according to surveys by the International Facility Management Association, a trade group for office planners and designers. And one of the bastions of closed-office culture, I.B.M., will fall next month when it opens its new headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., which is more than 90 percent open-plan.
Offices of all kinds are shrinking. The Facility Performance Group, a research firm, says personal work space has shrunk 25 percent to 50 percent over the last decade at 72 big, trend-setting companies it has studied. The office downsizing is partly a matter of belt-tightening. But most of these companies have also gone through "re-engineering" programs intended to replace traditional hierarchies with teamwork in the pursuit of greater innovation, speed and profits.
A shift to open-plan offices is often part of the re-engineering formula. With the cubes come more team meeting rooms, so personal space is sacrificed. Cubists insist their approach is a winner. "All the accepted research in this field says you have to have more visual and acoustic openness to get the benefits of a team-based organization," said Jon Ryburg, president of the Facility Performance Group in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Perhaps true for an auto maker or an insurance company, reply the cave dwellers. But a different set of work space principles, the cavers say, prevail on the frontiers of the new economy.
"People who have to think deeply, like programmers, need individual offices," said Eric Schmidt, the former chief technology officer for Sun Microsystems, who recently became chairman of Novell, a software company. "The best and the brightest drive this industry and the high-tech economy. Giving them an office to be more productive is a smart investment."
This is the cavers trump card: software programmers are special people who do special work. They must cooperate with others at times, but theirs is essentially individual labor -- hours of painstaking tedium punctuated by flashes of inspiration, all rendered in the arcane language of machines.
People who study how programmers work speak of cognitive "flow," the code cowboy's equivalent of an athlete being in a peak-performance "zone" when everything seems to work. Deep concentration helps the code flow and that mental state, many programmers believe, is easier to attain in a private office.
Sun Microsystems, a work station producer and creator of the Internet's Java programming language, has 75 percent private offices at its corporate campus in Mountain View, Calif. Both hardware and software engineers, the company says, prefer private offices. Besides, they add, private offices proved a recruiting advantage during Silicon Valley's earlier boom in the late 1980's. Sun had just expanded, building many private offices -- a lure for many job candidates.
Apple Computer, bowing to the preferences of its staff, gave each of its researchers and product designers an individual office when the company opened a new research and development complex in 1993. The leading desktop publishing software company, Adobe Systems, switched from 40 percent private offices to more than 95 percent last fall when it moved into new headquarters in San Jose, Calif. The goal is to give the company's engineers the luxury of solitude and a "more focused environment," seeking to increase productivity, according to Joseph Chen, Adobe's facilities operations manager.
The man who introduced the open-plan office to America in the 1960's, Robert Propst, is depressed by the spread of cubes across the modern corporate landscape. As a consultant to Herman Miller, the office furniture maker, Mr. Propst championed his pioneering Action Office as a way, he says now, to "give knowledge workers a more flexible, fluid environment than the rat-maze boxes of offices."
His concept got lost as companies embraced open-plan offices mainly as a cost-saving tactic, laments Mr. Propst, 76, a consultant in suburban Seattle. "The cubiclizing of people in modern corporations is monolithic insanity," he said.
On both sides of the cave-cube divide, there is some evidence of a softening of positions. Eric Richert, director of workplace effectiveness at a private-office stronghold, Sun Microsystems, is participating in an office-sharing experiment to open up more team-meeting space. "We're trying not to take a religious approach to the workspace issue," he said.
At Netscape, an open-plan company, Kandis Malefyt, senior vice president for people, says the company is pleased so far with its cubist setting. It is, she says, a flexible, egalitarian environment that suggests trust among company workers. "But we have long debates about what the working environment should be," Ms. Malefyt said. "This is our decision for now, but it could change.
The wave of the future, experts agree, is moving beyond the cave-cube schism to tailor the physical conditions of workers to the work being done. Researchers at the big office furniture companies -- Steelcase, Haworth and Herman Miller -- speak in terms of "cognitive ergonomics" (matching the office to the brain work) and of the importance of "memory extensions" (like Post-It notes).
The high-technology companies, in particular, are now talking less about offices and cubes, and instead focusing first on "work process" and "work practice," according to Rick Robinson, principal of E-Lab, a research firm in Chicago.
The alt.office gathering this week in San Jose is a conference and exposition dedicated to "alternative work environments." One of the conference speakers, Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, said, "Work is changing so rapidly and becoming so diverse, there is no one way to do an office anymore."
Yet even enlightened thinkers on the workspace issue tend to bring some firmly held views to the discussion. Pressed a bit, Mr. Saffo observed, "Whether they admit it or not, people want their own office, not a cube."
Another speaker at the San Jose conference owes the cube a considerable debt. "Living in cubicle hell for 17 years was the single biggest factor in making me unhappy in my work," Scott Adams said. That unhappiness, of course, led Mr. Adams to escape into a flourishing career as the nation's leading cube basher and the creator of Dilbert.

Chart: "Office Gossip: Which Is Better?"
Is your office acube in a large communal space or a cavethat affords privacy? Proponents of each hold strong views about which is best-suited for doing business. Here are some arguments for each style.
 
CAVE
 Productivity -- Real work requires real thinking. And an office is the place to think.
 Communication -- If you want to talk to someone, you can go find the person. Or try the phone or E-mail.
 Status -- An office and a door says you're someone special.
 Corporate Culture -- We respect an individual's privacy.
 Design -- A person's office is his or her castle, as tasteful or tacky as its occupant.
 Socializing -- Great for gossiping and intimate conversations.
 
CUBE
 Productivity -- Offices are for wimps. Even Intel's Andy ("Only the Paranoid Survive") Grove works in a cube.
 Communication -- A real advantage for cubes. Just stand up and wave your hands to attract attention. Or shout.
 Status -- Anybody who needs an office for status is pathetic.
 Corporate Culture -- We have a culture of trust and our workers actually like each other.
 Design -- Workers must respect the sensibilities of others, but also allow for group design projects.
 Socializing -- Great for overhearing gossip fodder. It's the 90's: no intimate chat on company time.

First Targets Are Seen For Line-Item Veto
President Clinton has decided to exercise his line-item veto authority for the first time, striking out at least one narrow tax break and one spending measure from the balanced-budget and tax-cut legislation he signed last week. 
 Congressional officials have said the likely candidates for vetoes -- which could be overridden by Congress -- are a part of the change in the Medicaid program and a provision that would allow the deferral of taxes for the sale of a food-processing plant to farmers' cooperatives. [Page A1.]
 
Groups to Challenge Wiretap Plans
Privacy advocates plan to challenge the F.B.I.'s plan for high-technology wiretapping, contending that the agency is seeking new powers never intended by Congress when it enacted a 1994 law to bring wiretapping into the digital age. [D2.]
 
Oil Use at Record Levels
American drivers are consuming record quantities of gasoline this year, and the nation's dependence on imported oil is also setting records as domestic production slowly declines. [A1.]
 
Intervention Sought in Strike
Officials at the United Parcel Service stepped up their calls for President Clinton to intervene to end the teamsters' strike, but Administration officials said he was leaning strongly against doing so. [A13.]
 
In Anti-Corruption Push, Results
The first fruits of a new policy by the World Bank and the I.M.F. to use their leverage with poorer nations to try to stamp out corruption and promote better governance are starting to become visible. [A4.]
 
High-Technology Turnstile Jumpers
The thousand or so hackers gathered at a conference in Manhattan had a new dream target: the Metrocard, and the $700 million computer system that transit officials installed to make it work. [A1.]
 
Museums' Caution About the Web
The rise of the Internet has forced museum directors to grapple with an old problem in a new universe. In cyberspace, it is unclear how best to balance their twin missions of making art available to the public and protecting the value and integrity of the art. [D5.]
 
Clouds Over E.D.S.'s Future
After Electronic Data Systems reported a disappointing outlook for earnings, analysts have been raising questions about the company's direction. Market Place. [D4.]
 
HarperCollins's Challenge
After deep cost cuts, HarperCollins is faced with the task of convincing agents and authors that its commitment to the future is truly nonfiction. Publishing. [D9.]
 
Transformation in Music Charting
In only six years, Soundscan has drastically changed the music charting system, and by extension, altered the way the recording industry does business. [D5.]
 
Yamaichi Executives to Step Down
Yamaichi Securities said it would appoint a new president and chairman as part of a leadership change as authorities investigate the brokerage firm in a racketeer payoff scandal. The company said its 11 directors, including the chairman, Tsugio Yukihira, and president, Atsuo Miki, would step down. [D2.]
 
Shift on Nuclear Policy
The Energy Department, its own big nuclear reactors broken down irreparably, is preparing to borrow space in a civilian power plant to manufacture tritium for nuclear weapons. The plan would break a taboo that has existed since the beginning of the atomic age: that civilian reactors are not to be put to military uses. [A10.]

HEADLINE: Workers Shouldn't Pay Price for Needing 2 Jobs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "High Stakes for Two Titans" (front page, Aug. 5), about the United Parcel Service strike: Given the flexibility part-time workers afford our economy, it would be foolish to reduce their number. But if corporate America needs part-time workers, it isn't showing it by paying them less than half what their full-time counterparts earn. The logical solution is to raise the wages and benefits of part-time workers. 
 More than ever, workers have more than one job in a lifetime, or even a day. Labor legislation should be updated; someone who works full hours divided between two or more companies shouldn't earn less than his counterpart working in only one.

HEADLINE: Workers Shouldn't Pay Price for Needing 2 Jobs;
Involuntary Part-Timers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Behind the Teamsters Strike" (editorial, Aug. 7) claims that spokesmen for the teamsters' union overstated the importance of part-time work for workers and the American economy. Although it is true that the percentage of the work force working part time has risen only 2 percent in 27 years, this figure disguises the disturbing aspect of part-time labor. 
 Ninety percent of that 2 percent represents a rise in "involuntary" part-time work. Voluntary part-time work as a share of total employment has grown only 0.3 percent since 1970. This substantial growth in involuntary part-time employment is causing total part-time employment to grow faster than total full-time employment.
The weekly hours of part-time workers are growing faster than the weekly hours of full-time workers. So part-timers, who traditionally receive lower wages and inferior benefits packages, are being asked to pick up the slack when business conditions demand longer hours.
A Cornell University study on part-time work and turnover at United Parcel Service found that 30 percent of part-time workers who left the company said their primary reason for doing so was the lack of full-time jobs. U.P.S. policy is representative of a national trend of escalating involuntary part-time employment.

HEADLINE: 2 Global Lenders Use Leverage to Combat Corruption

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
At their last annual meeting for the world's finance ministers, the World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, and the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, announced that for the first time they would use their leverage with poorer nations to stamp out corruption and to promote better governance.
As the finance ministers prepare to gather in Hong Kong next month for the next annual meeting, the first fruits of that new policy are starting to become visible. 
 This month the Monetary Fund sent the Kenya shilling and the Nairobi stock market into a tailspin. It suspended a $220 million loan to Kenya after President Daniel arap Moi failed to create the powerful new anticorruption authority the fund had demanded and to reinstate Samuel Chebii, who had been dismissed as Commissioner for Customs and Excise. Mr. Chebii had earned a formidable reputation for combating graft, to the Government's evident discomfort.
At the same time, the fund's executive board, which represents its member governments, formally agreed that all such assistance to third-world countries can be suspended as a matter of course in the future if government corruption is found to be having an adverse effect on a nation's economic development.
The World Bank uses the faith and credit of its member countries to borrow inexpensively on financial markets and lends that money to poorer nations. The fund makes loans to distressed governments provided that they adopt policies it favors.
While the fund said it was not changing its traditional view that reducing inflation, controlling Government spending and promoting "macroeconomic stability" remain the principal keys to growth, it made clear that it would put increased emphasis on fighting corruption and promoting better governance in countries it aids.
Financial assistance "could be suspended or delayed on account of poor governance, if there is reason to believe it could have significant macroeconomic implications," state new guidelines on governance questions adopted by the fund's board earlier this month.
The fund also showed a new readiness this month to interpret what it means by good governance quite broadly when it persuaded Romania to cancel a planned $1 billion purchase of 96 Cobra attack helicopters from an American company, Bell Helicopter, a division of Textron Inc.
Romania had hoped the purchase of sophisticated American military hardware would speed its entry into NATO, although the alliance's secretary general, Javier Solana, said the purchase was unnecessary.
The fund contended that such a large arms purchase risked disrupting the economic reforms to which Romania had agreed in return for a loan, by shifting money away from health and education programs that the fund considers more important for the country's successful transition to capitalism.
Last year the fund also showed its teeth in Asia by suspending disbursements on a $120 million loan to Cambodia for six months after anticipated Government revenues from logging concessions did not materialize.
Next month, it will be the World Bank's turn to publish a three-pronged plan for combatting corruption and promoting better governance. The bank already took the first step last year when it tightened procurement rules governing contracts financed by the $19 billion in loans it disburses annually, saying it will disqualify companies it considers corrupt and require those bidding for contracts to open their books to the bank's auditors.
The bank also is to recruit more procurement specialists to oversee the awarding of contracts, at an annual cost of $13 million, and to encourage third-world governments to include a pledge in projects it finances to take steps to prevent bribery. Finally, it plans to step up assistance to governments developing anticorruption strategies. It is already helping several countries develop strategies, including Latvia, Tanzania, Uganda and Ukraine.
Unlike the fund -- which usually makes just one loan to a government and which can suspend it at will -- the bank tends to have several loans outstanding at the same time in various sectors of any third-world country's economy where conditions may vary considerably.
So it plans a more selective approach to delinquent countries, making decisions on its lending on a project-by-project basis until it is satisfied with the way they are all being run. "You will see us giving a much higher profile to governance and corruption concerns in a selective way, delaying disbursement until we are satisfied, or suspending it altogether" said Masood Ahmed, who is coordinating the bank's new policies in this area.
In an early example of this approach, Mr. Wolfensohn recently delayed the $70 million second installment of a $150 million loan to a Kenyan energy project because of doubts about the way it was being run. He also delayed a health services loan to Kenya until the bank was satisfied with procurement procedures.
The bank also has suspended operations in several countries where it believes its money is unlikely to benefit ordinary people because of endemic corruption and inefficiency -- including Nigeria, the Sudan, Congo and Afghanistan.
In deciding to fight corruption and promote better government, both institutions have had to reinterpret requirements in their own bylaws that all lending should be based on economic considerations alone and should take no account of a country's politics.
In its new governance guidelines, the fund makes clear that its judgments still "should not be influenced by the nature of a political regime of a country, nor should it interfere in domestic or foreign politics of any member."
But it also concedes that staff "may need to be prepared to face some tension in the working relationship with country authorities in specific cases potentially involving corrupt practices."
Both institutions now contend that corruption and bad governance are in themselves obstacles to economic development, as are poor education, inadequate infrastructure and an ineffective health care system, all of which they have previously accepted as within the scope of their responsibility.

Envoy Meets Obstacles In Mideast Talks
Dennis B. Ross, President Clinton's special envoy to the Middle East, began his effort to restore what he called "the security underpinnings" of Israeli-Palestinian ties. He met separately for hours with Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. The two sides expressed very different opinions about what Mr. Ross should be trying to achieve, and each again accused the other of acting in bad faith. A1
 
Under Montserrat's Volcano
Residents of Montserrat were forced to consider whether they could still inhabit their Caribbean island as the Soufriere Hills volcano continued its forceful and frequent eruptions. With eruptions every 12 hours, a destroyed capital city and residents living in makeshift mass shelters, people contemplated their future in a place where safety is harder and harder to find. A1 

Struggling With Deportation
Although the Immigration and Naturalization Service has recently made dramatic improvements in its record of deporting criminal immigrants like Walter Cabrera Benavides, problems still linger. Offenders find it easy to return, often under aliases, and can bounce between American prisons and their home countries. A1
 
'Third Force' at Work Again?
The cycle of killing that marked South Africa's past has leapt up again in KwaZulu/Natal Province, reviving fears that the sinister "third force," supposedly dismantled with apartheid, may still be active. The third force is a presumably white-led, right-wing group dedicated to secretly fomenting black-on-black violence to prove that blacks are too violent to be trusted with government. A3
 
A Changing Mission
Last year, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund announced at their annual meeting that they would, for the first time, use their leverage with poorer nations to stamp out corruption and to promote better governance. As next month's annual meeting draws near, the finance ministers can point to examples of this policy's being applied in countries like Kenya, Romania and Cambodia. A4

Peruvian Rights Complaint
Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former United Nations chief, will take his case that Peru's security forces tapped his telephones during the 1995 presidential campaign to the Interamerican Human Rights Commission of the Organization of American States in Washington this week.

President to Use Line Item Veto Power
President Clinton has decided to exercise today his line item veto authority for the first time, striking out at least one narrow tax break and one spending measure from the balanced-budget bills he signed last week. The selection of the line item veto target has been sensitive because any veto, if sustained, is almost certain to face an immediate legal challenge on whether such authority unconstitutionally shifts power over spending and taxes from the Congress to the President. A1

Strike Injunction Not Likely
A post office employee made a Sunday delivery in Philadelphia as U.P.S. leaders stepped up their calls for the President to seek a court order to end the teamsters' strike. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton was leaning strongly against intervening, and union officials said such a move would be improper interference in the collective bargaining process. Negotiations between the union and the company broke down indefinitely on Saturday. A13
 
U.P.S. officials, who have been pushing the teamsters to let the rank-and-file vote on the company's contract proposal, suggested that the union's leadership was anti-democratic and was blocking the workers from considering a generous offer. From the union's point of view, all the company's talk about democracy and voting is a cynical ploy aimed at diverting members' attention from the main issues. A13

Nuclear Production Plans
The Energy Department, its own big nuclear reactors broken down irreparably, is preparing to borrow space in a civilian power plant to manufacture tritium for nuclear weapons. Tritium, a form of hydrogen and the H in H-bombs, is used to increase the power of older, fission atomic weapons, and the President has signed an order saying the United States has to have the ability to make more tritium by 2005. A10

Security Checks to Change
The Federal Aviation Administration, after years of fending off complaints of discrimination in its security checks for terrorists, has decided to require airlines to begin moving to a computerized system of "profiling." Officials say the new system does not allow for discrimination on the basis of ethnic background.

As President Clinton signed into law last week a bill to balance the Federal budget by 2002, one of the most widely touted provisions was a plan to provide $24 billion for health coverage of uninsured children, much of the money raised by an increase in tobacco taxes. How such an idea came about and survived is a complex tale of political alliances, backroom political skills and fortuitous timing. A12

HEADLINE: In Society of Female Chimps, Subtle Signs of Vital Status

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
MUCH to the surprise of primatologists, a dominant female chimpanzee turns out to be a lot like Alan Greenspan, the all-mighty czar of the Federal Reserve. He clears his throat, and stock markets tumble. She twitches an ear, and her underlings tremble. He controls the economy without so much as passing a law. She affects her group's fecundity without so much as raising a paw. Both man and ape offer proof that you don't have to speak much, you don't even have to carry a big stick, and still you can rule the world.
Scientists have discovered that female chimpanzees, long believed to have little or no interest in pulling rank on each other, in fact form subtle social hierarchies that profoundly influence the fate and fertility of every female in the group. 
 Working in the Gombe National Park of Tanzania with Jane Goodall, Anne Pusey and Jennifer Williams of the University of Minnesota have determined that female chimpanzees differ far more in their individual ability to bear and rear offspring than anybody had suspected, and that one of the biggest factors influencing a female's reproductive prowess is her social status. The babies of a high-ranking female are much likelier to survive to independence than are the offspring of a subordinate chimpanzee, and the daughters of a dominant mother reach sexual maturity four years earlier than those of a low-ranking female, a spectacular advantage that can transform a dominant family into a dynastic one.
But for all the discrepancies in prospects that are tied to social status, female chimpanzees appear indifferent to displays of power. They do not brandish fallen branches or kick over oil drums, as a male will to flaunt his status. They rarely fight with each other, and when they do, it is hard to tell who won. They are not big socializers, spending most of their time alone in the forest with their dependent young. Should a female encounter a male from her group, she will make the appropriate noises of subordination, giving off a little hnn-hnn-hnn sound called a pant-grunt, as a low-ranking male will in the presence of a dominant male. But when two females meet, they often ignore each other.
"The big surprise here is that dominance rank is so subtle as to be nonexistent, yet it has huge impact on reproductive success," said Ms. Williams, who is working on her doctoral dissertation. The findings of the new study appear in the current issue of the journal Science.
"People had emphasized the importance of rank among male chimpanzees, because it was so easy to see," said Dr. Craig Packer of the University of Minnesota, who did not contribute to the chimpanzee study but is familiar with it. "The females looked like the nebbishes of the woods," he said.
When Dr. Pusey and her colleagues began analyzing chimpanzee behavioral patterns more carefully, they found that beneath the females' apparently distracted exteriors skulked true political animals. Using data from the renowned Gombe chimpanzee field study that Dr. Goodall began in 1960, the scientists assessed dominance by looking at all pant-grunts exchanged in a group of 10 females from 1970 through 1992. They found that while pant-grunting is not an inevitable feature of female greeting, when it did occur between a given pair, it was always in the same direction: if female A pant-grunted to female B one day, A would pant-grunt to B the following year. By considering this reliable if inconspicuous vocalization, the researchers found that the females aligned themselves into a fairly stable hierarchy of low-, middle- and high-ranking apes.
The scientists then mapped out the reproductive histories of the 10 females, a difficult task for a long-lived and slow-breeding species like the chimpanzee. In their analysis, they counted as a success any offspring that survived to 5, the age of weaning. The group variability in fruitfulness proved significant.
Several of the low-ranking females had many pregnancies and births, but then lost most or all their infants, either to predation, poor nutrition, illness, accident, infanticide or causes unknown. By contrast, the highest-ranking female of the group, Fifi, is also the most successful mother. Now 38, Fifi has not lost a single one of her seven offspring. Five already are independent -- including two sons in their 20's, a 16-year-old daughter who is herself a mother and a 12-year-old daughter who is pregnant -- while the youngest two are on the cusp of weaning. The average age of reproductive maturity for a chimpanzee is 13, but the daughters of high-ranking females began breeding as young as 9.
The scientists do not yet know what distinguishes a high-ranking female from a subordinate, or why the offspring of dominant females fare better than those of the lowly. Dominant females are not any bigger or fleshier than their underlings, nor are they more overtly aggressive. High-rankers tend to be somewhat older than their subordinates, and a few females manage to gradually gain in stature as they age, but most stay put on the social pyramid no matter how long they live.
The scientists suspect that dominant females exert their pre-eminence in their choice of feeding terrains. Each female has her own turf that she forages through every day, and the dominants could be monopolizing the spots where the food is particularly nutritious. In addition, because feeding ranges overlap, the researchers theorize that should two females bump into each other while foraging, the high-status female gets first dibs on any good fruits or nuts that may be around.
"One thing we're trying to look at now is whether dominant females have a more steady body size," said Ms. Williams. "It could be that they don't lose weight in poor times." Fluctuations in body weight could affect fertility, lactation and the ability to fend off disease.
The scientists propose that a female's social rank is determined fairly early in life. Some daughters stay in their natal home, and may inherit their station from their mother, as Fifi did from her regal mother, Flo. More often, a young female will emigrate from her birthplace and join another group. It is during those early months of integration that a female makes her greatest effort to seek high status and is likeliest to engage other females in fights, or at least earnest, cacophonous discussions. After a while, a female appears to learn her place and from then on will grunt or be grunted at accordingly.
The researchers caution that the sample size in their study is extremely small, and that much more needs to be done to grasp the nuances of female competition in chimpanzees. Other research on primates has shown that dominant behavior, when taken to extremes, can backfire. Studying olive baboons, for example, Dr. Packer has found that the most dominant and aggressive females can suffer from fertility problems, possibly as a result of an excess of masculinizing hormones like testosterone.
Kathleen B. Kerr, a researcher and therapist at the Georgetown Family Center in Washington, has also been analyzing the Gombe data on female chimps as part of an effort to understand mother-infant relationships. She points out that while high rank for a chimpanzee is a critical factor in fostering successful motherhood, it is not the only factor. "There's variability between female chimps of the same rank in how they behave, what their life course is, and how many offspring they successfully raise," she said. "I don't think rank is whole story."
In her observations, the chimpanzee mothers most adept at rearing young tend to be "very relaxed but conscientious," she said. They are vigilant yet calm, staying watchful for danger while encouraging their young to explore their surroundings. In comparison, the mothers with comparatively low success at raising babies to maturity "tend to be restrictive and overprotective of their offspring," she said, "which translates into the offspring being less confident and exploratory, and more restricted in their approach to the world."
It's an old story: the strong get stronger, while the weak get weaker -- if they don't get eaten first.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Japan Key to Outcome In Climate Talks

SERIES: THE WARMING WORLD: Confronting Climate Change

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
AS time grows short in the latest and most serious attempt to deal with the prospect of global warming, everyone is waiting for two decisive players -- the United States and Japan -- to get their acts together.
Last week in Bonn, negotiators representing 145 countries inched closer to what would be the first international agreement on legally binding reductions in emissions of waste industrial gases, like carbon dioxide, that trap heat in the atmosphere. Mainstream scientists say these greenhouse gases threaten to disrupt the earth's climate and may already be doing so. 
 But with only one more session scheduled in the two-year-old talks before a final meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December, both the United States and Japan have yet to produce their proposals for specific reductions and timetables. Until they do, negotiators here said, no breakthrough is possible.
Japanese and American proposals are "the key to the success of the process," Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the chairman of the United Nations-sponsored talks, told the delegates.
Japan is seen as a pivotal nation because of its economic strength and because, as host of the final session, it will be in a special position to influence the outcome of the talks. The United States, by virtue of its economic weight, international influence and huge emissions of greenhouse gases, is the 900-pound gorilla of international climate politics.
"Without the U.S., nothing will happen -- it is absolutely crucial," said Bert Metz, a veteran climate negotiator from the Netherlands.
It may be that nothing will happen anyway. The complexities, economic stakes and rival interests at play in the talks are such that few would express surprise if they failed to produce a meaningful agreement. But leaders of major countries have become personally engaged in the issue, infusing it with new bite and raising it to a new level of relevance and visibility.
President Clinton says that he finds the scientific evidence for the fact of climate change "pretty compelling." He supports legally binding but "realistic" emissions reductions. He has opened a campaign to rally popular support for what could be unpopular steps to reduce the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, the main source of carbon dioxide emissions.
But the United States has yet to propose any amounts by which emissions should be reduced or to say when limits should take effect. Until it puts numbers on the table, the nature and strength of the American commitment are impossible to judge.
American negotiators in Bonn told a number of major countries privately that Mr. Clinton was strongly committed to binding action and that his Government was working intensively to complete the specifics of its proposal, a senior Administration official said. The American delegates also told their counterparts that any agreement acceptable to the United States must maintain economic growth, the official said.
The Administration is widely expected to announce its proposal after a scheduled White House conference on climate in early October and before or during the next negotiation session here, from Oct. 20 to Oct. 31.
Toshiaki Tanabe, the chief Japanese delegate in Bonn, acknowledged the concern about his country and the United States. Like the Americans, he said in an interview, Japan is "still in the process of working out our figures." He did not say when they would be ready.
While the talks go on, lobbying and debate intensify. On one extreme are representatives of industries that produce fossil fuels, who argue that cutting emissions will hurt economies. It is better, they say, to study global warming more to be sure that the remedy matches the threat rather than rush to judgment. On the other end of the spectrum are environmentalists who say that every year that passes without action will make climatic disruption more likely, more serious and more painful to deal with in the end. Unless a first step is taken now, they say, it might be years before the opportunity comes again, and by then climatic disruption might be obvious to all.
The most influential reduction proposal on the table so far is that of the European Union, which calls for industrialized countries to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (all greenhouse gases) by 15 percent by 2010 and by 7.5 percent by 2005.
No reduction targets and timetables for developing countries are being formally discussed in Bonn. Those countries have a general obligation, under a 1992 climate treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro, to reduce their emissions. But a conference of parties to the treaty that met in Berlin in 1995 expressly exempted the poorer countries from any new, more specific commitments in the present talks. The poorer nations have long insisted that since the industrialized countries got rich by burning fossil fuels, developing countries should not be unfairly penalized as they build their own industries.
The issue of the developing countries' role may be the thorniest in the talks, and many insiders believe that it has the most potential to scuttle them. Both the Clinton Administration and the United States Senate, which must ratify any Kyoto deal, are insisting that all countries must play some role in reducing emissions. Otherwise, it is feared, some American industries might move their operations to developing countries if those countries had no similar emissions controls.
The 1992 treaty, ratified by the Senate, included an important compromise on principle: Since the rich countries have emitted the most greenhouse gases so far, they should take the lead in controlling emissions. But the developing countries' emissions are expected to equal or surpass those of the richer nations after 2010 or so, and it was always expected that the developing countries would follow the lead of the developed nations -- once it was clear that they were indeed moving.
That evidence has not yet appeared. First, the rich countries have generally failed to cap their emissions at 1990 levels voluntarily, as the treaty says they must aim to do. Only two large countries, Germany and Britain, are succeeding at that. And there is that lack of concrete new proposals from the United States and Japan.
There are a number of ways the developing countries might participate. Their targets and timetables need not be the same as that of the rich countries, for example, and their adoption could be contingent on the rich countries' adoption of their own targets and schedules. Or a rich country could get credit for some emissions reductions by providing money or technology to help a developing country reduce its emissions. That would cut the cost of the reductions, and since the gases, once emitted, quickly become part of a single, global concentration, it does not matter where the reductions come from.
The United States favors this "joint implementation" approach but, over all, developing countries are skeptical. Still, the idea is already being tested in pilot projects, although no emissions-reduction credit is yet being awarded to rich countries for undertaking them.
At the meeting here, representatives of developing countries, citing recent studies, said they were already doing more than expected to control emissions. As for binding new commitments for the poorer nations, "one should not take on something he is not able to deliver," said Mark J. Mwandosya of Tanzania, the chairman of the developing-country caucus in the talks. But he did not rule anything in or out, saying he "wouldn't like to prejudge Kyoto," where the developing-country issue is expected to be decided -- or not.
As for the industrialized countries, Mr. Estrada said he hoped to have an agreement on their reduction commitments nailed down by the end of the next Bonn session in October (it will be the eighth negotiating session since 1995).
Achieving that agreement is not merely a matter of setting reduction targets and timetables. Both the Americans and the Japanese, for instance, believe that the structure within which the reductions would take place is just as important. They want countries to have the flexibility to achieve reductions in ways that make the best sense for themselves, and at the least cost.
The United States, for instance, has proposed that reductions be carried out over a series of multiyear periods, with the reduction targets expressed as an annual average of emissions for each period as a whole. It also advocates the "banking" of emissions reductions: applying reductions achieved in one period against the next, and "borrowing" from a future period -- at a penalty -- to meet the current period's targets.
The United States further proposes an arrangement called "emissions trading." In this approach, countries that find it difficult and expensive to reduce their emissions could purchase a permit to emit more than they are allowed from countries that find it less costly and easier. The price of the permits would be determined by supply and demand in an open market. The rationale is that in the long run, and over all, emissions reductions would be both cheaper and more effective.
In another idea on the table, some countries favor tailoring emissions reductions and the means of achieving them to a country's individual economic and energy profile, rather than imposing a flat-rate, one-size-fits-all target and a fixed set of methods. There would presumably be an overall reduction target, and countries would negotiate how much of it they would be responsible for. The European Union has devised an internal arrangement similar to this for its members, with countries like Britain and Germany taking on bigger reduction burdens than others.
But for now, the world is looking to the United States and Japan to take their stands. "When we have those two proposals," Mr. Estrada said, "the other pieces will fall into place."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Flat For Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were flat yesterday, with investors concerned that forthcoming sales and inflation data would point to a more rapid rate of economic growth for the third quarter, leading the Fed to raise rates next week to keep growth and inflation contained.
The 30-year bond declined 2/32, to 96 20/32 to yield 6.64 percent, up from 6.63 percent last week, when it rose nearly 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, as the yield curve steepened, and the spread between the short end of the market and longer maturities widened. 
 "Last week's midquarter refunding was quite disappointing," said Dr. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, and bonds sold off further following the 30-year auction. The rout intensified Friday, even though no fresh data were released. "Markets now have sweaty palms over this week's key data releases," she said.
She called the damage to the bond market extensive and said that technical factors pointed to further losses. And with the coming data, the markets will remain defensive for some time. "Remember, the F.O.M.C. meets on Aug. 19," she said. "Any whiff of a rate hike at that meeting would further smash the bond market." The reference was to the Federal Open Market Committee.
Coming data include today's release of second-quarter unit labor costs, which the consensus says is a 2.8 percent gain; the Producer Price Index for July tomorrow, for which the consensus is for a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent, after a one-tenth of 1 percent decline the previous month, and retail sales, which are expected to increase seven-tenths of 1 percent, driven by a healthy pace of auto sales along with firm chain store sales. Excluding auto, the consensus is for a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent. July's Consumer Price Index is to be released on Thursday, and the consensus is that it will be up about two-tenths of 1 percent.
Dave Shabelman, Treasury market analyst at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said yesterday that his contacts had told him there just wasn't a bid in the market, "which is making it even easier for the bears to stay in control."
He said the market's early gains came amid bargain hunting by investors looking for bargains after Friday's tumble left conditions in an oversold state.
Doug Burtnick, managing analyst for Technical Data of Boston, said the outlook still was not pretty, but yield levels could provide an argument for buying Treasury securities. He said their recent portfolio survey showed that investment managers were inclined to buy bonds near 6 5/8 percent yields, and the market was currently just above that level.
A Market News report in the afternoon caused a mild comeback, but it seemed to run out off gas. In an interview, a Fed governor, Susan Phillips, hinted that there would be no near-term rate increase despite strong growth. According to Market News Service, she said there was not a trigger mechanism that necessarily would suggest it was time to act.
Elsewhere, the Treasury's weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills was fairly routine, analysts said. The three-month averaged 5.17 percent at auction, up from 5.15 percent last week, while the average rate for a six-month issue was 5.23 percent, up from 5.20 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.693	97.356	Discounted Rate	5.17%	5.23%	Coupon Yield	5.31%	5.45%	High Price	98.698	97.366	Discounted Rate	5.15%	5.21%	Coupon Yield	5.29%	5.43%	Low Price	98.691	97.356	Discounted Rate	5.18%	5.23%	Coupon Yield	5.32%	5.45%	Accepted at low price	14%	31%	Total applied for	$55,796,212	$45,109,000	Accepted	$12,323,176	$12,304,736	Noncompetitive	$1,357,362	$1,306,224	
 
Both issues are dated Aug. 14, 1997. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 13, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 12, 1998.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Strong Rebound, Aided by Recovery in Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied sharply yesterday from its selloff on Friday, helped by rebounds in the American stock market and by doubts that the German central bank was preparing to raise interest rates.
The appetite for dollars erased much of the dollar's 2.9 percent slide against the yen and 1.1 percent drop against the mark on Friday, when stock prices plunged, too. 
 "I don't think one bad day spells doom and gloom for U.S. assets; that has something to do with it," said Ralph Delzenero, vice president of foreign exchange marketing at First National Bank of Chicago. "The market continues to want to buy dollars. Fundamentally, all the same things still are in place."
The dollar settled in New York at 116.12 yen, up from its nearly one-month low of 114.95 yen Friday. The dollar cost 1.8634 marks, up from 1.8473. The pound cost $1.5828, down from $1.5855.
Currency traders said that the dollar had tracked the behavior of other financial markets in the United States for much of the day yesterday, weakening as securities prices fell in the morning and rebounding as they rallied in the afternoon. Stocks ended generally higher, though bond prices were slightly lower.
The catalyst for the turnaround in stock prices appeared to be a report by the Market News Service quoting a Federal Reserve governor, Susan Phillips, as suggesting that there was no need for an imminent increase in American interest rates. Fears of higher rates contributed to a sharp decline in stock and bond prices Friday.
Further helping the dollar was a fading of speculation that the German central bank would raise an important short-term interest rate today in a move aimed at defending the mark. Higher interest rates in Germany would make investments denominated in marks more attractive to foreigners.
Traders said weakness in Germany's economy made a rate increase unlikely because that would add to already high unemployment.
"Most people believe the Bundesbank won't do anything," said Jeffrey Yu, senior currency trader at the New York branch of Sanwa Bank. "I think German citizens would question a Bundesbank decision to raise rates."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Jimmy Carter Turns

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Lovely day at the shore -- warmed by the sun and the thought of writing about certain young Americans struggling for the liberty of persecuted people far away. Then Jimmy Carter appears, bringing the shadow that travels with him now.
Once the 39th President prided himself on making human rights a priority in his Administration. But he has become part of the great change Beijing has brought about -- turning so many of the American elite into its political and economic servitors. 
 He appeared in an Op-Ed piece he wrote for The New York Times on Sunday. It is a classic example of propagandist technique -- manipulating truth to produce falsehoods. The most skillful specimen by Mr. Carter amounts to a denial of the millions of Chinese Christians who fight for their religious freedom, and of their suffering:
"Although congregations must still register with the Government, membership in Christian churches is booming."
The first half of that sentence treats the "registration" of Christian churches as if it were a formality, like getting a peddler's license. The truth, documented repeatedly by the U.S. Government, is that registration means submitting to full control by a specifically atheistic branch of the Communist apparatus. Control includes appointment of clergy, including bishops and cardinals, Catholic rejection of papal authority, banning of certain teachings like the second coming of Christ, forbidding proselytizing by foreigners.
The second part is a falsehood for what it does not say. Millions of Christians refuse to be part of the registered "official" churches. They worship in underground churches that the police try to search out and destroy. Their congregations are subject to incarceration, torture and death. But it is in the underground Catholic and Protestant churches that the greatest "boom" is taking place. To ignore the soaring reality of those who refuse to submit to religious control, and their courage, is a disgrace. Mr. Carter commits others:
Chinese policies are shaped by fear of chaos from "unrestrained" dissidents. Who? What have they done to create this fear except ask for minimal freedoms?
He says "the tragedy of Tiananmen" aborted discussions he says he had arranged between Beijing and Tibetans. What was the tragedy -- the peaceful protest by students or the murderous attack on them ordered by the Communist leaders he treats with such oozing respect? Why did China not allow talks in four decades of occupying Tibet before Tiananmen -- and in the 10 years since?
I believe that Mr. Carter and China's Politburo are both increasingly worried about the rising power of the American public protest against persecution of Chinese Christians. So I take a cleansing shower by thinking of the Americans who want to help the persecuted, not deny them.
Almost every day letters arrive: What can I do, one person alone, to fight persecution?
I've never taken part in political action, but these are suggestions from Americans who have:
1. Take every opportunity available in a democracy to the individual: Write or call elected officials, editors, broadcasters and businessmen in the China trade about what kind of legislation, sanctions, news coverage or investment policy you seek as a citizen and consumer. Keep writing and calling.
2. Refuse to remain alone. Work with your congregation, union, clubs, professional association to get legislative action and business responsibility.
3. Vote and buy on your convictions.
4. Search out organizations already set up to fight persecution.
The young Americans I mentioned have formed Students for Tibet in high schools and universities (1-888-SFTIBET). They are part of a network of students, actors and musicians who give their energies, talents and money to arousing Americans to the slaughter of Tibet. Untiring protest by the Students for Tibet is an important reason that the Holiday Inn chain recently ended its management contract with a Beijing-owned hotel in Tibet.
So: Beijing rulers are doing two things at the same time. They are turning the powerful of America to their service. And they are creating millions of Americans, young and not so young, who will never be turned.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Wins Incentives From Toledo

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation has become the latest company to negotiate extensive tax breaks and other government incentives, winning concessions totaling $232 million, or about $47,000 for each job retained, for building a Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio.
Never mind that the new factory will have 600 fewer jobs than the one it replaces, that unemployment rates are at record lows and that Chrysler planned to stay within 15 miles of Toledo -- possibly somewhere in Michigan -- even if it had abandoned its downtown site. Cities, like workers themselves, remain eager to hold onto jobs in this era of downsizing. City and state tax revenues paid by Chrysler and its workers would have plummeted had Chrysler moved out. 
 "Toledo would have been devastated by that kind of financial loss," said Donald E. Jakeway, director of development for Ohio. "Forget $232 million -- that is a drop in the bucket" compared with what would have happened if Chrysler had left.
So Toledo, following a practice that is common across the country -- from New York to Tuscaloosa, Ala., -- paid to keep the company from moving out. And Chrysler agreed in late July to invest $1.2 billion to build a new factory and upgrade its existing downtown factory, where workers build Jeep Wranglers and Cherokees. The Toledo Blade reported on Sunday that the financial package was worth $232 million. City and state officials confirmed that figure today.
Among similar deals in other states, New York has agreed to packages of city and state tax breaks and other incentives to keep companies like Merrill Lynch ($27 million), IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust ($3.1 million) and about 30 other companies in the city. Most recently, the city has been negotiating with Reuters, the British media giant, which may build an office tower in Times Square if it can work out the financial details and reach an agreement on tax breaks.
Critics say cities and states should not compete for corporate investments. "We call it economic war," said Arthur J. Rolnick, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. "It is going on between Kentucky and Ohio, between New York and New Jersey and between Minnesota and Wisconsin." He added that the Chrysler deal was only the latest of the lot.
The Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank argued that while the competition for jobs among states might shuffle jobs from state to state, it created no new jobs nationally. The bank argues that Congress, which has the authority to regulate interstate commerce, should deter such competition by taxing as income the special deals offered to companies like Chrysler.
Chrysler said the incentive package had made it possible for the company to build a modern assembly plant at an aging urban site. The company's investment "is going to be used for providing jobs for the citizens there for what we hope will be the next 80 years," said W. Frank Fountain, vice president for government affairs at Chrysler.
"It is anything but corporate welfare," Mr. Fountain argued. "It is an investment on a long-term facility that is going to be providing jobs and that will generate tax revenue." Chrysler needs the incentive package to compete with rivals that have received similar deals for their factories, he added.
Whatever the politics and finances, citizens of Toledo were eager for Chrysler to stay. "For the past eight months, there have been billboards and bumper stickers and T-shirts and lapel pins that said 'We love our Jeep,' " Mr. Jakeway said.
Since the turn of the century, workers have clocked in at the factory on Stickney Avenue in Toledo. Chrysler decided to replace the creaky factory with an up-to-date assembly plant within 15 miles of Toledo.
That set up the battle. "Fifteen miles north of Toledo, you're in Michigan," Mr. Jakeway said, adding that Michigan had offered Chrysler a bigger incentive package than had Ohio. In these good times, Chrysler shareholders are unlikely to complain -- the company earned $483 million last quarter and $3.5 billion last year.
So Chrysler will spend $600 million to build and equip the new factory in Toledo and another $600 million to refurbish an existing building on the site. The new, modern complex will need just 4,900 workers, down from the current 5,500, a level that will be reached through attrition and retirement. Construction starts next year.
This is not the first time Chrysler has gotten an incentive package to have a plant stay put. In 1992, Chrysler replaced an 85-year-old plant in Detroit with a $1 billion sophisticated factory where Jeep Grand Cherokees, the high end of the Jeep line, are built. Back then, the company received a package of financial incentives worth more than $250 million. Just this year, Chrysler announced it would invest an additional $1.3 billion in smaller factories near the Detroit Grand Cherokee plant.

HEADLINE: A Mixed Day As Stocks Try To Rebound

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday, as the market's two main indexes were the only ones that managed to regain some ground after Friday's sharp losses.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 30.89 points, to 8,062.11, rebounding from the Friday selloff that took most of the market's major indexes down 1.5 percent or more. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also rose yesterday, adding 3.46 points, to 937. 
 But the Nasdaq composite index finished lower, down 11.78 points, to 1,586.74, and indexes of smaller-company stocks also declined.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining stocks slightly outnumbered those advancing, and volume was moderate. Telephone companies, oil stocks and banks had gains. Technology, drug and health care stocks languished.
The plunge on Friday brought losses to stocks, Treasury securities and the dollar, as equities seemed to follow Treasuries lower and the dollar's selloff served as a catalyst for further slides in bond prices.
But the markets seemed to regain their composure yesterday, analysts said, as long-term investors returned to seek out lower-priced securities.
While the bond market closed little changed yesterday, a rally in the afternoon prevented larger losses. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.64 percent, from 6.63 percent Friday.
That afternoon bond rally, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, led to the turnaround in the Dow, which had been down as much as 66 points in the early afternoon. "Bonds rallied, plain and simple," he said.
The dollar also rebounded, rising 1 percent against the Japanese yen and slightly less than 1 percent against the German mark.
A healthy American economy -- with brighter growth prospects than that of the major economies of Europe or of Japan -- coupled with relatively low interest rates, helped strengthen the dollar, said Craig McCauley, executive vice president of global investment management at the Bankers Trust Company.
Even though there was no rebound across the board in the stock market, some analysts were still surprised that even a modest recovery had occurred. "I thought the market would have a bad day, and it didn't," said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers Inc. "I was pretty impressed with the zeal to buy stocks."
Yesterday's modest turnaround, he said, was a sign of the continued influence of the underlying factors that have been supporting the stock market all year, including the strong flow of cash into mutual funds.
Still, some analysts expect that equities will at best just meander this week, as several important economic reports are released.
"There's an awful lot of numbers coming out this week," said Jim Benning, a vice president and trader at BT Brokerage in New York. "Any one of these numbers could really push the market either way."
The Labor Department will release the Producer Price Index for July tomorrow, and the Consumer Price Index comes out on Thursday.
But the July retail sales report scheduled for release tomorrow is probably the week's most important number. It will provide the first indication of consumer buying for the second half of the year. It is the uncertainty about the pace of economy in the second half that led to last week's selloffs in stocks and bonds.
In the stock market yesterday, Chevron rose 2 3/8, to 80 1/16. Mobil gained 3 11/16, to 76 9/16. Royal Dutch/ Shell picked up 1 1/16, to 54 3/4.
The Fort Howard Corporation, a maker of napkins, paper towels and other tissue products, rose 2 7/8, to 60 3/8, on Nasdaq. Fort Howard is being acquired by the James River Corporation for $6.3 billion and it was announced yesterday that the new company, to be called the Fort James Corporation, will become a component of the S.& P. 500 index. James River rose 1 7/16, to 43 15/16.
Ascend Communications was the most active issue, with more than 24 million shares trading on the Nasdaq market. The shares fell 4 3/4, to 44 11/16. A regulatory filing by the company disclosed that July revenue had sharply lagged behind analysts' expectations for Ascend, a computer networking company.
Coca-Cola fell 15/16, to 61 3/4, yesterday, the third consecutive session in which Coke posted a decline. The stock traded as low as 59 5/8. Coke lost 3 7/8 on Friday, leading the Dow lower, after it said its third-quarter earnings would fall below analysts' expectations.

HEADLINE: Labor Secretary's Efforts Fail to Budge Negotiators in U.P.S. Dispute

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman met yesterday with top negotiators for the teamsters' union and United Parcel Service as the Clinton Administration stepped up its efforts to resolve the eight-day-old strike.
Ms. Herman reported no progress after meeting for two hours with Ronald Carey, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and then for two hours with David Murray, the chief U.P.S. negotiator. 
 In a statement issued after her meetings, Ms. Herman said she discussed in detail what it would take to get the parties back to the bargaining table after they broke off talks indefinitely last Saturday.
"I made it clear that everyone involved must show greater flexibility and a willingness to compromise," she said.
After meeting with the Labor Secretary, Mr. Murray said the company would stand by its latest offer. He again urged union leaders to let the rank and file vote on that offer.
U.P.S., the world's largest parcel-delivery company, wrote to members of Congress as a way to step up pressure on President Clinton to seek an injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act to halt the strike.
But Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, again indicated the President's reluctance to take such a move.
"We can't solve the labor-management conflicts between the parties," Mr. McCurry said.
Mr. Clinton and other Administration officials have repeatedly said that the strike by 185,000 workers has not created the serious economic damage that would be required to invoke Taft-Hartley. Under the law, a President can ask a court to issue an injunction to stop a strike, but no President has invoked the act in more than two decades.
After his meeting with Ms. Herman, Mr. Carey, the union's president, said he urged her to press U.P.S. to negotiate about increasing wages and converting more part-time jobs into full-time jobs.
Mr. Carey said, "What has to happen here is that the company has to get the message that the Government is not going to intervene on their behalf. They've been playing games. They haven't been serious."
U.P.S. received some support from Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, when Mr. Gingrich called on Mr. Clinton to ask the union to let the rank and file vote on what the company has called its "last, best and final offer."
Teamster officials insist that the company's call for a rank-and-file vote is a ploy intended to sabotage the strike and divide the members from their leadership. Union officials assert that their members would overwhelmingly reject the company's offer, and they say the company wants the union to suspend the strike while the vote is taken, a move that would reduce the union's leverage.
In Nashville yesterday, a U.P.S. manager, Floyd Parta, was killed when the tractor-trailer he was driving plunged off a highway ramp. The company said Mr. Parta was licensed to operate the truck.
In Miami, the police said Roderick Carter, a U.P.S. worker who crossed the picket line, was stabbed on Thursday. The Associated Press said four men had been charged with attempted murder -- including two who were identified as U.P.S. workers -- and two other men were being sought.

Japan to Lead Group In $16 Billion Thai Rescue
The I.M.F. and a group of Asian nations led by Japan agreed to a $16 billion rescue of Thailand's troubled financial system, which has been jolted by a currency crisis that has spread through the region, threatening its rapid growth. 
 The loan package is the second-largest international bailout, though it is significantly smaller than the $50 billion rescue of Mexico from the peso collapse of 1994-95. [Page A1.]
 
Credit Suisse to Buy Big Insurer
Credit Suisse agreed to buy Winterthur Insurance of Switzerland for $8.8 billion, another in a series of deals that combines financial companies with insurers. [D4.]
 
Earnings Rise at Store Chains
Two large retailers, Nordstrom and May Department Stores, reported robust earnings for the second quarter. [D2.]
 
Chrysler Wins Aid for Jeep Plant
Chrysler has won a $232 million package of government incentives to invest $1.2 billion to build a Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio, and to upgrade an aging plant there. [D3.]
 
F.A.S.B. Sticks to Derivatives Plan
The Financial Accounting Standards Board said that it planned to adopt its proposed rules on accounting for derivative securities, despite recent criticism from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. [D2.]
 
Quick & Reilly Said to Seek Bids
Quick & Reilly Group, the big discount brokerage firm, has reportedly put itself up for sale, giving a dozen potential buyers a chance to submit preliminary bids. [D2.]
 
E.P.A. Wants Pollution Disclosure
If the Environmental Protection Agency has its way, people who live near hundreds of factories in several major industries -- including producers of oil products, steel and other metals, autos and paper -- will soon gain easy on-line access to mountains of data about the pollution given off by the plants. [A1.]
 
Dollar Rallies After Big Drop
The dollar rallied sharply from its selloff on Friday, helped by rebounding stocks and by doubts that the German central bank would raise interest rates. [D6.]
 
Treasury securities prices were flat, with the yield on the 30-year bond edging up to 6.64 percent from 6.63. [D15.]
 
TV Ad Campaign by A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has come up with a new capitalist wrinkle to woo workers to the union banner: slick broadcast spots. New ads for the 13-million-member labor group show workers, with hip music in the background, explaining how unions have helped them. [A12.]
 
BMW is getting back to basics with a campaign that parks recent pitches focused on attributes like safety and value in favor of taking the performance aspects of "the ultimate driving machine" for another spin. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D7.]
 
No Progress in Strike Talks
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman met with negotiators for U.P.S. and the striking teamsters but reported no progress. [A12.]
 
The teamsters say their main goal in the strike is for part-time workers to gain full-time jobs that pay enough for them to live on. But the company says it cannot transform many part-time jobs to full-time ones because its day is made up of busy bursts and long lulls. [A1.]
 
Union Pacific Discloses Offers
Union Pacific Resources Group disclosed in an S.E.C. filing that it had received offers from third parties that would be interested in buying Pennzoil assets or participating in joint ventures if Union Pacific's hostile bid for Pennzoil is successful. [D2.]

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
I.M.F., With the Help of Asians, Offers Thais $16 Billion Bailout

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and a group of Asian nations led by Japan agreed today to a $16 billion rescue of Thailand's troubled financial system, which has been jolted by a currency crisis that has spread through South and Southeast Asia, threatening the region's rapid growth.
The package of loans, announced after a meeting here, is the second-largest international bailout, though significantly smaller than the $50 billion rescue of Mexico from the peso collapse of 1994-95. 
 The money will be used by Thailand to help shore up its foreign reserves, which were depleted by a futile attempt to save its currency, the baht, from being devalued last month. The reserves are needed to pay for imports and to meet some foreign-debt obligations.
Officials announcing the package called it a precedent-setting example of regional cooperation, as Asian nations acted to keep Thailand's problems from spreading. "What is impressive about the financial package this time is we have substantial contributions from the countries of the Asia-Pacific region," Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, said at a news conference.
The United States attended today's meeting, as did Germany, Britain, France and Canada, but those nations are not taking part in the rescue directly. This appears to result in part from a feeling that the Asians, with the most at stake, can and should handle the problem.
Among the countries taking part, Japan -- Asia's dominant economy and with huge investments in Thailand -- is playing the leading role, contributing $4 billion. That matches the amount to be contributed by the International Monetary Fund. Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore will each contribute $1 billion, while Indonesia and South Korea will chip in $500 million apiece. The remaining $3 billion or so is expected to come from the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and possibly from China. The loans will come due in three to five years, and will generally be in line with market rates.
In addition to the government and international lending agency help, Thailand is expected to receive billions of dollars in new financing from commercial banks, led by those in Japan. The Thai Finance Minister, Thanong Bidaya, is scheduled to meet with major Japanese banks on Tuesday. And Mr. Sakakibara of the Japanese Finance Ministry remarked, "I think the discussion between the Thai authorities and Japanese banks will proceed smoothly."
Once the paragon of a fast-growing Asian economy, Thailand has suffered a slowdown in exports because of new competition from China and other nations with lower wages, and also because the baht had been tied to a strengthening dollar. Even more damaging has been a huge-scale bad debt problem caused by overinvestment in real estate and factories.
After long denying the severity of its problems, the Thai Government was forced last week to agree to emergency measures to restructure its economy in return for the loans announced today.
Other Asian countries have an incentive to help Thailand because many of them are affected, though perhaps to a smaller degree, by the same economic problems and pressures on their currencies. However, previous agreements among Asian central banks to cooperate on currency stabilization were ineffective in preventing the recent turmoil.
Since Thai officials gave up trying to defend the baht -- allowing it on July 2 to float at market rates -- the currency has fallen about 20 percent against the dollar. The Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah have fallen roughly 6 or 7 percent. Three and a half weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund approved a $1 billion loan to the Philippines to help it cope with the currency crisis.
But the problems in Thailand have wider effects, and pose a particular threat to Japan. Its auto makers control virtually all of the Thai car market; its electronics companies have made Thailand a big manufacturing and export base, and Japanese banks hold about half of the country's $89 billion in foreign debt. Already, some Japanese-owned auto plants in Thailand have had to slow operations because of the financial crisis.
Yet Tokyo, which since the end of World War II has been reticent about taking the lead in world affairs, has not played as strong a role as Washington did in rescuing Mexico. Although the Japanese are exercising influence, they have allowed the International Monetary Fund to be out in front. The rescue generated little controversy here, unlike in the United States when the Mexican bailout was proposed. There was perhaps some worry that Japan would set a precedent, that it might have to rescue other Asian nations in financial trouble. But by enlisting the help of other countries in the region, it mitigated such concerns.
Officials at today's meeting here said that Thailand required $14 billion for 1997 and 1998, so the $16 billion agreed upon should be more than enough for current needs.
While the rescue package is expected to shore up international confidence in Thailand, the hard work of changing some aspects of the Thai economy lies ahead. Dissatisfaction in Thailand, both with the Government's perceived mishandling of the crisis and with the bitter economic medicine to follow, has caused speculation on a coup attempt, though the Prime Minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, has insisted that he has full control of the often-assertive Thai military.
To qualify for the international bailout, Thailand agreed last week to reduce public spending, raise the value-added tax to 10 percent from 7 percent, and suspend the operations of 42 debt-ridden financial companies.
The nation's currency losses mean that interest payments on the Thai foreign debt have swelled 20 percent, as measured in baht. Prices on imports will climb, contributing to inflation. The slowdown in construction, factory production and consolidation of the financial industry is expected to increase unemployment.
"We realized the devaluation of the baht will create some inflationary pressure in Thailand," Mr. Thanong, the Finance Minister, said at the news conference today. "But somehow we feel it's a necessary step to make Thai exports more competitive."
He predicted that Thailand will grow 3 percent this year and 4 percent next year, well down from growth of more than 6 percent in 1996 and the 9 percent spurts that were once considered normal. Mr. Thanong said he expected Thailand to resume rapid growth in 1999. Some economists find these projections optimistic.

HEADLINE: Budget Deal Creates Heat for District of Columbia's Delegate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
For years, she has been the city's most popular public official, a landslide winner in every election who moves easily across the ethnic and economic lines that often fracture the community spirit of the nation's capital.
Yet not since she was first elected to Congress as the District of Columbia's nonvoting delegate in 1990 has Eleanor Holmes Norton's popularity faced such a hard test. 
 With new Federal legislation shifting the power of running the city from elected officials to appointed overseers, Ms. Norton has suddenly been caught in the political storm of her life, one largely of her own creation. Initially an ardent supporter of the measure for its enormous financial benefits to the city, she turned into a vociferous critic after residents expressed outrage that the law costs them their sovereignty.
Ms. Norton, a Democrat, is now hearing constituents question whether her loyalties are to her party or her people.
"She has been too addicted to being on the prevailing side, rather than a principled side," said Lawrence Guyot, a supporter of local self-government and a friend of Ms. Norton for decades. "She has an awful lot of explaining to do."
To defuse tensions and avert growing strains between the mostly black city leadership and the Clinton Administration, Ms. Norton met today with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to discuss how to swing back the pendulum of power, even if slightly, to the city's elected officials from a financial control board appointed by Congress two years ago.
She emerged from the meeting with what appeared to be a forced smile and with the promise of a strategy: she said the Administration would try to amend the law to give the District Council a meaningful role in confirming heads of city agencies.
The Council and Mayor lost that right to the control board as part of the new legislation.
"He suggested it even before I raised it," Ms. Norton said of Mr. Clinton. "It was a mistake in the legislation. We both feel it's a place to begin so we can work our way back to full self-government."
The changes in local governance were part of the Federal budget bill that Mr. Clinton signed last week. The measure included almost $1 billion over five years as well as new management restraints on the local government demanded by the Republican leadership of Congress.
The legislation gave the control board many bold new powers that were once the province of the mayor and District Council, including the right to hire private consultants to run the city's major agencies. Earlier, the control board appointed a board of trustees to run the public school system, in place of the elected school board.
Ms. Norton, who has been a strong supporter of home rule for the District, initially hailed the legislation, largely for the financial relief, but also for what it did not include, the creation of a city manager form of government, which she said would have usurped even more authority of the local government, leaving the mayor as little more than a ribbon-cutter. "A big win" for the city, Ms. Norton called the measure last week, "an extraordinary deal for the District."
But a groundswell of protest erupted. Marion S. Barry Jr., who has been Mayor for 15 of the last 19 years, called the change "a rape of democracy" that turned the calendar back more than 25 years, to when unelected commissioners ran the city at the behest of Congress.
To many other District residents as well, the new law was a step backward. In protests staged last week in front of the White House and in a church where the control board was meeting, several hundred local residents demonstrated and more than a dozen were arrested.
The winds of disaffection reached Ms. Norton quickly, and she almost instantly changed her public stance.
By the weekend, she was protesting with the protesters, asserting that the deal was, in effect, a theft of fundamental rights and insisting that when the managerial changes were written into the law, "I was not in the room." She vowed to speak to the President.
After the half-hour meeting at the White House, she appeared with the Administration's point man on District matters, Franklin D. Raines, the Federal budget director, and told reporters it had been "an excellent exchange." She expressed her appreciation for the financial help in the form of the Federal Government's agreement, among other things, to assume the city's pension liability, to pay a greater share of Medicaid costs and to take over a prison.
She also maintained her position that there had been "no need, from the beginning, for Congress to legislate" the shift in powers.
Characterizing her change of heart as a move of political expediency, Mr. Guyot, the Norton critic, predicted that Ms. Norton could face a viable challenge in next year's election, even with her striking ability to attract votes: she won with 62 percent of the vote in 1990, 85 percent in 1992, 89 percent in 1994 and 90 percent in 1996.
But Mark Plotkin, a local political analyst for public radio, said the fact that Ms. Norton had altered course so quickly would only solidify her position among voters.
"She made a strategic mistake," he said of Ms. Norton's original support for the measure. "But she might have helped herself by admitting she made a mistake and seeking to rectify it."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Martinez Clouts 38th To Support Pettitte

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The scorched baseball sailed off Paul Molitor's bat toward the left-field seats and virtually everyone at the Metrodome figured that the Twins would have no trouble scoring off Andy Pettitte in the third inning. But it turned very quiet after Chad Curtis raced to the warning track, backed up against the fence and gloved the ball. It was quiet and Pettitte kept it that way.
The scorched baseball clanged off the facing of the right-field luxury boxes and virtually everyone at the Metrodome turned into a Tino Martinez fan before he finished trotting out the three-run homer in the Yankee fourth. It was very loud, much louder than it should have been for an opposing player. 
 These two snippets underscored the Yankees' 11-0 victory tonight. Who could blame the fans for respectfully cheering Martinez's major league best 38th homer? They could not be excited about the pitching of Rich Robertson, who dropped his eighth straight decision as the Yankees concluded a 6-2 road trip with a season-high 21 hits.
Pettitte was the polar opposite of Robertson in nearly notching the second shutout of his career and his second in five weeks. The valiant left-hander stifled Minnesota on five hits in eight innings before yielding to Jim Mecir and permitted only two Twins to reach third base in winning his team-best 14th game. He struck out nine and walked three.
"It's usually a tough call, but tonight I was out of gas," said Pettitte, who whiffed two with the bases loaded in the eighth to keep the shutout intact. "I don't know how I got through the seventh, I was so stiff. I felt like I had good stuff tonight and I mixed it up."
Tonight was one of those nights that the Yankees proved how impressive a team they can be, while winning for the 11th time in the last 14 games.
"We're probably playing better now than we were last year," said Manager Joe Torre, whose 1997 team (69-47) has the identical record of the 1996 team after 116 games. "Last year, we were trying to protect a lead. This year, we're chasing. I sort of like the way we're doing it now better."
Pettitte pitched splendidly and the defense was sensational. But it was the hitting that was truly awesome. Martinez, who has the most homers by a Yankee first baseman since Lou Gehrig's 49 in 1936, also poked a run-scoring single to give him 108 r.b.i. Curtis, who socked five hits, now has seven in a row and might keep Tim Raines on the bench forever And Luis Sojo, the Mariano Duncan of this year, had three hits and scored twice.
Because the Yankees fashioned their best road trip since going 6-2 in Cleveland and Minnesota last June, they quietly sliced first-place Baltimore's bulge from six games to four and a half games in the last week. Torre has already admitted that the Yankees will probably not catch the Orioles if they do not sputter, but the two teams will meet eight times next month so Torre could be playing possum. More important for the Yankees, their slick play has enabled them to maintain a lead in the battle for the wild-card berth.
Pettitte was economical in squashing the Twins for the second time in 11 days. He bulldozed through a tough jam in the third. With runners on first and second, he whiffed Denny Hocking and exhaled, then heard the crowd go silent when Molitor's shot died on the warning track. The Twins died after that.
Robertson was more of a target than a pitcher in a four-run third. Bernie Williams hammered a one-out single off Robertson's left shin to put runners on first and second and Paul O'Neill's two-out chopper bounced off the left-hander's glove to knock in the first run. Charlie Hayes doubled in two runs and Curtis doubled in another for a 4-0 cushion.
With one out and Derek Jeter on third in the fourth, Manager Tom Kelly of the Twins had Robertson walk Williams and face Martinez. It was a poor decision because Martinez drilled an off-speed pitch 371 feet for a three-run homer.
"You know how Tino is, he's intense," Torre said. "He needed that one. He's a very intense guy. That three-run homer helped his personality. It helped ours, too."
 
INSIDE PITCH
KENNY ROGERS said the muscle stiffness between his right shoulder blade and spine that caused him to leave Sunday's game after three innings has subsided. The left-hander felt that he would be able to pitch in about five days and vowed that he would not go on the disabled list. "This isn't something you go on the d.l. for," Rogers said. "It's not that bad. I ain't going on the d.l." Manager JOE TORRE said Rogers would be evaluated in a few days. . . . TIM RAINES will be activated Tuesday and DARRYL STRAWBERRY was expected to follow him to the majors this weekend. . . . The Yankees claimed the right-handed pitcher JOSE ALBERRO off waivers from Texas, where he was 0-3 with a 7.94 earned run average in 10 games. He was optioned to Class AAA Columbus. . . . Outfielder SCOTT POSE will likely be demoted to Columbus when Raines is activated, with pitcher JIM MECIR expected to join him once HIDEKI IRABU is promoted Wednesday. MARK WHITEN or PETE INCAVIGLIA will be sacrificed when Strawberry arrives.

HEADLINE: Where Tribe Saw Promise, Democrats Saw Pledge

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
In June 1996, Charles Surveyor, an American Indian leader from Oklahoma, found himself in heady company at a White House luncheon. Along with top executives of a handful of big companies, he was getting to make his case to the President, and this was his best chance, Mr. Surveyor thought, to win the return of 7,500 acres taken by the Government more than a century ago.
For 20 minutes, the President listened intently as Mr. Surveyor, the chairman of the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, described his impoverished people's 50-year struggle to regain their sacred -- and enormously valuable -- land. In an interview on the reservation near Concho, Okla., Mr. Surveyor recalled that Mr. Clinton had looked him square in the eye and said, "We'll see what we can do to help you." 
 Those few words of encouragement from the President led the 11,000-member tribe to keep its pledge to contribute $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee, which amounted to nearly 18 months of bingo earnings. Even then, the Indians did not have quite enough.
The tribe's first political contribution, and the flow of other donations to an event that one fund-raiser described as an "intimate White House luncheon," is now being criticized by Senate Republicans investigating possible campaign finance abuses. Though the money was later returned, and the President took no action, the Republicans call it one of the most explicit examples of the aggressive role the White House played in Democratic Party fund-raising in 1996.
Unlike the slightly larger fund-raising coffees that have drawn wide attention, the luncheon included only seven guests. At the coffees the President spoke broadly to the group about a variety of issues, whereas at the luncheon, some guests said, they were able to raise specific issues with Mr. Clinton.
Though the President "made no promises" to his tribe, Mr. Surveyor said, he returned to the reservation, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City, so overcome with joy that he was nearly speechless.
Michael C. Copperthite, a campaign manager and consultant to the Democratic Party, said, "They went back to Oklahoma thinking they were walking among the gods."
Mr. Copperthite has tried since December to help the tribe reclaim the land from the Agriculture Department. It includes unmarked graves, ritual dance grounds and an estimated $500 million in oil and gas reserves.
It was the tribe's idea to contribute $100,000, after a lawyer it had hired suggested that a large campaign contribution would get the Administration's attention and buy two seats at the White House luncheon, tribal officials said.
Fourteen months later, the tribe is still waiting for good news from Washington.
 
The Luncheon
Plenty of Company From Corporations
The Cheyenne-Arapaho tribal members were not the only guests at that luncheon to give $50,000 apiece to the Democratic National Committee.
Executives of several big companies were also there and at least two, the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company, and Fidelity Investments, contributed $50,000 each within several weeks. A third company, the Beneficial Corporation, a financial services company, gave $100,000. Executives from all three corporations denied that their contributions bought the invitations or were linked to any promises from Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Surveyor said that a party fund-raiser, Michael Turpin, told him a week before the luncheon that if the tribe contributed $100,000 to attend, they would be given an opportunity to take their quest directly to Mr. Clinton.
A Philadelphia businessman, Peter L. Buttenwieser, has said that Terry McAuliffe, the finance chairman for the Clinton-Gore campaign, tried to sell him admission to the same lunch for a $50,000 campaign contribution.
"I would not, under any circumstances, pay $50,000, or any stipulated amount, to break bread with President Clinton," Mr. Buttenwieser wrote in a June 20, 1996, letter to Mr. McAuliffe. "Luncheon, yes. Luncheon for a contribution price, no!"
Mr. McAuliffe responded in an interview, "Of the thousands upon thousands of people whom I called for money, if one person misinterpreted what I said, then so be it."
Lanny J. Davis, the White House special counsel, denied that fund-raisers had established a "financial requirement" to attend the luncheon. Mr. Davis also said the President routinely listened to concerns of people at White House luncheons and coffees.
"I would say, as a general matter, that it would not be surprising for the President to listen to a concern expressed by a visitor," Mr. Davis said. "In such a situation, the President would often express sympathy or at the very least promise to look into the matter raised."
Mr. Davis added, "No solicitation for funds occurred at this event, and no change of policy or commitment to change policy was expressed by the President as a result of anyone attending this event."
 
The Tribe
A Poor People Make a Big Gamble
After the tribe's contribution was first reported last March, the Democratic National Committee quickly announced that it was returning the donation, which it said had not been reported to the Federal Election Commission because of an oversight. Committee leaders said they returned the money because they wanted to be clear that there was no link between a donation and a fair hearing on the request for the return of tribal lands.
And two weeks ago, Newsweek magazine reported that tribal leaders had contemplated hiring a Washington firm to investigate Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who has opposed the tribe's efforts to regain the land. Tribal leaders said they wanted to prove that Senator Nickles opposed the return of the land because he had ties to the oil and gas industry, which is also interested in acquiring the land. The tribe has chosen not to hire the firm.
During the Senate hearings on campaign finance, Mr. Nickles accused the Democrats of orchestrating a "shakedown" of the tribe. But tribal leaders in Oklahoma watched the hearing with bemusement.
"He is no friend of ours," said Archie D. Hoffman, 60, the secretary of the Tribal Business Committee, "but he is pretending that he is. "We're fighting Nickles on this. We gave that money to get around him."
In an interview, Mr. Nickles said the suggestion that he was blocking the tribe because of oil and gas ties was "hogwash." He said he was outraged that the tribe was asked to make good on their pledge, and had to use emergency money, which he said the tribe needed to pay for funerals and utility bills, to make contributions.
"I just think this was an outlandish shakedown by the Clinton Administration," Mr. he said. "If they were promised something in exchange for a contribution, that happens to be called bribery. It is wrong. And when you are hitting up a group like this, a very low-income tribe, it makes it doubly as bad."
Mr. Surveyor, 42, said, "The impression I got is the President would try to help us, as best he could, and do everything possible."
Recalling his report to tribe members, he said, "And when I told them what the President said, everyone said, 'This is it.' "
Because Oklahoma prohibits casino gambling by its 39 tribes, the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe has not benefited from a high-stakes gambling windfall. Instead, it has managed to survive on $5,000 a month from a bingo hall whose parking lot is usually nearly empty. Sixty-three percent of the tribe's 10,890 members are unemployed. Those with jobs earn average annual incomes of $6,074, Bureau of Indian Affairs statistics show.
 
The Land
An 1883 Promise Remains Unfulfilled
Tribal leaders say they believe their economic salvation is connected to the 7,500 acres known as the Fort Reno lands, taken from the tribe in 1883. Tribal leaders said they hoped to develop the land and turn Fort Reno, into a tourist attraction.
According to an executive order by President Chester A. Arthur in 1883, the land was to be returned to the tribe when it was no longer used for military purposes. In 1948 Fort Reno was closed, but the land was shifted to the Agriculture Department.
The tribe has tried, in vain, to persuade officials in Washington to declare the land surplus or to have the President to return it.
In 1994, tribal leaders went to Mr. Nickles's office in Washington, but they said a Nickles aide denied them an opportunity to meet with the Senator. Mr. Hoffman said that was when they decided to form a political action committee and register thousands of American Indians to vote.
In November 1995, the tribe sought the advice of Michael Turpin, the former Oklahoma Attorney General who was chairman of the Oklahoma Democratic Party. Mr. Turpin, who was paid $10,000 by the tribe to lobby for the return of the land, suggested that tribal leaders could gain the Administration's attention by contributing $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Turpin did not return calls to his Oklahoma law office.
"We knew it was a lot of money," said Richard Grellner, the tribe's lawyer, "but we figured it was the best way for us to be heard."
Tribal leaders said that they agreed to give $100,000 and that Mr. Turpin then called to say they could have two seats at a White House luncheon with the President for $100,000. The tribe accepted the invitation but did not write a check until after the luncheon, they said. That amount made the tribe the largest donor in Oklahoma.
Both Mr. Surveyor and Tyler Todd, another tribal leader who attended the lunch on June 17, 1996, recalled that Mr. Clinton listened carefully to them. Mr. Surveyor said Mr. Clinton asked how the land was taken and whether Senator Nickles had helped the tribe, and said he would try to help.
The next day, Mr. Surveyor returned to his reservation and asked tribal leaders to approve the $100,000 contribution. A few were doubtful about parting with $100,000, he said.
James Pedro, one of eight elected members of the Tribal Business Committee, argued, "I guess the bottom line here is that we committed -- we can't back out now," Mr. Pedro told his fellow tribe members, according to a transcript of the meeting.
The committee agreed to cash in its certificates of deposit and wired $87,671.74 to the Democratic National Committee on June 27, 1996. Within weeks, Democratic fund-raisers told the tribe it still owed about $12,000. The tribe then gave $20,000 more for the President's birthday dinner at Radio City Music Hall on Aug. 19.
After last November's election, Mr. Grellner said, "all of a sudden, we were off their radar screen."
 
The Offer
Oil And Gas Rights In Return for Help
Last December, the tribe sought the help of Mr. Copperthite, the Democratic campaign manager, who said in an interview that he had put the tribal leaders in touch with Nathan Landow, a Democratic fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. Landow, a wealthy developer, offered to help the tribe if its leaders agreed to give him 10 percent of the oil and gas rights to the land for 20 years, according to a contract he signed and sent the tribe in March.
Mr. Copperthite and Mr. Grellner both said that Mr. Landow told the tribe that without the deal, they would never get their land back.
Mr. Landow denied making a threat, saying he tried "to explain to them that it seemed obvious that after close to 100 years of effort, they must be doing something wrong. And they should try to select people that can help them."
In March, a day after The Washington Post and The Philadelphia Inquirer published articles about Mr. Landow's proposed deal, the tribe began discussions with Cody Shearer, who identified himself as a friend of the President and offered to help them without charge, tribal leaders said.
Mr. Shearer insisted, however, that the tribe keep the matter quiet, Mr. Grellner said. Mr. Shearer did not return phone calls to his Washington office. And a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "As far as we know, no one had any awareness of what Mr. Shearer was doing."
Mr. Shearer offered to get an answer within 10 days, Mr. Grellner said, but the 10 days turned into 10 weeks, the tribe became suspicious of Mr. Shearer's motives, Mr. Grellner said.
"I think he just wanted to keep us quiet until the campaign finance hearings ended," Mr. Grellner said.
That seems unlikely now. The F.B.I. has been here, and several lawyers and investigators with the Senate committee investigating campaign finance abuses plan to visit this week to talk with tribal leaders.
Mr. Surveyor said he would tell the investigators what the President told him, and how much it meant to his tribe. He said he would continue to fight for his land, though he planned to stay far from Washington for a while.
"It's pretty hard to trust people from that town," Mr. Surveyor said.

State's Private Investing Is Up

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
State investment in private building projects increased 79 percent during the first half of 1997, indicating continued growth in New Jersey's economy, state officials said yesterday.
From January through June, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority issued $522 million in bonds to help finance 145 projects costing a total of $831 million, said Rose M. Smith, a spokeswoman for the agency. A year earlier, the state invested $292 million in bonds to assist 116 projects worth $385 million, Ms. Smith said. 
 This year's projects, which include expansion of St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, will create 1,400 permanent jobs and 3,650 construction jobs, more than were created in the first half of last year, Ms. Smith said.

HEADLINE: Budget Bill's Downfall

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Peter Passell (Economic Scene, Aug. 7) argues persuasively that an eventual rise in the Federal deficit will likely more than offset the rise in household savings resulting from the new balanced-budget bill. We should also note that we are at the peak of the business cycle, with full employment and correspondingly large tax revenues. 
 A pause in growth will certainly increase the deficit beyond the bill's forecast. Then, to make the budget balance, we will have to forgo the usual built-in, counter-cyclical mechanisms like unemployment or welfare payments and see any recession prolonged. The bill is a monstrosity. It will almost certainly be abandoned before 2002, the year projected for the balanced budget.
Business should be ashamed of itself for letting ideology and special interest displace the principle that what is good for the country is good for business.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Markets Fall, Paring Early Gains by Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose modestly yesterday, erasing some early gains as United States financial markets fell and offsetting the positive effects of a decision by the German central bank to leave a key money-market rate unchanged.
"The Dow tumbled, bonds tumbled and then the dollar tumbled," said Jay Werthheimer, senior currency trader at Banco di Sicilia. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 101.27, most of it in late trading; bond prices declined less steeply, with yields at the highest level in almost six weeks. 
 The dollar had risen against the mark earlier in New York trading after the Germans left their 14-day repurchase rate unchanged at 3 percent. Still, the dollar's gains were limited as the central bank set the rate for one week rather than the usual two weeks.
Some German bank officials, concerned about the recent slide in the value of the mark, had recently hinted at the possibility of a rate increase, though most analysts were skeptical that such a step would be taken in light of the country's 11 percent-plus unemployment. While a rate increase would make investments in marks more attractive, it could also hamper an economic recovery by raising borrowing costs.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.8645 marks, up slightly from 1.8634 on Monday. The dollar also rose a bit against the Japanese yen, settling at 116.43, up from 116.12 yen on Monday. It rose, too, against the British pound, which fell to $1.5802 from $1.5922.
Southeast Asian currencies continued to tumble after a spokeswoman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore suggested that the agency would not resist a decline in that currency's value. "Investors have looked at the prospects and risks in individual markets and reacted accordingly," the spokeswoman said. "The exchange rate is appropriate to what's happening in the market."
The dollar rose to a three-year high of 1.5140 Singapore dollars in Asian trading. It also rose to a three-and-a-half-year high of 2.7945 Malaysian ringgit. Currencies in Thailand and Indonesia slumped, as well.
Financial troubles in Thailand have prompted a selloff of South and Southeast Asian currencies in recent weeks, leading to a $16 billion international rescue program.

HEADLINE: Norman B. Ture, Architect of the 1981 Tax Cut, Dies at 74

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Norman B. Ture, an uncompromising advocate of supply-side economics and an architect of the 1981 tax cut that was one of the largest in the nation's history, died on Sunday at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 74.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, said a friend, Barry Rogstad. 
 For the better part of 30 years beginning in the early 1950's, both Democratic and Republican Presidents, as well as many Congressional leaders, sought out Mr. Ture for his advice on taxes and supply-side theory, the economic concept built on the belief that lower taxes spur greater economic growth.
He was, in the judgment of Jude Wanniski, an economic consultant in Morristown, N.J., and a longtime advocate of supply-side thinking, "the one American who bridged the Kennedy and Reagan tax cuts" both of which lowered individual tax rates at times when the economy was lagging.
Supply-side economics has long divided political leaders and economists. Opponents say the economy suffered from huge budget deficits throughout the 1980's in part because the 1981 tax cut was not accompanied by equivalent offsetting spending cuts. Proponents counter that the 1981 cut laid the groundwork for today's growth, low inflation and unemployment.
Mr. Ture was a consultant to Representative Wilbur D. Mills, the Arkansas Democrat who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 1960's.
"The speech that Wilbur Mills gave in 1963 that introduced the Kennedy tax cut proposal was written by Norman Ture," Mr. Wanniski said. "John Kennedy was a wall-to-wall supply-sider."
Not everyone agrees with that. Still, President Kennedy adopted key elements of supply-side economics, Mr. Wanniski said, after "the usual Keynesian ideas, like investment tax credits, didn't do anything" and pushed tax cuts to revive the economy.
President Lyndon B. Johnson won passage of the Kennedy tax cut after assuming office in 1963 and, Mr. Wanniski said, "Norman Ture was part of that action."
When asked whether Mr. Ture was a Republican or a Democrat, Mr. Wanniski said: "Nobody knew what his politics were. He was a tax guy."
It turns out that Mr. Ture was a Republican, said Stephen J. Entin, a resident scholar at the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation in Washington.
Mr. Ture founded the institute, which Mr. Entin described as "a nonpartisan, free-market think tank," in 1977, left it in 1981 to join the Reagan Administration and returned to it as president in 1982, after he quit the Administration to protest repeals of parts of the 1981 tax cut.
People have stumbled over the pronunciation of the economist's name. His wife, Donna Cramer, said today that the family traditionally had pronounced it TOO-ray, until he became Under Secretary of the Treasury for Tax and Economic Affairs in 1981 and an article in The New York Times rendered it too-RAY. That led others to pronounce it with the stress on the second syllable, she said, and Mr. Ture decided to adopt that pronunciation himself.
Mr. Ture was born in Cleveland and received a master's and doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago. He served in the Army in World War II.
He was a member of the Treasury Department's tax analysis staff from 1951 to 1955 and a staff member of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress from 1955 to 1961. So thorough was his knowledge of the subject that Mr. Entin said today: "Someone once told me that when people came to Wilbur Mills with tax questions, he told them, 'Talk to Norman about it. He understands taxes.' "
Mr. Ture served on tax panels for President Richard M. Nixon and was director of tax studies at the National Bureau of Economics. He taught economics at George Washington University, the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania and at Illinois College.
Mr. Ture's marriages to Pearl Roberts and Daphne Laird ended in divorce.
Besides Ms. Cramer, he is survived by their daughter, Claire Cramer-Ture of Alexandria; three daughters from his marriage to Ms. Roberts, Julianne Ture of Boston, Heather Turey of Capitola, Calif., and Martha Ture of Fairfax, Calif.; a son from that marriage, Peter Ture of Bethesda, Md.; a stepdaughter, Keli Cramer of Baltimore, and two grandchildren.
Mr. Wanniski and Mr. Entin described today how Mr. Ture got to play a pivotal role in pushing the 1981 tax cut. "When Reagan was elected in 1980 and needed people who knew how to move this issue along, the search led to Norman Ture," Mr. Wanniski said. "Reagan chose Donald Regan as his Treasury Secretary. All of us supply-siders were nervous about Regan."
But they were pleased when Mr. Regan chose Mr. Ture, their candidate for the top tax post in Treasury.
"Norman came in as a chief architect of the 1981 tax cuts," Mr. Entin said. "But as soon as the ink was dry on the 1981 act, there were people in Washington who wanted to repeal parts of it, and in 1982 they repealed large parts of the business section that constituted serious back-tracking by the Administration.
"Norman resigned in 1982, largely in protest over the over the tax increase that repealed substantial portions of the 1981 law," Mr. Entin said. "He was one of the few people who went in on principle and went out on principle. He didn't compromise."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Huizenga, Toyota and the Perils of Lawsuits

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 12

 BODY:
A vicious legal fight between H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries and two Japanese auto makers is proving that few problems can be as deadly to a stock as the uncertainty created by big lawsuits.
Republic's stock closed today at $23.4375, having lost nearly half its value since reaching a high of $42.75 on Jan. 23. This precipitous drop in a rising market is particularly serious for Republic, which has an expansion strategy of using its stock to buy up other businesses. 
 Republic blames Toyota and Honda -- which have sued Republic to block it from buying some of their dealerships -- for the stock slide. "They are deliberately trying to hurt the stock," Mr. Huizenga said in an interview today. "I think they know they can't stop us, but I think they are just trying to slow us down."
The auto makers denied that they were deliberately trying to hurt Republic's stock and said that their lawsuits were intended to force Republic to comply with their rules limiting the rapid acquisition of dealerships. "There's not one shred of truth to his allegation," said James E. Press, senior vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. "When they disregard our policies, what other choice do we have?"
Both Toyota and Honda have allowed Republic to buy some dealerships, but have sought to limit the number it can buy quickly. Art P. Garner, a Honda spokesman, said his company's suit had nothing to do with Republic's stock price. "Our intent is to protect the Honda brand name and the Honda image," Mr. Garner said. "The only way to challenge them is in court."
Wall Street analysts agree that the lawsuits have hurt investor confidence in Republic, though opinion is divided on the extent to which the auto makers have used the courts as a tool in their commercial fight with Mr. Huizenga's company.
Since last winter, Republic has agreed to buy 153 dealerships belonging to various auto makers, becoming the nation's largest owner of car dealerships. Nearly all the transactions have been paid for with Republic stock.
But the decline in the stock's value means that nearly twice as many shares are now required for comparably valued deals; in Republic's view, that shows that the filing of lawsuits can sometimes do as much damage as the eventual rulings do. "It has had a definite effect on our stock," said Mr. Huizenga, who acknowledged that buying dealerships had now gotten more costly. "It is expensive, but we are still going forward because we have a strategy and a plan."
The Big Three American auto makers have not raised significant objections to Republic's series of deals because they have been trying to thin their own ranks of dealers, and Republic's consolidation plans align with their interests. "The Republic strategy plays into their hands," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto analyst with Lehman Brothers.
Indeed, some have even taken a page from Republic's playbook: the Ford Motor Company has begun to consolidate its dealerships in Indianapolis and Salt Lake City by investing with local dealers there to form groups that will close the weakest outlets.
"We believe in the franchise system," Alexander Trotman, chief executive of Ford, said in an interview last week. However, he added, "We can't sit still and let the world go by as we see what might be a revolution."
While Wall Street analysts agree that the legal fight is making investors less willing to buy Republic stock, they said that the lawsuits were not the only cause of the slide in the stock price. Rival dealership groups have turned in disappointing earnings, and analysts are uncertain how the new groups would perform in an economic downturn, Mr. Phillippi of Lehman Brothers said. But the legal fight certainly "has colored investors' sentiments," he said.
Others agree. "It has held the stock back from performing as well as the market," said Thomas M. Galvin, a managing director of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
Toyota sought on April 2 to block Republic's purchase of a Toyota franchise in Houston. Republic's stock dropped more than 10 percent on the news. Since Honda sued Republic on May 6 to stop it from carrying out a plan to buy more than 60 Honda and Acura dealerships in the next 18 months, Republic's stock has drifted down to trade between $20 and $25 a share. (Honda amended its suit today to reflect what it said were "numerous violations" of its dealership policies.)
Recently, Republic has been using the courts to fight back. Last Thursday, it filed a petition with the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Commission seeking an order that would allow it to buy dealerships in Tennessee; in addition, it is seeking civil and criminal penalties and sanctions against Toyota over the auto maker's attempt to block the sales. Today, Republic filed a lawsuit in Alabama charging Toyota with unfair and deceptive trade practices.
Particularly angry these days are car dealers who thought they had made fortunes by selling their family businesses to Republic, only to have the transactions tied up in court by auto producers. The dealers and Republic point to state franchise laws requiring that auto makers approve sales of dealerships, unless the buyer fails to meet simple standards such as having "good character."
And a Toyota dealer in Spokane filed a complaint with the Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles accusing Toyota of blocking the sale of his dealership to Republic.
Other dealers are also upset. "I have the right in this country and in this state to sell my business as long as the buyer is qualified -- this isn't Japan and this isn't Russia," said Ronald M. Salhany, a Florida car dealer who has been blocked by Toyota from completing the $45 million sale of two Lexus dealerships to Republic. "If I lose my merger agreement, which ends Sept. 9, I'm suing them."
But Toyota officials have insisted that they have the right to add a provision to their franchise agreements limiting the rate at which any buyer can snap up dealerships. They have lost patience as Republic has continued to sign acquisition agreements with Toyota dealers even while continuing to negotiate with Toyota executives.
"They keep saying they want to be partners, and my grandfather said to me many years ago, 'Listen to what people say but watch what they do," Mr. Press of Toyota said.

Bond Prices Record Fifth Loss in a Row

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury market, after being pummeled by dealers and investors for four sessions because of a poor quarterly refunding and concern that a strong economy would lead the Fed to raise interest rates, enjoyed a brief respite yesterday morning, only to reverse course and chalk up its fifth loss in a row.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 13/32, to 96 7/32, to yield 6.67 percent, up from 6.64 percent on Monday. That was its highest level since July 2, when it was 6.71 percent. 
 Encouraged in the morning by a report of a drop in weekly retail sales ahead of today's July report, market participants bought bonds in what many thought were oversold conditions. In addition, the Atlanta Fed report on business activity showed a pickup in July, while its inflation signals were mixed. This apparently eased concern that a resurging economy would accelerate inflation.
However, in the afternoon, the LJR Redbook report showed that weekly retail sales rose a higher-than-expected nine-tenths of 1 percent in the first week of August, and that turned market sentiment bearish again.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said it was easy to get the prices of Treasury securities to move higher after reaching an oversold condition. "What I'm seeing today is a lot of hedge-fund buying," he said, and some follow through as a result of reports on Monday that a Fed governor, Susan Phillips, had suggested the Fed would not raise interest rates soon.
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said the release of the Redbook report had accelerated a decline that began on rumors of a large seller of zero-coupon bonds.
"It tells you that even after showing decent gains for the first time in almost a week, the market's basic makeup is still fragile ahead of retail sales and producer price numbers," Mr. Jones said.
"It tells you a lot when the market comes down over a full point off its high for the day," he said. "We dropped on a rumor and a strong weekly retail reports, which two weeks ago wouldn't have caused a ripple. We expect tomorrow's retail sales report to show a gain of 0.8 percent and the P.P.I. to be up 0.1 percent over all and at the core, excluding food and energy. Even if everything comes in as expected, the trend is toward higher yields going into the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week."
David Ader, regional director of fixed income for Technical Data of Boston, said the market had demonstrated a frightening ability to come down a lot faster than it goes up, showing that many who are holding Treasury securities "are very nervous about their positions." He said the market might improve if forthcoming economic reports, "especially retail sales, come in friendly." But, he added, "I am convinced that there will also be a lot of selling into that strength as these longs get out."
"Bottom line," Mr. Ader said, "until we unwind the refunding paper and strong selling, the Street is going to continue to view upticks as an opportunity to lighten up, even with good information."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Rate Of Productivity Is Up Only a Bit

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The productivity growth rate of American workers -- measuring how much more they produce in an hour on the job -- rose at an annual rate of only six-tenths of a percent in the second quarter, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The announcement was greeted with hoots of criticism from a growing number of economists and business people who insist that the official data greatly understate a flourishing efficiency in the workplace.
"The numbers must be wrong; they must be understated," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "There is no way we could have had the outstanding economic performance this country has had over the last couple of years if those numbers were remotely accurate." 
 The new Labor Department numbers were doubly disappointing for those who hold, as Mr. Steinberg does, that the boom in corporate profits and stock prices, and the low inflation rate result chiefly from rising productivity. In the spring, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics had announced a spurt in productivity in the first quarter, and the productivity optimists had expected the second-quarter data to reinforce this trend -- finally giving their views statistical support.
Instead, not only was the second-quarter number weak, but the bureau revised downward the bullish first-quarter number. Productivity growth for all of American business except farms grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in that quarter, the bureau said, not the 2.6 percent originally reported.
The latest report seemed to intensify a spreading debate between those who believe the American economy has entered a new prosperous era characterized by rising productivity and those who resist embracing such a concept in the absence of statistical evidence from the Labor Department, the official scorekeeper.
"The way I would put this is that the burden of proof is on someone who thinks there is a dramatic change, and every quarter that comes along without it is some evidence against that view," said Robert M. Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics.
Productivity, in everyone's view, is the path to rising income, profits and standard of living. When a worker -- making shoes or repairing a car or cleaning a suit -- increases in a single hour the sales revenue from his or her output to, say, $102 from $100, then that worker's productivity growth rate is 2 percent. The additional revenue can go into profit or raises or both. And a company can prosper, along with its workers, without having to raise prices.
The productivity growth rate nationwide averaged 2.8 percent annually from 1947 until 1973. Since then, it has averaged 1 percent, or less, according to the official data, and yesterday's second-quarter report reconfirmed that trend. For the 12 months through the second quarter, productivity rose at an annual rate of seven-tenths of a percent, down from a revised 1.1 percent in the year ended with the first quarter.
The Labor Department also said that in the 1990's the annual productivity rate for nonfarm business has averaged 1 percent, including an upward revision to 1.3 percent in 1996 from a previously estimated seven-tenths of a percent.
Most of the weak productivity growth this year came from downward revisions in output -- the revenue from selling what workers produce -- without similar downward revisions in hours worked. The big exception, as usual, was in manufacturing, where productivity rose by 3.2 percent in the second quarter, up from 2.5 percent in the first quarter. That implied that productivity in the much larger and harder to measure service and financial sectors of the economy was very weak.
But Mr. Steinberg and others say this cannot be. The combination in recent years of sharply rising corporate profits and a small upturn in wages has convinced them that rising productivity is generating the extra revenue to make this possible throughout a strong economy. They cite the low inflation rate as evidence for this view. If they are wrong, the prosperous combination could come apart.
The official data, they say, are failing to capture technology's growing contribution to productivity, for example, or the hidden output generated by computer software, or the true efficiency of service sector workers, or the organizational improvements in corporate America.
The opposite side in this debate says the contribution of computers to productivity is greatly overstated, the service sector includes large areas of inefficient labor and much production today is often labor intensive.
Some of the dispute stems from a disagreement over the proper measure of output. Should it be the sum of the revenue from the sale of every worker's output, known as the product side of the ledger? Or should it be the sum of all the "income," that is, the wages, salaries, profits and dividends earned from all the sales? In theory, the two should be equal, but lately income has been higher, suggesting a higher productivity number -- if only, the optimists argue, the Labor Department would shift to using "income" instead of "product."
Government statisticians reject this shift, arguing that the product calculation is more accurate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is using the best available data, said Edwin Dean, chief of the bureau's productivity division. "Our methodology for computing labor productivity is widely accepted."
The bureau also reported that unit labor costs, the wages and benefits paid for each unit of output, had risen at a 2.4 percent annual rate, down from 3.1 percent in the first quarter. That meant that wage costs were exercising less upward pressure on prices, thus dampening the inflation rate. What is more, compensation per hour worked rose at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the second quarter, down from 4.5 percent in the first period.

HEADLINE: Affluent Turning to Public Colleges

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
The nation's public four-year colleges and universities, long the backbone of economic opportunity for moderate-income Americans, are increasingly serving the economic elite, who as a group no longer put so high a premium on private education.
The proportion of students from rich families sending their children to public universities has risen sharply in the last 15 years, according to data to be published next month by Michael McPherson of Macalaster College in St. Paul and Morton Schapiro of the University of Southern California. 
 These two economists estimate that 38 percent of the college freshmen from families earning more than $200,000 a year enrolled in public institutions in 1994, compared with 31 percent in 1980.
Those findings are underscored by recent studies in Minnesota, Florida and Oregon showing that students in four-year public institutions come from wealthier families, on average, than their counterparts in private colleges and universities in those states.
The gentrification of public colleges accents what Tom Kane, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, calls "the simmering crisis" in education finance. And it is a crisis carrying its full share of questions about fairness.
While the demand for higher education is widely expected to rise by a third in the next decade, there is little indication that state legislatures are prepared to come up with the greater subsidies to support the extra students at the public institutions. If across-the-board tuition increases are used to fill the gap, Mr. McPherson argues, "the poor will bear the brunt," because an even higher percentage of places in four-year public colleges will be filled by students whose parents could have paid the full cost of their education. This, in turn, will tighten the financial noose on private colleges that depend on affluent families to pay a disproportionate share of the institution's bills.
"Parents are buying college the way they buy consumer goods," concluded Mr. Schapiro, co-author of the forthcoming "Student Aid Game" (Princeton University Press). "They're saying to themselves, 'Why pay full tuition at Stanford when you can get almost as good an education at Berkeley for one-third the price?' "
Economists and educators suggest that the findings challenge the underlying logic of the way public higher education is priced. With strong support from taxes, most public institutions charge uniform fees to all. But many experts argue that one-tuition-fits-all pricing unfairly burdens taxpayers and hard-pressed middle-income students alike. The better way, they assert, would be to charge on a sliding scale according to family income, long the approach of private colleges with strong commitments to equitable access.
"The taxpayers are getting less education for fewer people than they could have with means-tested tuition policies," argued James Day, a consultant on education finance in Minneapolis.
It has long been conventional wisdom that public higher education is the way up for the hard-working children of low- and moderate-income families, while the affluent enjoy the perquisites of private college. In fact, the numbers show how much these demographic lines are blurring.
One reason is the price of private education. Mr. McPherson and Mr. Schapiro calculate that in 1992-93, families with incomes exceeding $60,000 paid an average of $11,600 for tuition at private four-year colleges, compared with just $3,100 at public colleges.
Another reason is the shrinking difference in perceived quality between private and public education, given fine state-financed flagship campuses from San Diego to Ann Arbor to Chapel Hill.
And the consumerist approach to picking colleges has been psychologically validated by heavily publicized college rankings that factor in price as well as quality, giving new prominence to institutions like the State University of New York at Binghamton.
Recalculating all their numbers in terms of 1994 dollars, Mr. Schapiro and Mr. McPherson found that the proportion of families with incomes exceeding $200,000 that sent their children to the best public research-oriented institutions -- places like Indiana University and the University of Wisconsin -- rose to 24.6 percent in 1994 from 19.6 percent in 1980.
Equally striking, the upper middle class has discovered the relative virtues of second-tier public four-year colleges, like those in the California State system, that compete with less selective private institutions.
The proportion of families with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 that enrolled freshmen in these public colleges rose to 20.1 percent in 1994 from 15.5 percent in 1980, adding to state education costs and depriving private colleges of the students, increasingly rare, who could be expected to pay the full sticker price.
Those national results are reinforced by research in individual states.
A 1991 study underwritten by the Lilly Endowment showed that students at the University of Minnesota's three main campuses came from families with a median income within a few dollars of their counterparts at the state's private colleges. The proportion of enrollees with family incomes between $45,000 and $80,000 was actually higher at the state university.
A 1993 report by the Postsecondary Education Planning Commission in Florida showed that undergraduates at all public four-year institutions came from families with a median income of $50,750, while those in private colleges had median family incomes of $45,850.
In Oregon, corresponding figures for 1992, estimated by the Human Capital Research Corporation, based in Chicago, were $47,210 for public colleges and $45,734 for private.
The pattern may ring a bell among those with long memories.
In the 1960's, the explosive growth of state university systems was hailed as a triumph of liberal capitalism, a distinct American variation on the welfare state that emphasized opportunity over entitlement. Two economists, Lee Hansen of the University of Wisconsin and Burton Weisbrod of Northwestern University, demurred, publishing a study that challenged the logic of taxing low-income Californians to educate the children of the elite in the highly regarded California system. The education establishment noted their argument, and brushed it aside.
But now Mr. Kane, of the Kennedy School of Government, argues that the issue is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.
According to the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, a year at the average four-year public college cost the institution $12,100 to deliver in 1994. That cost, rising rapidly, has been partly buffered over the last 15 years by a 15 percent decline in total enrollment, entirely a result of the drop in the college-age population.
But the demographic trend is about to reverse, with a 20 percent rise among that population in the next 15 years. And the total demand for space in college classrooms, turbocharged both by new Federal tax incentives and by compelling evidence that a four-year degree nearly doubles average lifetime earnings, is likely to rise by far more.
If the past is precedent, states will respond with austerity measures -- "more teaching assistants and televisions, fewer and larger classes," as Gordon Winston, an economist at Williams College, puts it.
By the same token, tuition increases are a certainty. According to the Department of Education, four-year public colleges raised charges by 91 percent from 1980 to 1995, even after adjustments for general price inflation.
Mr. Winston argues that higher tuition is not necessarily a bad thing, inasmuch as so many of the beneficiaries of state-supported colleges are more affluent than the average state taxpayer. He supports raising the sticker price of public education to cover a higher proportion of its total cost, along with means-tested scholarships that offset the increases for low-income families.
Among other advantages, this would give a lift to private institutions that still educate nearly one-quarter of those attending four-year colleges.
But states have never been inclined to link college fees to ability to pay. Typically, notes Brian Zucker, head of the Human Capital Research Corporation, tuition goes up only when legislators are wrestling with budget deficits.
"There is no relationship between changes in tuition and changes in need-based financial aid," Mr. Zucker concluded.
Mr. Day, the education finance consultant, sees all this as a classic case of elected officials' following the path of least political resistance. "Legislators have found it convenient to buy into the myth that one tuition fits all," he said.
This suggests that four-year public colleges will remain a refuge for affluent bargain-hunters and, in spite of new Federal tax breaks, that the barriers to attendance for moderate-income students will become more formidable. Indeed, the refuge could become even more inviting if the states abandon affirmative action.
"Since entrance exam test scores and family incomes are closely linked," Mr. Schapiro said, "the result would be more rich kids going to college at the taxpayers' expense."

HEADLINE: Home Buyers Find the Bidding Wars Are Back

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Encouraged by relatively low interest rates and the swelling value of their stock portfolio, Bruce and Alexis Goria plunged into the home buying whirl last spring. They tramped through dozens of houses in Bergen County, N.J., just west of New York City, before finding one they liked.
But the Gorias, a 30-something couple looking for their first home, soon learned that buying a house is not for the weak of heart or pocketbook these days. After losing out on their first choice, they did not find something again until early July. The only problem: Another couple had just signed a contract at the asking price of $264,900. 
 Undeterred, Mr. Goria talked his way inside that night -- in the midst of a thunderstorm that knocked out electricity in the neighborhood. By flashlight, he offered $275,000. When the bidding war ended four days later, the Gorias had agreed to pay $282,500, or $17,600 more than the original deal.
Such experiences, reminiscent of some of the red-hot housing markets of the late 1970's and the mid-1980's, are happening with rising frequency in areas of the country where home prices had been weak for years. Bidding wars are no longer uncommon, particularly in affluent areas of northern New Jersey, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and Boston, as competing buyers push selling prices well beyond the asking price. The last time that happened was just before the stock market crash of 1987.
More broadly, for the first time in a decade, prices are rising nearly everywhere, with 80 percent of the nation's metropolitan areas showing a rise in home prices that exceeds the inflation rate.
By contrast, only 54 percent of the 130 major metropolitan areas regularly surveyed by the National Association of Realtors experienced price increases in excess of inflation in 1994 and just 30 percent did in 1990. Prices fell in merely 4 percent of the metropolitan areas last year, compared with 16 percent in 1994 and 21 percent in 1990.
"For the first time in the 1990's, all regions of the country are participating in the housing boom," said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Regional Financial Associates, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "Housing is running at full tilt everywhere."
Even Southern California, which has long lagged behind the surging real estate markets in the Rocky Mountain West, the South and the Midwest, has finally bottomed out and is expected to show a rise in house prices for the first time in years. The once-depressed New York area, which had a banner year in 1996 that was the best since 1987, is continuing to improve.
True, with inflation low, most homeowners are not seeing the kind of frenzy that once turned even modest houses into speculative investment vehicles. In general, price gains are relatively moderate, though some cities in the South and Midwest are chalking up double-digit price increases. And a few scattered areas, from Providence, R.I. to Riverside, Calif., still lag behind.
The biggest gains in the housing market are occurring at the high end of the market, where buyers are flush with stock market riches and generous pay packages. But the low end is strong, too, as starter homes are being eagerly snapped up by young two-income families, by recent immigrants and by upwardly mobile black and Hispanic buyers who were often shunned by lenders until new programs encouraged banks and savings institutions to seek them out. The rate of home ownership recently hit a record 65.8 percent of all households, surpassing the previous peak set in 1980.
With demand for housing strong almost everywhere, the number of house sales topped four million last year, more than ever before. Median prices nationwide rose 4.5 percent in 1996, modest by 1980's standards, but roughly double the inflation rate, and higher than the gains of 3 percent or less that were common earlier in the decade. Prices are continuing to climb at nearly the same rate so far this year, according to figures released yesterday by the realtors association.
Many real estate brokers and economists expect that residential housing in the United States will continue to do as well or better for at least the rest of the year and perhaps longer. Rising employment and a strong stock market lifted consumer confidence to a 28-year high in June. A month later the number of applications for mortgages hit a record high. And with interest rates comparatively low so late in this economic cycle, the housing market has remained surprisingly strong long after most experts had expected it to fade.
To be sure, not everyone is enjoying the benefits of a robust real estate market. The gulf between homeowners and renters has grown wider. The number of home owning households with incomes above $50,000, adjusted for inflation, has doubled while the number of rental households with incomes of $10,000 or below has grown from 7 million to 10 million over the last 20 years. Half of all renters, estimates William C. Apgar, executive director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, now spend half their income on housing.
"Rental housing," Mr. Apgar said, "is increasingly home to the nation's poorest households."
The driving force behind the current housing revival has been job growth and healthy gains in personal income, economists say. The rebound began first in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest states, then spread to the industrial areas of the Midwest, where the old Rust Belt label has been scraped off and replaced by a new shine, and to the fast-growing business centers of the South. Now, California and even the Northeast are experiencing solid job gains, too.
Over all, the economy has added a net 14.2 million jobs since the recession ended in 1991. Unemployment fell to 4.8 percent last month, a 23-year low.
All of that, and a rising stock market to boot, have built up consumer confidence in purchasing a new or larger house. Stock prices have tripled since the early 1990's, adding $5 trillion to the net worth of America's households, much of it going to the most affluent but also benefiting millions of middle-income families.
"The stock market has made so much money for the average person," said James Weichert, chairman of Weichert Realty, which has 200 offices from Connecticut to Virginia. "They're now taking it out of the stock market and leveraging housing."
There are significant differences across the country and from one neighborhood to another, of course.
In the New York area, the market varies widely, though home prices generally have been rising slightly faster than inflation for a couple of years. The pace slowed in the second quarter, but the median home price in the bedroom communities of Bergen and Passaic Counties in New Jersey was $203,600, about 4 percent above the level a year earlier, according to the realtors association. On Long Island, prices were up just 1 percent, to $163,800. Figures were not published for Westchester County or the Connecticut suburbs.
In New York City itself, where hefty Wall Street bonuses and tourism dollars are fueling the economic engine, cooperative and condominium apartment prices are 12 percent higher than a year ago, while the city's most exclusive apartments, on Fifth Avenue, have soared by more than a third, according to the Corcoran Group, a real estate broker.
Indeed, expensive homes are where a lot of the appreciation is occurring. In Morris County, N.J., a suburban base for several Fortune 500 corporations, the average price in Chester has jumped 9.9 percent, to $275,900, since 1995, while the average in the wealthier Mendham Township leaped 20 percent, to $595,400, according to Weichert Realtors.
The Washington area has rebounded recently after a long decline, with the median price up to $172,300, 5 percent higher than the year before.
Elsewhere in the country, increases in home prices have been spurred by a continuing regional shift of jobs and people. In Spartanburg, S.C., for example, the opening of a BMW automobile assembly plant added 1,900 jobs to a fast-growing area in which Michelin tire, Wilson sporting goods, Dunlop and other companies have built offices and factories where textiles mills and farms once reigned. The median home price there is up 29 percent from three years ago.
"The builders have put neighborhoods in places I didn't expect," said Pam Jordan, a lifelong resident. "They took a cow pasture and put 50 nice homes in it."
In March, Ms. Jordan and her husband sold their five-year-old home for $85,000, which was $23,000 more than they paid for it. They bought a larger three-bedroom home for $130,000. "We're taking advantage of the boom," Ms. Jordan said.
By contrast, the feeding frenzy that characterized the housing market in Colorado Springs in the mid-1990's has halted as a glut of new homes has helped stabilize the market. But the median price of $131,200 is still up 26 percent from 1994 and with new employers like MCI, Apple Computer, and Focus on the Family, a large Christian organization from California, the area is now much less dependent on the volatile military and energy industries.
"I don't see our local economy going into the pits like it did in the past," said Martha Taylor, president of the Pikes Peak Association of Realtors, "because we're so much more diverse."
For the second quarter of 1997, the Midwest continued to rise, with median prices at $105,600, 4.6 above the period a year before.
"New homes are being built everywhere," said Ken Lockard, the owner of the Lockard Realty Company in Waterloo, Iowa. "We've had a lot of new companies come here, and we now have some of the lowest unemployment in the nation."
In Southern California, where home prices fell sharply from the beginning of the 1990's until bottoming out last year, the strength of the entertainment and high-technology industries has finally pushed up house prices in Orange County and wealthy neighborhoods in Los Angeles, while the more middle-class areas remain weak. At the end of June, the median price for homes in the high-priced neighborhoods on the west side of Los Angeles was $598,000, up 6.3 percent from a year earlier. The modest homes in the northeast section of the San Fernando Valley did not fare as well; the median price was $130,000, down 2.1 percent.
"Prices are moving up," said Fred Sands, president of Fred Sands Realtors, one of the largest brokers in California and a specialist in more expensive homes. "At the very high end, above $2.5 million, we're seeing double-digit price jumps."
The news is just now soaking in. Larry Goldstein, a health care executive, enjoyed some unexpected gains when he moved from the exclusive Los Angeles suburb of Bel Air to the Washington area to take a new job. His four-bedroom California house, which he bought for about $550,000 in 1995 when prices were still dropping, sold quickly for $700,000 this spring.
"The buying panic has started to hit," he said. "In a market most people thought was soft, we made $150,000."
For his new home across the country, Mr. Goldstein found a five-bedroom house on a wooded half-acre in Potomac, Md., one of Washington's pricey suburbs. Mr. Goldstein said he felt pressure from other potential buyers, prompting him to raise his bid to $625,000.
"I knew we had to come in with a good offer," Mr. Goldstein said, "or we would run the risk of losing it."

HEADLINE: Made in Finland, Sold Just About All Over;
Cell Phones Make Nokia a World Player

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland

 BODY:
About five years ago, Nokia hatched a telecommunications project with the code name "Responder" and formed a secretive unit to carry it out. Some 25 researchers, managers and scientists gathered discreetly in Tampere, a bastion of high-technology research in Finland, and were given this broad mission: "Look at the next challenge" in tapping the exploding world of wireless communications.
That challenge, they decided, was to combine Internet, computer and phone technologies to produce a portable machine that could use all of them equally. When presented with the idea, Nokia's top management pressed their engineers to move quickly to outflank the company's two giant competitors, Motorola of the United States and Ericsson of Sweden. And sure enough, the Nokia 9000, or Communicator, will hit American stores this fall. 
 It is a risky move. For with mobile phones everywhere, only the most innovative ones will turn a decent profit, but it fits Nokia's aggressive strategy. The company has not only transformed the portable phone -- with five factories around the globe turning out some 1.5 million phones a month, it is the world's No. 2 producer, after Motorola -- but has also transformed itself from an old-line paper company into a leading technology company.
Along the way, it has also helped transform the Finnish economy. "We used to have two clusters of strength in the Finnish economy: Wood and paper, and metals," notes Kurt Nordman, chairman of the Helsinki Telephone Company, a private telecommunications company that is a big client of Nokia. "Now we have a third: it's called Nokia."
How could tiny Finland give birth to such a company? Simple. Though its population is only five million, Finland is by all accounts the world's most wired country, with a highly educated and technologically savvy population.
 Nokia, with an ever-growing staff of 34,000 scientists, researchers, salespeople and other employees peppered around 45 countries -- 6,000 of whom joined last year alone -- is rapidly joining the ranks of international household names like Sony and Microsoft.
Inside Nokia House, the new headquarters six miles west of Helsinki in Espoo, a growing sense of confidence is palpable. This "ecologically sensitive" building, an architectural marvel set on the shore of the Baltic Sea, is encased with 26,000 glass plates flooding its eight-story atriums and offices with the light of Finland's long summer days.
 As the Communicator project progressed, the focus became to create, essentially, the world's first movable, pocket-sized office. The device would allow conference calls, receive and send faxes, handle E-mail and cruise the Internet -- all from a moving car, train or sidewalk cafe. It would, says Yrjo Neuvo, senior vice president for product creation, "turn one-plus-one into more than two," which he calls a creed of Nokia's corporate culture.
The culture must work. Revenues hit $8.5 billion last year, and Nokia's share price went from $35 in January 1996 to $56.50 a year later and now stands at $85.75. Its price-earnings ratio of 26 exceeds the 23.5 of the Standard & Poor's 500.
It is an article of faith in Finland that by 2002 well over half the world's data, voice and images will travel without wires, which is why Nokia is heavily focused on what its vice president for communications, Arva Suominen, calls the manufacture of "mobile phones and everything you have in between."
Long gone are the days when Nokia was known for its paper-processing mills nestled by the Nokia River. Nokia executives calculate that by 2000 the world will have 500 million mobile phones, up from 135 million today. And 60 percent of them, they predict, will use a technology supported by Nokia called Global System for Mobile Communications.
Nokia's upbeat mood is enhanced by a widely shared conviction among its executives that new markets in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East will insure growth well into the next century.
"Our objective is to continue to grow annually by 25 to 35 percent a year," says Pii Kotilainen, vice president for human resources, and Nokia employees have a clear incentive to meet those targets. Every worker gets a bonus of 5 percent of salary if profit growth beats 35 percent, and some 2,000 top executives also get lucrative stock options.
Such growth, though, is by no means guaranteed. Luke Szymczak, a telecommunications analyst at Prudential Securities in New York, agrees that "if you looked at Nokia 10 years ago, you would have never predicted they'd be where they are today." But he cautions that the company may be putting too many eggs in one basket. "I mean 55 percent of their mix is into handsets," he said. "This is a very favorable thing right now, but could be a risk sometime in the future."
For one thing, Mr. Szymczak says, Motorola is catching up quickly in Nokia's specialty, "smart" mobile phones. And other analysts note that many other companies, like Phillips, Lucent and Sony, are also set to produce mobile phones. The risk is that what happened with color televisions could happen to portable phones -- with rising volumes but falling profits on each phone.
To Nokia executives, the immediate risk lies in failing to meet demand for smart phones like the Communicator, those with added features that they believe consumers will pay more for. "Handsets will increasingly enable the use of advanced digital services which can be loaded with all kind of services to consumers," says Pekka Ala Pietila, president of the mobile telephone division.
For Nokia, the challenge is to keep its enormous research and development staff -- 8,000 employees -- focused on the cutting edge of smart, user-friendly products.
This year, Nokia is marketing set-top boxes that turn televisions into Internet terminals, mobile pay phones that can be placed in taxis or restaurants, and credit card-size inserts that turn portable computers into phones.
Then there is the Nokia 8110 phone line, with a single key that opens a menu of options allowing a user to track a stock, a news item, a ball game and send and receive written and audio messages. Or the Nokia Cellular Data Suite, which allows the use of Windows 95 with a digital portable.
And Nokia just introduced the 2180 portable, its first foray into the competitive digital standard growing in the United States.
"They put quite a big emphasis on the 'music' part of their business, so to speak," comments Risto Linturi, technology multimedia director of the Helsinki Telecom Company, a large private concern. "Take the Communicator, for example. It has all the components necessary for hand-held communications. It's pragmatic, easy to use and a simple touch-button proposition."
True. But the failure of competitors to match the Communicator, noted an executive at a competing company who insisted on anonymity, could be their belief that "the market is not ready" for such sophisticated gimmicks. Sales of the Communicator, with an initial cost of about $1,000, have been sluggish in Europe, but Nokia insists it is too early to gauge demand.
"It will be interesting to see how it will do in the U.S.," said Mr. Neuvo, the Nokia vice president. "It takes some time before people realize how convenient some services are."
Meanwhile, Nokia's chief competitor, Motorola, thinks it is on the verge of surpassing the Finnish company's technological lead. Margaret Rice-Jones, Motorola's product marketing director for Europe, says her company has its own smart phone, to be released around the end of the year, with "capabilities that go beyond those of the Communicator."
When Nokia began to emerge as a telecommunications phenomenon, one company executive said its success was founded on "enthusiasm and madness." Today, the focus in collegiality. Its core is held together by several common denominators: a requirement that all employees speak English; a younger crowd, with a median age of 31, and a hiring policy marked by extensive interviews designed to insure a staff with the ability to get along with others.
"No politics, a lot of trust, realism with equality between people, titles are not important -- teamwork with openness is," explains Matti Alahuhta, president of Nokia Telecom, who has worked for the company for two decades. "There is a Finnish word, Noyrwws, which means humility, humbleness, that you take pride in the past but don't project it into the future."
To workers this seems attractive enough. "They understand what you need," said Siberg Jukka-Pekka, an engineer who joined Nokia a year and half ago. "It is the same pay, but what attracts here is being on the cutting edge."
Much of the success has to do with Nokia's being a Scandinavian company born in Finland. Scandinavia took a giant leap into deregulating telecommunications in the late 80's. That gave Nokia and Ericsson free rein to learn how to operate in a competitive environment and establish a lead over others in Europe and surpass the technology then in place in the United States.
Nokia has also forged strong ties with many of Finland's 20 universities. At Tampere, about 100 miles north of Helsinki, Nokia's research laboratories are next to Tampere University's media lab, and professors regularly stroll over to the labs for lunch. "It guarantees the universities know where the business is and where the business is going and Nokia knows what the scientists are doing and thinking," Mr. Pietila notes.
"It means that many more researchers are finding killer applications," says Markku Laukkanen, chairman of the administrative council of Finnish Broadcasting, which does business with Nokia.
But what if the world eventually heads for satellite-driven communications, not earth-based switches and relay stations. Indeed, satellites are being deployed by rivals like Motorola, at great expense.
"Satellites will have two million subscribers after the year 2000," Mr. Neuvo predicts. "Cellular phones will have nearly 400 million, at a much lower cost for use. In my opinion, satellites are a niche market -- certainly a big niche, but still a niche, for places like the Gobi desert, the Atlantic Ocean or the Sahara."
Just in case, however, Nokia is also coming out with a phone for anyone stuck in the Gobi desert. It is a new solar-powered model, the Nokia 1610.

Chart: "Trying to Be the Innovator"
Nokia, Finland's homegrown electronics company, has become one of the world's leading makers of cellular phones by continually upgrading the technology of its products. The latest example is the Nokia 9000 Communicator, which goes on sale in the United States this fall. It is a portable phone and computer in one. The versatility comes at a price, though -- it retails for about $1,000 in Europe -- and some industry experts wonder whether people will pay to have everything in one box.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Gephardt Find Common Ground at Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Aug. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, do not always see eye to eye these days.
Mr. Gephardt, who acts as though he is gearing up for a primary challenge to Vice President Al Gore in 2000, broke with Mr. Clinton over the balanced budget law. He opposed the President on renewing normal trade status for China. And he could soon be at odds with Mr. Clinton over the President's quest for new authority to make trade agreements. 
 But here today on Mr. Gephardt's home turf, the two Democrats put aside their ideological differences and appeared side by side with Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat, at a luncheon fund-raiser where 70 people paid $15,000 a couple to raise about $250,000 for the Democratic Party for the 1998 midterm elections.
Noting that Republicans in the House recently staged a near rebellion against Representative Newt Gingrich, Mr. Carnahan said, "Certainly we here would agree with them that they need a new Speaker, but I have a suggestion: Let's make it Dick Gephardt."
"I accept," said Mr. Gephardt, who on this day, at least, was praising the achievements of the Clinton Administration as a record for Democrats to run on next year.
Mr. Clinton praised his fellow Democrats for insisting on some of the spending programs contained in the budget agreement and for fighting to see that its child tax credits applied to lower income families. He implored the donors to keep giving to Democrats, who he said were in sight of winning back control of the House.
"We know that they will have more money than we will," he went on in a reference to Republicans, "from all sources, maybe a lot more. But my experience in this business has been it's O.K. if they have more. But you have to have enough."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton visited the sweltering concrete and brick warehouse of the Midwest Manufacturing Technology Corporation, a business consortium that trains inner-city residents for manufacturing jobs. His appearance was part of his effort to encourage businesses to hire welfare recipients who face strict benefit limits under the welfare law that the Republican Congress passed and Mr. Clinton signed almost a year ago.
The President noted that the law requires most people to work after two years on welfare and restricts them to a total of five years of benefits across a lifetime.
"Now if you say that to someone and you don't want to be cruel to them or their children," Mr. Clinton said, "then you must acknowledge that we, the rest of us, have a moral obligation to make sure there is a job there, and that if they need training that they have the training they need for the job."
Calling on employers to "join this crusade," Mr. Clinton repeated a toll-free phone number for employers who want to hire a welfare recipient. "I feel like I'm hawking something on one of those channels in television," the President said, "1-888-USA-JOB1. I can do this."
Mr. Clinton reported that 1.4 million people had left the public assistance rolls since he signed the welfare law in August 1996. He said that since he took office four years ago, the welfare rolls had declined by 3.4 million or 24 percent, which he called "the biggest decline in history."
The White House also said 11 states -- Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Wyoming -- had seen caseloads fall by 40 percent or more in that four-year period. New York lags with a 12 percent decline in its caseload.
"Now a lot of people said that welfare reform would never work, because the private economy wouldn't do its part, or the government wouldn't do its part, or we couldn't get people from welfare to work," the President said. "You know, I heard all the reasons that people said it wouldn't work. But a year later I think its fair to say the debate is over. We know now that welfare reform works."
One critic of the new welfare law was Mr. Gephardt, who sat quietly in the warehouse while Mr. Clinton spoke, even though he voted against the measure. Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said today that the President "acknowledges that there were people within our party who had principled reasons to be against that bill and had a great deal of skepticism."
Mr. Clinton's aides said the decline in welfare rolls to 10.7 million had brought the nation's caseload to its lowest level since 1970. They acknowledged, however, that the statistics did not track how many of the people who had left the welfare rolls had found work.
Bruce Reed, the assistant to the President for domestic policy, said some of the decline in welfare rolls was due to the booming economy and low unemployment rates. But he said some of the states that had seen the largest declines were pioneers in using work programs. And he said that the message in the press and from caseworkers that welfare was no longer a long-term income maintenance system had led some people not to apply for assistance.

Dow Loses 101 Points On Worries About Rates
Stocks fell sharply as concern persisted that the strength of the economy may cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
The Dow industrials plummeted 101.27 points, or 1.26 percent, to 7,960.84. The Dow has now fallen 3.6 percent from the closing high of 8,259.31 it reached last Wednesday -- the sharpest decline in the Dow since it fell 9.8 percent from March 11 to April 11. [Page D8.]
 
The Treasury market suffered its fifth straight loss, with the yield on the 30-year bond rising to 6.67 percent from 6.64. [D15.]
 
The dollar rose modestly, but slipped from its early level, as the losses in the stock and bond markets offset the positive effects of a German central bank decision to leave a key interest rate unchanged. [D6.]
 
A.M.A. to Endorse Sunbeam Goods
The American Medical Association has for the first time agreed to allow its name to be used in endorsing a line of products, in return for potentially millions of dollars. The products, made by Sunbeam, will include blood-pressure monitors, heating pads, thermometers, humidifiers and vaporizers. Advertising. [A1.]
 
Intel Accuses Digital on Patents
In response to a patent suit by Digital Equipment, Intel filed a counterclaim, accusing Digital of violating Intel patents that appear to affect nearly every aspect of Digital's business. Still, Digital's stock rose. [D4.]
 
Tougher Stances in U.P.S. Strike
Both sides ratcheted up the stakes in the United Parcel Service strike. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said that other unions would lend the striking teamsters $10 million a week to help them weather the walkout, and U.P.S. officials warned that business losses could force the company to lay off 15,000 workers. [A1.]
 
Fund Executive Out, in Surprise
Thomas F. Marsico, the portfolio manager of two top-performing mutual funds of the Janus Funds, left abruptly as "a result of philosophical differences" with the company, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Marsico was the manager of the $5.3 billion Janus Twenty fund and the $1.5 billion Janus Growth and Income fund. [D15.]
 
Wal-Mart and Penney Post Results
Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, said that net income rose nearly 13 percent in the most recent quarter as each of its divisions recorded a sales increase and a profit. And J. C. Penney said operating earnings grew almost 24 percent as the company cut costs and pared inventories, though net income fell 3 percent because of special charges. [D2.]
 
Over-the-Counter Crackdown
The N.A.S.D. plans to toughen the rules for small companies and brokers that trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board, which has been plagued by fraud, an official said. [D2.]
 
Housing Market Back in Order
For the first time in a decade, prices are rising nearly everywhere in the United States, with 80 percent of the nation's metropolitan areas showing a rise in home prices that exceeds the inflation rate. The strength in housing, particularly at the high end of the market, is even causing some bidding wars reminiscent of the 1980's. [A1.]
 
Clinton to Add Drug Regulation
President Clinton will order changes in the testing of prescription drugs to insure that manufacturers specifically examine their effects on children if the medications are to be used by a significant number of young patients, White House officials said. [A17.]

Sides Agree to Form Panel To Solve Jerusalem Attack
After talks with Dennis Ross, the American envoy to the Middle East, Israeli and Palestinian authorities agreed to report all they have learned about the suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market to a three-way panel that will include the C.I.A. station chief in Tel Aviv. A1 

Washington Ends P.L.O. Lease
The State Department ordered the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington to suspend its operations. The move was taken because Congress left for its August recess without extending a law that had allowed the United States to have diplomatic contacts with the P.L.O. A7
 
Bosnia's Money Trap
The latest obstacle to unifying Bosnia, Western diplomats say, is money: the millions of dollars political leaders are making by smuggling goods into the territories under their control and by tapping government aid money meant for the reconstruction. A10
 
A Tell-All Targets Yeltsin
Russians have been treated with a new form of Kremlinology by a long-time aide to President Boris N. Yeltsin. Aleksandr Korzhakov has written a book portraying Mr. Yeltsin in a dark haze of vodka and health problems. Few Russians were surprised to hear such allegations, and many thought Mr. Korzhakov's unflattering depictions of current Yeltsin favorites was sour grapes. A10
 
Mexican Opposition Forms Bloc
Furthering their challenge to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mexico's four main opposition parties have formed a voting bloc allowing them to elect the Speaker of the House and thus control Congress' powerful rules committee. The PRI, which in July elections lost the absolute majority it had held for 68 years, objected, but the dispute will likely await a vote next month. A3
 
Hutu Rivals Clash in Burundi
Up to 600 people were killed in northwestern Burundi, according to survivors of a series of violent clashes between rebel Hutu movements there. Fighting between the armed wing of the National Council for the Defense of Democracy against that of the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People was apparently sparked by the former group's decision to attend peace talks with Pierre Buyoya, who heads the country's Tutsi-dominated Government. A4
 
Cambodian Leaders Visit King
The Cambodian leader Hun Sen and his new Co-Prime Minister, Ung Huot, met with King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing, where they sought his blessing for the armed ousting of the monarch's son last month. A military court in Phnom Penh said an arrest warrant had been issued for Prince Norodom Ranariddh, now in Thailand, on weapons smuggling charges. A8

Strike Loan Announced As Layoffs Are Threatened
Both sides increased the stakes in the United Parcel Service strike, as the A.F.L.-C.I.O. announced that labor unions would lend the striking teamsters $10 million a week to help sustain them during the walkout and U.P.S. officials warned that strike-related business losses will force at least 15,000 layoffs. A1
 
Gingrich Leads in Fund-Raising
Speaker Newt Gingrich raised more money in the first six months of this year for his 1998 re-election race than anyone else in Congress -- and promptly spent it all. Virtually none of the $1.8 million in money he raised since January went to anything campaign-related. Instead, the donations were spent on lawyers and political consultants, direct marketers and public relations efforts. A1
 
Airline Adds Warning System
A new altitude warning system that might have saved the Korean Air jumbo jet that crashed on Guam is being installed in hundreds of American jetliners and may eventually be required on all airliners by the Federal Aviation Administration. A1
 
Clinton to Order Drug Studies
President Clinton will order changes in the testing of prescription drugs to insure that manufacturers specifically examine the drugs' effects on children if the medications are to be used by a significant number of young patients, White House officials said. The officials said they had decided to require such pediatric studies because drug companies were not doing enough on their own. A17
 
Nichols Asks to Move Trial
The lawyer for Terry L. Nichols, a defendant in the Oklahoma City bombing, asked a judge to move his trial from Denver, saying that another city would give Mr. Nichols a better chance of a fair trial. A14
 
Caretaker Collects Reward
Fernando Carreira collected $45,000 in reward money, nearly three weeks after he inadvertently discovered the hideout of Andrew Cunanan, suspected of killing Gianni Versace. The reward money included $10,000 each from Dade County, the City of Miami Beach, the F.B.I. and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and $5,000 from the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau.

Shuttle Device Has Near Miss
An ozone-measuring satellite trailing the space shuttle Discovery came within one and a half miles of a 500-pound piece of space junk that could have smashed it to pieces. A18
 
Burgers May Be Contaminated 
About 20,000 pounds of frozen hamburger patties sold across the country by an Arkansas company may be contaminated with deadly E. coli bacteria, the Agriculture Department said. The department learned about the problem from state health officials in Colorado, where about 20 people became ill in early July after eating some of the hamburgers, which were sold by retail and wholesale outlets.

Women's Shelter Cleared After City Investigation
Six months after city investigators went to a shelter for battered women and removed the 44-member staff following allegations that workers had forced women to have sex and ignored reports of child abuse, the Commissioner of the Department of Investigation said he had found no evidence to support the allegations. The statement by Commissioner Edward J. Kuriansky was in stark contrast with his remarks on Feb. 11, when he announced that he had "evidence of widespread wrongdoing" at the New Day Shelter. A1
 
Officers Accused of Torture
Prosecutors are investigating allegations that several police officers beat and tortured a man while he was in custody at a Brooklyn station house, officials said. Two officers were placed on modified duty, meaning that their guns have been taken away and they have been put on desk jobs while the case is investigated by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office and the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau, police officials said.

HEADLINE: LABOR UNIONS PLAN A TEAMSTERS LOAN TO SUSTAIN STRIKE

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Ratcheting up the stakes in the United Parcel Service strike, John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, announced yesterday that the nation's labor unions would lend the International Brotherhood of Teamsters $10 million a week for "many, many weeks" to sustain members during the strike.
Officials with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations said the unions had never before lined up so much financial support for a strike, demonstrating that labor leaders view the walkout by the 185,000 workers as a pivotal showdown for the increasingly assertive labor movement, which hopes to show that it cannot be pushed around by management. 
 "Because their fight is our fight, we are making this strike our strike," Mr. Sweeney said at a press conference at the teamsters' headquarters in Washington. "Before the week is out, we will have enough loan commitments from other unions, large and small, to finance the worker side of this confrontation for a long strike, if that's what it takes -- many, many weeks at $10 million dollars a week."
Ronald Carey, president of the teamsters, welcomed the financial aid as an unusually generous show of solidarity. It will be used to finance strike benefits of $55 a week for each member and public relations efforts by the teamsters to help strikers endure a long walkout. The strike fund went broke in 1994 and benefits were eliminated. But last year, when Mr. Carey balanced the union's budget, he set the benefit at $55 a week. The union will have to dip into its general fund to begin paying benefits at the end of this week.
The unusual size of the financial assistance announced yesterday, labor leaders say, stems from the sheer number of workers on strike against U.P.S. and the symbolic importance of the issues: pensions and part-time work. In addition, the strike is by far the biggest test faced by the labor movement since Mr. Sweeney took the labor federation's helm 22 months ago, with a widely publicized pledge to revive union influence in the workplace.
While Mr. Sweeney sought to give the strikers the wherewithal for a long strike, James Kelly, the U.P.S. chairman, issued a layoff warning that union officials said was intended to push the strikers to return to work. Mr. Kelly said that if the strike, now in its 10th day, lasted two weeks, the drop in business would cause layoffs of 15,000 unionized workers -- and possibly many more if the strike lasted a month or more.
"The longer it goes on, the fewer jobs we'll have, so this is about destroying jobs at U.P.S." Mr. Kelly said on the NBC "Today" program.
Mr. Carey said the talk of layoffs was "intimidation," and he questioned whether United Parcel had lost enough business to make layoffs necessary.
Mr. Kelly again called on President Clinton to seek an injunction ordering the teamsters back to work under the Taft-Hartley Act, which gives the President such powers when a strike is deemed to have done serious damage to the nation's security or economy.
"We have customers who are closing down shifts," Mr. Kelly said. "We have customers who are laying off people. We have customers who have their business stacked up, and they tell me they can't hold out much longer."
The teamsters and their labor allies oppose an injunction, asserting that the strike has not caused severe economic damage. Union leaders say they fear they will lose a bargaining leverage if the strikers are forced back to work.
At the news conference yesterday, Mr. Sweeney said: "President Clinton needs to let U.P.S. know definitively that he will not be providing an escape hatch for U.P.S. negotiators. Once it is made clear to these giants of private enterprise that they can't count on rescue by the Government, they will bargain in good faith and the strike will soon be over."
U.P.S. was feeling financial pressure from the strike. Investment analysts estimated that the company was losing $30 million to $50 million a day because it had many fixed costs, and also had to pay the salaries of the 100,000 managers, accountants, clerks and nonunion employees who have continued working.
"They're into the several hundred millions of dollars of losses and the meter is still running," said Philip Baggaley, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. "U.P.S. can withstand a strike quite well in terms of financial resources -- it has a $4.5 billion bank line and a fair amount of cash. The risk is the longer-term damage from customers choosing to use other transporters instead of relying exclusively on U.P.S."
Yesterday, the two sides seemed far more interested in playing hardball than in returning to the bargaining table.
Huge efforts have been orchestrated in recent days to win public support. United Parcel, the world's largest package-delivery company, ran full-page advertisements yesterday in more than a dozen newspapers, saying it had made a generous offer to the union and apologizing for any difficulties caused by the strike.
For their part, strikers have visited hundreds of the company's customers to explain their cause, and have given out thousands of pro-union flyers at football and baseball stadiums across the country.
Discussing the strike, Mr. Sweeney said, "It's about a greedy, hugely profitable employer who wants to make even more money by shortchanging workers on their wages and benefits."
Talks broke down again last Saturday after the two sides failed to reach agreement about wages, pensions and the company's widespread use of part-time workers.
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman briefed Mr. Clinton yesterday on the situation after having met with negotiators from each side on Monday. Even though no talks are scheduled, Ms. Herman sounded a note of optimism. "I'm encouraged in that I believe that both sides expressed a willingness to be more flexible in looking at their own differences," she told reporters while accompanying Mr. Clinton on a trip to St. Louis.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said Secretary Herman would have another round of "contacts" with the two sides on Wednesday in the hope of persuading them to resume negotiations.
Administration officials say they are monitoring the strike, which involves more workers than any other walkout this decade. In addition, U.P.S. normally handles 12 million parcels a day -- almost 80 percent of the parcels shipped by ground nationwide -- but the strike has pushed its volume below 10 percent of that.
Speaking privately, some union leaders expressed fears that United Parcel would seek to press the teamsters to the wall because its strike fund was close to zero. It ran out in 1994 during a 24-day freight strike by 70,000 drivers. The fund was already low because the union had voted in 1991 to raise strike benefits to $200 a week but refused to increase dues.
"The strike won't be decided by the strike funds," Mr. Carey said. "This is a strike about the future -- about good jobs, about our children, our grandchildren."
Explaining why unions agreed to make loans to the teamsters fund, Denise Mitchell, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. communications director, said: "Unions generally understand that this is a strike that affects all workers. They all have a strong stake in making sure that workers don't get undermined in this economy. There is huge support for this strike."
Labor leaders said unions have a long history of providing financial aid to strikers at other unions, pointing to long strikes at Caterpillar Inc. and Staley Works.

HEADLINE: White House Talks Likely With Albany on Medicaid

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Advisers to President Clinton said today that the White House was prepared to open negotiations with the Pataki administration to resolve a dispute that had jeopardized the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal Medicaid money to the state.
The three-year-old argument came to the forefront on Monday when the President used his new line item veto powers to delete a Federal budget provision intended to preserve rules that have allowed New York State to collect up to $2.6 billion in Federal Medicaid matching funds since 1992. 
 State officials say they are concerned that the veto will lead to a reduction in Federal Medicaid payments to the state by $200 million or more in the coming year.
Because the Medicaid funds in dispute have helped finance health care programs for the poor, Mr. Clinton's veto came under intense attack by state labor leaders, hospital officials and political leaders in both parties today, many of whom said they had already begun lobbying blitzes to persuade the President to reverse his action.
Amid the protests, Chris Jennings, deputy assistant to the President for health policy, said that he would attempt to convene a meeting between budget and health care advisers to the President and aides to Mr. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani within the next several weeks.
"We will do everything we possibly can to work this out," Mr. Jennings said.
His remarks came as an array of Democratic and Republican officials denounced Mr. Clinton's inaugural use of the line item veto, saying it was inappropriate and vowing to challenge it in court.
At City Hall, Mr. Giuliani, appearing with several Democratic members of Congress, said that if Mr. Clinton did not reverse his action, the city would bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the line item veto. "I think the case is a very strong one," the Republican Mayor said.
In Albany, aides to State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, said that he had spoken today to Clinton Administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, urging them to resolve the dispute quickly and in a way that would not be costly to the state.
"The Comptroller believes the President was wrong to have singled out New York and vetoed this provision," said Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for Mr. McCall.
At stake is an array of taxes that the state imposes on hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers to help finance health programs, including hospital services for the indigent and insurance for low-income children. Under the complex rules of Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, the Federal Government reimburses the state for 50 cents on every dollar the state collects in those taxes.
But in 1991, Congress enacted a law intended to prevent states from using health care taxes to improperly reap millions of dollars of Medicaid matching funds. In 1994, the Clinton Administration said some of the state's provider taxes might be in violation of that law, raising the possibility that New York might have to return hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicaid overpayments to the Federal Government.
In 1995, the Pataki administration asked for the state to be exempted from the 1991 law. But that waiver was never granted. So this year, at Mr. Pataki's' behest, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato inserted an amendment to the Federal budget that would have deemed the state's provider taxes permissible under the 1991 law, circumventing the waiver process. That amendment is what Mr. Clinton deleted from the budget on Monday.
At least 15 other states have applied for similar waivers, and aides to Mr. Clinton said that he decided to veto the provision for New York State to prevent other states from trying to sidestep the 1991 law in similar ways. Were that to happen, it would cost the Federal Government $3.5 billion more in Medicaid payments, the Administration estimated.
"We felt we had to do it for policy reasons despite the political costs," Gene Sperling, the President's economic coordinator, said in an interview today. "I think the people who care about the program, like the President, need to take steps to protect its integrity or it will become a target for those who would like to tear it down."
But several New York Democratic officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they thought the President had miscalculated in attempting to single out the D'Amato amendment as a symbol of Congressional excess. "This was just a colossal error," one Democrat said. "With all the waste and bloat in that budget, all he could find was something that clearly benefits the poor?"

HEADLINE: Israelis and Palestinians Agree To U.S. Role in Attack Inquiry

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The Israeli and Palestinian authorities have agreed to report all they have learned about the suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market to a three-way panel whose American representative will be the C.I.A. station chief in Tel Aviv, senior American officials said tonight.
The decision to use the panel, which is to meet regularly to review findings about the attack, was made at a meeting late Monday night among intelligence officials representing all three sides, American officials said. It was refined at talks today between Dennis B. Ross, the special American envoy, and the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. 
 The mechanism will in effect allow the United States to serve as referee and arbiter in a dispute that has raged since the bombing on July 30 about whether the Palestinians are doing enough to cooperate with Israeli demands to crack down on suspected Islamic militants. The twin explosions killed 16 people, including the two suicide bombers.
A panel had already existed to allow cooperation among the Israelis, the Palestinians and the Americans. But by elevating the panel's role now, the United States has essentially committed itself to being at the table during all discussions related to the suicide bombing and perhaps other security matters.
The C.I.A. station chief, whose identity is not widely known, is unlikely to play any kind of a public role in that process. He would presumably report his judgments about the extent of cooperation and actions taken by the two sides only to the American Ambassador in Tel Aviv and to his superiors at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Va.
It would be left to the Ambassador, Martin Indyk, or to Mr. Ross, or even to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to decide whether to either publicly or privately accuse either side of bad faith or whether to declare that cooperation had resumed in earnest.
There remained no immediate indication tonight that the Palestinians were yet willing to act as aggressively as Israel and the United States would like in rounding up the dozens of Islamic militants that Israel suspects might have played a role in the most recent suicide bombing attack.
Mr. Ross, who arrived on Saturday night, had been scheduled to leave the region this evening. But the situation remains so fragile, American officials said, that he will stay until late Wednesday to meet for the fourth time in as many days with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, in hopes of making further progress.
After meeting with Mr. Arafat tonight in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Mr. Ross said only, "We have to see the process work toward results, and we're working toward that end."
A senior American official said there were continuing fears that the parties responsible for the twin suicide bombings may be preparing to strike again.
"There is a grave and urgent situation out there," said a senior American official, who said he believed that the quest for a broader peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians was now "hanging by a thread."
A spokesman for the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv declined tonight to identify the C.I.A. station chief there, maintaining his anonymity under a practice that is standard at most American embassies around the world.
The station chief and other American intelligence officers are nevertheless known to have worked closely in the past with their Israeli and Palestinian colleagues. But meetings between Israeli and Palestinian intelligence officials have more often taken place away from American eyes. Although the process has sometimes worked well, it has led to accusations of bad faith during periods of mutual mistrust like this one.
American officials said the decision to give the C.I.A. station chief a central role was motivated by the view that intelligence-sharing and judgments about it might prove most productive at arm's length from diplomats and political leaders.
One question that American and Israeli officials described as unanswerable was whether the acknowledged central involvement of United States intelligence in reviewing evidence into the bombing investigation might prompt guerrillas to consider attacking American targets.
The new mechanism may help the Clinton Administration to finesse some of the questions raised by Ms. Albright's announcement last week that she would visit the region by the end of the month but only if the two sides had made progress toward renewed cooperation.
By making an American intelligence officer a judge as well as a witness to what is actually being shared, the central role to be played by the panel could allow the Administration to insist that its judgments had nothing to do with politics.
The new system could also serve to pre-empt some of the rancor caused by rival interpretations of Israeli-Palestinian exchanges in which no third party is present.
If no further progress is made before Mr. Ross's departure, it seems possible that the Administration might now put off a formal decision about when and whether Ms. Albright will make her journey until it receives reports from the new panel.
The Secretary has said her agenda will include the kinds of political issues more central to Palestinian concerns than the security matters that Mr. Ross has pressed. That has left the Palestinians in particular eager for the visit, as the Palestinian Planning Minister, Nabil Shaath, made clear tonight.
He said that while Mr. Ross's visit might have halted the deterioration in relations between the two sides, "we are looking forward to going on from security to the bigger issues of the peace process."
But Israeli officials have expressed concern that any good will shown by the Palestinians as a gesture to enlist Ms. Albright in the progress might cease the moment she says explicitly that she is coming, and would prefer that any announcement to be postponed until the Palestinians mount a major security crackdown.
Mr. Arafat has insisted that his security forces are doing all they can to find out who might have carried out the attack in Jerusalem. But Mr. Netanyahu, with some American support, has insisted that the Palestinians do far more by arresting scores of suspected militants, including 88 on a list that Israeli intelligence officials have presented to their Palestinian counterparts in the last week.
So far, that is something the Palestinians have shown little willingness to do, despite a commitment under the peace accord they have signed with the Israelis to do everything necessary to suppress violence and terror.
A Palestinian military court today sentenced a member of Mr. Arafat's presidential guard to death and two other guards to long prison sentences. But while Israel has asked the Palestinians to crack down on security personnel whom it accuses of involvement in terrorism, the three men who were sentenced today had been convicted of treason and collaboration with Israel.
Even as Mr. Ross proved successful today in establishing the new security mechanism, and as he urged the Palestinians toward a course of further cooperation, it became increasingly evident that he is also trying to persuade the Israeli Government to make a conciliatory gesture, but so far to little avail.
In elliptical remarks late Monday night, Mr. Ross spoke to reporters about "measures that are not helpful and would be counterproductive."
But during his meeting with Mr. Netanyahu this afternoon, both Israeli and American officials said he had explicitly asked the Prime Minister to resume payment of millions of dollars owed to the Palestinians that since the bombing have been frozen as a punitive measure.
Mr. Netanyahu is certain to hear the same message on Wednesday in the Jordanian port city of Aqaba, where he is scheduled to meet with King Hussein. That session will mark his first meeting with an Arab head of state since the suicide bombing sent Israeli-Palestinian relations into a downward spiral.
Israel's imposition of economic sanctions against the Palestinians has caused alarm across the Arab world, in large part because they have left the Palestinian Authority unable to pay most of its 80,000 employees their monthly salaries.
In the West Bank town of Nablus today, some 10,000 Palestinians demonstrated against what they called American and Israeli pressures, and American officials made clear their worry that Israel's use of the weapon could backfire.
Much of the money that is being withheld is normally used by the Palestinian Authority to pay the police officers and other security personnel who Israel is now asking to carry out a security crackdown.
But Mr. Netanyahu's communications director, David Bar-Illan, noted this evening that some Palestinian policemen have been implicated in attacks against Israelis, and that Israel has issued an arrest warrant for Ghazi Jabali, the head of the Palestinian police, whom it has accused of directing officers to carry out an attack on Jewish settlers.
"It's a little ludicrous for us to pay the salaries of the very same force that's mounted terrorist attacks against us, and has shown no change in this policy," Mr. Bar-Illan said.
Today was Mr. Ross's third working day in the region, and his visits with Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Mr. Arafat in Ramallah marked the third time he has met with each of them since arriving.
The main purpose of today's sessions, American officials said, was for Mr. Ross to discuss with the two leaders the agreement reached late Monday night at the meeting of high-level officials from Israeli, Palestinian and American intelligence.
To avoid giving the session a political cast, Mr. Ross himself attended only briefly. According to American and Israeli officials, those who attended included the C.I.A. station chief and the deputy chief of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, neither of whom they would identify by name.
It also included Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, who head the Palestinian Preventive Security forces on the West Bank and in Gaza, respectively, and are the Palestinian officials who have long cooperated most closely with Israel and the United States.
There had been six previous three-way meetings in the days since Mr. Ross began his mission, but little had been achieved until the Monday night meeting in which a senior American official said there had been "much less polemics and much more substance."
In return for committing themselves to full security cooperation, the Palestinians want an Israeli commitment to address Palestinian grievances, including the halt in the flow of money and the blockade that has kept tens of thousands of workers in the West Bank and Gaza from reaching their jobs in Israel.
But Israel has insisted that the closing of Israel to Palestinian workers is a security measure, and thereby not a subject for negotiation. And Israeli officials have said they can begin to ease the economic sanctions only once the Palestinians undertake the wave of arrests that the Israelis have demanded.

If There's Heaven, It Should Expect Changes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI 

 BODY:
IN the 1960's, Paul Rudolph sneaked a triplex rooftop addition onto a brownstone on Beekman Place, just before the historic-preservation police would have stopped him. Embarking on the New York phase of his brilliant career, Mr. Rudolph -- often called the most fertile architectural imagination of the postwar generation -- piled a hanging architectural garden on the rather plain building: the fragile steel-and-glass superstructure cantilevered over the street and spilled off the back in an interlocking succession of landscaped terraces overlooking the East River.
When I first moved to New York in 1983, I dropped my bags and made the hajj. The expansive intervention opened the lid of the boxy brownstone, aerating not only the building but also the densely packed block. The exuberant and joyous gesture was the best thing that could have happened to the rather pickled enclave. 
 Mr. Rudolph obsessed on the house for years, creating the only architect's house in New York equivalent to the treasure Sir John Soane left in London. By the time I finally saw the interior of the triplex in the late 1980's, it had evolved into a daring trapeze of thin mirrored steel beams, glass floors and transparent acrylic shelves. The acrylic wash basin in one bathroom acted as a skylight for the bedroom below.
At a reception in its shimmering dizziness one night, I put down a plastic cup of wine on what I thought was a shelf, only to see the cup drop three stories straight through projecting transparent acrylic planes to the white marble floor below. Mr. Rudolph always smiled mischievously as he recounted the story of a woman who, during a benefit in the 1970's, froze at the sight of the space and had to be carried out on a stretcher. The disorientation was part of the spatial intrigue, and it drew the intrepid on promenades of discovery. Interior views unfolded up and across the highly porous, forestlike plateaus -- you couldn't see the building for the architecture.
Mr. Rudolph's heart stopped beating in the filigreed wilderness last week. He had been bedridden for months with an asbestos-related cancer, tethered to machines that kept him alive in the living room. A stream of the modernist faithful hiked up to his aerie to pay their respects to an architect who had been cruelly dropped by an amnesiac press and academia. The triplex was a reminder of the contributions made to American architecture by this poet of space.
Houses designed by architects for themselves tend to be autobiographical, and Mr. Rudolph's triplex epitomized his reaction to the bracing doses of stiff Germanic modernism meted out to Harvard architecture students under Walter Gropius during and just after World War II.
"We wanted to get out of the German thing, and some of us exploded our way out," said the New York architect John Johansen, who was at Harvard in the same period. "Paul spoke for a whole generation which went on after school to practice with great exuberance, diversity and originality in the 50's and 60's."
Mr. Rudolph abandoned the austerity and pursued his freedoms first in Florida, where he designed a series of startlingly original houses -- light, hovering structures with flowing spaces and hinged wall panels, counterbalanced by weights at the ends of cords, that opened like wings to admit breezes and create shade. Mr. Rudolph also designed schools that avoided tunneling, factorylike corridors in favor of strikingly lighted, modulated spaces with spontaneous gathering places. Already he exhibited his abiding belief in open rather than closed, contained form: he was a spiritual descendant of Frank Lloyd Wright, and his work fused American and European strains of modernism.
In about 1950, Mr. Rudolph, the son of a minister, spoke at a national convention of the American Institute of Architects. "It was like the boy Jesus in the temple," Mr. Johansen recalled. "He admonished the old established architects to get off it, to leap out of the certainty of the German idiom: 'Why can't we enjoy design? Why not picturesqueness? Why do we have to be so grim?' He was very independent." Freedom was the message, not theory.
No building defined his career, and caught the spirit of the times, like the Art and Architecture Building at Yale, where he was architecture chairman from 1957 to 1965. "I asked him what he liked most when it was finished," Mr. Johansen said, "and he answered, 'The 37 levels.' " Within a 10-story building, he managed to nest 37 levels of interlocking spaces divided only by walls of plate glass.
"What impresses me most about his work is that he's been everywhere in it," Mr. Johansen continued. "Whether he's drawn it, or seen it in his mind, he's been at every turn of stair, every turn of angle, every new view, every accommodation of one level to another, every source of light coming in."
The Art and Architecture Building staked out its corner in New Haven with declarative towers, broken by strong horizontal bands. The poured-in-place concrete was bushhammered, and the blocky masses and vertically striated surfaces resembled the sheer faces of a quarry. Inside, the spaces metamorphosed as they flowed, alternately expanding and contracting with low and high ceilings and wide and narrow passages.
When it opened in 1963, the building became an object lesson. As a Yale freshman, I experienced the building as a revelation of space: I raced up staircases that offered overlooks, tiers of tectonic plates and framed exterior views. Fossils and abalone shells were embedded in the concrete walls, and plaster casts of classical friezes hung in the overlooks. Gates from a Louis Sullivan design enclosed a library carpeted in a gorgeous orange that snapped the building together.
Besides making space itself sensuous, Mr. Rudolph radicalized design with the symphonic complexity of his composition, conceived at a time when simplicity was the cardinal virtue. Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe had both created spaces flowing in plan, but Mr. Rudolph took the idea into the third dimension, no longer thinking of an elevator building as a stack of pancakes. In other designs Mr. Rudolph would make space palpable by drawing schools of arrows swimming through baroque voids: space flowed, but it flowed in a direction.
Mr. Rudolph remarked that as the Yale dean, he had to remain open to all ideas, so he left the school to focus on a narrower band of principles. At Yale, he was succeeded by Charles Moore, who built with his students a Mylar hut full of iconoclastic attitude on the main floor of the building. The coy structure proved an early call in a hounding chorus of post-modernism emanating from Yale. Mr. Rudolph became the lightning rod for criticism.
In the late 1970's, a fire of suspicious origin engulfed several floors of the building, and the brilliant but misunderstood structure never really recovered either from the catastrophe or from the unsympathetic renovations. Mr. Rudolph remained incredulous that, until relatively recently, the school did not consult him about the restorations.
He had hung out his shingle on West 57th Street and steadfastly resisted succumbing to the common New York practice of being an executive architect who doles out the initial sketches to his subordinates. Mr. Rudolph could regularly be found at his drafting table overlooking the traffic, drawings pinned up within arm's reach, palms smeared with graphite. "He had nice things to say about working all night with a stubby pencil," Mr. Johansen said.
If post-modernism and the rise of historic preservation marginalized Mr. Rudolph in the United States (lesser architects got the Pritzker Prize), Asians still believed that modern architecture symbolized progressive, future-oriented societies. Colonial-style architecture hardly appealed to post-colonial cultures. His complex, labor-intensive architecture also suited countries with inexpensive labor, and the deeply sculptured structures thrived in the chiaroscuro of the tropical sun.
"He felt that America had lost its optimistic outlook, and that Southeast Asia was still riding a trajectory of innovation," said Donald Albrecht, who organized a show of Mr. Rudolph's work in 1993 at the Van Alen Institute in Manhattan. "He was happy as long as he had work, and there was plenty of work in Asia."
The Asian commissions allowed him to explore ideas at scales hardly tolerated in the United States. Among his contributions to architecture are his investigations of the high-rise. Even in structures where economies of scale encouraged repetition and air-conditioning necessitated containerization, he always broke the box. The sculptural involutions of the facades invited terraces; atria several stories high created piazzas inside. Form was not used for the sake of form, but to humanize the building and cityscape.
During the last two decades, his was a schedule of all-night flights, his red buzz cut -- "chinchilla sunset," one critic remarked -- still standing alert after grueling trips. As post-modernism faded and architects again reassessed modernism, Mr. Rudolph was one of the few of his generation left standing with a functioning practice. Peter Blake wrote in "No Place Like Utopia" that Mr. Rudolph was one of the great architects of the century: Mr. Rudolph seemed amused that someone remembered him. (Mr. Blake is organizing an exhibition to run from Sept. 19 through Oct. 15 at the Architectural League in New York.)
All this time, Mr. Rudolph tinkered with his triplex, which exemplified the elusive Chinese principle that subdividing space expands it. Disappearing behind its panels, platforms and myriad planes, space seemed infinite because its end could never be seen; but the many subdivisions of pieces into small parts also extended the infinite into the infinitesimal. His favorite neighborhood was Canal Street, where he ventured to find new plastics to apply to surfaces in the triplex. Beams were often clad in pieces of reflective metallic plastic less than an inch wide, and the reflections fragmented light, sending it deeply and unpredictably into the interiors. The quality of the light changed throughout the day and varied by season. In the morning, as he lay dying, light off the East River cast cool silver blue tones through the white space. As the sun set, the interior warmed to orange. The fractured horizontal levels and the scores of mini-levels were harpooned by great vertical rises of space and structure.
The solace is that a man who lived for architecture died in an aerie of his own ideas. He asked that there be no memorial.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Against Mark After Bundesbank Warning

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the mark and other major currencies after the German central bank, the Bundesbank, warned that it would monitor exchange rates to see if the sagging German currency was fueling inflation.
Even though Germany's economy is sluggish and unemployment is near a post-World War II high, the Bundesbank has recently hinted it may raise interest rates to curb the mark's weakness. 
 "Today was obviously quite a setback for the dollar, mainly against the mark," said James McGroarty, chief currency manager at Potomac Babson Inc., a money management firm. "The tone of the Bundesbank was that it's unhappy with the mark's weakness."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.8352 marks, down from 1.8645 marks on Tuesday and the lowest since July 24. The dollar fell to 115.69 Japanese yen from 116.43 yen and dropped more than 1 percent against the Swiss and French francs, the Italian lira and the Dutch guilder. The British pound rose to $1.5840 from $1.5779.
The dollar began its descent in European trading after the Bundesbank said in its monthly report that it would "closely observe the further development of exchange rates with regard to the risks of a stability-oriented policy." The mark has lost 16 percent of its value against the dollar so far this year, pushing German import prices up -- which could bolster inflation.
The Bundesbank's comments about the weakness of the mark probably represented more of an effort to "jawbone" the dollar down than a sign that the bank is about to raise rates, traders said.
"They just don't want to wake up and see the dollar at 1.90 marks," said Richard Koss, market strategist at MFR Inc., a money management and consulting firm. The dollar reached an eight-year high of 1.8900 marks last week.
The dollar also fell as financial markets in the United States erased most of their early gains. Falling stocks and bonds hurt the dollar because investors selling American securities often convert the dollar proceeds into other currencies.
"We keep going with the asset markets and they continue to feel heavy," Mr. Koss said.

HEADLINE: Freelancers Lose Test Case On Electronic Publishing

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
A Federal judge ruled yesterday that publishers could reproduce articles by freelance writers in some electronic media without their permission or paying them extra.
The ruling came in a lawsuit, filed in 1993 by a group of writers, that was widely viewed as an early test of the economic rights of freelancers and copyright law in the new realm of electronic publishing. The plaintiffs challenged the right of six publishers, including The New York Times Company and Time Warner Inc., to reproduce newspaper or magazine articles on CD-ROM's or in electronic data bases -- without seeking the permission of the freelance writers and without paying them beyond what they were paid for the original articles. 
 An important issue, under the Copyright Act of 1976, is whether the reproduction is the same as the original publication or amounts to a slightly revised version of the original. If either is the case, the publishers have reproduction rights. That, for example, is the copyright interpretation that permits publishers to put archive versions of newspapers and magazines on microfilm.
Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that for CD-ROM's and certain electronic data bases, publishers could reproduce without permission. But since the suit was filed, the biggest arena of electronic publishing has become the World Wide Web. In their Web versions, newspapers and magazines often include articles and pictures not found in their original publications and sometimes even video and audio.
Given the rise of the Internet and the increasing importance of electronic publishing, representatives for both the defendants and the plaintiffs predicted that the court ruling yesterday would not be the end of the conflict between publishers and freelancers.
"The judge ruled that CD-ROM's and some kinds of data bases are the functional equivalent of microfilm," said Bruce P. Keller, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, the law firm representing the defendants. "But it is not a sweeping decision that determines copyright in all forms of electronic media."
The lead plaintiff, Jonathan Tasini, the president of the National Writers Union, termed the judge's decision "murky, wrong and somewhat contradictory." But he noted that in her ruling, the judge acknowledged that copyright law might not have kept pace with today's technology and its implications.
"The court does not take lightly that its holding deprives plaintiffs of certain important economic benefits associated with their creations," Judge Sotomayor wrote.
But, she added, "the plaintiffs' real complaint lies in the fact that modern technology has created a situation in which revision rights are much more valuable than intended at the time that the specific terms of the Copyright Act were being negotiated."
Congress, she noted, "is of course free to revise that provision to achieve a more equitable result."
Mr. Tasini said he was considering an appeal of the ruling. In addition, he said the writers' union, an affiliate of the United Automobile Workers, had been talking to members of Congress about trying to bring copyright law into the Internet era.
"The judge is essentially saying, 'Don't beef to me -- take it to Congress,' " Mr. Tasini said.
In the last couple of years, publishers have also moved to strengthen their control of copyright in cyberspace. Beginning in 1995, most major newspaper and magazine publishers began requiring freelancers to sign so-called all-rights contracts, giving the publishers reproduction rights for all forms of electronic media, including Web sites.
"Even if we won the case today," Mr. Tasini said, "we would still be fighting these all-rights contracts."
Besides The New York Times Company and Time Warner, the defendants in the case were Newsday, which is owned by the Times Mirror Company; Mead Data, a unit of the Dutch-British conglomerate Reed Elsevier P.L.C., which runs Nexis, a data service that provides the archives of many news organizations via computer, and University Microfilms, a division of Bell & Howell that for many years has provided the archives of The New York Times and many other newspapers on microfilm.

HEADLINE: In Prime Minister's Life, A Parable of His Country

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Aug. 12

 BODY:
At 77, Prime Minister I. K. Gujral, who has been buffeted from crisis to crisis since taking over as head of India's 15-party coalition Government four months ago, is by his own account a transitional figure. But he has a vision -- ending decades of enmity with Pakistan -- that would have likely found favor with the leaders who won India's independence 50 years ago.
"I would like our borders to be completely soft, like Canada and the U.S.A.," Mr. Gujral said in an interview on Tuesday in the parliamentary office once occupied by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. Nehru worked tirelessly in the months before Aug. 14, 1947, to find a formula to prevent the subcontinent from being partitioned into the separate nations of India and Pakistan. 
 The quest for improving relations with Pakistan comes naturally to Mr. Gujral, who was one of at least 10 million Hindus and Muslims who migrated across the new frontiers. Born in what is now Pakistan, Mr. Gujral lingered at his family's timber business in Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city, until anti-Hindu riots forced him out in February 1948. Like Muslims headed in the other direction, the Gujral family lost all it owned and started out in New Delhi living with three other families in one room.
As Prime Minister on India's 50th anniversary, Mr. Gujral has looked back on his experiences in rising from being "a penniless migrant" in 1947 to India's top job, and found in them a parable of India's achievements. While many Indians have been disparaging the country's failure to solve its problems, especially poverty, Mr. Gujral said he was upbeat.
"I don't think there is any reason for my being defensive, or in a state of self-reproach," he said. "There are a lot of things of which India can be proud."
While Government figures showed 350 million people still in poverty, he said, about the same number were now counted as middle-class. The last famine was in 1967, and the country is now producing four times as much food as at independence -- a 200-million-ton grain harvest with a surplus to export. Hundreds of thousands of Indians are going to college, and nearly one million migrants to the United States have competed on equal terms with the best American talent.
In addition, Mr. Gujral said, India now has a vast industrial and scientific base, capable of producing missiles, space satellites and "nuclear technology and whatever you want to call it," meaning the country's secret stockpile of nuclear bombs.
He contrasted this with 1947, when a neighbor in Karachi, whom he described as "a very rich man," had made his fortune importing sewing needles. "Importing sewing needles!" he said. "That was the level of accomplishment of British India."
India has also experienced a social revolution since 1947, he said, characterized by increasing opportunities for the hundreds of millions of Indians born into the lower social classes.
An example of this mobility, he said, was the men who now held the country's highest two posts: K. R. Narayanan, a veteran diplomat born into an untouchable family, who was elected to India's largely ceremonial presidency last month, and Mr. Gujral himself, who said he never imagined in 1947 that he could one day fill Nehru's chair.
The issue uppermost in the Indian leader's mind seemed to be Pakistan. Like many people at the time of partition, he said, he believed that normal life would quickly resume. Instead, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, and enforced a separation that has persisted for 50 years. Now, Mr. Gujral said, he hopes that his new dialogue with Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, will help end the enmity.
"I think the legacy of partition is gradually wearing out," he said.
Mr. Gujral said nothing to indicate he has found a way around the stumbling block of Kashmir, the predominantly Muslim territory fought over, and divided, by Indian and Pakistani troops in 1947. Pakistan's stand is that India must withdraw its troops and allow a free vote among Kashmiris on joining Pakistan, and that only then can there be the broad opening of the kind Mr. Gujral has said he wants -- in trade, people-to-people exchanges and relaxation of military rule.
Mr. Gujral, following the line India adopted since the 1950's, said India's borders were fixed. Although some Indians feel India "should undo the partition" by handing over Kashmir, he said, "I don't contribute to this."
He added: "That never solves the problem. The sovereignties of each of us must be respected. We must now think that the partition was final. We have to respect each other, and be friends with each other, and cooperate with each other. That's it."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Early Gains In Treasury Prices Wane

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Relieved that reports on retail sales and producer prices were less alarming than some investors had feared, the Treasury market rallied sharply yesterday before giving up some of the gains because of worries about the dollar.
The 30-year bond gained 19/32, to a price of 96 26/32, pushing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to 6.62 percent, from 6.67 percent on Tuesday. 
 In recent days, investors had worried that yesterday's reports might signal increased inflation, making it necessary for the policy-setting committee of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a meeting next week to slow down the growth in the economy. Instead, the producer price report showed a decrease in July, the seventh straight monthly drop. And while the retail sales report showed a gain of six-tenths of 1 percent in July, that was generally in line with or slightly below expectations.
Concerns about those reports and other data due this week -- as well as the Fed's response -- have been cited by analysts as a key reason for the Treasury market's retreat over the last week. Analysts also said investors who had been heavily invested in securities with long maturities were using the rally leading up to the recent declines as a vehicle to get out and move to the short end of the market.
It is a safe bet that all those factors -- along with the fact that the dollar has given up some of its gains against European currencies -- played a part in the slide. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors because of the potential gains from currency translation.
Against that backdrop, yesterday's news came as a relief. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "Despite indications of a revitalized consumer and an economy that appears to be moderately accelerating, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to make any policy change until the economy's forward thrust shows signs of leading to increasing inflationary pressures."
And he said that he expected the Consumer Price Index, a more important inflation indicator than the producer index, to remain nonthreatening, with a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent for July.
"Bond yields, however, will continue to gyrate upon the release of economic data," Mr. Fine said, "because a growing economy with tight labor markets always presents a risk of a pickup in inflationary pressures and a concomitant Fed response, and the uncertainty this creates breeds volatility."
Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, also sounded a note of caution. Yesterday's report of a gain in retail sales, he said, while not unexpected, still indicates that consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of economic activity, remains robust.
"Many credit market investors quickly realized that while we could certainly justify a sip of champagne after observing the release of the benign P.P.I. report, the apparent firming of demand side pressures evidenced in the retail sales report virtually guarantees that bringing out cases of this was clearly unwarranted," he said.
Mr. Chan said that most investors now believe that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged in August, though perhaps not indefinitely.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said he thought that the overall economic picture remained one of moderate growth with low inflation. The seven straight monthly declines in producer prices "indicate that the economy is fundamentally different than that of the past 25 years, able to generate healthy growth without any inflationary pressures at all," he said.
In the corporate bond market yesterday, Chase Credit Card Master Trust Series 1997-2 sold $1.585 billion of asset-backed securities in two parts. The class A portion of the debt sales consists of $1.5 billion in securities with an average life of three years that were priced to yield 6.395 percent, or about 29 basis points more than a Treasury security with a like maturity. The class B portion, consisting of $85 million in subordinated securities with an average life of 3.1 years, was priced to yield 6.555 percent, or about 45 basis points more than a Treasury with a similar maturity.

HEADLINE: Despite a Positive Report On Inflation, Stocks Falter

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The news was good yesterday, the kind that often cheers investors and catapults stock prices higher. The Government said that inflation on the producer price level fell in July for the seventh consecutive month and that retail sales last month were stronger but not booming.
Those seemed the kinds of reassurance investors would liked after almost two weeks of concern about stronger growth and price pressures that had helped propel interest rates sharply higher and stock prices lower. 
 But yesterday, an early rally on the "good" news faded quickly as the market gyrated wildly. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average -- which had surged nearly 80 points at the opening, then reversed course and dropped 80 points -- was down 32.52 points, at 7,928.32. It was the Dow's fourth loss in five sessions, a decline of 331 points, or 4 percent.
"People are as nervous as I've seen them in a long time," said Robert F. Dickey, a technical analyst at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis. "There's a fear that we're at the end of some economic cycle, and so investors are looking for almost any excuse to sell."
Analysts said that investors were bothered by a late retreat yesterday in the bond market after an initial rally on the new economic data. The data showed that producer prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent in July while retail sales rose six-tenths of 1 percent.
In addition, the dollar weakened against the German mark, raising the specter of slackening foreign demand here for stocks and bonds.
That combination seemed similar to the one that sent stocks tumbling on Friday, a 157-point drop by the Dow. Stocks also made repeated efforts to recover yesterday, buoyed by strength in smaller-company shares and in the technology sector. But those gains were short-lived.
Indeed, many analysts believe the market may be in the midst of a long overdue correction -- a pause or slump in buying pressure after a sharp run-up in prices. After all, since mid-April, the Dow had climbed nearly 29 percent through last week, a spirited run in slightly less than four months.
One sign of such a correction could be the fact that the market failed to rally on what would normally have been regarded as good news.
Other analysts attributed the recent downturn to the fact that investors, having seen enormous gains this year in what many thought was an ideal economic environment, are now worried that it may not be so ideal after all, and that wage pressure could eventually erupt into inflation.
"There are some signs that the economy is growing faster than projections for the third quarter, and I think that is the basis for the bond yields moving above their very low levels of last month," said William Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock. "Despite all the talk about a new economic environment, the fact is that the Fed is poised with their finger on the button. And it wouldn't take a lot for them to tighten."
David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, believes that the economy is gathering steam, and that later this year the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy by raising short-term rates, a move that he said would lead to a sharp selloff in stocks.
"The economy is much stronger than most people realize and we're going to be looking at a Fed tightening at the end of September," Mr. Shulman said. He said, though, that he does not expect the Fed to act when its policy-making committee meets next Tuesday.
But is this the start of a selloff? "It's too early to tell," he said.
Yesterday, the evidence was mixed. While the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index lost 4.51 points, to 922.02, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 7.16 points to 1,583.40. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues barely edged advancers, 1,476 to 1,373, on heavy volume of 593.6 million shares.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller- capitalization stocks, however, gained a modest 0.22 point, to 411.64.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Leaves Mideast Without Sign of Progress

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 13

 BODY:
An American special envoy flew back to Washington tonight with no clear indication whether his mission had succeeded in persuading the Israelis and the Palestinians to begin making gestures that would allow the two parties to step back from a precipice in their partnership.
The envoy, Dennis B. Ross, said he believed that he had begun to revive security cooperation between the two sides after trust between them collapsed after a suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market two weeks ago. 
 At a minimum, Mr. Ross said, he had succeeded in preventing "further deterioration" in the ties between the peace partners. He said that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright would "very clearly" soon make her first trip to the region, but that the timing of that journey would depend on her assessment in the days ahead about whether security ties had resumed in earnest.
In four frenetic days here, Mr. Ross met four times each with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders and consulted at length with their top security deputies in trying to help them map out an end to what remains a dangerous impasse.
Despite urging from Mr. Ross, the Palestinians have yet to take any of the concrete steps to crack down on Islamic militants that Israel has demanded after the July 30 attack, in which two bombers and 14 others were killed.
At the same time, Israel has refused to back away from what the United States has labeled its counterproductive decision to withhold millions of dollars owed to the Palestinians until the other side begins to heed its demands.
"We have to remember that we're dealing with issues of dignity on both sides," said a senior American official who said it will likely be at least several days before either side begins to budge.
And no one among senior Israeli, Palestinian and American officials said they expected either party to move far from the rigid positions they have staked out on security matters until Ms. Albright arrives in the region with a mandate to widen the discussions to other issues.
A grim mood has seized the region since the bombing, and it was reinforced today by a new warning by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who said the authorities had uncovered "information about the possibility, even the planning, of new terrorist attacks as we speak."
Mr. Netanyahu was speaking at a joint news conference with King Hussein of Jordan after meeting with him in the Jordanian port of Aqaba. The Israeli leader brought with him to the session intelligence reports about the possible attacks, a senior Jordanian official said, and the information appeared to have left the King, who usually smiles broadly in public appearances, in some despair.
Four times during his own remarks, the King said relations between Israel and the Palestinians had reached "a dangerous moment." And he said that unless more was done on all sides "to prevent further bloodshed and destruction" then "we cannot predict what the future will bring, except disaster."
As the main achievement of his mission, Mr. Ross seemed to point to the agreement earlier in the week by Israeli and Palestinian security officials to report all information they gather about the bombing to a three-way panel on which the American representative will be the C.I.A. station chief in Tel Aviv.
That panel, which is to meet regularly to review intelligence gathered and actions taken by both sides, is to serve both as a vehicle for cooperation and a means to allow the United States to monitor whether the two sides are making good on their commitments. The other members of the panel will include high-level Israeli and Palestinian intelligence officials.
"I am concluding this trip with the belief that we have created a mechanism that begins to establish the security relationship," Mr. Ross said.
But a senior Israeli official traveling aboard Mr. Netanyahu's plane on the return flight from Jordan sought to minimize the panel's significance. "So now we have a forum that's going to monitor steps which haven't taken place," the senior official said with mild sarcasm during a briefing for reporters in which he spoke on condition of anonymity.
Because they regard themselves as the weaker party in dealings with the Israelis, the Palestinians have become more enthusiastic about giving the Americans a seat at the table, and a top Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, praised the initiative as having created "a damage-control mechanism."
But Mr. Erekat left little doubt that Palestinian officials intended to wait for Ms. Albright's visit before considering any major steps. "I think we need the dimension of a third party," Mr. Erekat said. "And if she decides to use her weight, I think that Ms. Albright can save the peace process from collapsing."
Throughout his mission, Mr. Ross pressed the Palestinians to do more to put pressure on Islamic militants in the West Bank and Gaza. He also urged Israeli officials to begin easing the punitive measures, including the halt in the flow of money, that Israel has imposed on its peace partners since the bombing.
In a television interview tonight, Mr. Ross said he believed Israel would begin to ease some sanctions once cooperation was restored.
But the two sides have remained at an impasse over which should act first, and whether inducements offered to the Palestinians to take a harder line against the militants should extend beyond an Israeli promise to resume the payments, which they are obliged to make monthly to the Palestinians under peace accords.
As the revenues collected by Israel continue to accumulate, some $40 million that has been collected from Palestinians and is owed to the Palestinian Authority is now sitting in a Tel Aviv bank account.
The payments account for most of the Palestinian budget, and their suspension has forced the Palestinian Authority to withhold pay from most of its 78,000 employees and to borrow heavily from local banks.
At the news conference in Aqaba that followed his meeting with King Hussein, Mr. Netanyahu insisted that Israel's use of the economic weapons was "not designed to encumber or discomfort the population."
But Mr. Netanyahu has been so steadfast in his refusal to restore the payments until the Palestinians begin a security roundup that even King Hussein said today that he had not expected "that this meeting would resolve problems in a dramatic way."
The Prime Minister's refusal to ease the sanctions has infuriated Mr. Arafat and his advisers, who say that since the identity of the two bombers has still not been determined there is no reason that the Palestinian Authority should be held culpable.
But with clear American backing, Mr. Netanyahu has said Mr. Arafat and his forces have been too lenient toward Islamic militants whom they suspect of at least providing support to the still-unidentified bombers.
In recent days, the Israeli Army has taken some steps to ease the strict security measures that in the immediate aftermath of the bombing had prevented Palestinians even from moving from one Palestinian-ruled village to another.
But aides to Mr. Netanyahu have said that this should not be seen as a reward of any kind to Mr. Arafat.

Rancor in Jordan
 AQABA, Jordan, Aug. 13 (By The New York Times) -- A shouting match between Israeli journalists and Jordanian officials at King Hussein's waterfront palace here today underscored the tensions and mistrust that still underlie relations between the two countries.
To the Israelis' fury, security officials had insisted that journalists attending a news conference by the King and Prime Minister Netanyahu surrender their mobile telephones at the palace gate. The measure was variously described by Jordanian officials as a security move and an attempt to prevent the disruption of the session that could have been caused by loud voices and phones.
Some Israeli reporters had intended to use the telephones to broadcast the proceedings live, and many of them threatened to boycott the proceedings. A reporter from Israeli Radio even used a question to King Hussein to register a protest.
A Jordanian reporter later prefaced a question to Mr. Netanyahu by pointing out that Jordanian journalists had also surrendered their phones to the guards "because these are the rules and we respect them."

HEADLINE: Summer at the Firm: Party Hearty;
But No 80's Excess at Law Students' Summer Programs

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The other night at the Pull Cart, a ceramic studio in a Manhattan loft, dozens of men and women in their 20's were staring intently at unpainted pottery bowls, cups and saucers. Paintbrushes poised, they deliberated. Stripe versus swirl? Cornflower blue versus heather green?
This was not an art therapy class, but a gathering of some of the country's best and brightest law students. This summer they have been working at Debevoise & Plimpton, which has been host to many such outings for its "summers," as the students are known, hoping to make a lasting impression. 
 "If the summer program isn't enough like summer camp already," said Bruce E. Yannett, a Debevoise partner, "we wanted to be able to send a bowl home to their mothers."
Not since the high-rolling days of the late 1980's have New York's corporate law firms wooed the top law students so assiduously. The economy is surging, lawyers are doing very nicely, thank you, and firms are eager for these students to return after graduation to take up full-time entry-level positions. By some estimates, a firm can spend more than $250,000 to entertain its summer associates.
But though the courtship is now as ardent as a decade ago, the courting style has changed. Deliberately putting some distance between themselves and a tarnished decade that has become synonymous with conspicuous consumption, many New York law firms this summer have adopted an approach that is more, well, down home.
Of course, the de rigueur cocktail parties at places like Windows on the World and boat cruises around the Statue of Liberty by moonlight continue apace. But the emphasis has shifted to folksier, more intimate activities like canoe trips, walking tours, Shakespeare in the Park, softball games and pottery-painting parties.
The paradox for the summer class of '97 is that because many of the students are so swamped with work, they cannot always break away for the events and parties in their honor. It is not unusual for a firm to pack as many as two dozen activities into a summer to introduce summer associates to partners and associates.
"There are days when it's too much," said one law student at a prominent midtown firm who asked that her name not be used. "There was one week when I had a lot of work and I got sick. All my projects were hitting, and there were three serious events, and I was exhausted from all the running back and forth."
One tradition that was nipped during the recession but has since bounced back is the lavish lunch. Make that plural. In nine weeks, Amanda Perez, a Yale Law School student working at Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, has dined at the summit of Manhattan's restaurant scene: Nobu, Gramercy Tavern, La Grenouille (twice), Aureole, Le Cirque 2000, Four Seasons and Restaurant Daniel.
"It was mind boggling," said Ms. Perez, one of 68 summer associates at Simpson, Thacher. "During the school year, I eat spaghetti and canned soup and cereal. Suddenly, you're eating in these tremendous restaurants you could never dream of eating in on your own."
During the on-campus interview process, firms boast about the whirlwind of events for their summer associates. But while the extracurricular activities do not appear to make or break a student's decision about a summer job, they certainly put a thumb on the scale.
"I chose this firm because I thought they did the type of work that I wanted to do," said Marcia Bruggeman, a University of Michigan law student who accepted a summer position with Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy after considering 11 other offers. "But I definitely realized when I was interviewing that this is a firm that will really show you a good time."
Gone, however, are the nights on the town that Simpson, Thacher and a few other firms used to bestow on their interns during the 1980's. The nights were nearly blank-check outings for each summer associate and a guest, allowing them to charge to the firm, say, dinner at Lutece, the opera and dancing at nightclubs like M.K. or Nell's. Firms have also cut back on the opulent bashes at Tavern on the Green or the Guggenheim Museum that used to punctuate the summer.
Instead, many of this summer's activities and social events seem intended to tap into a distinctly 1990's Zeitgeist.
The pottery-painting event, and a canoe trip down the Housatonic River, were hits among the 53 associates at Debevoise & Plimpton. Simpson, Thacher scored with a party at the Central Park Zoo, also attended by lawyers' children. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, with 45 summer associates, offered a white-water rafting trip on the Delaware. Weil, Gotshal & Manges had a bowling party and a private viewing of the Keith Haring exhibition at the Whitney for its 58 summer associates.
And intimate dinners in partners' homes and smaller parties given by a single division of a firm have overtaken the firmwide 80's bashes.
It may seem odd that these young lawyers-to-be are romanced and coddled to such an extent. After all, the summer money alone should be enough to satisfy any 23-year-old: their base salary this year is the equivalent of $87,000 a year, about $1,675 a week. The future holds even more allure. The top law school graduates joining the top New York firms can earn, with bonuses, more than $90,000 a year.
But while a summer associate job is brushed with good-time glamour, a full-time associate turns into the grunt of the firm, often working 80-hour weeks on the most eye-glazing details of a deal or piece of litigation. So in a law students' market like this, with firms desperate to increase staff levels to keep up with the flood of work, firms must sell the summer associates not only on their brand of corporate law but also on the character of the firm, and on New York City.
"I don't think the recruiting intensity has ever been as high as it is right now in New York," said Mel M. Immergut, the chairman of Milbank, Tweed, who has given the obligatory cruise a personal touch by taking summer associates out on his 48-foot power boat.
Simpson, Thacher now offers a modified night on the town. A full-time associate will invite a summer associate and a guest for, perhaps, dinner and a Broadway show. "We scaled back on the dream nights in the early 1990's and never added them back," said Mark G. Cunha, a partner who oversees the summer associates program at Simpson, Thacher. "People thought it was too much, that it was a little over the top."
During the recession, many corporate firms lost money because merger and acquisition deals and major construction projects fell off. Some firms laid off lawyers; others went belly up. Now that they are raking in profits and expanding, they are doing all they can to avoid excess, or at least the appearance of it.
The low-key approach toward selling themselves seems to resonate with the summer associates of the 90's. While the dream nights of the 80's must have been exciting, said David Ellis, a 25-year-old summer associate at Debevoise, "You reach a point where it becomes wasteful."
A student at New York University Law School, Mr. Ellis said gatherings like the pottery-painting event, enhanced by red wine and Cole Porter CD's, allowed summer associates to meet the firm's lawyers in a relaxed setting. Of the earlier canoe trip, he reflected: "You'd be dunked into the river along with a partner, which is a rather different experience than what you see in the day-to-day life of the firm."
The low-key events are a welcome respite from the pressured atmosphere at work. Summer associates, who during the recession functioned almost as paralegals, are fielding assignments typical of a first- or second-year associate. They are working well past midnight. Some have been sent abroad for weeks to bolster branch offices overwhelmed by international deals.
Tim Wei, a Milbank, Tweed summer associate who spent a month in Hong Kong for the firm, has worked 70- to 85-hour weeks. "There was not a lot of time or energy to go out after work," he said. He did finally blow off steam during the firm's all-day outing at the Scarsdale Golf Club.
Perhaps the work load has saved the summer associates from any illusions that life in the capital of corporate law is one endless picnic. "This is about recruiting," said Alexandra Lahav, a Harvard law student at Debevoise & Plimpton this summer.
"They're doing their best to make us want to work for them. I know of a partner who stayed up all night for three nights. Everyone's aware of what's going on. We're lawyers, after all."
Well, almost.

HEADLINE: Child-Support Payments to Rise Automatically With Inflation

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki signed into law today a bill that, for the first time, permits automatic increases in child-support payments in cases in which payments have not kept pace with the cost of living.
The Governor also signed a bill that increases the penalties for parents who are repeatedly convicted of failing to make child-support payments, making the crime a low-level felony instead of a misdemeanor. 
 The laws are part of Mr. Pataki's broader campaign to collect delinquent support payments that total $2.3 billion statewide. The state now seizes the drivers' licenses of parents who fall more than four months behind in payments.
It is wrong for the state "to look the other way" when parents who can support their children just walk away, Mr. Pataki said during a bill-signing ceremony in the State Capitol. "We are going to go after them with everything we can."
New York joins one other state, Minnesota, in providing automatic cost-of-living adjustments for existing child-support orders. Other states are expected to adopt similar measures because the Federal welfare law approved last August gives them the option to do so as an alternative to using the courts to adjust child-support payments, advocates for the poor and children say.
"Many states have so relied on the courts that they have been reluctant to use administrative measures such as the cost-of-living adjustment," said Russel Sykes, the deputy director of the State Communities Aid Association. "The Federal law eliminates any uncertainty among the states that this approach would be frowned upon by the Federal Government."
Until now in New York, as in other states, a parent with custody of a child had to go to Family Court to get an increase in child-support payments. But critics say that process is often lengthy and has resulted in adjustments for only 26,000 of the 270,000 cases since 1994.
The new law circumvents the courts and allows parents with custody of the children to receive an increase if the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has risen by at least 10 percent since the child-support order was originally issued by the courts.
The Pataki administration estimates that more than 200,000 families with orders that were issued in 1994 or earlier will be eligible for an adjustment because the administration expects the increase in the cost of living to exceed 10 percent between 1994 and the end of 1997.
But under the law, a parent who is ordered to make higher payments can appeal the increase in Family Court by demonstrating that his or her income has not increased enough to require a change in the payments.
Advocates for the poor and children praised the legislation, saying it lifts the burden on parents who have until now had to go to court to make a case for higher support payments.
"It takes this issue out of the courts and makes it a matter of course," said Karen Schimke, the executive director of the State Communities Aid Association. "It really just says that a parent shouldn't have to go into court and argue for this."
Under the other legislation signed by the Governor, a parent who is convicted twice within five years of failing to make payments for a child under the age of 16 could be convicted of a Class E felony, which carries a maximum penalty of four years in jail.
Under the previous law, a person who failed to make a child-support payment faced a maximum penalty of one year in prison. "By creating a second offense as a felony, you are going to send a very clear message that you are not going to get a slap on the wrist," Mr. Pataki said.
The Governor also announced the arrests of 47 parents who were caught driving despite the fact that their licenses were revoked because they refused to make their child-support payments.

HEADLINE: Embattled Helicopter Service Evicted From Heliport

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
A company that operated the city's largest helicopter service for tourists was evicted from the East 34th Street Heliport yesterday, losing its final skirmish in a long legal battle with the city over back rent and the number of flights it sent daily over the Statue of Liberty, Central Park and Yankee Stadium.
The eviction will speed up the city's efforts to close another heliport, at East 60th Street, and will greatly reduce the number of tourist flights over the city. 
 The company that was evicted yesterday, Island Helicopters, which is based in Garden City, N.Y., was reponsible for nearly 40 percent of the 400 takeoffs and landings at Manhattan's four heliports every day.
City officials, under pressure from the heliport's neighbors, which include New York University Medical Center and the Murray Hill neighborhood, last year tried to force the company to cut the number of flights nearly in half by inserting a restrictive clause in the lease for the heliport, which is owned by the city.
While the city also contended that the company failed to prepare required environmental reports and owed at least $700,000 in back rent over a 10-year period, Island Helicopters officials yesterday blamed the eviction on election-year politics and the clout of wealthy neighbors.
Last year, the company sued in Federal court and won the right to keep up its busy flight schedule. And though its lease expired last year, it managed to stave off eviction by seeking Federal bankruptcy protection. But the bankruptcy suit was dismissed last Friday.
Yesterday, Judge Fredric Block of Federal District Court in Brooklyn rejected final pleas from the company's lawyers to further delay the eviction. A dozen city marshals who had been waiting since 11 A.M. converged on the heliport in the late afternoon, ordering the company's pilots and other employees out before locking the trailer that housed Island's office and the heliport's fences, and removing the company's signs.
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, the heliport's landlord, praised the action yesterday. "They were constantly in default on their rent, and they were a bad neighbor," he said.
But Leslie Roberts, a spokesman for the company, contended angrily that the city had misrepresented the facts about its dispute with Island Helicopters. He said the company owed no back rent to the city and had spent more than $1 million of its own money to obtain a special permit to remain on the site.
The real reason it was evicted, he insisted, was because the noise from the helicopters bothered residents, many of them wealthy, who live near the heliport. A crash at another Manhattan heliport in April of another company's helicopter, which killed a corporate executive, also cast a pall over the industry, he said.
"This company took the heliport from a rat infested, garbage-staging site," Mr. Roberts said, "and built it into the largest and most technologically current heliport in the world. And what it is now is a casualty of election-year politics."
Mr. Millard said the closing of Island Helicopters will reduce noise in a city constantly buzzed by helicopters. Overall, flights over the city will be cut by about 40 percent and tourist flights by about 60 percent.
Helicopter services at the heliports at Wall Street and East 60th Street also operate some tourist flights, and tours make up more than half of the business at the West 30th Street heliport. Those three sites are on privately owned land.
Within the next four months, Mr. Millard said, Johnson Controls, which now runs flights from East 60th Street, will move to the East 34th Street Heliport, and the East 60th Street heliport will be closed. In the meantime, Johnson Controls will operate corporate flights only at both sites, he said.
The consolidation of the two sites had been sought since April by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who vowed to reduce noise and address safety concerns.
Several aircraft in the Island Helicopters fleet had been involved in accidents in recent years. One of the company's helicopters lost power and made an emergency landing in the East River in October 1993. Another of its helicopters made an emergency landing in Central Park a few months earlier. Between 1985 and 1990, three helicopters owned by Island crashed on flights from East 34th Street, resulting in two deaths.

HEADLINE: India's 5 Decades of Progress and Pain

SERIES: 50 YEARS PAST MIDNIGHT: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: KAITHWARI, India

 BODY:
With monsoon rains sheeting down outside, Dawa Chand has passed many days recently in his tiny, darkened tent-maker's shop in this north Indian village, stitching bunting to flutter over village rooftops on the 50th anniversary of India's independence at midnight on Aug. 14, 1947.
As he has pedaled his treadle sewing machine, Mr. Chand, 31, has considered what India's half century as a free country has meant to people like himself, villagers who account for nearly three-quarters of the country's 970 million people. The question goes to the heart of India's nationhood, since it was in the country's 650,000 villages that Mohandas K. Gandhi, who led the independence struggle, found what he considered to be India's soul. 
 Mr. Chand strikes a note of optimism, crediting free India with achieving more for people like himself, an untouchable at the lowest rung of India's social hierarchy, than has been acknowledged by many of the country's critics. "We are still backward, of course, but we are moving forward, and we owe this to the Mahatma," he said, referring to Gandhi, a champion of the untouchables. "Because of him, people like myself are making progress our fathers and grandfathers never imagined."
In the myriad voices that have been raised in India in its 50th year, there have been many like Mr. Chand's, full of satisfaction for what the decades of independence have brought. Many others have been filled with doubt and recrimination. But perhaps the largest number of Indians have reacted with ambivalence, unsure of how to take the measure of a country so vast, so populous and so diverse that is has always defied attempts to define it.
Should Indians celebrate that their country, a grand tapestry of castes, languages, regions and faiths, has survived despite forecasts that it would splinter once Britain's controlling hand was removed? Or do they despair because inherent strains have spawned secessionist movements and other forms of violence that have made India one of the most lethal places on earth?
Should Indians take pride in their parliamentary democracy, vigorously upheld in a world where countries with far fewer problems have remained stifled by autocracy? Or should they lament the failures in their system, the demagogues who have risen to power on the votes of illiterate masses only to betray them, the politicians at every level who have built lives of sybaritic comfort for themselves while 350 million Indians remain mired in poverty?
In recent years, there has been another conundrum, the huge gap that has emerged between the new India of high technology, and the old India of the bullock cart. In Bombay, New Delhi, Calcutta, Madras and scores of other cities, an economy is emerging based on computers, rapid jet travel, air-conditioned hotels and mobile telephones.
This economy's new middle class numbers in the tens of millions, yet it exists in an uneasy symbiosis with an India where tens of millions of others cannot afford medicine when they are sick and send their tiny children into the street to bang on car windows for coins.
In weighing these contrasts, Indians are asking what matters more, that a country once racked by famines is now feeding itself and even exporting grain, or the crushing levels of illiteracy, disease and poverty that remain India's scourge?
As Indians search for answers, many cannot even agree on what standard they should use. Should they compare India now to the India of 50 years ago or to the accomplishments of a dozen more prosperous Asian nations, most of which India dwarfs in complexity and size?
These contradictions, apparent everywhere in India, were plainly evident in the differing attitudes towards the independence anniversary in Kaithwari. The village's 5,000 residents include a dominant minority of landowners, upper-caste families who still rule the roost, but it also has low-caste families who have found a small measure of prosperity that their families never previously knew. There is also a large block of families, at least a third of the village, who are still desperately poor.
Mr. Chand, the tent-maker, is an obvious case of success. The son of an illiterate cattle-trader, he won a lower-caste scholarship from the government to attend college in Meerut, an old British garrison city close to this village in western Uttar Pradesh state, then returned home after graduation to set up his business. His income from the shop and running a village post office is $130 a month, a fortune to the village's poor.
But among Mr. Chand's neighbors, there are some who have never traveled outside the village, never used a telephone and never had anybody in their family who stayed in school long enough to learn to read or write. In one muddy courtyard, a group of 25 Muslims, in rural India often poorer even than the poorest Hindus, said that the four generations of their family were living off a combined income of $50 a month, and that none of them had owned even a bicycle, a sewing machine or a radio, the first luxuries for India's poor.
For these villagers, the India of 1997 seems much too much like the India of half a century ago, a place where Gandhi's name is ritually invoked by politicians on great public occasions but where his memory is mocked by some of the realities of a country he did not live to see. Although Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist on Jan. 30, 1948, five months after independence, Indians everywhere still like to muse over what he would make of India if he were to return today.
Among the poorest in Kaithwari, there is a ready answer. " 'What is the Mahatma to us today?," said Mohammed Yunus, 48, who works in the fields for the upper-caste Hindus who own 90 percent of Kaithwari's land. Rolling a home-made cigarette of crushed leaves, Mr. Yunus said modern India was little different than the India of his forefathers.
"The Mahatma brought us freedom, but after that, what?" he said.
 
The Optimists
Stable Democracy Inspires Pride
For many Indians, the answer to that question lies in accomplishments they say have been overlooked in the breast-beating the anniversary has provoked. They hail three achievements in particular: the resilience of democracy despite a two-year lapse when Indira Gandhi assumed dictatorial powers in 1975; the country's success in feeding a population nearly three times larger than in 1947, and India's survival as a nation despite protracted insurgencies in the Punjab, Kashmir and the remote border states of the southeast.
"India can only be compared with India," argues Yogendra Singh, a sociology professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, a sentiment shared by many of India's optimists. By that measure, there is much to celebrate today.
"Poverty now is not at all what it was in 1947," said Mr. Singh, who grew up poor and low-caste in a village in Uttar Pradesh. "Then, 80 to 90 percent of the people had no proper clothing; now, almost everybody is properly dressed. Then, many people were emaciated; now, just about everybody gets two meals a day. Then, life expectancy was about 30, and it's more than 60 now. These are tremendous changes, so I don't think we have any reason to hang our heads."
Many Indians are particularly proud of the persistence of their democracy, and contrast their country with Pakistan, the nation carved out of British India when Muslim leaders demanded a separate state. Although Pakistan has been ruled by elected governments for the last nine years, it has been under military dictatorship for nearly half its half-century as a nation.
On the one occasion that Indian democracy was imperiled, Mrs. Gandhi's declaration of emergency and suspension of civil rights in 1975, voters outraged by the imprisonment of thousands of leading politicians and intellectuals turned on her in the 1977 general election and ousted the Congress Party from power for the first time since it led the independence struggle.
In recent years, a wave of corruption and criminality in Indian politics has caused some Indian commentators to say that democracy is facing a new and more insidious peril. In the assemblies of many of the 25 Indian states, and even in the Parliament in New Delhi, the independence generation has been replaced by a breed of ambitious and acquisitive politicians, some little more than gangsters.
For years, hardly a day has passed without a front-page scandal involving a a politician accused of selling favors. More than a dozen Cabinet ministers who served in the Congress Party are under investigation for corruption, including former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. In Bihar state, India's poorest, the low-caste politician who headed the state's Government until he was arrested last month, Laloo Prasad Yadav, has been jailed on charges of scamming $280 million from the state's animal husbandry funds.
While each scandal swallows money that might have gone to developing the country, some have had a direct impact on everyday life. Millions of Indians are paying the price for a decision in the early 1990's to rebuild the country's telephone system. The telecommunications minister, Sukh Ram, who was a former postal clerk who rose through Congress Party ranks, awarded contracts for a $40 billion scheme that was to have brought the country 10 million new phones, more than double the number then installed, by the end of the decade.
But according to investigations that began after the Narasimha Rao government's defeat in a general election last year, Mr. Ram rigged the bidding process and took large sums in payoffs. In the wake of the scandal, the project to modernize the country's antiquated telephone system has effectively stalled, with not a single new handset anywhere to show for the plans announced by Mr. Ram.
Even shadows like these have not persuaded most Indians that democracy itself is at fault, only that abuses are inevitable with an electorate of nearly 600 million people, half of them illiterate. Some say that political trends that have ended the Congress Party's role as India's natural ruling elite have produced new political forces, and that some of these, including low-caste parties like Mr. Laloo's in Bihar, have been under pressure to generate slush funds that can be used to bind the parties together and give their leaders a lifestyle their followers can admire.
Others say that India's greatest triumph is simply that it still exists. In British times, half of the country consisted of nearly 600 princely states, mostly ruled by maharajahs under British control. While most of these states were successfully integrated soon after independence, strong separatist tendencies have pulled at the country's seams, setting off a series of ethnic, religious and linguistic insurgencies. So far, none has succeeded, and few Indians expect that any will.
"You must remember that people were writing books in the 1950's and 1960's asking whether India could survive," said M.J. Akbar, a biographer of Nehru who is the founding editor of The Asian Age, a new newspaper that has quickly become one of India's most influential. "In 1947, it was very difficult to see how a seething mass of hungry and mostly illiterate people could keep this nation together. But now, the country's survival is taken for granted. You hardly hear anybody questioning it anymore."
 
The Skeptics
What Would Gandhi Think Today?
While views like these are widely held, the official mood at the anniversary has been heavily influenced by the skeptics. The Gujral Government has deferred the placement of a Gandhi statue on Rajpath, the ceremonial avenue at the heart of New Delhi, expressing reluctance to have Gandhi, the apostle of nonviolence, installed where he would stare down an avenue used every January for a military parade. But many say that erecting a statue would be hypocrisy anyway, since the country, in their view, has betrayed Gandhian ideals.
Among these is Khushwant Singh, 82, an author and columnist who covered the independence struggle and wrote "Train to Pakistan," a novel that gave a searing account of the 1947 partition.
Resisted by Gandhi to the last, the division resulted in the migration of at least 10 million Hindus and Muslims across the new frontier, and as many as 500,000 of them, according to Khushwant Singh's estimate, being killed in the bloodletting that ensued.
Those passions have not abated; Mr. Singh spoke from the apartment where he has lived under armed guard since the 1980's, when he angered Sikh militants with articles condemning a separatist insurgency in his native Punjab.
"Gandhi gave the world an illusion that all Indians were like him, inspired by a missionary concern for nonviolence and the plight of the poor," he said, "but I'm sad to say that it has turned out that hardly any of us are."
Government surveys offer plentiful ammunition for such dismal views: the 350 million Indians who live below the official poverty line; the 48 percent of the population who are illiterate; the 100 million city-dwellers living in vast, dismal slums known as jhuggis, where homes are mostly structures of metal and timber scrap; the 70 percent of Indians with no access to toilets; the 30 percent with no supply of safe water, and the millions who fall victim every year to rates of infant mortality, diarrhea, tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS that are among the highest in the world.
Conditions like these contribute heavily to a culture of violence that some Indians say is the country's worst failure. Outside India, the best-known example has been the cycle of riots between Hindus and Muslims, about 8,000 of which have been recorded since 1947. But far more Indians have died from other causes.
In big cities like Bombay, thousands of murders go unsolved, and for the most part barely investigated, every year. In the villages, the situation is much the same. According to Indian human rights groups, 5,000 women are killed every year in disputes over dowries, mostly by men, but only a handful of cases ever result in convictions.
Alongside these deprivations, many privileged Indians enjoy lives of opulence that mirror the inequalities of earlier times. Although the bejeweled maharajahs of British days have faded away, a new overclass in cities like Bombay, mostly politicians, business tycoons and mafia bosses, parade their wealth, inviting India's glossy magazines to palatial villas and to weddings that mimic the maharajahs' displays. While India has many discreet philanthropists, some millionaires admit to having ventured no closer to a jhuggi than an airport highway.
But it has not been the concentration of wealth, so much as the failure to create more, that has mattered most. For this, it is common nowadays to blame Nehru, the first Prime Minister, who believed that Soviet-style style economics held the solution to ending poverty. Even before Gandhi was killed, Nehru had rejected his vision of India as a "village republic," with its future rooted in the welfare of its rural masses, and embarked on a rush to industrialize.
The result of Nehru's policies was a vast network of state-owned factories, and a stifling system known as the "license raj," with officials determining the products, prices and markets for the private enterprise that remained. The bureaucracy burgeoned into a national army of 60 million, notorious for its inefficiency and sloth. In time, Indian economists began speaking of the "Hindu rate of growth," a yearly increase in per capita income of about 1.5 per cent for the first three decades after 1947, as if something intrinsic to India condemned the country to economic stagnation.
A failure to control population compounded socialism's burdens. The number of Indians has nearly tripled since 1947, and continues to grow by 18 million a year. Although populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh, with 140 million people, have been reporting lower growth rates in recent years, the absence of effective government birth-control programs has put India on track to surpass China as the world's most populous nation sometime in the 21st century. By then, perhaps around 2025, India is expected to have a population of at least 1.3 billion.
The failure to control population growth is most often blamed on Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Gandhi, who encouraged a disastrous experiment with coerced sterilization during the Emergency of the 1970's that was overseen by her son Sanjay. The experiment ended with the collapse of Mrs. Gandhi's flirtation with dictatorship, but a lasting consequence of the popular anger has been that Indian politicians ever since have treated birth-control programs as taboo.
Because national wealth has to expand by more than the rate of population growth of 2 percent a year just to keep the economy growing, the government's failure to act on population has crippled its ability to redress many of India's vast social problems, especially education, which many Indians consider to be the key to all other progress.
In the 1950 Constitution, the new rulers set 1960 as the deadline for universal primary education, but government figures four decades later show that 33 million children of school age, about one in three, have never been to school, and that about half of all students never reach secondary school. Women are worst affected, with a literacy rate of 39 per cent, against 64 per cent for men. At least 70 million Indian children under 16 end up in child labor.
Another legacy of the Nehru years is India's huge military establishment. Although reliable figures are hard to pin down, Western experts say that India's armed forces and a network of paramilitary police forces have a strength of at least four million men, and cost more than $10 billion a year, as much as the Government spends on health and education combined. To this must be added the huge expense of India's covert programs to develop nuclear weapons, along with the missiles to carry them.
Although left-wing critics often complain that the country's military might offends Gandhian principles of nonviolence, there is little dispute about the issue in mainstream Indian politics.
For one thing, the expense is justified by the need to confront Pakistan, especially in the disputed territory of Indian-held Kashmir, where a force of more than 500,000 Indian troops and police have been tied down by an insurgency backed by Pakistan. For another, Indian leaders have become increasingly concerned about the growing military might of China, although almost none ever say so publicly.
Partly because of the four decades of political dominance by three members of the Nehru family who served as Prime Minister -- Nehru himself, who died in 1964; Mrs. Gandhi, assassinated by Sikh security guards in 1984, and her son, Rajiv Gandhi, assassinated by a Tamil terrorist from Sri Lanka in 1991 -- their policies faced no major challenge until 1991, when Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, facing national bankruptcy, ordered socialism scrapped in favor of free markets, low tariffs, and foreign investment.
Although growth rates in the 1990's have zoomed beyond 7 percent, resistance from politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen accustomed to the comforts of the old system have blocked new changes needed to make the reformed economy work.
More than half the country's $350 billion annual output is still produced by state-owned companies. Almost none of the 60 million state employees have lost their jobs, or been retrained for other work. With many foreign companies becoming disillusioned, outside investment, less than $3 billion in 1996, has been far below that elsewhere in Asia, including China, which reported foreign investment of more than $40 billion last year.
 
The Future
Rising Expectations, In Cities and Villages
Even with these shortcomings, the economic reforms have produced a startling growth of the middle class. Indian economists argue about whether there are 30 million, 100 million, or even 150 million in the urban consumer class, but by any measure the Indian "yuppie" has become a pervasive fact of life, driving smart new cars, taking mortgages on the high-rise apartment buildings mushrooming beside every highway and griping about the quality of the cable systems that bring the Cable News Network or the ESPN sports channel into their homes.
While many university graduates used to head overseas to market their skills, now many are returning to exploit new opportunities in India.
A heart surgeon who returned to Ahmadabad last year from a thriving practice in California said he had come home for the sake of his children. "It's a shock readjusting to the heat and the dirt and the traffic, but having the kids back in their own culture is worth every bit of it," he said.
The rising expectations of the new middle class are one of the factors that are wearing down resistance to the economic reforms. Although left-wing politicians still denounce the "Westernization" of Indian culture, even they use mobile telephones. And even the leftists have been forced to recognize that ultimately there can be no turning back to the discredited socialism of the past. To even suggest it these days is to enrage many ordinary Indians who have to put up with the legacy of past mistakes.
The flaws of the old system show up in every sphere of life, with maddening consequences for rich and poor alike: In narrow, potholed highways choked with traffic that contribute to an annual road carnage of 65,000 deaths; in antiquated power plants that leave large areas of the country without power for hours, sometimes days, at a time; in hospitals with no medicines; in schools with no notebooks, pencils or chalk.
Many Indians contrast these conditions with progress elsewhere in Asia, where many countries that were as poor as India in 1947 have leapt to prosperity. Twenty-five years ago, most of these countries were no more advanced than India, but then the gap began to yawn. Some of these nations, such as Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea, have achieved per capita incomes 10 to 20 times higher than India's $340 a year, along with literacy rates of 90 per cent and more. While some Indians dismiss such comparisons as unfair, because of the differences in the scale of the problems India faces, others say it is time to reject the rationalizations.
"As a 16-year-old in Bombay in 1947, I felt there was nothing to stop India from doing whatever it wanted," said S. L. Rao, an economist who has been an key adviser on the economic reforms of the 1990's. "But the fact is, we haven't delivered the people of India what we promised. We are far, far behind, and our only choice is to admit it, buckle down, and see what we can accomplish in the next 50 years."
At first glance, visitors to Kaithwari could think that little in the village has changed. Buffalos wander down cobbled pathways. In the sunlight after the rains, old men draw quietly on hookahs, the brass water pipes that are traditional in rural India. At street-corner pumps, young girls giggle as they wash shoulder-length hair. Barefoot children scamper, chasing goats, while Muslim women move silently along lanes gathering buffalo dung for fuel.
But villagers are eager to list the things that have improved. For some, it is the paving of once-muddy roads leading to Meerut, 15 miles away; for others, the villages' three schools, with enrollments accounting for 90 percent of all village children; for others still, electricity that flows three or four hours on most days, long enough to power pumps that irrigate fields, raise water from wells, and power television sets that many better-off villagers now own.
These improvements seem to have emboldened many villagers, leading them to question old social roles and even to demand more from their government. Naresh Kumar, a 35-year-old man from an untouchable background, held his tongue when Brahma Jeet Tyagi, 89, a veteran of Gandhi's nonviolent protests against the British and a member of the high-caste clan that still wields the real power in this village, spoke of the rise of lower-caste politicians as a matter of "the donkeys taking over from the horses." Only later, when he was alone with visitors from outside the village, did Mr. Kumar speak up. "Can the donkeys do any worse than the horses?" he said.
In Kaithwari, there were many conversations with poorer villagers like the one with Mr. Kumar, suggesting that attitudes may be hardening. Watching television, among other things, has introduced the villagers to a wider world, and their comments sounded like a challenge to the country's politicians to begin the country's second half-century with a more determined effort to deliver on the vision of a better life held out to another generation of India's poor 50 years ago.
"When we sit in our homes at night, we see pictures on our television sets of the rich man's life, with cars, refrigerators, air-conditioners, everything we don't have," said Mohammed Rafiq, 28, a Muslim who makes his living selling vegetables. Mr. Rafiq held out what he said was his most treasured possession, a watch he bought for 120 rupees, about $3.40. And then he added: "So naturally we think: Why is it that God caused us to be born here? Is it our fate to live always as we do?"

Graph/Map: "Independent India, Then And Now"
India, with diversity rivaling America's melting pot, has the second largest population on earth. At its current growth pace, it will surpass China on this count around 2020. Indians speak 17 languages and 22,000 distinct dialects. They practice six major religions. More than half of the population can read, but fewer than half the children under five have enough to eat. What may most constrain, if not define, India as a nation, are the mountains capping the north and oceans cradling the rest.
India along with Pakistan, China and Indonesia emerged from similar economic circumstance at similar times in history.

HEADLINE: Alaska Revels in Frontier Image Though Frontier Slips Away

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BARROW, Alaska

 BODY:
Board "the Last Great Airline" to the state where license plates extol "the Last Frontier" and the Iditarod sled dogs run "the Last Great Race," and the suspicion cannot but swell that the one-million-plus tourists who visit Alaska each year may be witnesses to "the Last Great Snow Job."
After all, in this state that perpetuates the image of being populated by old "sourdough" cabin-dwellers and bushwhackers, fully half the population of more than 600,000 now lives in metropolitan Anchorage, where in most ways they might just as well be living in Minneapolis or Buffalo. Nearly three-fourths of all Alaskans live in urban areas. 
 Where men were once said to outnumber women 10 to 1, and their backwoods weirdness inspired the saying that "the odds are good but the goods are odd," the ratio is now closer to 109 men to 100 women.
Eskimo villagers watch 28 channels of satellite television and take courses by Internet. Hunters tracking moose deep into the interior call their wives on their cellular phones to boast from the campfire. Drive-through espresso stands dot highways where the only other sight is eye-straining plains leading to white-meringue mountains.
In a time when a bush pilot can buy Grey Poupon at a settlement store in the desolate north, Alaskans are struggling with a question that puts in doubt the state's very identity: Can "the Last Frontier" still be considered a frontier at all?
The answer, as gleaned from two dozen Alaskans asked recently in places from Barrow to the Aleutians, seems to be mainly, "Yes, but," with a loud undercurrent of "No, get over it."
For all the shrinkage of the world, nearly all those interviewed said that living in Alaska remained deeply different from living "outside."
"I've worked in every area of the state -- the Aleutian chain, McGrath, Barrow, the Kingscreek Mine -- and we have the same conveniences you have outside now, which wasn't true 10 years ago," said Steven Johnson, the manager and cook at an outpost hotel in Nuiqsut, a native village in the North Slope Borough. But still, Mr. Johnson said: "It's different here. I think 'frontier' might be closer to a state of mind."
A growing school of thought argues that not only is Alaska no longer a frontier, but that the state would also do well to move past its frontier mythology altogether.
The time is gone, the argument goes, when untouched land was seen as a challenge to be conquered, and now the world is moving toward an ethic that the land must instead be preserved. If there is a central conflict underlying much of Alaskan politics today, it is this question of frontier versus park, of whether various chunks of Alaska's natural bounty should be developed or protected.
"What has happened to Alaska in the last 30 or 40 years is that it's gone from being the last frontier to the last wilderness," said Stephen Haycox, a professor of history at the University of Alaska at Anchorage. " 'Frontier' in the national psyche means economic development, and that is no longer seen as the unquestioned future."
In a recent essay, John Haines, one of Alaska's most respected writers, condemned "this industrial maggot burrowing into the 'last frontier' as if a people could not rest and thrive if that American mirage, the frontier, ceased to exist. But it is already disappearing, exists perhaps now as a kind of tinted vacationland, an immense outdoor theater."
"And I believe," Mr. Haines wrote, "we will learn to live with its absence or perish, as a nation, as a people."
It is enough to make residents wonder whether, more than a century after the historian Frederick Jackson Turner first lamented the end of the American frontier, America has truly come to the end of the road.
Even the most gung-ho frontier boosters admit that Alaska is no longer the kind of wild and woolly place it was when the gold miners rushed in 100 years ago, or when the military swarmed in 50 years ago, or even when the pipeline and highway builders invaded in the 1970's.
On the other hand, even if it is not the frontier it once was, it still has space, space, space, residents said, and that Lebensraum places its stamp deep on the state's psyche.
Alaska, which makes up 16 percent of the United States land mass, is so sparsely populated that it averages just 1 person per square mile, compared with 75 people per square mile nationally, according to the Alaska Population Overview put out by the State Department of Labor.
And that space, many say, translates into a sense of opportunity that does hark back to the fortune-seeking of the pioneer days.
Asked if Alaska was still a frontier, Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat whose election platform included a pledge to consign the still-common "honey bucket," or outhouse, to the museum, responded at first with a kneejerk, Oh, sure.
Then Mr. Knowles paused to qualify. Travel is so much easier, he said, and the state's population has grown so much that Alaska does not seem as remote as it once did.
Still, he contended, it retains abundant wilderness, and "it is also the frontier in the symbolic sense, in the way that frontiers are made of opportunity and hope, and people look to Alaska in that regard."
As Susan Fison, an Anchorage statistician, described the feel of Alaska: "It's not all set and pat and cast in concrete. You can make a real difference here."
Professor Haycox agreed that the state remained a frontier only in the extra edge it offered, the dynamic sense of added opportunity that its newness and the sparseness of its population offered, the sense that if a person wanted to do something all he had to do was get out of his chair and do it.
Otherwise, he said, he likes to joke that if you subtract all the Alaskans living in cities and large towns, and also subtract the 85,000 Alaskan natives who do spend time out in the bush, "you come up with about 250 people actually hewing their own wood and building cabins."
And "the three-fourths of the population which do live in urban areas work in steel-framed, glass-fronted buildings with indoor-outdoor carpet," he said, "and drive home over asphalt streets to platted subdivisions with unruly grass and unruly children just like people everywhere else in the country."
Of course, that is the view from Anchorage. In more remote spots, residents who were asked whether Alaska remained a frontier tended to speak not of abstract spirit but of concrete geography, as in, "Well, it is here."
On the Aleutian island of Unalaska, Mayor Frank Kelty noted that the rough Bering Sea fishing life had long attracted people escaping from unsavory pasts "outside" to a place where all that mattered was whether a person could do the work.
Mr. Kelty recalled one mysterious man who paced the shore for months, undisturbed by local residents, until he finally disappeared; people assumed he had finally caught his submarine, the Mayor said.
And in Barrow, the northernmost town in the United States, the owner of a Mexican restaurant, Fran Tate, described the logistical problems involved in transporting lettuce and tomatoes for her "tacos on the tundra" when the temperature was 20 below zero.
"It takes a different breed of cat to survive," Ms. Tate said. "You can't be a sissy up here. You can't even get a quarter-inch screw when you want it. You have to ride to Fairbanks to get it."
Fairbanks is 540 miles to the southeast.
On a plane near Gates of the Arctic National Park, Tom Stout, a helicopter pilot who has explored some of the farthest corners of the state, noted the continued prevalence of out-in-the-field occupations like oil drilling and bush piloting that give workers a sense of being at nature's mercy.
But the main difference between today and the old frontier, Mr. Stout said, is that technology has reached the point that "if you've got enough money, you can conquer any point anywhere."
Even in Anchorage, residents said, moose often wander into backyards, salmon cram the streams and residents never forget that it is only a few minutes from downtown to great stretches of unpeopled territory.
"People say, 'The good thing about Anchorage is that it's so close to Alaska,' " said Ms. Fison, a statistician for the Anchorage City Planning Department. "The reason we can be called a frontier is that so much of the land is really in its natural state. We're surrounded by all this land that has never and will not be developed."
As for the land that can be developed, she said, the business horizons seem so open despite the state economy's slow growth rate that a friend who hopes to develop Alaska's first outlet mall calls it "the last retailing frontier."
"We still have no Victoria's Secret, no Gap, no Limited," Ms. Fison said. "It wasn't long ago we didn't even have a McDonald's."
Also frontier-like, residents noted, is Alaska's lingering attraction among the adventurous young, and its lack of appeal among the old. The state's median age is almost 31, compared with nearly 35 nationally.
The population's mobility is also striking. More than half of Anchorage's residents have lived there less than 10 years.
And the state's population is growing. In 1995, the last year for which Census Bureau figures are available, the population was 603,617, an increase of 9.7 percent over the 1990 figure of 550,043, and nearly double the 1970 population of 302,583.
Many Alaskans also mentioned the powerful every-man-for-himself spirit that still pervades the state's economics. Alaska has no income tax or sales tax and generally keeps taxes so low that it is far and away the nation's least taxed state. A great many people come to Alaska simply to make a pile of money and leave, said Mr. Stout, the pilot..
For all that, Alaskans who have been here more than a decade or so, those veteran enough to recall the days when they saw television shows two weeks after they were broadcast in the lower 48 and when tapes of national news were flown in and broadcast a night late, have a hard time buying into the frontier line.
Especially when they stop in to villages like Nuiqsut, a settlement of 400 people on the Colville River, and see Grey Poupon mustard in the local store or hear Robert Nukapigak, a local bus driver, mention that "they just hooked up the whatchamacallit, the Internet."
Floyd Saltz Jr., a pilot for FS Air (whose slogan is a brave-hearted "Anything, Anywhere, Anytime"), said: "It's not the frontier it was when I arrived 31 years ago. Today, we're able to bring our way of life into a small village and change it overnight."
Even young residents like Jeremiah Odom, the 19-year-old barista at the Pit Stop Espresso booth on the lonely highway between Anchorage and Palmer, do not feel any of the deprivations that once characterized distant frontier life.
True, Mr. Odom spent part of his childhood in a cabin in the bush (the family left because his mother tired of life without appliances), and must lug in several tanks of water every evening to make the coffee for lack of running water.
But he has his cell phone to keep him company and a menu of espresso shots, syrup flavors and lattes to equal any in Seattle.
"I feel like we're modernized here just like anywhere else," Mr. Odom said, "though if you want to feel the last frontier, you can just grasp it in the bush."

HEADLINE: Competitors Say Strike Is No Blessing

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Competitors of the United Parcel Service are doing about as much business as they can possibly handle, but not one said it was thrilled about the strike against the nation's biggest package-delivery company.
"No one would be happier than me if this were to end," said Bram Johnson, a spokesman for RPS Inc. in Pittsburgh. 
 Like other overnight and parcel delivery companies, RPS, a subsidiary of Caliber System Inc. in Akron, Ohio, is running full bore: since the strike, its volume has jumped 50 percent, to 1.5 million parcels a day. The company is not taking on any new customers, and has no intention of considering new business until after the strike is resolved.
Business is also booming at the Federal Express Corporation, where daily volumes have jumped to between 3.5 million and 4 million from 2.8 million. But Federal Express, which has shortened pickup and operating hours, eliminated overnight guarantees and placed limits on the number of additional parcels its regular customers can ship, clearly could be doing even more business if it had more personnel.
"We are limiting volume as much as we can," said Jess Bunn, a spokesman for Federal Express, which is based in Memphis. "And people just don't seem to understand why we can't take their packages, that we are not U.P.S., which handles 12 million parcels daily. People seem to think we should be able to step right in. We wish this strike had never happened."
Capacity is close to the breaking point at the Airborne Freight Corporation, which normally handles about 1.3 million parcels a day.
As of yesterday, Airborne's shipments were up 35 percent from the day of the walkout, to 1.755 million.
"We are at the point now where we are concerned about service levels," said Tom Brannigan, a spokesman for the company, which is based in Seattle. Airborne has not limited the number of packages its regular customers can ship, but it is restricting the weight of each shipment.
Sandra Harding, a spokeswoman for the United States Postal Service, which moves more parcels than anyone save U.P.S., did not sound especially upset by the strike.
"This is not the best-case scenario," Ms. Harding said. But she added, "A number of small and large customers have said they are going to start shifting business our way."
Since the strike began, Ms. Harding said, the volume of the Postal Service's overnight mail, called Express Mail, has risen 70 percent; Priority Mail (with delivery in two to three days), 50 percent, and regular parcel post service, 20 percent.
The strike has also prompted a sharp increase in package delivery service at major bus companies.
"Before the strike, we were shipping about 10,000 to 11,000 packages a day," said Katherine Williams, a spokeswoman for Greyhound Lines Inc. "That volume has about doubled," she said. Ms. Williams added that the company, based in Dallas, has started to add buses that carry no passengers, only freight.
Economists said the drag on business output caused by the strike will depend on how long it lasts, but there are already some signs. Yesterday Russ Berrie & Company Inc. in Oakland, N.J., a maker of dolls and gift items, and National TechTeam Inc. in Dearborn, Mich., a provider of data services, said they had laid off a total of 200 part-time and temporary employees because of the strike.

HEADLINE: United Parcel and Teamsters to Resume Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Negotiations to end the strike at United Parcel Service are scheduled to resume on Thursday as pressure mounted on the President to intervene more aggressively in the labor dispute.
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said that the resumption of bargaining between U.P.S. and striking members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters came after she had repeated telephone conversations with both sides. 
 But after her announcement the teamsters' president, Ronald Carey, expressed little grounds for optimism.
Even as the two sides headed back to bargaining, the stakes in the dispute seemed to be escalating rapidly for the White House as each day passes without an end to the walkout, now well into its second week. The strike has severed the inventory pipeline for thousands of businesses. But it also represents a crucial test of strength for the labor movement, which has been one of Mr. Clinton's strongest supporters.
So far, Presidential aides have tried to keep Mr. Clinton out of the line of fire, urging representatives of U.P.S. and the teamsters to settle the dispute on their own, while limiting the Administration's involvement to the informal jaw-boning and arm-twisting by Ms. Herman.
But with no sign of progress toward a settlement, Republican lawmakers and business groups are sharpening their demands that the President intervene directly. One way Mr. Clinton might do that is by invoking the Taft-Hartley Act, the Federal labor law that allows the President, in cases of economic emergency, to go to court to force strikers back to work for up to 80 days while a board of inquiry studies the issues. Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, wrote to Mr. Clinton, urging the President to carefully weigh his powers under the law.
But Mr. Clinton's aides said that the Taft-Hartley law was an unwieldy tool that set an extremely high legal threshold. To meet it, the Administration would have to present evidence in Federal court that the strike affected an entire industry and endangered "national health or safety."
U.P.S. representatives and some employer groups contend that the terms of the law have already been met. They suggested that Mr. Clinton was reluctant to act more decisively for political reasons, chiefly that he is unwilling to oppose the teamsters and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which oppose any effort to invoke the statute.
The teamsters have been an important contributor to the Democratic Party. The union donated a total of $161,021 to the party in 1995 and 1996, but contributed nothing to the Republican Party, according to figures compiled by Common Cause, a citizens' group. In the same period, U.P.S. contributed $148,325 to the Republican Party and nothing to the Democratic Party.
Today, White House aides denied that Mr. Clinton's support from labor was connected to his unwillingness to invoke the Taft-Hartley law.
"There's a statutory standard in law that would allow the President to invoke back-to-work proceedings under the Taft-Hartley Act," said Michael D. McCurry, the President's spokesman. "Those are rarely invoked.
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter tried to invoke the law, but a Federal judge ruled that the Administration had failed to meet the standards of the act. It was the last time the Government tried to apply the law.
Experts said Mr. Clinton could feel more pressure if consumers found increasingly empty shelves.
But today, White House aides expressed confidence in their hands-off approach, partly because public opinion polls showed many Americans supported it. One poll, by ABC News, showed that while nearly three-quarters of those polled said they were affected by the strike, only 26 percent said that the President should intervene.
Since he has been President, Mr. Clinton has followed a zig-zag course in handling labor disputes. On the eve of Thanksgiving in 1993, he informally intervened in a five-day-old strike by American Airlines flight attendants, persuading the parties to submit to binding arbitration.
But Mr. Clinton's informal efforts to end the Major League Baseball strike in 1995 failed.
Mr. Clinton did intervene to halt a strike by pilots against American Airlines in February, minutes after the walkout began. He suspended the strike by invoking emergency powers under another law, the 1926 Railway Labor Act. The law, which does not apply to the U.P.S. strike, has a lower threshold than the Taft-Hartley law. It allows the President to intervene if a transportation strike threatens severe economic impact.

Pride and Ambivalence Mark India's Anniversary
Indians are by and large delighted that their country has survived 50 years of independence without having succumbed to undemocratic temptations. But they are less sanguine about the extent of poverty and rising criminality within the new political class. A1 

Prime Minister I. K. Gujral envisions amicable relations between India and Pakistan, where he was born before the 1947 partition. A7
 
Canada Will Shut 7 Reactors
Seven of the 19 operating nuclear reactors in the Canadian province of Ontario will be shut down after a report concluded they were badly managed and inadequately secure. All of the reactors are within 100 miles of the United States border. The president of the utility that operates them resigned, and more departures were expected. The Candu reactors in question have figured prominently in a multi-billion dollar export program and versions have been sold to Argentina, Romania, South Korea and China. A6
 
Class Bias Seen in Brazil
The impunity of Brazil's upper classes was reaffirmed by a federal judge's decision to dismiss murder charges against four affluent youths accused of killing a sleeping Indian leader by dousing him with gasoline and setting him on fire. The judge cited a picture of one of the youths with his dog as evidence that he was a "good person." Human rights activists were outraged and an appeal was expected. A6
 
Pretoria Panel Hears Testimony
Clive Derby-Lewis, the man convicted of murdering one of South Africa's most popular black leaders, testified to a well-attended session of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission that he was in a "state of shock" when he learned of Chris Hani's death in 1993. He said he had long plotted to kill Mr. Hani and given his accomplice a gun for the purpose, but he thought they had agreed to postpone the assassination until after that Easter weekend. A7
 
Envoy Leaves Mideast
Dennis Ross, the American special envoy to the Middle East, returned to Washington after four days of frenetic meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. He reckoned his mission had at least stanched further deterioration in the two sides' relations after a suicide bombing last month cast a grim pallor over peace talks. He said Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's first trip to the region would be accelerated if she deemed that security ties had resumed in earnest. A3
 
Bosnia Refugees Can Return
Around 400 Muslim refugees have been promised full security to return to their homes in the Jajce region of central Bosnia, according to a Bosnian television report. Local Muslim and Croat officials agreed that the Muslims, who fled intimidation from Croat gangs early this month, could return starting this weekend. But United Nations officials said they expected most of the refugees to be too frightened to reclaim their homes. (Agence France-Presse)

Groups to Fight Subpoenas In Congressional Inquiry
The Senate committee investigating campaign finance has issued 26 sweeping subpoenas to nonprofit advocacy groups, on both the right and the left, seeking an array of documents, including confidential strategy memos, correspondences with candidates and all materials related to publicly debated issues. Several of the groups are rebelling against the subpoenas, calling them politically motivated "search missions" that go beyond the committee's scope and violate their constitutional rights to free speech.

Calcium Intakes Redefined
A panel of nutrition experts, citing substantial evidence that most Americans do not consume enough calcium to stave off bone loss, set new standards that increase the recommended daily allowance of calcium-rich foods by roughly one serving per day for most people. A1

Competitors of U.P.S. are doing about as much business as they can possibly handle, but not one of the companies said it was thrilled about the strike against the nation's biggest delivery service company. A28
 
Rulings in Bombing Case
Lawyers for Terry L. Nichols, who will stand trial next month on charges of murder and conspiracy in the Oklahoma City bombing, lost their bid to disqualify the United States Attorney from Oklahoma City, Patrick M. Ryan, because they said he might cry in front of the jury. A12
 
Army Official Issues Threat
The highest-ranking enlisted soldier in the Army, Gene C. McKinney, the Sergeant Major of the Army, issued a threat through his lawyers that if he is put on trial on sexual misconduct charges, his defense team will show that top-ranking officers within the Army were not prosecuted for the same crimes.

Hikers Lost in Flash Flood
Searchers combed water, mud and boulders in a narrow, scenic, normally dry canyon for survivors of a flash flood in Arizona that swept away 12 hikers. The canyon near Lake Powell turned into a deadly flume, sweeping away the hikers, who apparently were unaware of a storm miles away. A12
 
Agreement on H.U.D. Jobs
Clinton Administration officials and the largest union representing Federal housing agency workers said they had agreed on a plan to reduce the work force of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to 7,500 from the current level of 10,500 by 2002. The reduction is part of a plan to make the much-criticized agency more efficient. A22

Police officials said a 25-year-old officer was charged with assaulting and brutalizing a man in a Brooklyn police station after arresting him in a scuffle outside a nightclub. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said other officers could face charges in the attack on the victim, who remained in critical condition at Coney Island Hospital.

HEADLINE: Sales Are Robust; Inflation Remains Feeble

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Revived after a spring rest, shoppers briskly increased spending at retail counters for the second straight month in July, while an important gauge of inflation was even more subdued than expected, Government reports showed today.
"The consumer is back," said Daniel Laufenberg, senior economist at American Express Financial Advisors in Minneapolis. "The second-quarter slowdown was just a breather, not the start of a moderating trend." 
 Retail sales, the Commerce Department estimated, climbed six-tenths of 1 percent last month, and that was after the June sales gain was revised upward to seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Nonetheless, economists said they still believed the Federal Reserve would find scant reason to raise interest rates when its chief policy arm meets next Tuesday in one of its eight yearly sessions to plot monetary policy.
"Why fool with an economy so balanced" that inflation remains tame in the face of moderate to strong growth? asked Cliff Waldman, economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. He said the Fed would not act next week.
Indeed, the Labor Department reported that prices obtained by the nation's producers fell for an unprecedented seventh straight month in July, with all three stages of production -- finished goods, crude goods and raw materials -- recording drops last month and since July 1996.
Moreover, when the wide-swinging energy and food components were excluded, prices of finished goods, those ready for sale to consumers or business users, edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in July and stood exactly where they did a year ago.
"Fabulous," exclaimed Joseph Liro, economist at CIBC Wood Gundy in New York.
One of the most visible examples of vanquished inflation was cars. With the aid of incentive programs, car prices fell 1.6 percent last month so that auto makers received 3 percent less for them than they had a year ago. This no doubt contributed to the announcement by Chrysler today that its 1998 models would carry sticker prices slightly below this year's.
Computers dropped 1.8 percent at the producer, sometimes called wholesale, level last month, bringing the 12-month drop to 21.6 percent, the Labor Department's tally also showed.
Flour fell 5 percent, fresh fruits and melons 9.7 percent, gasoline 1 percent, primary nonferrous metals 5.3 percent, wheat 10.4 percent, copper scrap 7.8 percent, beef and veal 1.3 percent and refined sugar 2.9 percent.
On the other hand, fresh eggs soared 21.7 percent, wood pulp rose 3.1 percent and raw cotton, hit by drought, jumped 8.4 percent.
The increased affordability of cars helped lift automotive sales 1 percent last month, the Commerce Department's initial estimate of retail activity found. Auto dealers took in $51.1 billion in July, nearly one of every four retail dollars.
But even without motor vehicles, retailers took in five-tenths of 1 percent more money than in June. This reflected broad strength, the lone pronounced exception being a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent for merchants selling furniture and other home equipment, a bit of a puzzle given the buoyant real estate market. The category of building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes posted an increase of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
Among nondurables, items expected to last less than three years, the overall increase was six-tenths of 1 percent for July, two-tenths of a point more than in June.
All categories showed gains, nine-tenths of 1 percent for drugstores, eight-tenths of 1 percent for gasoline stations, seven-tenths of 1 percent for department stores and others selling general merchandise, four-tenths of 1 percent for food stores and for restaurants and bars and two-tenths of 1 percent for stores selling apparel and accessories.
"The current pace of retail sales is consistent with our view that consumer spending will rise at a 2.5 to 3 percent rate during the second half," Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, advised clients. "That does not constitute excess demand."
But solid gains for June, now seven-tenths of 1 percent, and for July followed three straight monthly declines, contributing to Mr. Laufenberg's appraisal that there is a 50 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates when it meets on Sept. 30, the next scheduled meeting after Tuesday's session.
A more skeptical view was offered by Susan M. Sterne, proprietor of Economic Analysis Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., a specialist in consumer behavior. She said the summer was such a slack time for retailing that it was too early to judge "whether we have a rebound." If one does occur, she added, it is likely to be mild.
Consumers are financially stretched, she has long maintained, and "the more overextended you get, the more price-conscious you get," thereby keeping pressure on merchants' profit margins, as well as sales volume.
Today's price report showed that both finished goods and raw materials edged down one-tenth of 1 percent last month, while those at the intermediate stage of production eased two-tenths of 1 percent.
"There is still no sign of pressure at the earlier stages of production," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns.

INDIA
From Midnight to the Millennium
By Shashi Tharoor
Illustrated. 392 pages. Arcade Publishing. $27.95.
 India is 50 years old as an independent nation this weekend, and, of course, it has for thousands of years been one of the great expressions of human civilization. But India is unlike any other country. It is a place made and unmade by British imperialism and populated by every racial type on the globe, people who speak 17 major languages and 22,000 dialects and engage in some of the most ferocious sectarian fighting -- Hindus against Muslims, Sikhs against both -- going on anywhere in the world these days.
Shashi Tharoor, a novelist who is also a senior official at the United Nations living in New York, uses the half-centennial to examine the question of what is India, what makes it a country? In "India: From Midnight to the Millennium," Mr. Tharoor is a thoughtful and well-informed observer, one who demonstrates the balance of insiderness and outsiderness that has often made for the best writing about India. (V. S. Naipaul, who grew up in Trinidad, is another very good example.) 
 Mr. Tharoor, who was born in London but grew up in Bombay and Calcutta, writes a series of essays focusing on different aspects of his two major concerns: India's terrible poverty and the rise of sectarian feeling powerful enough to threaten the common sense of nationhood. He writes elegantly and often colorfully, and when he blends his political interests with his personal experience, his portrait is especially vivid.
But he also writes at times too much as a politician himself. He takes positions, but they are often tinged with a bromidic quality, as if he were a candidate for office striving not to offend anybody while building a broad base of support for his views. Perhaps consistent with that, his "India" goes rather more deeply into local politics and politicians than most Americans would want. His 75-page chapter, "Better Fed Than Free," in which he reflects on the debate between the advocates of unrestrained democracy and those of authoritarian rule in a poverty-stricken country, is a rambling and repetitive exercise.
In it, Mr. Tharoor covers the various excuses and justifications that have been made for authoritarianism -- especially during the emergency declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975; acknowledges that the "bargaining, compromise and consensus-building" needed in a democracy make authoritarian government seem efficient by comparison; discusses India's intellectuals as "torn between the pull of an ancient tradition and the attractions of the modern world" and quotes everybody from Woodrow Wilson to a Congress Party president, D. K. Borooah. In the end, Mr. Tharoor opts for democracy over authoritarianism, but one feels, aside from the fact that the subject is a bit old, that he could have come to that not surprising conclusion in a crisper, shorter and less dutiful essay.
Still, Mr. Tharoor makes no apologies for India's shortcomings, including those that stem from the mistakes made by the Indians themselves. While he clearly admires Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister and the founder of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty (Indira was his daughter), he blames Nehru's soggy socialist ideology for much of India's economic backwardness today. "For most of the five decades since independence, India has pursued an economic policy of subsidizing unproductivity, regulating stagnation and distributing poverty," Mr. Tharoor writes. "We called this socialism."
In 1986, he points out by way of example, the Steel Authority of India "paid 247,000 people to produce some 6 million tons of finished steel, whereas 10,000 South Korean workers employed by the Pohan Steel Company produced 14 million tons that same year." He is correspondingly supportive of the economic reforms begun in the early 1990's by former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, which in Mr. Tharoor's opinion are the best hope for Indian prosperity in the half-century of self-rule.
Among Mr. Tharoor's most compelling passages are those that deal with India's descent, after centuries of relative harmony, into sectarian violence. As always, he is at his best when he links his own experience -- in this instance, his beliefs in the nature of Hinduism -- with his country's political experience. He repudiates the fundamentalist Hinduism that brought about the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya in 1992, which in turn led to the most horrific religious bloodletting in many years. Indeed, in Mr. Tharoor's vision, Hinduism cannot be fundamentalist because it is a religion without dogma, enriched by the beliefs of others.
In explaining the rise of sectarianism, Mr. Tharoor does not hesitate to place the blame on Hindu fanaticism, even if that fanaticism has been provoked by what he calls "other chauvinisms," Muslim and Sikh. "The rage of the Hindu mobs is the rage of those who feel themselves supplanted in this competition of identities, who think that they are taking their country back from usurpers of long ago." In this sense, Mr. Tharoor writes, "the battle for India's soul" will be waged between "two Hinduisms, the secularist Indianism of the nationalist movement and the particularist fanaticism of the Ayodhya mob." He offers no cause for optimism that his brand of Hinduism will prevail.
His best story has to do with a man named Charlis from the author's ancestral homeland, Kerala. Charlis as a boy was repudiated by Mr. Tharoor's family because he belonged to an untouchable caste. With each visit that Mr. Tharoor makes to Kerala, the situation changes incrementally, until at the end Charlis has become an important local official and an honored guest in the household.
Mr. Tharoor's book would have been more rewarding had he dwelt more on people like Charlis. When the author deals with the more abstract, highly serious questions, his book has a familiar feel. When he gets down to India as a concrete personal experience, everything seems new and fresh.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Singing the Course Of Human Events

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
SO maybe it is the squarest thing on Times Square. It's often gratingly corny; it's dotted with the kind of nudging sexual jokes that might be swapped in the boys' room of an elementary school, and its songs feature rhymes that make Madison Avenue jingles seem like models of sophistication. Besides, doesn't the very idea of America's Founding Fathers gamboling to a souped-up minuet give you the willies?
But darn it if "1776," the 26-year-old musical about (oh, please) the Declaration of Independence, doesn't prove itself to be a surprisingly (if oddly) skilled seducer. It's like some facetious history nerd of a blind date you couldn't imagine, at the evening's beginning, enjoying yourself with. Yet by the end of three hours in its company at the Roundabout Theater, you're amazed at how quickly, and even pleasurably, the time has gone. 
 "1776," which has music and lyrics by Sherman Edwards and a book by Peter Stone, was the show that nobody expected to like when it opened in 1969, not exactly a banner year for Yankee Doodle patriotism. But it wound up beating its far racier and hipper rivals, "Hair" and "Promises, Promises," for both the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle Awards for best musical. The current revival, impeccably mounted by the director Scott Ellis and featuring an assured, nicely balanced ensemble, makes it clear that its laurels weren't just nods to jingoistic values in a time of social upheaval. "1776," of course, plays on the shiny residual sentiments about the nation's beginnings instilled by old history books. But it does so with considerable ingenuity and in a way that actually finds dramatic suspense in a most familiar plot. It may be shameless, but it isn't stupid.
The show was the long-gestating offspring of Edwards, who was previously known as a writer of pop hits ("Johnny Get Angry," "See You in September") and who died in 1981. He was also a former schoolteacher. And "1776" does indeed seem to have been conceived by the sort of passionate introductory history professor whom young students tend to make fun of but secretly like: the fellow who sees long-ago events in the present tense and tries to convey his excitement through whatever means are required.
This probably accounts for both the central weaknesses and strengths of the work. "1776" definitely panders to its audience: it can be unconscionably cute and leering at the same time.
But in portraying the long, long assembly of the Second Continental Congress one spring and summer in Philadelphia, it also creates an immediate environment of sensory discomfort, personal (and often petty) conflict and overriding frustration. (It's the frustration, as in so many musicals, that keeps you hooked here.)
It is "hot as hell in Philadelphia," as one lyric (showing Edwards's irrepressible fondness for internal rhymes) puts it; the flies are legion; and when a bedraggled courier (Dashiell Eaves) stumbles in with another discouraging missive from one General G. Washington, the gentlemen of the assembly recoil from his stench.
Moreover, the show does a miraculously solid job of giving specific, discrete identities to each of the score of delegates at the Congress. (Yes, there were many more at the real thing, but economy, if nothing else, makes such license forgivable.) Actually, these characters (in many cases, drawn from figures who have become national archetypes) have far more individuality than those of Mr. Stone's current history-based musical hit, "Titanic."
Mr. Ellis's handsome production, with traditional but first-rate sets and costumes by Tony Walton and William Ivey Long, respectively, doesn't attempt to impose a contemporary, ironic gloss on the proceedings. The director and his ensemble, ably led by Brent Spiner as the agitating John Adams, do a fine job, though, in conveying the irksome thrust and parry, and the compromise and counterplotting, that have always made American legislatures move (or, just as often, not move).
With a couple of exceptions, the actors kindly avoid stepping over the line into buffoonish exaggeration. And there's enough troubled shading, in both plot and characterization, to remind us that great events are often shaped by mixed motives and less-than-noble emotions. As the wily old Benjamin Franklin (played in a dry, low key by Pat Hingle) points out, these are not demigods; they're ordinary men trying to get a job done. And the show's form is dictated by the twisting stratagems involved in accomplishing that job.
The music, from a man who had a pop tunesmith's knack for paying foxy homage to familiar melody lines (here including even "The Star-Spangled Banner") in songs that stick to the memory, has its irritating low points but more high ones than most people probably remember.
The trio in which Adams, Franklin and Thomas Jefferson (Paul Michael Valley) harmonize about the "hatching" of a new nation in a song called "The Egg" comes close to realizing your worst fears about what this show could be. So does a coy, double-entendre number called "He Plays the Violin," in which Jefferson's bride, Martha (the appealing Lauren Ward, making the best of a bad lot), brought in to relieve her husband's sexual frustration so he can write the Declaration, describes her husband's particular brand of foreplay.
But the score of "1776" also finds invigorating musical metaphors for the political process. The opening number, "Sit Down, John," an irascible call-and-response argument between Adams and his adversaries, is full of cantankerous life and is a terrific mood setter.
Even better is "Cool, Considerate Men," with exquisitely droll staging by Kathleen Marshall, in which the Congress's conservatives (led by an excellent Michael Cumpsty) find their political tempo in the measured rhythms of a minuet. And as Edward Rutledge of South Carolina, a fiery, charismatic Gregg Edelman turns the haunting "Molasses to Rum," a sinister account of slavery, into the show-stopping equivalent of senatorial grandstanding.
There is also the graver lyricism of the ballad of a dying soldier sung by Mr. Eaves's courier, a reminder that while Congress piddled, America burned. And Mr. Spiner (yes, the one who plays the android Data on "Star Trek: The Next Generation") and Linda Emond, as Abigail Adams, are charming in their sentimental epistolary duets.
It should be noted that large stretches, especially in the first act, have no songs at all, as the book focuses entirely on the clash of Congressional wills. But Mr. Stone, who has fine-tuned his book for this production, knows how to turn political debate into pleasurable, and remarkably lucid, spectator sport. At its best, the show suggests -- in its Classic Comics way -- what you want C-Span to be but all too seldom is.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
India, Mon Amour

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
When I was young in India . . .
Often, when I give myself time to think about my life the words pronounce themselves to me. Sometimes they startle me, the times I hear them when I thought I had been thinking about other things and other places. Until a few months ago I believed the words had to do only with the four years I spent as the New York Times correspondent in India, in the second half of the 1950's. 
 But in March, on one of many journeys back, I understood that what the words said to me was that I had felt young not just in the 50's but always since, whenever I returned to India. I realized that every return was like starting fresh -- the same excitement and zest, the same sense that not just a country but a whole world of infinite variety was spread out before me and that I had the delicious chance to learn about it, just by going forward to meet it.
All year, as India approached the 50th anniversary of its independence on Aug. 15, 1947, it has been getting unsparing analysis and criticism. I contributed a share.
But not today, and I hope never will I send her one of those black-bordered cards she's been getting for decades. They arrive with every birthday or crisis from Indians and foreigners. Americans and Indian professionals share a particular delight in kicking their country around.
By now you may have guessed I am seized by India. It could be said I love India, so I say it.
I love India for personal reasons. It gave me decades of discovery, learning and friendships -- and lots and lots of stories to write. All I had to do was go out and scoop them up; for reporters a golden land.
I love India because when almost all newly independent countries became Communist or Fascist, or militaristic tyrannies that the world prettified by calling authoritarian, and through all the decades when the West poured its treasure into dictatorships and its contempt into India, the Indians stuck with democracy. That is the most personal reason of all for a foreigner who knows he himself could not thrive, and might not live, without it.
Some birthday mourners say yes, India has elections but elections themselves do not a political democracy make. No, but they certainly do when they are as free and regular as India's and when India adds freedom of press, worship, courts, speech, assembly and politics -- and a usually vote-smart public.
In the 50 years since 1947 Indians created a single nation where none existed before, out of 500 princely states. They built it despite religions at war with each other for centuries, and the death of a million people in the war of partition. They fashioned a steadily industrializing state, which produced a huge middle class. Its scientists, doctors and computer wizards bolster not only India but America and other Western countries.
Indians have not solved the old evils that still threaten their future -- poverty, illiteracy, the birth rate, violence between Hindu castes and among Hindu, Muslim and Sikh. And newer evils are eating into the national marrow: epidemic corruption and business regulation that Indian politicians keep promising to end but don't.
However, consider the West's record in the 50 years before 1947:
Two world wars. One Holocaust. Fascism and Communism. Unknowable millions slaughtered by Germany. Policies that helped Japan defeat China and then helped the Communists take over China. Nuclear bombs, two used (thousands still available). World depressions. Famines in Western colonies -- like India.
And now for a few world highlights since 1947, during India's half-century of self-rule.
Corruption: Italy and Russia. Religious and communal warfare: Bosnia. Racial tensions: France and Germany. Appeasement of dictators: Western arms and technology to Iraq, Communist China, etc. Famines: Mao bringing death by starvation to unknowable millions. Disease: AIDS and tobacco-cancer. Drugs, crime and cynicism: see everywhere. Exception: the U.S., which knows no poverty, disease, corruption or racial tensions.
After examining the above two paragraphs could we please wait before sending more black-bordered cards on India's birthdays -- wait say 50 more years?

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rise 0.2% As Growth Stays Controlled

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Government statisticians produced an avalanche of fresh data on the economy today, but when analysts added things up, they found little to alter opinions: growth is solid, inflation is subdued and Federal Reserve policy makers will stand pat next Tuesday.
Consumer prices, the Labor Department found, climbed two-tenths of 1 percent in July, a touch higher than in the preceding four months, but still in line with expectations. 
 Industrial output, according to the Federal Reserve, also expanded by only two-tenths of 1 percent last month as automotive production, hurt by strikes, acted as a drag. The pace of increase slowed from June, reducing the risk that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities is overheating.
"We have an economy that's doing well, and there's virtually no inflation pressure," said Richard B. Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. He agreed with what has solidified into a near-unanimous view that the Fed will defer any increase in interest rates for at least six weeks, perhaps longer.
Still other figures today showed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits increased by 12,000 last week, a reading that suggested that the labor market, while perhaps moderating a bit, remains very tight. Because of required waiting periods in states that allow strikers to collect benefits, there was no impact from the 185,000 idled workers at U.P.S.
And the Commerce Department issued a report on June inventories that showed bigger buildup at the retail level than previously estimated, indicating the possibility of reduced production requirements in the future. Some analysts expressed concern about high inventories while others dismissed such fears.
The Consumer Price Index provided further reassurance that inflation remained well in check. On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that producers in July received less for finished goods for a record seventh straight month.
While the C.P.I., which includes services and goods, is not showing a total absence of inflation these days, it registered no increase in the cost of medical care, the first time this occurred since late 1975.
This category, accounting for 7 percent of the index, had long been a chief source of inflation pressure but has now moderated to a 2.7 percent increase during May, June and July.
But some analysts noted that while the price of products showed virtually no inflation -- prices were up one-tenth of 1 percent in July and 1.1 percent over the latest 12 months -- services were less well contained.
John Youngdahl, senior money market economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said this trend could eventually make the Fed uneasy. Services account for 57 percent of the Consumer Price Index.
"Goods pricing is getting more and more favorable and yet services are looking a little bit firmer," he said, pointing to six consecutive advances of three-tenths of 1 percent for services other than those involving energy. This meant an annual rate of 3.4 percent, well above the 2.8 percent rate posted for the six months through January.
Food prices rose moderately, the report showed, with sizable increases for eggs, beef and coffee partly offset by another decline for dairy products. Coffee is 23.5 percent more costly than in February.
In transportation, airline fares reversed course to jump 2.3 percent, and prices accelerated for new motor vehicles. But used cars fell 1.1 percent, and gasoline was lower for the fifth straight month.
The so-called core C.P.I., which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy, rose the same as the overall index, two-tenths of 1 percent, and is 2.4 percent above the July 1996 reading.
For the New York metropolitan area, consumer prices climbed three-tenths of 1 percent last month, more than in Philadelphia, Los Angeles or Chicago but less than San Francisco's four-tenths of 1 percent increase. Since July 1996, New York's inflation is 2.5 percent compared with 2.2 percent for the nation.
The Fed's production report showed that the industrial operating rate for July was down two-tenths of a point, to 83.1 percent, comfortably below the point, albeit indefinite, at which inflationary bottlenecks could be expected to develop.

HEADLINE: Job Boom in New York City Excludes City Residents

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In an unexpected twist that reflects the lopsided nature of economic expansion in the New York region, a robust spurt of job creation in New York City has apparently created a wealth of new opportunities, but not for people who live in the city, where unemployment has hit double digits. It is the suburbs that have benefited.
The apparent contradiction, described in a report to be issued today by Alan G. Hevesi, the New York City Comptroller, results from the type of jobs that are being created: mainly positions on Wall Street, at high-technology companies, and at firms that require advanced skills and education. 
 But the report said this newly created pool of jobs, about 21,900 during the first six months of the year, would have seemed a mirage for most city residents in search of work. Overall employment among city residents fell by 23,900 during the same period, and the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent, double the rate for the nation and a level not seen since the depth of the city's recession in 1991.
The main reason, according to Mr. Hevesi and several other experts, is that skilled suburbanites have been flocking to fill the new jobs in Manhattan, displacing lesser-skilled city residents and rapidly increasing ridership on commuter trains and buses. In contrast to 1996, when more than 25,000 city residents found new jobs in the suburbs, the regional employment pattern shifted to the opposite direction in the first half of 1997, with an increase of more than 45,000 suburban residents finding jobs in the city.
"In the context of an economic boom that is driving city revenues beyond our expectations, this is a serious item of bad news," Mr. Hevesi said in an interview.
Advisers to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani disagreed.
"It is simply a flawed analysis," Randy M. Mastro, New York City's Deputy Mayor for operations, said of the report, which derived its employment data mainly from the New York State Department of Labor. Mr. Mastro said that the data were in error for the first half of 1997, and that the report was even more misleading if it was regarded as a measure of the New York City economy during Mayor Giuliani's tenure. Since 1994, Mr. Mastro said, more than 150,000 jobs have been created, most for city residents.
But Ruth W. Messinger, the leading Democratic candidate for mayor, said the report was "further proof of what I've been saying: that 1 out of 10 New Yorkers is out of work because jobs are going to people who don't live in New York City."
"It may be good times for people who live across the Hudson River, but it's bad times for people in the five boroughs," Ms. Messinger said.
Among Mr. Hevesi's recommendations were that the city and state, while dedicating more money to education, also find ways to expand public transportation options for city residents to northern New Jersey, Westchester County, Nassau County and elsewhere where demand for workers is intense and unemployment rates are less than half that of New York City.
"Creative use of buses and trains during periods when they would otherwise sit idle, and discounts for reverse commutes, would help address this problem," Mr. Hevesi said.
But economists and business executives said yesterday that the mismatch between the location and skill level of new jobs in the region reflected longstanding demographic shifts that are simply being heightened this year, and that government policies cannot be expected to reverse.
"It is absolutely true that the labor market is tight in Fairfield County and we would endorse initiatives to make commutation more feasible in both directions," said Christopher Bruhl, the president of the Business Council of Southwestern Connecticut, where unemployment in such cities as Greenwich, Stamford and Norwalk is below 4 percent.
"But we are a very high-skilled labor market, and it would not be the right idea to provide people with public transportation so they can be told no, they don't qualify," he said.
The disjointed employment trends documented by Mr. Hevesi come amid a legacy of more than 25 years in which high-skilled, high-paying New York City jobs have been moving to the suburbs, starting with the relocation of large corporate headquarters from Manhattan during the 1970's. The shift of high-paid employment spawned a fresh migration of workers to homes in affluent suburban communities.
But during the 1990's, corporate layoffs have trimmed the payrolls of many of the same companies. And while smaller high-technology companies, publishers, investment houses and others have followed those companies to the suburbs, preventing a steep reversal for what had become suburban bastions of high salaries, high skill levels and high-cost living, the burst of job growth experienced in New York City this year has not been duplicated in the suburbs.
Mr. Hevesi said that the situation has prompted many of the suburban professionals, even those who had hoped to combine a suburban home with a suburban job, to commute into the city. In one indicator of the trend, he said, the number of residents of Westchester, Nassau and other counties who had jobs had grown far more rapidly in the first half of 1997 than the number of jobs that were available in those counties.
In another indicator, the report said that bridge and tunnel commuter traffic into Manhattan had increased sharply, with bus travel over the George Washington Bridge from New Jersey up 5 percent and auto traffic through the Holland Tunnel up 6.8 percent during the early months of this year.
James Hughes, an economist and urban planner at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said yesterday that the shift was in part a result of the aging of the generation born after World War II. Many of the baby boomers, now 30 to 50 years old, are committed to raising children in the suburbs, and will remain there even if a growing share of the region's jobs are in the city, he said.

HEADLINE: Dow, in an Up-and-Down Day, Ends Up

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market bounced around yesterday, seemingly directionless, despite a good inflation report and a decline in interest rates.
After the Government said that consumer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July, a sign that inflation is tame, the bond market rallied, but stocks languished. 
 Through much of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average moved up and down, largely in negative territory, until a sudden rash of buying at the close lifted the average a meager 13.71 points, to 7,942.03.
In the previous five sessions, the Dow had lost 4 percent of its value, dragged down by concerns about higher interest rates, a weakening dollar and the threat of inflation.
But two days of excellent reports on the inflation front have been unable to return the market to its exalted height of just a week ago, when the Dow was at a record 8,259.31.
Wall Street analysts attributed the weakness to the fact that the tremendous gains of the previous four months -- gains that saw the Dow rise about 29 percent -- were just too much, too fast.
"The market was overextended," said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential Securities. "I don't care what kind of inflation news you get. You can throw all the good news in the world at it, but it's got to rest."
What gains there were yesterday were modest. While oil stocks were weak yesterday, drug stocks rebounded from several days of sharp losses.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.75 points to close at 924.77 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 3.29, to 1,586.69.
Advancing issues beat decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the Big Board on volume of about 532.3 million shares.
Among Dow stocks, Procter & Gamble was the best performer, up 2 11/16 , to 144 7/16 , along with Hewlett-Packard, up 2, to 69 7/8. Of the Nasdaq issues, Micron Technology rose 2 1/4, to 44 7/8, one day after falling 7 1/2 points on worries about a profit slowdown.
A large portion of the trading volume in recent weeks has been program trading, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm based in Greenwich, Conn. And that may be contributing to the sharp price swings.
"There aren't a whole lot of people anxious to buy or sell," said Laszlo Birinyi, the president of Birinyi Associates. "And in that vacuum, the marginal investor has a much more significant impact on prices."
In other words, with fewer players, a program trade, or even a smaller trade, can more easily sway prices.
Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, believes that there is something more ominous at work in the market.
"The market's discounted the perfect scenario already," said Mr. Metz, who has long been bearish. "The inflation figures were great, but that's past history."
Indeed, Mr. Metz believes that most of the gains in the last few months were the result of "trend following" and the popularity of investing in mutual funds that track the major indexes.
But now, he said, many investors may be coming to the conclusion that profit margins cannot continue to rise, as they have been doing for some time.
One reason for such a concern, he said, was last Friday's warning from the Coca-Cola Company, which said that its earnings would slow in the third quarter of this year.
Mr. Metz said that the warning -- coming from a company that has seen steady, double-digit gains for some time now -- was a sign that corporate earnings growth was slowing.
Such concerns, he said, were one reason the market failed to respond yesterday to better-than-expected inflation news. Instead, investors are worried that they may have paid far too much for their stocks.
"It's just like a patient that doesn't respond to medicine," he said of the market's performance. "He's sicker than you think."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Joining Low- and High-Income Rentals at the Hip

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Seventy-two rental apartments for low-income tenants are going up in two projects on the North Shore of Staten Island. At the same time, a 22-story 246-unit luxury rental tower is under way on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The projects are linked by New York City's 421a tax certificate program.
Under this program, developers who build low-income housing receive tax abatements from the city that can be used for market-rate housing projects in Manhattan, underscoring the reliance of new construction on public benefits. 
 The program works like this: For each low-income unit that developers build, the city gives them five transferable property tax abatement certificates under which the tax rate rises over a 10-year period. Developers typically sell the certificates to a builder of market-rate housing between 14th and 96th Streets in Manhattan.
Projects in that area are not eligible for tax abatements unless they are tied to low-income housing usually built outside that zone or the low-income units are built as part of a new Manhattan development under the so-called 80-20 program, which uses tax-exempt-bond financing. In this program, 20 percent of the units are leased to low-income residents. Buildings financed with such bonds are eligible for a 20-year city tax abatement.
Of the 72 one- and two-bedroom low-income rentals being built on Staten Island, for which the developer received 360 tax certificates, 28 units, known as Harbor Manor, are on Harbor Road in the Mariners Harbor section. The remaining 44 units are at Nicholas Manor on Nicholas and Slaight Avenues in Port Richmond. The developer is Harbor Court Associates of Bulls Head on Staten Island.
The building at 230 East 86th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, will have studio to three-bedroom units. The Related Companies of Manhattan is the developer.
Both developers said that without the tax certificate program, they would not have proceeded.
Developers say there is renewed interest in the program, which began in 1984, as the city's housing market has improved and other government subsidies for low-income housing have dwindled.
The 360 tax certificates from the Staten Island projects were sold to Related, raising $3.6 million of the $7.8 million needed to build the low-income rentals, said R. Randy Lee, president of Harbor Court. The remaining $4.2 million was raised by Harbor Court's sale of Federal tax credits, bought by individuals or corporations for tax write-offs.
The Related Companies is using the tax certificates to keep real estate taxes low for 10 years on its Upper East Side tower.
Jeff T. Blau, a senior vice president at Related, said that even with today's higher rents, rental construction, given the combination of taxes and higher development costs in Manhattan, still is not economically possible without public benefits like abatements.
Related has four other rental projects, with 1,091 units recently completed or under way in the city. All are mixed-income projects that use the 80-20 method of tax-exempt financing.
The New York State Legislature recently authorized the State Housing Finance Agency to issue $350 million more in bonds under the 80-20 program, but most of that money has already been spoken for. "With resources limited, the tax certificate program is an alternative," said David J. Wine, president of Related's management arm, the Related Management Company. "Without it, rents would have to be 15 to 17 percent higher."
Mr. Wine said that over the 10-year life of the abatements, property taxes would be reduced by as much as 50 percent on the Upper East Side project.
But there are concerns about the program's viability because the city is getting fewer Federal credits, the other subsidy needed to create privately built affordable housing.
This year, the Pataki administration redirected many of the Federal credits elsewhere in the state, saying New York City had been getting about 70 percent of them for years. Though some credits have been restored to the city, it has lost the ability to construct thousands of affordable units, housing analysts said.
Some developers, including Related, say that with fewer low-income projects being built, fewer tax certificates will be sold, which could slow the pace of market-rate construction. At the Staten Island projects, designed to resemble town houses, the 650- to 1,100-square-foot apartments will be leased to tenants earning $19,000 to $29,000 a year based on family size. Monthly rents will be $390 to $520, plus utilities.
At 230 East 86th Street, rising on a site once occupied by a turn-of-the-century apartment row, the units will have 450 to 1,300 square feet. Rents are expected to start at $1,600 for the smallest unit and $3,000 for the larger ones, Mr. Wine said. The $75 million project will also have 40,000 square feet of retail space and such amenities as a health club and a sun terrace.

HEADLINE: Iran's Moderate President Faces Dissent Over Cabinet Choices

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Aug. 14

 BODY:
President Mohammed Khatami of Iran has had the briefest of political honeymoons -- and his differences with political opponents are now coming out in the open.
Analysts and diplomats said today that Mr. Khatami, a moderate Shiite Muslim cleric, was facing a stern challenge by conservative opponents over some of his choices for Cabinet ministers. 
 The 54-year-old President inherited an economy that was showing early signs of a possible slowdown and an electorate filled with high expectations of change, they added.
Conservatives and hard-liners, who had largely refrained from publicly criticizing Mr. Khatami since his election in May, have opened up with harsh attacks on his Cabinet selections ahead of a parliamentary debate on Tuesday.
"It is now certain that a noteworthy number of these nominees will not be able to get the Parliament's vote of confidence," the Teheran Times newspaper said today.
Some analysts said the 270-seat Parliament was expected to approve the majority of Mr. Khatami's 22-member Cabinet but vote against the proposed Culture Minister, Ataollah Mohajerani.
Mr. Mohajerani has been criticized by conservatives for his advocacy of greater cultural freedoms and his call in 1990 for direct talks with the United States.
"Introducing a person like Mohajerani, who seeks relations with America, is an insult to the Majlis," deputy Mehdi-Reza Darvishzadeh told the Resalat newspaper today.
The Culture Ministry plays a key role in domestic life in Iran since it has oversight over what books and films can be printed and the extent of media freedom.
Conservatives are also expected to question the nomination as Interior Minister of Abdollah Nouri, a cleric deputy who leads a pro-Khatami faction in Parliament, analysts said.
Mr. Khatami's choice of Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's representative to the United Nations, as Foreign Minister has also been attacked by hard-liners who question the revolutionary credentials of Mr. Kharrazi, who lived a long time in the United States.
Mr. Khatami was swept into power in national elections in May after winning wide support from Iranian youth, women and the middle class, who saw in him a leader able to inject social and economic freedoms into the stern Islamic state.
From his election victory to his swearing-in ceremony on Aug. 4, Mr. Khatami raised the possibility of changes in peoples' daily lives and that his administration could herald a change in Iran's foreign relations.
Mr. Khatami fought back against the attacks on his nominees with a televised nationwide address Wednesday night, saying that he was determined to press through his program, which was backed by a strong electoral mandate.
"I have a pact with the people to fulfill my plans," he said in his first major interview since taking office.
Mr. Khatami also used the address to call for the creation of an independent press and formal political parties, which have not been allowed by authorities since the years after the 1979 revolution.
Parliament is led by the speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, who was defeated by Mr. Khatami in the recent election.
Mr. Khatami said he would respect Parliament decisions and had a list of alternative names for Cabinet posts.
He also suggested that a woman would be in his Cabinet as a vice president, a position which does not need parliamentary approval.
Iran's economic health will also be of concern to Mr. Khatami as evidence emerges that Government revenues have fallen below budget forecasts and that prices continue to rise.
The President said that work would quickly begin on a new budget, which would be presented to the Parliament in November.

HEADLINE: 57 Towns Get $131 Million For Tourism On Erie Canal

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
The Federal Government will provide $131 million to 57 communities along the Erie Canal and connecting waterways in the most sweeping economic development initiative in upstate New York in decades, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Andrew M. Cuomo, announced yesterday.
The HUD loans and grants, coupled with $102 million in private funds and $57 million from local governments, will be used to build shops, housing, marinas, restaurants, recreational trails and other tourist attractions along the state's 524-mile canal system in an effort to revive the economies of towns that once relied on manufacturing. Officials said they expected the development to create 5,000 jobs. 
 "Once they move out of manufacturing, what do they do?" Mr. Cuomo said. "The answer for the nation has been tourism. San Antonio did it with the Riverwalk, Washington State did it with the Puget Sound and Baltimore did it with the Inner Harbor. Frankly, the Erie Canal has nicer geography and a richer history."
One of the most ambitious projects in the initiative involves a British boat company, Crown Blue Lines, which operates canal boats in Europe. The company hopes to draw European tourists to the Erie Canal. It plans to buy 26 European-style boats from Penn Yan Marine Manufacturing of Penn Yan, N.Y., a community in the Finger Lakes region. Its boats would ply the canal starting from Frankfort.
The mule-drawn barges of the Erie Canal, which extends from Buffalo to just north of Albany, opened the Midwest to commerce from the Northeast and the Atlantic Ocean 170 years ago. The canal waned as railroads were built and was eventually rendered obsolete by superhighways.
Yesterday in North Tonawanda and Rochester, Mr. Cuomo announced some of the 200 projects to be financed by the loans and grants. Today, as he announces more projects in central and eastern New York, he will be joined by the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, in Albany. He is expected to release the preliminary findings of a National Park Service study on making the Erie Canal a National Heritage Corridor.
HUD will provide $74.2 million in low-interest loans and $56.8 million in grants to the communities, which competed for the money by filing development proposals. The development is expected to rejuvenate the fading downtowns of upstate New York.
Perhaps no community did as well per capita as Holley, a village of 2,000 residents 20 miles west of Rochester. Holley was given $1.24 million in grants and $666,000 in low-interest loans. It plans to build shops, bed and breakfast inns, parks and restrooms along the banks of the canal.
"We're a good grant writer," said Holley's Mayor, Lewis R. Passarell. "We're trying to revitalize the whole area. We want to bring new businesses into Holley big time."
David Albanese, the Mayor of Albion, a village of 6,200 midway between Buffalo and Rochester, wants to erect a canal museum, restore an old building, renovate a waterfront park, build a gazebo, pave a parking lot, build a pump station and erect more tie-ups along the canal. Albion received $2.2 million in loans and grants. "We got a lot more than I expected," Mr. Albanese said. "This is hopefully going to be unbelievable. Everybody is enthused about it."
The Erie Canal initiative has received broad-based bipartisan support. The plan by Mr. Cuomo, the son of the former Democratic Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, was endorsed by Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican Senator who helped engineer Governor Cuomo's defeat, and by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

HEADLINE: A Golden Anniversary in Queens;
Indian and Pakistani Immigrants Honor 2 Homelands

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
Up a narrow flight of stairs in Jackson Heights, Queens, above the rich scents of curry and the high-pitched melodies of Indian pop divas that wash over the bustling sidewalk, two spare offices appear to house nothing more remarkable than a businessman and an accountant.
But the second-floor office of Kanu Chauhan, a concert promoter and developer from Bombay, is the headquarters for this weekend's 50th anniversary celebration of India's independence, while just upstairs, the office of Manny Beg, an accountant from Karachi, was the nerve center of Pakistan's 50th anniversary festival, held last Sunday. 
 Fifty years after Pakistan was carved from India at the moment of independence from the British Raj, this layering of celebratory efforts -- Mr. Chauhan, a Hindu who owns the building, rents to Mr. Beg, a Muslim -- is no anomaly in Jackson Heights. Thousands of immigrants from countries that have been enemies since 1947 live together peaceably in the commercial heart of New York City's South Asian population.
"It's not a perfect harmony," said Madhulika Khandelwal, acting director of the Asian-American Center at Queens College. "There are moments of misgiving, but what you see in everyday life in Queens is a lot of interaction among peoples from South Asia."
Indians and Pakistanis buy from each other. They work for each other. The belong to the same merchants' association. They share the same few blocks of commercial space along 74th Street. They idolize the same Indian movie stars and watch the same cricket matches. And, most importantly, they share a common story: they came to the United States in pursuit of a life better than what they left behind.
"Sometimes, people say money is the cause of evils," said Ramesh Navani, a part owner of the India Sari Shop and a Hindu with childhood memories of fleeing Pakistan for India 50 years ago in a noisy propeller plane. "But sometimes, money keeps you so busy you have no time to think of nasty things."
In the New York metropolitan area, a magnet for more Indian and Pakistani immigrants than any other urban region in the nation, nostalgia for home has blended with ethnic pride to produce a burst of independence celebrations that may be more festive than those on the subcontinent, where the daily drip of political venality and the ever-present tragedy of poverty have complicated the moment.
This past Sunday, the police estimated that 10,000 people gathered for the Pakistan Day festival in Battery Park to picnic on fragrant, spicy food, listen to singers from home and feast their eyes on Pakistani movie stars. This coming Sunday, the India Day Parade, billed as "unprecedented, spectacular, colossal," will sail down lower Madison Avenue, with the John Wayne of Indian movie stars, Amitabh Bachchan, in the lead as grand marshal.
But in the midst of the parades, banquets, concerts and conferences that are the public face of immigrant celebrations of independence, many of those who left home because they were dissatisfied with life on the subcontinent are in a mood that is more meditative than joyous.
Saeeda Qureshi, 43, who emigrated from Pakistan 21 years ago and has raised her children here, said she was glad to be Pakistani, but disgusted by the state of politics in her homeland. "I feel very good about independence," said Mrs. Qureshi, who lives on Staten Island. "But the politicians are very bad in Pakistan. There is too much corruption."
Indian immigrants, too, have complex feelings about their nation's progress. They say they take pride in being from the world's largest democracy, but abhor the corruption that has debased it. They take heart in the growth of the country's middle class and the loosening of state control over the economy, while mourning the high rates of illiteracy and poverty.
And some ponder the persistence of communal conflict between Hindus and Muslims. The Global Organization of People of Indian Origin, a nonprofit group based in New York, has invited experts to speak on that theme, among others, at a 50th anniversary conference on Aug. 30 at the New York Hilton and Towers.
The integration of Hindus and Muslims in neighborhood and civic life within India, which echoes in relations between Indian and Pakistani immigrants here, may well be the key to peace between them, said one of those experts, Ashutosh Varshney, an associate professor of government at Harvard University.
Professor Varshney has compared some of the most riot-prone cities in India, including Ahmadabad and Hyderabad, with the most tranquil, Lucknow and Calicut among them. He found that cities where Hindus and Muslims had everyday relationships at the neighborhood level and joined together in business, labor, professional and voluntary associations, were the most resistant to violent polarization.
And peace is actually far more prevalent than it appears, he said. His study found that from 1950 to 1995, 18 cities with only 8 percent of India's population accounted for two-thirds of the 7,300 riot-related deaths. "Peace does not make news," he said. "It's not good copy."
But coexistence, Queens style, is a visual feast. The daily pageantry of Jackson Heights, where women shop for brilliantly-hued saris ($29, $35 or $39 at India Sari Palace) and men thrust plump fresh chickens into tandoori ovens, is a show that runs free for the watching.
The first waves of immigration to New York from the subcontinent began after 1965, when United States immigration quotas that had favored Europeans were abandoned. Many Indians, who far outnumber Pakistanis here, came under rules that gave a preference to the highly skilled and educated. They, in turn, brought their wives and children, siblings and parents, in a chain of familial migration.
By 1990, United States Census figures show, the New York area had 199,010 Indian residents, about half of them living in the city, and 21,726 Pakistanis, two-thirds of whom lived in the city. From 1990 to 1994, 14,486 Indian immigrants and 7,465 Pakistani immigrants moved to the city, according to the City Planning Department.
Typically, Queens has been the newcomers' first home. But many immigrants, as they have become more prosperous, have scattered to New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester County.
And increasingly since the 1970's, Jackson Heights has become an ethnic marketplace for South Asian immigrants from all over the region. The everyday connections between Indians and Pakistanis here are everywhere evident.
The first Indian-owned store in the neighborhood, Sam and Raj, opened in 1973 to sell 220-volt appliances to immigrants for shipping home to relatives on the subcontinent, where that voltage is standard. The store hired a Pakistani salesman, Atif Hasan, in 1978. Mr. Hasan has since risen to be the store manager.
"They never made me feel I was hired because I'm Pakistani," Mr. Hasan said. And Nitin Vora, who is a part owner of the store, said Mr. Hasan was right. "We hired him because he's a nice person," Mr. Vora said.
Across 74th Street, at the New York Gold Company, Vasantrai M. Gandhi, 60, who emigrated 20 years ago from Bombay, was carefully weighing a ring, necklace and bracelet for sale to Raj Kanchwal, 37, who came from Karachi 12 years ago and runs his own health food store in Forest Hills. Mr. Kanchwal, hunting for gifts for his wife, found the shop in the Yellow Pages.
"I have a lot of friends who are Indian," said Mr. Kanchwal, whose parents were among the millions of Muslims who fled India for Pakistan in 1947, as millions of Hindus emigrated in the opposite direction. Mr. Gandhi, who advertises his gold store in the Pakistani ethnic press, piped in, "Here there is no difference except for politics."
Among the second generation, the remaining divisions may fade further. Ritika Chadha, a 26-year-old accounting student at the State University in Albany who emigrated from Delhi as a child, still cherishes her ethnic identity, but she is also influenced by American culture. She admires Mohandas K. Gandhi, the great Indian leader -- and tellingly, she gleaned some of her impressions of him from Ben Kingsley's depiction of Gandhi in the 1982 movie.
As she munched on french fries while window shopping along 74th Street one recent afternoon, she recounted her experiences from a January trip to Delhi. Her family had hoped she would find a husband while she was there. She was introduced to three or four young men, but none was quite right. "I was a little too picky," she said. "I wanted more of a choice."
Indeed, Ms. Chadha had a choice of her own in mind back in New York City: a Pakistani limousine driver. They are to be married this week, she said.
"My parents are really against it," she said. "I'm Hindu. He's Muslim. But if I married an American, they wouldn't like it either. I'm a rebel with a cause."

Positive News On Inflation Lifts Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury market took a big step yesterday toward regaining the momentum it had in July, as more economic data suggesting solid growth, but with little threat of inflation, eased investors' concern further.
Analysts said the reports were good news for bond market participants, who until favorable data were released in the last few days were pricing in what they saw as an increased risk of an interest rate increase by the Fed at next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. 
 The 30-year bond surged 31/32 , to a price of 97 25/32 , pushing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to 6.55 percent, from 6.62 percent on Wednesday; that was the lowest yield since 6.44 percent at the conclusion of the Treasury's quarterly refunding of the nation's debt last week.
Yesterday, the Labor Department reported that workers' average weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, fell in July from the previous month. Real average weekly earnings fell one-tenth of 1 percent, after rising a revised eight-tenths of 1 percent in June.
There were no surprises in the Labor Department's other report, which showed the Consumer Price Index up two-tenths of 1 percent in July, as expected. The index is the widest measure of prices consumers pay for goods and services. Other data released included weekly unemployment claims, which increased by 12,000, to 316,000, in the week ended last Saturday, while the Commerce Department said business inventories rose an unexpected seven-tenths of 1 percent in June, its sixth consecutive monthly gain. And industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July, a slower pace than in June.
Stuart G. Hoffman, senior vice president and chief economist for the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, said yesterday's numbers made it virtually certain that the central bank would not have to raise rates next week in an effort to head off price increases. "July gave us a clean sweep on inflation numbers, leaving us with the same picture we have been seeing right along: low inflation pressures and moderate growth, the perfect recipe to keep the Fed on hold."
Mr. Hoffman said he expected third-quarter economic growth to be between the 4.9 percent of the first quarter and the second's 2.2 percent.
But Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, a Canadian investment firm, said that despite the signs of a moderate rebound in growth, the July Consumer Price Index confirmed what the Producer Price Index for that month, reported on Wednesday, suggested. "While signs continue to mount that the economy is regaining speed, the strong growth is causing absolutely no damage to the stellar inflation performance," she said.
But while one big component of the index, energy prices, have been benign and actually sank by one-tenth of 1 percent in July, the Government noted in its report that this moderation might be over. Next month's report will probably disclose a big jump in gasoline costs, as pump prices are already up sharply in August, in contrast with typical seasonal declines during the month, the Government said.
Rates at yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills were a bit higher than in last month's sale, with the average rate at auction yesterday 5.28 percent, up 2 basis points from 5.26 percent on July 17 and the highest since 5.35 percent on June 19. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Analysts said the results were generally in line with expectations, with the bid-to-cover ratio, or the total number of bids compared with the total sale amount, at 4.33 to 1. Over the last 12 months, the average of the ratio has been around 3.98 to 1.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new one-year bill:

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Hints at Flexibility in Talks With Union

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Negotiators for the United Parcel Service and the teamsters' union resumed talks today with a Federal mediator as the company hinted at new flexibility in bargaining to end the 11-day-old walkout.
After the company insisted for days that it would not budge from its "last, best and final offer," James P. Kelly, the chairman of U.P.S., said today that it might be willing to change its offer if the talks made progress. 
 Mr. Kelly, calling today's talks "informal discussions," told reporters that "if those informal discussions lead us to believe that the negotiations could be concluded at some point in time, then the last, best and final offer would cease to exist."
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman persuaded U.P.S. and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to resume talks at a Washington hotel after talking repeatedly with each side on Wednesday, prodding them to show more flexibility and find a solution. Talks broke off last Saturday, and each side has spent much of this week denouncing the other.
"I urge them to stay at the table until they reach a settlement," Ms. Herman said.
Evidence is mounting that the strike by 185,000 drivers, sorters and loaders is squeezing companies and consumers around the nation.
The two potential deal-breakers in the talks, officials close to the negotiations said, are the teamsters' demand that the company convert 10,000 part-time positions to full-time jobs and the company's demand to start a U.P.S.-only pension plan and withdraw from the teamsters' multi-employer plans.
The union has proposed converting the 10,000 part-time positions into full-time ones over the next four years, while the company has proposed converting 800. On pensions, U.P.S. says retirement benefits would rise an average of 50 percent per worker in the proposed single-company plan, while the union calls that number exaggerated and says the withdrawal of U.P.S. would hurt the multi-employer plans.
In an another statement showing increased flexibility, Mr. Kelly said: "We think the pension issue is very important for both our people and the future of our company. But, as I said, there is no one or two single issues that will determine whether we're able to reach agreement."
Before the talks resumed, Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president, warned strikers and the public not to raise their expectations about a deal.
"While there is no reason for optimism at this point," Mr. Carey said, "we will be there, ready to negotiate a reasonable agreement that provides the good jobs that American families need."
On another U.P.S. labor front, the president of the union representing the company's 2,000 pilots announced today that they might walk out in December, the peak shopping and shipping season, because they were unhappy about not reaching a new contract with U.P.S. since the old one expired in December 1995.
A strike by the union, the Independent Pilots Association, could shut down the company even if a settlement with the teamsters is reached, because the teamsters have pledged to honor the pilots' picket line. The pilots' union is honoring the teamsters' current picket line, which began on Aug. 4.
"Unless there is a significant change in direction," said Robert Miller, the president of the pilots' union, "U.P.S. is facing back-to-back strikes."

 BODY:

With Growth and Prices In Control, Bonds Gain
Growth is solid, inflation is subdued and Federal Reserve policy makers will probably stand pat for now on interest rates -- at least, that was what analysts drew from the latest economic reports by the Government. 
 Consumer prices climbed by two-tenths of 1 percent in July, a touch higher than in the preceding four months, but still in line with expectations. Industrial production also rose by two-tenths of 1 percent, a slightly slower growth rate than in June. [Page D4.]
 
Helped by the economic data, the Treasury market took a big step toward regaining some lost momentum. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.55 percent from 6.62. [D15.]
 
But the stock market seemed directionless, with the Dow industrials ending 13.71 points higher at 7,942.03. [D8.]
 
Pepsico Board Approves Spinoff
Pepsico will get $4.5 billion in cash to pay down debt and buy back shares when its Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell restaurants are spun off into a new company, Tricon Global Restaurants. [D2.]
 
Kmart Earnings Down 9%
Kmart said quarterly earnings fell 9 percent because of slow sales and markdowns in women's apparel, but the results still beat expectations. Other retailers posted mixed results. [D2.]
 
Travelers Hires Pension Expert
Thomas W. Jones, a top executive at the world's largest pension system, T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F., will join the Travelers Group, where he will oversee efforts to expand the fee-based asset management business. [D8.]
 
Indonesia Yields to Currency Attack
Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, fell sharply against the dollar after the Indonesian central bank allowed it to float, joining other Southeast Asian nations in bowing to market forces. In Indonesia it was quoted at 2,830 to the dollar, about 6 percent weaker than before the decision was announced; later, in New York trading, it recovered somewhat, to 2,745. [D6.]
 
Thailand, hit hardest by the currency crisis, will get $1 billion in emergency credit from China, which is demonstrating a new connection with other Asian nations. [D15.]
 
Possible Softening in U.P.S. Stance
The United Parcel Service hinted at new flexibility in bargaining to end an 11-day-old strike as talks with the teamsters' union resumed. [A26.]
 
While the strike has hurt many small businesses, some catalogue companies have been able to get packages to customers with only a few days' delay, mostly by diverting their business to the Postal Service, which they had often tried to avoid in the past. [A26.]
 
For the fourth time in 23 years, a textile workers' union has failed in its effort to unionize North Carolina plants owned by Fieldcrest Cannon, which has come to symbolize Southern resistance to organized labor. [A26.]
 
Another Stock Fraud Settlement
GKN Securities of New York and 29 of its brokers agreed to pay $2.125 million to settle regulators' charges that they overcharged customers on stock trades. [D7.]
 
Kodak Plans Retail Push
Kodak, whose sales of film and its new Advantix system have been sluggish, is poised to plunk its name on 300 to 500 photo specialty stores across the country within the next 18 months, in an effort to strengthen its brand image among consumers. [D8.]
 
Hugo Boss and the Nazis
Hugo Boss, the clothier now known for classic men's suits and flashy ties, made uniforms for the Nazis, a spokeswoman acknowledged. The company founder's name appeared on a list of dormant bank accounts released by Swiss bankers. [D15.]
 
Guilty Plea in Honda Bribe Case
Rick Hendrick, one of the nation's biggest auto dealers and owner of a top stock car racing team, pleaded guilty to mail fraud in a case in which he was accused of making bribes to Honda executives. [D7.]

HEADLINE: Tobacco Chiefs Oppose a Plan For Big Penalty

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Tobacco industry executives expressed concern today at the White House about demands for stiffer penalties if they failed to meet targets for reductions in smoking by teen-agers under the proposed tobacco settlement. They said the $15 billion annual payments under the plan were all they could afford.
But the executives signaled that they were prepared to accept broad Food and Drug Administration authority over nicotine and other cigarette components in exchange for partial immunity from state and private lawsuits, participants said. 
 The meetings were part of a series of talks between Administration officials and industry representatives over the proposal to change the way cigarettes are made and marketed in America. Under the plan, major cigarette makers would pay $368 billion over 20 years to settle lawsuits filed by 39 states and Puerto Rico and two dozen class-actions suits.
The President is expected to announce his conclusions on the proposal early next month.
As part of the Administration review, officials of the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget assessed the impact of the deal on the companies' financial health.
They concluded that the cigarette makers would suffer little economic harm because they would pass on virtually all the costs of the settlement in the form of higher prices. Estimates of the price increases ranged from 60 cents to $1 a package, depending on how much consumption declined as a result of higher prices and on the profit margin.
The President and his advisers have already indicated that Mr. Clinton would not endorse the deal unless the F.D.A.'s power to regulate tobacco was strengthened and penalties for failing to live up to the agreement were stiffened.
Michael A. Moore, the Attorney General of Mississippi and one of the lead tobacco negotiators, said in an interview after today's White House sessions that the various participants were "close" on the question of F.D.A. jurisdiction.

HEADLINE: U.S. ACTS TO OPEN MINORITY PROGRAM TO WHITE BIDDERS

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today set in motion changes in one of its premier affirmative action programs that would make it easier for white-owned companies to qualify for Government contracts that have been reserved almost exclusively for minorities.
The planned changes in the Small Business Administration program, announced today, are part of the Administration's continuing effort to modify Federal affirmative action policies to comply with a 1995 Supreme Court ruling that restricted the use of race as a consideration in awarding Federal contracts. 
 Administration officials and others who follow the issue say the changes in regulations may mean that an additional 3,000 companies will become eligible to apply for contracts under the program. Most of them are likely to be owned by white women, a fact that distressed members of minorities who said today that they feared that the effect would be to give them a smaller share of Federal contracting dollars.
The program, known bureaucratically as 8(a), is the Federal Government's largest effort to use affirmative action in awarding Government contracts.
In the last fiscal year, 6,115 companies -- all but 27 of them owned by members of racial or ethnic minorities -- were awarded Federal contracts totaling $6.4 billion as a result of the program.
The changes in the program are expected to be put in place later this year after a period of public comment. Although significant in themselves, they are only the first step in a larger effort to revamp Federal contracting programs that are based on race.
This fall, the Administration intends to issue additional new guidelines for other contracting programs based on an industry-by-industry and region-by-region look at discrimination against minority companies.
Although the Administration's main purpose in devising the new rules was to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena, Administration officials say that by allowing more whites into the 8(a) program, they will increase the size of the political constituency supporting affirmative action at a time when such programs are under increasing attack.
Aida Alvarez, administrator of the small-business agency, said it was "fair to say" that the Administration "looked to strengthen the program by expanding the definition of who might be eligible."
A company can now enroll in the program if it meets several criteria: it must be small; its owner must have a personal net worth of less than $250,000; and its owner must be "socially disadvantaged," a designation the law automatically bestows on black and Hispanic people, Indians, Asians, Eskimos and Native Hawaiians.
Whites must prove they are socially disadvantaged by showing such things as a history of discrimination, or unfair denial of credit.
Under the changes planned by the business agency, however, whites can prove social disadvantage through a "preponderance of evidence," rather than the more stringent legal standard of "clear and convincing evidence."
Some students of the program say the main beneficiaries of the change will be white women who will be able to prove a history of discrimination much more easily than white men. "You still have to prove that you are socially disadvantaged," said Jeanie M. Barnett, executive editor of Minority Business Entrepreneur magazine. "I don't think this is going to allow an influx of white males into the program."
Others are not so sure.
"It's a big question mark," said an Administration official who has been involved in the review of Federal affirmative action efforts and who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It could mean that we find a lot of white women who make the claim they are socially disadvantaged and get in this program. But we could find a lot of people who are disabled, or who are white men in Appalachia. So as to what will happen, we don't have the foggiest idea."
Representatives of minority-owned businesses are concerned that whoever owns the newly eligible companies, fewer Federal dollars will be awarded to minority-owned companies through the program.
"My feeling is that although white, female-owned businesses historically have had disadvantages, it's very difficult to absorb them into that program without having a negative impact on minority businesses because the overall amount of resources has not been increased," said Sam Carradine, executive director of the National Association of Minority Contractors.
Administration officials say they hope to expand economic opportunities for small, disadvantaged businesses -- whether owned by minorities or whites -- even as they allow more whites into the program.
In one proposal for achieving that goal, the business agency is contemplating placing a ceiling of $100 million on the amount any participant in the program can receive in a Federal contract. Currently, there is no cap on the value of a contract an eligible company may be awarded. The agency is also considering allowing enrollees to bid jointly on Federal contracts, thereby increasing the number of companies that may be awarded contracts.
Ms. Alvarez said Administration officials were discussing the possibility of awarding more Federal contracts to small, disadvantaged businesses, including 8(a) contractors, increasing the percentage to 23 percent of all Federal procurement from the current 20 percent. In the last fiscal year, these companies accounted for $41.1 billion in contracts.
Businesses in the 8(a) program alone accounted for 3.2 percent of all Federal contracts in the last fiscal year.
But as the Administration expands eligibility for the program, some worry that it may increase the potential for fraud, especially the practice of husbands' setting up businesses in their wives names so they can qualify under the new looser standards for white-owned companies.
"The problem is going to be certification," Ms. Barnett said. "How are you going to keep fronts out?"

Israel Eases Blockade
Israel eased slightly the blockade it set up two weeks ago around the West Bank cities of Hebron and Ramallah, allowing Palestinians living in those areas to leave for the first time since a suicide bombing in Jerusalem. But Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat said the measures were inadequate and gave a speech in Ramallah saying Israel's continued refusal to let Palestinian workers into the country indicated that its government was not prepared to pursue the peace agreement.

70th Precinct Reorganized After Torture Allegations
Responding to allegations that police officers tortured a man in custody inside the station house of Brooklyn's 70th Precinct last weekend, Police Commissioner Howard Safir swept the precinct clean, reassigning its two top supervisors, suspending a desk sergeant, and placing nine other officers on desk duties. In announcing the shakeup, the commissioner and Mayor Giuliani also demanded that other officers at the Flatbush precinct set aside allegiance to colleagues and step forward with anything they know about the alleged brutalization of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, inside the station house's bathroom. One officer has been criminally charged, and his partner that night has been assigned to desk duty. A1
 
Mayor Giuliani's extremely severe move against the precinct made clear his acute awareness that taking credit for the Police Department's successes, like the city's huge drop in crime, also makes him the one held ultimately responsible for the department's failures. A1

Company Lured Back

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
City, state and port officials have agreed to provide tax breaks and cash incentives worth $6.3 million, or nearly $29,000 per worker, to lure Exco Noonan, a British foreign exchange company with 219 employees, back to Manhattan after a six-year stay in an office tower on the Jersey City waterfront.
Exco Noonan, which left New York in 1991, will return and consolidate with Exco RMJ, another division of Exco International P.L.C., on two floors at One World Trade Center, in a 15-year lease from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Exco Noonan will move from 10 Exchange Place in Jersey City; Exco RMJ will move its 241 employees from 199 Water Street. 
 City officials provided $3.9 million in real estate tax abatements. State officials added $2 million in grants. And the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey provided $400,000 in sales tax abatements, according to a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation.
As part of the deal, Exco Noonan, whose employees have an average salary of $125,000, agreed to add 80 jobs within five years. City and state officials justified the high price by saying the payroll and sales taxes the company would generate would pay for the incentives in less than a year. DAVID M. HALBFINGER

HEADLINE: Israel Opens Door a Crack; Arafat Says It's Not Enough

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 14

 BODY:
A day after the departure of an American special envoy, Israel took its first small steps today toward easing punishing measures against Palestinian areas, but Yasir Arafat called the moves inadequate and said the Israelis remained intent on wrecking the peace agreement.
The American envoy, Dennis Ross, left on Wednesday after four days of talks that, a senior American official said today, had persuaded both sides to take action toward resolving the current crisis. 
 But the tone of Mr. Arafat's remarks today indicated that Mr. Ross was less successful in diminishing the deep distrust of both sides, which remains the biggest obstacle to progress.
"We say: 'Is this Government really ready to work with us to preserve the peace process and protect it? Is it really ready to do so?' I am sorry to say the answer is no," Mr. Arafat said, referring to the Israeli Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a speech in Ramallah.
Among the steps Israel announced today was a slight easing of the blockade around two major West Bank cities, Hebron and Ramallah, allowing Palestinian residents there to leave for the first time in the two weeks since two suicide bombers killed 14 people in a Jerusalem produce market.
Mr. Arafat complained that the continued refusal by Israel to let tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from Gaza and the West Bank into Israel and to turn over money owed to the Palestinian Authority indicated that the Israeli Government was not prepared to pursue the peace agreement.
"They are allowing a few people to move from one home to the other, but they are not letting through cement, steel and vegetables," Mr. Arafat said in remarks to a delegation of Israeli-Arabs. "They are not permitting any economic life."
Press reports on both sides concentrated on predicting when Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright might arrive in the region. The Secretary announced last week that she would visit the region within the month in hopes of pressing for accelerated peace talks, if the Palestinians took action on security issues.
The American official said today that Mr. Ross had not succeeded in trying to re-establish the idea that the peace negotiations only really worked when they were treated as a partnership.
"As difficult as it is, both sides need to tone down the rhetoric, and I do mean both sides," the official said. "It may make good television, but it doesn't help the process."
Mr. Ross had also urged Israeli leaders to lift sanctions not directly related to security, arguing that measures like withholding money due the Palestinian Authority were counterproductive. Tax revenues collected by Israel continue accumulating, with at least $40 million owed to the Authority now frozen in a Tel Aviv bank account.
Israel continues to insist that it will not ease the most severe of its measures until the Palestinian Authority takes concrete steps to arrest those responsible for organizing suicide attacks.
"What we would like to see is action on the commitment to fight terrorists, and when we see action -- any action -- in this direction, we will modify and adjust the measures taken accordingly," Mr. Netanyahu said at a news conference in Jordan on Wednesday after talks with King Hussein. Today, Mr. Netanyahu started a four-day vacation.
Israel detained seven Palestinians in the West Bank overnight and its bulldozers tore down two Palestinian houses today that it said had been erected without permits, bringing the total of houses knocked down since the bombing to 18.
The closings around Bethlehem remained in effect, and Palestinians from the West Bank were not allowed into Jerusalem. Gaza is also sealed off.
The identity of those who carried out the market bombing still has not been solved. Today, Mr. Arafat again tried to distance the Palestinian Authority from any responsibility, indicating that Israel should be held responsible for the security of predominately Jewish areas.
"If they want me to be in charge of security in West Jerusalem, then I am ready to send my colonels," Mr. Arafat said today, grinning. Mr. Netanyahu has said repeatedly that the two bombers, even if they came from outside Israel, the West Bank or Gaza, must have had help from inside Palestinian-controlled areas.
But Palestinian officials have resisted any move toward a wide crackdown at a time when most Palestinian see the peace talks as stalled.
Under an arrangement worked out by Mr. Ross, the chief security officers from both sides are supposed to meet in the presence of the C.I.A. station chief in Tel Aviv, who is to act as referee.
United States officials have been reticent on exactly how the process would work or how the C.I.A. official would act as the final arbiter between the Israeli side, headed by Israel's secret service chief, and the Palestinians under their intelligence director.
The American official said that the security consultations would be kept confidential. But he said that the C.I.A. had already handed Palestinian authorities lists of suspects compiled by the Israelis and that it was dismayed that some suspects had been released by the Palestinians. He said the C.I.A. had not done any independent verification of the Israeli lists.
The official also said the issue of suspects was the kind that the Americans hoped the Israelis and Palestinians would be able to work out by themselves through consultations.
He added that the United States also hoped to see a greater Palestinian effort to root out arms caches as part of an overall effort to combat militant groups that had dropped off since the security arrangements for Hebron were reached last January.
But the American official noted that no matter what the American mediator ruled on whether the Palestinians were making a full effort to combat terrorism, the Israelis still controlled the bank account containing the money owed to the Palestinians and they would decide when to turn it over to them.

 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 21, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about American-brokered talks on the Middle East misstated an American official's comment about the United States Government's dealings with the Palestinians. The official said a list of terrorism suspects was handed to the Palestinian Authority by the United States Government, not specifically the Central Intelligence Agency. And the official said it was American officials, not specifically C.I.A. aides, who were dismayed that the Palestinians had released some of the suspects from detention.

HEADLINE: Montserrat's 'Settlers'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Aug. 11 news article on Montserrat's erupting volcano refers to "Irish colonists who settled in the 1600's." By the mid-1600's, most Irish exiles on that Caribbean island had been forcibly removed from Ireland by Oliver Cromwell, who designated Montserrat as a penal colony. 
 The harsh treatment of political and military prisoners, as well as orphans, widows and the unemployed who were deported, left a bitter legacy.
The nickname "Emerald Isle of the Caribbean" is due not so much to a faded colonial past but to a distinctive Irish flavor that still pervades Montserrat.
Many residents, most of whom are black, boast of their Irish ancestry. Also, the island still recognizes St. Patrick's Day as a public holiday.

HEADLINE: West Moves to Back Bosnian Serb Leader Against Hard-Liners

BYLINE: By MIKE O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The West's principal civilian authority here set the stage today for what some diplomats are portraying as the opening round of a decisive diplomatic showdown with the Bosnian Serb authorities.
The Western representative has decided to support a move by the Bosnian Serb President, Biljana Plavsic, to dismiss the legislature of the Serbian-controlled part of Bosnia and call new elections. 
 The Bosnian Serb Constitutional Court ruled today that Mrs. Plavsic's action was illegal. But the office of Carlos Westerdorp, who was appointed to oversee the civilian side of enforcement of the Dayton peace accords, announced tonight that it would overrule the court's decision.
Mrs. Plavsic is being enthusiastically courted by Western diplomats as the only Bosnian Serb in office who even marginally accepts key provisions of the accords, which ended the war in Bosnia. But she is confronting hard-core separatist politicians, who retain most of the power in the Serbian part of Bosnia and have successfully defied the West since the war began.
The West now seems to be supporting Mrs. Plavsic in what is likely to be a series of very difficult disputes with her opponents.
Her opponents could maintain the separate government they have now, ignore her dismissal of the legislature and, by refusing to cooperate with foreign election officials, make a new vote nearly impossible.
And even if the Western governments overcome those challenges, they will have strengthened Mrs. Plavsic, a person whose history seems just as nationalist and xenophobic as those of her opponents.
The legislative elections that she is seeking would take place in October after next month's municipal elections.
[In Washington, the Clinton Administration strongly criticized the Bosnian Serb court's ruling, saying the judges had come under political pressure from supporters of Radovan Karadzic, Mrs. Plavsic's predecessor and the person who still wields most of the power. "We are aware of specific acts of intimidation directed against court justices and their families and strongly condemn such outrageous attempts to flout the rule of law," the State Department's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said in a statement.
[The America reaction came as President Clinton met with his senior advisers to discuss policy toward Bosnia after the visit by his envoys, Richard C. Holbrooke and Robert S. Gelbard. Mr. Gelbard, the special coordinator for Bosnia, is to return to Bosnia on Sunday.]
A European diplomat put a slightly different twist on the day's events. "This is a very interesting position that we've gotten ourselves into," the diplomat said. "We have to support Madame Plavsic, because we have encouraged her to fight the forces who oppose the peace agreement. Once that is said, how do we make her opponents accept all of this, and how do we live with her if she turns out to be a bad investment?"
As American diplomats repeat when explaining their support for her, Mrs. Plavsic is the legally elected head of the Serbian-controlled portion of Bosnia. But it is not a real country -- representing only half of the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country that is held together by international pressure and 32,000 foreign soldiers.
In her offices in the town of Banja Luka, Mrs. Plavsic commands a staff of four, plus a few advisers.
At 9:42 one recent morning, the electronic calendar-clock over the door of her main staff office said Aug. 28, 10:31 P.M. A handful of guards sat dull-eyed around a table drinking beer.
Just across from the presidential building, the leaders of the political machines that Mrs. Plavsic hopes will organize voters in her favor spend much of their day under the shade trees at a sidewalk cafe. But they are the chiefs of small opposition parties, and their forces in the last election were geared toward defeating her.
"We're not supporting Plavsic," said Milorad Dodik, an opposition leader. "We just support her call for new elections because we think elections will give us more seats in the legislature."
Mrs. Plavsic emerged as a serious critic of the politicians who run the Serbian area earlier this summer when she began attacking them for corruption. Until then, she had been one of their inner circle.
She said Dr. Karadzic, who has been indicted on war-crimes charges and is still regarded by many as the person who controls the government, ran a criminal organization that was stealing much of the government's revenue. That theme struck home with many ordinary Serbs.
Then, in speeches that brought increasing support, she said the economy remained moribund because her opponents in the Government refused to fulfill the peace agreement, prompting the West to refuse to give reconstruction assistance.
"There is no budget in the Bosnian Serb Republic," she said in one speech. "The police are smuggling, the people are in misery and the country is isolated."
The effect of her campaign is obvious, if difficult to measure. Recently, at a secret meeting of a few local leaders in a Bosnian Serb town, the men said they had changed their opinions and now considered some politicians they had followed during the war as obstacles to recovery.
The people at the meeting included the owners of small retail businesses and the manager of the local factory. In the United States they would be leaders of a small-town community organization.
But the heavy pistols in shoulder holsters hiding under some of their jackets gave evidence that they were frightened of the people who run their corner of Bosnia and serious about challenging them.
"In America the people keep an eye on their government," said one man, who like everyone else insisted that neither he nor the town be identified. "Here the government is watching us." In other towns, where local authorities are considered less brutal, Mrs. Plavsic has led large rallies.
Like the President, many Bosnian Serbs want only part of the peace agreement enforced: just enough to start foreign aid flowing, but not so much that all those who were expelled from their homes return or that the quasi-sovereignty of the Serbian-controlled area be jeopardized to unify Bosnia.

Worst One-Day Selloff In 6 Years Wallops Stocks
Was the stock market simply due for a pause? Or were rising interest rates in the bond market and a falling dollar to blame? Whatever the reason, the market plummeted. The Dow plunged 247.37 points, or 3.1 percent, to 7,694.66, its worst setback in percentage terms since November 1991. 
 Few on Wall Street seemed deeply troubled, even though the plunge came during a week in which the market was treated to healthy news on the economy and inflation. And interest rates edged a little lower yesterday, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond falling to 6.54 percent. [Page 1.]
 
The real question as to whether the stock fall will turn into something significant, or just mimic the swoon this spring when the Dow quickly recovered after falling almost 10 percent in a month, depends on individual investors. News Analysis. [37.]
 
No Progress on U.P.S. Pact
The gap between the striking teamsters' union and the United Parcel Service was reported as no smaller, even after the two sides talked for a marathon 16 1/2 hours on Thursday and more than 10 hours yesterday. [9.]
 
Tactics of the political battlefield have made their way to the bargaining tables. Both union leaders and U.P.S. executives show the discipline of political candidates in adopting and staying on a single message. Armies of representatives make their cases on the television talk shows. And both sides have developed sophisticated campaigns aimed at turning opinion in Washington. [1.]
 
Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman has a big stake in the outcome of the U.P.S. strike. Her ability to nudge the two sides toward a solution without involving the Clinton Administration too much -- or too little -- could well set the tone for the rest of her tenure. [9.]
 
Upping Ante on Teen-Age Smoking
Despite industry opposition, the Administration will demand that cigarette companies pay stiffer fines than the tobacco settlement proposes if smoking by teen-agers does not drop. As it stands, the fines could not exceed $2 billion a year. But Bruce Reed, the chief domestic policy adviser, said, "We are going to strengthen the penalties." [1.]
 
Yamaichi Executive Slain in Tokyo
Koichiro Tarutani, 57, customer relations manager at Yamaichi Securities, was stabbed to death, and the police were investigating whether the killing was linked to a scandal involving payoffs to a racketeer. [37.]
 
Tainted Hamburger Alert Spreads
The Agriculture Department said more than 1.2 million pounds, up from 20,000 pounds, sold across the country might have been contaminated with E. coli bacteria. The hamburger patties were made on June 4, June 5 and June 9 at a plant in Columbus, Neb., owned by Hudson Foods of Rogers, Ark., and were sold under the Hudson brand name. [1.]
 
U.S. a Bigger No. 1 in Arms Sales
The United States has pulled further ahead as the world's biggest weapons merchant, an annual survey showed. Its share of the market increased to 35.5 percent last year, with $11.3 billion in orders. Britain was No. 2 with sales of $4.8 billion, or 15.1 percent. [3.]
 
Hong Kong Interest Rates Rise
Interest rates in Hong Kong surged to their highest levels since 1995 as traders bet that the speculative attack on Southeast Asian currencies might cause officials to allow the Hong Kong dollar to float. Currency turmoil continued elsewhere in the region, too. [34.]
 
Supplies Up, Copper Prices Fall
Copper futures prices tumbled on continuing signs that rising world production and slowing demand were increasing inventories. And on other markets, coffee prices slid. [34.]

Mutant Seaweed Afflicts Mediterranean Waters
The luxuriant but toxic meadows spawned by Caulerpa taxifolia have defeated navies and ravaged eco systems all across the Mediterranean. Scientists now hope a Caribbean snail can stop the relentless progress of the weed, accidentally brewed in a German zoo from an exotic Pacific species. 1 

 U.S. Arms Sales Increase
The United States increased its lead as the world's No. 1 weapons merchant, according to an annual arms survey published by the Congressional Research Service. The American share of the world's growing arms bazaar grew by nearly 23 percent last year, to $11.3 billion of the worldwide $31.8 billion market. Britain was second in sales; Russia sank to third as clients worried about reliable support services. 3
 
Yeltsin Blasts Privatizations
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia publicly criticized the way a major mining concern and a telecommunications behemoth were privatized. Mr. Yeltsin attributed the disputes prompted by the auctions, which were won by the same bank, to the favoritism displayed by the man who organized them; that man has resigned. 4
 
Adoption Deadlock Continues
A year-old baby who had been scheduled for adoption by an American couple died late last month in an orphanage in the Republic of Georgia. Witnesses said the infant, who was born with a damaged central nervous system, could have been saved with proper medical attention. Her adoption had been impeded by the moratorium on foreign adoption for which Nanuli Shevardnadze, the wife of Georgia's President, has fought. 4
 
Ruling on Bosnian Assembly
The Bosnian Serbs' Constitutional Court ruled that President Biljana Plavsic had no right to dismiss the national assembly on July 3 and call for new elections. Ms. Plavsic had accused the country's former war leaders, her former comrades, of corruption. The West's main civilian authority in Bosnia, however, said it would overrule the court's decision. 3
 
Turkish Editor Leaves Prison
Ocak Isik Yurtcu, a newspaper editor, was released from a provincial prison on a limited amnesty passed by Turkey's Parliament. He urged pressure on the Government to free the more than 70 other journalists who remain in prison. Mr. Yurtcu was imprisoned in 1994 for publishing articles about Kurdish insurgents.

DNA Tests in French Murder
A court has ruled that investigators into the murder of an English schoolgirl may test the DNA of all young men in Pleine-Fougeres, a village of 1,800 people in the west of France. The girl, Caroline Dickinson, was raped and killed while on a trip there in July 1996. Her parents had requested the tests, which will be voluntary. A man was convicted in Cardiff, Wales, for the murder of a 15-year-old girl after a mass DNA screening in December. (AP)

Officials Broaden Warning On Tainted Burger Patties
The Agriculture Department issued a far broader alert about tainted hamburger patties, warning that more than 1.2 million pounds of ground beef sold across the country may have been contaminated with deadly E. coli bacteria. The hamburgers were sold under the Hudson brand name. 1
 
Challenge to Tobacco Deal
A top White House official said in an interview that the Clinton Administration would demand that cigarette companies pay stiffer fines than the tobacco settlement proposes if smoking by teen-agers does not drop. The industry fiercely opposes additional sanctions. The official's remarks set the stage for a confrontation between industry and Clinton Adminstration officials, whose support is deemed vital if the $368 billion tobacco settlement is to become law. 1
 
Ruby Ridge Inquiry Closes
The Justice Department said it would not bring more criminal charges against senior F.B.I. officials in the 1992 siege at Ruby Ridge, where a Government sniper killed the wife of a white supremacist as she clutched their baby daughter inside a mountain cabin in Idaho. After a two-year investigation involving 378 witnesses, a Federal prosecutor concluded that the bureau's criminal conduct in the case began and ended with one man: E. Michael Kahoe, chief of the bureau's violent crimes and major offenders section. In December, Mr. Kahoe pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice. 6
 
Elvis Fans Gather in Memphis
The faithful, the fans and the imitators are gathering in Memphis to mark the 20th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death. More than 50,000 were expected at Graceland, his former home, for a candlelight vigil. 6
 
No Progress in U.P.S. Talks
Ronald Carey, the president of the teamsters' union, said there had been no progress in talks with the United Parcel Service. Mr. Carey also said the teamsters were stepping up cooperation with transportation unions in Europe to crimp or shut down U.P.S.'s operations on the other side of the Atlantic. The strike of 185,000 workers began Aug. 4. 9
 
Waiting for the President
President Clinton is due to arrive on Martha's Vineyard on Sunday for a three-week vacation. While each of his previous three visits had generated much hyperventilating about Presidential dinner parties -- who was hosting them, who was invited, who was not -- this visit has not had any "buzz," local residents said. 8
 
Anti-AIDS Gene Identified
Researchers studying specimens from 3,000 people have confirmed a genetic mutation that inhibits disease progression in people infected with the virus that causes that AIDS. Researchers said that by pinpointing how these altered genes fight H.I.V., it may be possible to develop treatments that help people delay the onset of AIDS. (AP)

2d Police Officer Charged
A second New York City police officer has been charged with brutally attacking a Haitian immigrant inside a Brooklyn station house last weekend, officials announced, adding that the essential information used against the officer was provided by one of his colleagues at the 70th Precinct. The immigrant, Abner Louima, who had been arrested in a scuffle outside a Flatbush Avenue nightclub, remains hospitalized with internal injuries. 1
 
Economics Closing Camps
Soaring operating costs and declining government aid are forcing many nonprofit sleepaway camps for low-income families to close. These camps were a quintessential New York rite of passage, part of growing up in the city by getting away from its crowded subways and tenements on the Lower East Side or the South Bronx. But between 1985 and 1996, more than a quarter of the state's nonprofit sleepaway camps were closed, from 435 to 321, according to a study conducted last year by the New York State Camp Directors Association. 23

Stocks Suffer Steep Fall
The stock market plummeted with the Dow Jones industrial average suffering its worst one-day selloff in nearly six years. The collapse accelerated a nasty, weeklong decline in prices which began just after the Dow had reached its most recent peak, leaving the stock market wobbly and investors uncertain. The Dow plunged 247.37 points, or 3.11 percent, to 7,694.66, its worst setback in percentage terms since November of 1991. 1

As Gaza Stagnates, Arafat Is Blamed as Well as Israel

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: GAZA, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Gaza, long resentful of Israel, is afflicted by a new discontent this summer.
Three years after a nominal peace with Israel made possible the rule of Yasir Arafat, most of the one million residents still search desperately for some sign that their lives are improving. 
 Instead they encounter the life styles of the rich and close to Arafat -- the new cars with red Palestinian Authority license plates that skim through Israeli checkpoints, the nightclubs along the Mediterranean where belly dancers gyrate long into the night, the garish villas erected by exiles back from Tunis on plots selling for more than $1 million.
The rest of Gaza stagnates. The refugee camps remain mired in squalor. Businessmen who anticipated a peace dividend are awash in empty apartments. Work is scarce. Detention by any one of nine Palestinian security agencies can come swiftly, and if the arresting officer is powerful enough, the courts can do little to prevent beatings or extended jail time without charges.
The result is a new mood that damns Israel and Arafat in almost equal measure. While the special American envoy, Dennis Ross, and Israel demand that Mr. Arafat do more than ever to uproot any violent dissidents ready to wreak havoc with peace talks, the Palestinian leader's reputation among his own people in Gaza has only fallen since his return.
In the Jabaliya refugee camp, Mahar Abdullah and Shaaban Mustapha spend countless hours idling in plastic chairs on their rough cement porch, which overlooks two overflowing trash dumpsters and an open sewage trench. About 150 yards in front of them stands a military post built for Israeli troops that now houses the Palestinian police. A question about what else has changed prompts a bitter joke: "Before the peace we only had one garbage container in front of the house, but now, thanks be to God, we have two," said Mr. Mustapha, 29.
The two men reminisce briefly about the stone fights against Israeli troops they fought for six years, and about the night in July 1994 when they danced in the unpaved street to celebrate Mr. Arafat's return.
"Arafat promised us when he came that he would transform this place into Singapore," said Mr. Abdullah, 31. "What he forgot to tell us was that he meant the Singapore of 500 years ago."
 
Economics
The First Thing Gaza Wants Is Jobs
Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Mustapha, like so many here, know that the peace talks have been in full crisis since July 30, when two bombers blew themselves up in a Jerusalem market, killing 14 others. They do not care much. They and other Gazans like them feel that they have gained nothing, and thus have nothing to lose. They want first jobs, then freedom of movement, then their own state and eventually democracy.
Gazans are socially more conservative than the 1.2 million Palestinians on the West Bank and certainly more so than the Palestinian revolutionaries who, with Mr. Arafat, spent years of exile in Beirut and Tunis. So they are generally shocked by what they see as the wanton ways of the returnees. Gazans have a derisive name for them: "the Tunisians."
"The feeling is that 'If you can't deliver on the peace process, why are you here?' " said Ali B. Jerbawi, a political science professor and director of the Independent Commission for Citizens Rights.
The returnees say the talk of a gap between the new government and the Gaza residents is overblown, although they concede that the allegations of corruption will have to be addressed. "We did not come from heaven, nor did we come to heaven," said Ahmad Abdel-Rahman, an Arafat aide for some two decades and now the Cabinet secretary. "We know there are people in the Authority who do not belong."
There is no doubt among Palestinians that the Israeli Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the larger problem for them. All those peace agreements trumpeted on the White House lawn only seem to have left Israel with a greater choke hold than ever over the gateways of Gaza -- gateways to trade with the outside world, and especially to Israel itself, a key source of private employment.
Palestinians are dismayed that so many aspects of their daily lives, including their food, their work and their travel, remain largely dependent on Israeli permits. Israelis fault repeated bloodshed by Islamic militants. In the wake of those attacks Israel's Government has drastically restricted the movements of both Palestinians and their goods.
The working poor often say they are the ones punished for the inability of leaders on both sides to coordinate police work. In 1996, Gaza was sealed in for 82 out of 277 working days -- 3 days out of every 10.
It does not help that the few jobs at home are open largely to those who know the right people. Supporters of Al Fatah, the largest party in the Palestine Liberation Organization, are privileged. Many Gazans say it takes a letter from Fatah headquarters verifying that a person is a member in good standing to get any government job. So far, 78,000 people are on the Authority payroll, according to United Nations statistics, including about 35,500 with the security services. Gazans point out ruefully that the official numbers do not include hundreds of paid informers.
Ordinary people like Gaza's 2,800 fishermen, who have been repeatedly blockaded by the Israeli Navy during closings, often say they feel that the agreement has served basically to shrink their horizons. When they first complained to the Authority, they were told that the final agreements would take only a year or two to negotiate and then the entire sea would be open, instead of just 20 miles along the Gaza Strip.
Rajab al-Hissi, 71, the dean of Gaza's fishermen, said of the negotiators: "They know nothing about our problems, and now we have no place to fish. Things are getting worse and worse."
In 1992, the year before the peace treaty, United Nations reports put per capita income at $1,713. Salem Ajluni, head of the United Nations monitoring unit, now puts it at roughly $1,300. While income fell, prices edged upward, a development traceable in part to the Palestinian Authority's monopoly on everything from cement to fuel to most staple goods. Overall unemployment is 28 percent, with 10 percent more no longer looking for work.
 
Leadership
Arafat's Standing Is in Trouble
Although he long ago eliminated any serious rivals for individual leadership of the P.L.O., Mr. Arafat cannot rule with the same ruthlessness as a Saddam Hussein or a Hafez al-Assad. Under occupation, and especially in the 1980's, Palestinians grew accustomed to taking to the streets to protest even if it meant facing arrest or bullets.
So public outcry can sometimes force his hand. In April, when his security forces arrested the leaders of a teachers' strike, for instance, the clamor quickly got them released.
And his is not the only Palestinian movement. Today there is a known alternative in Hamas, the Islamic movement with a network of social programs and fund-raising, alongside violent underground cells opposing Mr. Arafat's peace with Israel.
Many downtrodden Gazans depend on Hamas charity to feed their children -- a consideration for Mr. Arafat if he were to crack down hard against the movement's militant cells, as Israel demands.
Even without a direct confrontation with Hamas, though, Mr. Arafat's political standing is in trouble here. The aura of corruption around the entire peace enterprise has some local Palestinians suggesting openly that it might be better if Mr. Arafat left, taking with him the 10,000 exiles he brought home.
Criticism that once would have been considered astonishing is fairly common, even if people speaking out before strangers are reluctant to give their complete names. "Arafat should go live in France," said Abu Hassan, the owner of a small Gaza grocery. "He's too old. He should rest, retire."
The affectionate nickname Abu Ammar has been replaced by something more caustic -- Abu Khafiya, the father of the headdress.
 
Business
'Carpetbaggers' And Corruption
The dejection is not limited to the poor. Two months after Mr. Arafat came back, Hamad al-Sakka, a Gaza businessman, started building Mecca Tower, a 20-story edifice with 80 apartments, on the promise that many Palestinians would want to return to settle. He has sold 15 apartments. "Nobody is buying anything because there is no hope," he said.
With their living standards eroding, Gazans sharply resent the fact that the Palestinian Authority has been muscling into all kinds of business on top of its import monopolies.
Its most visible presence is Al Bahar Company, run by Hashem Abu Nada, a key financial adviser to Mr. Arafat. Its interests include a hotel, an advertising agency and real estate. Its centerpiece project is Zahra al Madain, or Flower of the Cities, a beach resort of chalet bungalows on the coast. It had been announced that the place would be awarded to the highest bidder, but no price was disclosed when Al Bahar moved in. This kind of murky dealing, combined with a Palestinian Authority audit released in May reporting that $326 million had been misspent, has left many Palestinians thinking that they are besieged by carpetbaggers.
An investigation by the Palestinian Legislative Council found that much of the suspected abuse was a matter of dubious accounting principles rather than outright misappropriation. Still, the Council demanded that ministers explain a catalogue of abuses. Although there have been allegations that officials have sought kickbacks for contracts, foreign diplomats bend over backward to stress that the $1.3 billion in aid disbursed so far was largely earmarked for specific projects and that no government has reported any abuse.
Businessmen and diplomats say private sector investment has not followed the foreign aid, largely because of the problems of operating in an unstable political environment where it is never clear when a business will be able to import raw materials or export finished goods. On top of that, they say, the Authority's financial mismanagement has served to deepen the qualms of the private sector and to prompt foreign donors to review their pledges for a total $2.5 billion in aid.
Mr. Arafat has not addressed the corruption issue himself. But he sent a top aide, Tayyib Abdel-Rahim, to speak in his name at the Legislative Council in May to promise a larger inquiry. "The Palestinian Authority will not keep silent on any violation and will work on ending any form of corruption," Mr. Abdel-Rahim said.
Some Palestinians say the fledgling government should be given credit for at least recognizing a problem ignored in most Arab states.
"The laws controlling investment and business and what is legal or illegal are nonexistent," said Jihad al-Wazir, the son of a P.L.O. founder, Khalil al-Wazir, who was killed by assassins thought to have been sent by Israel. Mr. Wazir, 34, left his life in a Rochester suburb to open an office in Gaza to encourage investment. "You have to take into account that we are not the U.S. Congress with a 200-year tradition of oversight and checks and balances," he said.
While the initial reports of financial mismanagement have been jarring, it is the clash of cultures that markedly alienates many residents. During Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip, flouting Islamic moral rules was as rare as was flaunting wealth. Now a string of nightclubs offer belly dancing and Maccabee beer, an Israeli brand. The cost of two beers amounts to about a day's wages for a Gazan laborer.
Some relish the new freedom, despite thundering condemnations by Hamas leaders. "If you want to pray, you can go pray in the mosques," said a longtime Gaza resident in the Scheherezade nightclub. "You have to change with the times."
 
Policing
Professor Arrested For Work in Class
One change of the times has made Gazans suddenly more fearful, more hesitant to talk in public. They were ecstatic to get Israeli troops off their streets, but dismayed to find that the Palestinian troops who moved into the same barracks are eager to throw people in jail for even perceived slights against the Authority.
The police are supposed to report arrests to the attorney general's office within 48 hours, but the rule is often ignored. "Any system will not stop these people," said Fayez Abu Rahma, the attorney general appointed on July 18 after his predecessor resigned amid bribery allegations. "If I give orders, they will not follow orders."
Mr. Abu Rahma said that when he took over, he inherited 180 prisoners suspected of being Hamas members. "The fact that someone is a member of Hamas is not enough of a reason to jail them for this long," he said. He let 44 go and plans more releases.
But while the Authority may have avoided jailing militants on lists handed over by Israel, Gazans resent the ease with which others have been confined on charges that amount to criticizing the Palestinian Authority.
Take the case of Fateh Sobeh, a professor in Al Azhar's University's education department, who told 300 students sitting for their finals on June 21 to write nine short essays about the interplay between social and educational problems. Mixed in with questions about things like the influence of television, the professor asked his students to catalogue the effect of corruption in either the university administration or the Palestinian Authority.
He was arrested on July 2, and his family got to visit him only this week. He has yet to be formally charged with anything, and although 14 soldiers raided his house to seize the exam books, the branch of the security services that grabbed him hints darkly that he will be accused of spying for Israel and sexually harassing his students.
"They should release him because they have nothing on him," his wife, Fatima, said, enumerating his repeated arrests by the Israeli authorities during the occupation.
The case appears to be something of an embarrassment to the Authority. Mr. Abu Rahma had the professor's case file on his desk and said the charges were as yet incomplete. "It is very strange to have such a charge against a professor," he said. "I have never seen such a thing."
The professor's wife mused that she and her husband support the idea of peace, that they want to serve their country, but that it is proving difficult with the influx of outsiders as their leaders. "They think they are Westerners and advanced, better than us, that our minds are still influenced by religion," she said. "They look down on us."
Thus the basic problem edging Gazans toward despair: They feel hemmed in, neither free of Israel nor living under the kind of Palestinian government they envisioned.
"Palestinians might accept a little corruption if they felt the peace process was getting somewhere," said Mr. Jerbawi, the professor. "Or they might accept so little movement with the peace if the government was clean. But now Arafat doesn't have the cover he needs to crack down on anybody. He can't stand up and say he needs to do it or the peace process will derail. Everybody thinks it has already derailed."

THE LAST DIVISION
 A History of Berlin, 1945-1989.
 By Ann Tusa.

 DISSOLUTION
 The Crisis of Communism
 and the End of East Germany.
 By Charles S. Maier.

 Princeton University Press. $29.95. 
 The postwar era began and ended in Germany. From the summer of 1945, when the participants in the Potsdam conference failed to agree about Germany's future, until the summer of 1990, when the Soviet Union accepted the newly unified Germany's membership in NATO, the German question was at the center of the era's most important conflicts.
In "The Last Division," Ann Tusa, the author (with John Tusa) of books about the Nuremberg trials and the Berlin airlift, examines some of the most dangerous moments in the history of East-West confrontations over Germany. The subtitle of her book is doubly misleading: it is neither "a history of Berlin" nor does it cover the entire period from 1945 to 1989. Instead, Tusa traces Berlin's role in international affairs, with particular emphasis on the period between Nikita Khrushchev's threat in 1958 to seek a separate settlement with East Germany and the construction of the Berlin wall in August 1961.
Although Tusa does not provide much new information, she tells this exciting story well. With a good eye for striking quotations and significant details, she sketches vivid portraits of her characters: Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany and President Charles de Gaulle of France, old enemies drawn together by their shared distrust of Britain and the United States; Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, frightened by the dangers of war and excessively eager for negotiations; President John F. Kennedy, at first overwhelmed by the responsibilities thrust upon him but gradually gaining self-confidence and a sense of direction. Whenever Khrushchev is on stage, he steals the show: crude, cunning, shifting unpredictably from conciliatory charm to abusive threats, he managed to maintain the political initiative from his ultimatum in 1958 until the debacle over the Cuban missiles four years later.
Throughout her book, Tusa is harshly critical of the "ineffectual and timorous behavior of the Western Powers." But while she can easily demonstrate the occasional ineffectiveness of Western policy toward Berlin, she does not succeed in showing what might have been done differently. The fate of Berlin, after all, was determined by the West's decision not to go to war to drive the Soviets out of Eastern Europe. Western strategy was essentially defensive; it was, in George Kennan's famous phrase, a strategy of containment. This meant that the Western allies might have been prepared to fight to maintain their hold on their sectors of Berlin, but not to prevent the Soviets from doing what they wanted in the East. The construction of the wall was the unavoidable outcome of allied acquiescence in Europe's division.
Charles S. Maier's "Dissolution" suggests that in the long run the Western powers' patience (which is so easy to mistake for timidity) paid off. Maier, the Krupp Foundation Professor of European Studies at Harvard, has written a historical synthesis of the economic crisis, popular unrest and diplomatic negotiations that disrupted and then destroyed East Germany and with staggering speed opened the way for its unification with the Federal Republic.
A major goal of his book, Maier writes, is to defend the importance of human agency by showing how "the East Germans, when they came to act collectively, had a decisive impact on their own history." Maier eloquently describes the Leipzig demonstrations throughout the fall of 1989, when ordinary men and women took to the streets to demand greater freedom, and the huge East Berlin rally in November, when some of the regime's most prominent intellectuals called for fundamental reform.
But did these expressions of popular discontent really bring about the end of East Germany? As Maier's own account clearly shows, collective action may have helped to precipitate the final crisis, but its causes and outcome were determined by developments over which neither the demonstrators nor their Government had much control: the steady decline in ideological commitment, even among some of the elite; the deterioration of the economy; and finally, the upheavals in European Communism that followed Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to reform the Soviet Union.
Of these three changes, the collapse of the Communist bloc seems by far the most significant. The East German crisis began, not with the Leipzig demonstrations in the fall, but rather in the summer, when Hungary's Communist Government decided to allow East German refugees to cross its borders to the West. Once this door was opened, East Germany lost the capacity to save itself with either repression or stringent economic reforms, remedies that would have increased even more the westward flight of its citizens. As a leading Soviet expert on Germany correctly remarked, "The death sentence of the G.D.R. was signed in the moment when it was decided to open the border."
"Dissolution" is the best available one-volume account of East Germany's decline and fall. Maier recounts the complex and exciting events of 1989-90 clearly and concisely. He has mastered the growing literature on the subject, interviewed several of the most prominent participants and looked at some of the newly available archival material. Equally important, he puts these events into a rich historical context by comparing them with episodes in the German past (especially the revolutions of 1848 and 1918-19), with developments in the rest of Eastern Europe and even with trends in the capitalist West. The last of these comparisons is the most original and potentially the most important, since it points us toward a post-postwar history in which a now undivided Europe can begin to confront its common past.
Both Tusa and Maier end their books with cautious optimism about the future of Germany and Europe. They are right to do so. There is little reason to mourn the passing of East Germany. And there is every reason to celebrate the removal of the lethal military power that once was concentrated along the German-German frontier. Compared to the era that ended in 1989, the future, while not without challenges and dangers, is filled with promise and possibility.

FOUR DECADES
New and Selected Stories.
By Gordon Weaver.
University of Missouri, paper, $18.95. 
 Gordon Weaver's terrain is Middle America, and his protagonist is usually an unhappy middle-aged man. For many of these characters that unhappiness stems from the brutal contrast between what adolescence seemed to promise and the bitter realities that ensued in adulthood. Alcohol is a universal solvent in Weaver's stories, destroying marriages and careers with stupefying efficiency. Its major victim is memory, as characters are left wondering not only where the past has gone but whether it occurred at all. Thus in "Return of the Boyceville Flash," a bum named Teddy Pafko pleads with an old friend: "Could you possibly tell me anything about who I was, what sort of person I was, Jimmy?" In "Madness," two teen-age friends are estranged when one goes incurably insane; as the other desperately attempts to re-establish the old bonds, certain symmetries in the narrative suggest that the two characters are essentially one -- that a single disastrous life is being viewed from different perspectives. Playing a variation on this theme, the narrator in "Getting Serious" has an inexplicable need to keep in contact with Guy Roland, a hometown acquaintance who was thought to be a World War II hero but later proved a fraud. The narrator's domestic life, described as an idyll, crumbles to nothing, but the failure goes almost unnoticed. All that matters to him is to be with Guy, now an unemployed alcoholic but still strangely, fatefully attractive: "His blue eyes were still bright, like the eyes of a child after weeping."

HEADLINE: The Heat Is Outside the Kitchen

BYLINE: By David Blum; David Blum is a writer based in New York. His last article for the Magazine was "Julia Ormond's Trip Through the Star Factory" in April 1995.

 BODY:

It is a few minutes away from sunrise on a Friday morning in early June. David Gregoire Bouley has been eating almost steadily since 11:30 P.M., when he sat down with eight others to a 12-course dinner in Chinatown at New York Noodle Town. That feast ended at around 1:30, shortly after Warner LeRoy, the 62-year-old owner of Tavern on the Green and Bouley's business partner, left for home. A walk through deserted lower Manhattan was followed by an hourlong stop for a drink at Cafe Fledermaus in the South Street Seaport. The group then proceeded to the Fulton Fish Market.
The visit to the market is the ostensible reason for this night on the town, a week after Bouley's 44th birthday. He used to show up there regularly before he closed his four-star French restaurant, Bouley, in June 1996. Tonight is his way of announcing to the fish purveyors that David Bouley (pronounced boo-LAY) is coming back. After 90 minutes of interaction with men in rain boots -- all of whom seemed thrilled to learn that their old customer Dave had his wallet out again -- Bouley and his entourage (which included two sous-chefs, one waiter, his director of operations and a French architect) marched back to Fledermaus. Bouley had originally intended to phone his friend Jean-Georges Vongerichten to congratulate him on the four-star review he has received in that morning's New York Times, but it is now too late to call. Walter Krajnc, the Austrian owner, has prepared platters of goulash, sides of salad, baskets of sliced baguettes and three different desserts, and has replaced the rock CD on the sound system with Johann Strauss' "Blue Danube" waltz. 
 The music suits Bouley's people, who in a few months plan to open their own Austrian restaurant, Danube, at the corner of Duane and Hudson Streets. When that day comes, Krajnc will leave Fledermaus to become the maitre d' at Danube. The executive chef will be Kurt Gutenbrunner, an Austrian chef who stood at Bouley's side cooking fish for five years in the famously intense TriBeCa kitchens and who now sits at Bouley's side eating goulash.
"This is great," Bouley says as he digs in with a fork, displaying a hardiness that belies the hour. In less than a week, he will open Bouley Bakery at 120 West Broadway, his first public venture since Restaurant Bouley closed its 18th-century French wooden doors. Its opening will mark the first step of Bouley's two-year, $16 million plan to transform himself from a mere restaurateur into a full-fledged retail entrepreneur and food mogul. In doing so, he hopes that the Bouley name will soon signify a top-quality food product available everywhere. Though the Connecticut-born Bouley has worked in the relative seclusion of a restaurant kitchen for more than 25 years, he now wants to be as famous as those who once dined regularly on his wonderfully simple food. He boasts to me of the time Michael Jordan came to his Duane Street kitchen with a request to collaborate on a health-food restaurant in Chicago; but he prefers not to share the marquee space on his planned establishments.
Bouley claims confidently that Danube will open by December. The schedule next calls for the summer 1998 opening of an 18,000-square-foot retail store called Bouley at Home. Soon after that, he says, the headquarters of Bouley International will open in the Mohawk Building, at the corner of Duane and Hudson Streets. The plan is for this building and the one adjoining it to be an extravagant temple of devotion to haute cuisine, housing a 110-seat International Cafe, an intimate, 75-seat version of Restaurant Bouley, two private dining rooms, a cooking school and a research institute with a test kitchen, laboratory and food library. Bouley says that he expects all of these ventures (each within two blocks of his original restaurant) to be finished before the end of 1998.
But at 5:15 on this June morning -- almost two years since the announcement of his partnership with Warner LeRoy and more than a year since I began talking with Bouley about his plans -- his comeback has yet to materialize. The Mohawk Building continues to be nothing more than a stack of blueprints in a dingy storefront office. Bouley at Home remains a raw space. Danube still looks like a boarded-up sandwich shop. Even the Bakery, which is supposed to be the site of a big opening-night party only four days from now, looks as if it needs at least another month of work. The windows haven't been installed; the chairs haven't come; the lights aren't fixed; the bathroom is a mess.
The food revolution that is now under way in America first surfaced 26 years ago in the kitchen of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., when Alice Waters began moving the boundaries of taste by using fresh herbs and natural flavors instead of butter and cream. It continued with the advent of American nouvelle cuisine in the 1970's. That approach to French cooking eliminated rich sauces, shrank portions and emphasized new flavors that were designed to astonish the taste buds rather than soothe them.
In the 1980's, a dynamic new group of chefs in their 30's came forward with their personal visions of this approach. While there had long been celebrity chefs (Julia Child, Paul Prudhomme and Andre Soltner are just a few), the 80's, when the money flowed and the media made the restaurant business look glamorous, seemed to manufacture them. These cooking stars weren't just restaurateurs -- they were entrepreneurs out to create potentially lucrative new markets for their work. They wanted to make millions, and frequently did; Barry Wine of the Quilted Giraffe sold the lease to his four-star restaurant to Sony for seven figures in 1992, at its peak.
The financial success of the celebrity chef-entrepreneurs gave them unparalleled freedom to experiment and expand. In 1992, Daniel Boulud left Le Cirque and went on to earn four stars at his own Restaurant Daniel, joining Gray Kunz at Lespinasse, David Waltuck at Chanterelle and Gilbert Le Coze at Le Bernardin as some of the most highly regarded chefs in America's restaurant capital. The recent, highly publicized opening of restaurants like Le Cirque 2000, Vongerichten's restaurant Jean-Georges and the revamped "21" signal a return to the era of expensive dining that first turned these young chefs into stars. In both 1995 and 1996, the Zagat Survey noted an increase in high-end restaurants for the first time since the late 1980's, as well as the first rise in average food prices since 1988. And it wasn't just a local phenomenon. The success of deluxe restaurants like Charlie Trotter's in Chicago, the newly reopened Spago in Los Angeles and the Blue Door in Miami Beach suggest a national trend toward high-priced eating, all the more remarkable in an industry where by some estimates only one in five restaurants lives beyond its first birthday. But the economy is booming for now, and so are industries that cater to people with money.
David Bouley wants to use his own celebrity status to become a powerful force in a continuing battle to improve the American palate. For five straight years, Bouley's innovative cooking earned his restaurant a No. 1 popularity ranking in New York by the Zagat Survey and effusive praise from food critics. His health-consciousness and his commitment to quality ingredients found a receptive audience right alongside the lobster-and-mashed-potato eaters. In 1991, when Zagat asked 7,000 diners, "Where would you eat the last meal of your life?" respondents overwhelmingly picked Bouley.
"They all use good ingredients," says Ruth Reichl, The Times's restaurant critic since 1993. "The thing I admire most about how Bouley cooked was that if you watched the evolution of the restaurant, he did change his style to depend more on the quality of ingredients, and to simplify. The food was left to stand on its own, in a way that is really American."
Beyond that, Bouley came to define a new kind of work ethic in the American kitchen. He believed deeply in the principle that to do better than your competitors, you have to work harder than they do. For the first three years at Bouley, he left work at 3 A.M. and returned, showered and shaven, four hours later. Some nights he never left at all. He interviewed the cabdrivers at the curb to find out what customers said about his restaurant. He went out front to sweep up the cigarette butts. All this separated him from many superstar chefs of the 80's, who moved too fast or too far away from their basic strengths. Jonathan Waxman, the young chef of the restaurant Jams, says of the cause of its closing in 1990, "If it was anything, it was going out to dinner too many times." Bouley shares more with a workaholic entrepreneur like Wolfgang Puck, whose ever-expanding empire of restaurants, cafes and frozen pizzas reveals a chef with similar ambitions.
"Bouley and Puck are probably the two top guys in the business right now," says Tim Zagat, a co-publisher of the best-selling series of restaurant surveys. "But Puck is franchising his name. Bouley aims at a higher level than anyone else in the business and won't allow his name to be used if he is not directly involved. In terms of creativity, he is No. 1." Puck has successfully staked out the mainstream realm of simple food served in a casual West Coast style; his pizzas sell in the frozen-food section of local supermarkets. Bouley is interested in haute cuisine; he wants his products to be found in gourmet food stores and top restaurants. They are likely to be affordable only to upper-income customers.
The darkly handsome Bouley, with wavy black hair flecked with gray and pale green eyes, has never focused his attention on pleasing everyone. In his 10 years on Duane Street, he earned a reputation as a difficult artist who had stormy relationships with many of his colleagues. He sees himself as incapable of failure and possessed of only brilliant ideas. Friends and detractors both attribute to Bouley the qualities of a cult leader: charm, arrogance and the ability to inspire loyalty. Last winter, when The New York Post ran a front-page photo of Marshall Applewhite, the Heaven's Gate cult leader, with the headline "Follow Me," Bouley staffers inserted the chef's picture and faxed it to Bouley in Paris. He laughed.
Bouley's ambitions are bold and invite intimations of disaster, yet Warner LeRoy willingly put up $4 million, and dozens of people have signed on to work for him. Still, critics openly wonder whether Bouley has correctly calculated the marketplace for his ideas. His first planned venture, the $1.5 million Bouley Bakery (which is both a bakery and a restaurant with a major bread fetish), has already inspired some skepticism. "He goes away for a year and what does he have to offer us?" asks Alan Richman, GQ's restaurant critic, who then answers with mock glee, "Rolls!"
Even those close to Bouley voice occasional doubts about the viability of his long-range vision. "When he sees the finished blueprints for the Mohawk Building, there's definitely going to be a big case of sticker shock," says Laurence Harman, an architect with the Harman Jablin firm who is doing some work on the Bouley International headquarters. "David's way of doing things costs a lot of money." Some of his closest employees also fight bouts of pessimism. "The guy has an amazing amount to do, and there are days when I walk in here and say, 'We're never going to pull this off,' " says Peter Kend, his 33-year-old co-director of operations who left a lucrative career as a currency-derivatives trader at Swissbank to work for Bouley. "But then I see David and all his drive and energy and optimism, and I figure, If anybody can pull this off, he can."
Perhaps no one sums up Bouley better than Herbert Wishengrad, a 61-year-old semiretired New Jersey businessman who was Bouley's business partner at the Duane Street restaurant until Bouley abruptly announced in 1995 that he would close his highly profitable restaurant at the pinnacle of its success. At the time, Wishengrad and Bouley were splitting more than $1 million in annual profits. But Bouley changed course and partners, leaving Wishengrad to speculate on the messianic drive of a man who would willingly fold a profitable business.
"Remember how they said the earth was flat until some guy came along and said it was round?" Wishengrad says. "That's who David Bouley thinks he is."
 'Motorcycles . . . denim jeans and black leather jackets . . . gum chewer . . . girls . . . culinary school" were the words that the editors of the yearbook for Edwin O. Smith High School in Storrs, Conn., used to describe Dave Bouley, a graduating senior in 1972. He had spent his childhood in deep thrall of his French-born grandmother, who raised pheasant, chickens and goats, grew fruits and was the host of an all-day marathon cooking session every Sunday at her Rhode Island farm, with a teen-age David at her side. He watched, learned and first came to his now passionate belief that this was the right way for food to be grown, prepared and eaten. "I was always the happy kid," Bouley recalls, though he has borne much family tragedy. Three of his eight siblings have since died -- one of cancer, one in a train accident and one in a plane crash.
When Bouley was 15, he went to work at the Willimantic Motor Inn in Storrs as a dishwasher, and he worked his way up through the kitchen ranks. At 19, he left nearby Manchester Community College and moved to Santa Fe, N.M. There he became the manager of the Pink Adobe, an American restaurant that survives today -- a fact that Bouley attributes, in part, to his overhaul of the kitchen.
In Santa Fe, Bouley made one of his first important connections in the food business. Michel Richard, now well known as the chef-owner of Citrus in Los Angeles, was then working at the Hotel La Fonda as a pastry chef. Richard moved to Los Angeles and Bouley eventually followed him, landing his first big-city cooking job -- making desserts at a pastry shop that Richard opened in Beverly Hills. After that and a brief stop as a waiter in Cape Cod -- "I waited on Tip O'Neill a lot," Bouley recalls -- he could no longer resist the pull to the gastronomic capital of the world.
"I knew I had to go to Paris," Bouley says. "I had $4,000, and I figured out how I could live in Paris on $5 a day." He took classes at the Sorbonne, and an introduction by Richard got him a job in the pastry kitchen of Gaston Lenotre, which led to another with the renowned French chef Roger Verge, who would become a crucial influence on Bouley. It was Verge -- the owner of Le Moulin de Mougins, the renowned restaurant on the Riviera -- who first took Bouley from the intricate architecture of French pastry into the wide-open canvas of nouvelle cuisine.
From that point on, Bouley's education took place inside the great kitchens of Europe and New York. He worked under Paul Bocuse in Lyons and Fredy Girardet of Switzerland and Verge, between stints at New York's top-rated restaurants -- including then-four-star Vienna 79, where he first got to know Austrian cuisine, and Le Cirque, where he spent two years as a sous-chef under the scrutiny of Sirio Maccioni, who recalls, "He never stopped working." Or moving. By 1984, he had worked as a sous-chef at more than a dozen restaurants, until he finally landed at Verge's Sutter 500, in San Francisco. It was there that he met a young, ambitious restaurant captain named Drew Nieporent, whose fantasy was to open a casual yet haute French restaurant very much like the one of David Bouley's own dreams.
In April 1985, the two men opened Montrachet on an almost deserted block of West Broadway in TriBeCa. Seven weeks later, Bryan Miller of The Times lavished three stars on their little boite and called its opening "ample reason to celebrate." But the relationship between the two men could not withstand the pressures created by Miller's rave, and within less than a year, Nieporent ended up packing Bouley's cooking equipment and loading it into a van. (Nieporent has, in the past, accused Bouley of discussing financing for a new venture while still working for him.) Nieporent now runs six other restaurants in the same neighborhood, including Nobu and TriBeCa Grill. The two men have not spoken to each other since their rift, which has only added to its legend. (Bouley made a special point of telling me that Robert De Niro, Nieporent's frequent partner, ate many meals at Bouley.) It is clear that time and success have not healed the wounds of their conflict.
By early 1987, Bouley had raised $815,000 for his own place from Herbert Wishengrad, who was a partner in a factory that made the wax-coated cups used by Dannon yogurt. When his son-in-law, who worked at the accounting firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells, told Wishengrad about a business plan that he had helped Bouley to prepare, Wishengrad agreed to meet the 32-year-old chef, then living in a walkup on West 55th Street, and eventually to commit the needed funds.
Restaurant Bouley opened in the late summer of 1987, built by a crew comprising chefs, cooks and Bouley's brother Martin, a builder. After only a few months, the restaurant got a two-star review from The Times -- "The ride can be delightful," Bryan Miller said cautiously -- but by 1990 it had earned its four-star rating. From then on, six nights a week for the next six years, Bouley almost never had an empty table. Warren Beatty, Woody Allen and Bill Cosby made repeated visits. Bouley dated Bernadette Peters and rode motorcycles with Lyle Lovett. In 1994, People magazine named him one of the "50 Most Beautiful People" of the year.
By the end, Restaurant Bouley was grossing an estimated $8 million to $9 million a year in revenue, with Wishengrad and Bouley each getting huge profit checks. Wishengrad had invested after-tax dollars to open the restaurant, which meant that he had to double his investment to recoup his original outlay. Once he did, it became a 50-50 partnership and then, when Bouley passed a specific revenue mark each year, 65-35 in Bouley's favor. Their annual profits eventually reached an estimated $1 million to $2 million.
But, like his falling-out with Nieporent, Bouley's relationship with Wishengrad ended badly. "From a business point of view, you're never happy if you have a successful business and it is terminated," Wishengrad says now. "It is not a game. You're dealing with people's lives. He had 67 people who were earning a living. A lot of this was done on an emotional basis." Bouley argues that Wishengrad made the partnership difficult. "It is hard having a partner who doesn't think the chef should be allowed to drink a bottle of wine in his own restaurant," Bouley said to me in exasperation one day, objecting to Wishengrad's insistence on controlling every penny spent. When Bouley's 10-year lease was up, he switched to a new partner whom he had met at a corner banquette in his restaurant two years earlier -- the one who said to him, "I've never had a partner, I've never wanted a partner, but I want you to be my partner." In less than a year, LeRoy and Bouley had worked out a deal that would help finance Bouley's business dreams.
 In search of a wide national audience, Bouley plans to go beyond anything yet attempted in this country. For example, his ideas for the overnight shipping of gourmet food will use a vacuum packaging process known as "sous-vide" that he spent weeks studying in France. When done properly, sous-vide sucks out the air from a food package -- keeping the food away from any bacteria in the air that could cause spoilage. The idea of sous-vide is to seal and flash-freeze cooked food so that chefs or customers can prepare a meal simply by reheating it. Some American food retailers have resisted sous-vide as impractical, and possibly hazardous when the food isn't stored properly, but Bouley says such problems can be overcome. Using the technique, Bouley claims that he can sell food that essentially matches his restaurant fare in quality. His fantasy is that through Bouley at Home he will sell four orders of Chatham Lobster With Oven Roasted Fennel and Organic Rhubarb Braised in Red Wine to a guy on the phone in Seattle and get it there overnight.
"He treats food like it is a religion," a competing restaurateur says, "and like he is the spiritual leader who must convert everyone in his path." That assessment would probably not disturb Bouley. The consistent vaulted-ceiling design of his restaurants brings to mind the architecture of a church.
There is a slight stumbling quality to Bouley's speech -- a lot of extra searching for just the right word -- but when the subject turns to food, an eloquence takes hold. What is his favorite spice? "Rosemary," he says and, as it often does, a crooked smile crosses his face. "That was the first spice I ever knew," he explains, and it becomes clear that if food is his one true love, then rosemary was his heart's first passion.
"He used to come to work and tell me he had a dream about scallops in a Pernod and fennel sauce," recalls Georges Briguet, the owner of Le Perigord, where Bouley worked for nearly two years beginning in 1979. "All he thought about was food, and how to make it better, fresher. He had the most amazing set of taste buds I've ever seen."
Bouley's own philosophy of food is simple. "I'm trying to take all the madness out of cooking and see what happens," he says. "Cuisine has a structure. This is what I learned from my grandmother. I don't do the elevated cuisine, the roux and the sauces. I do the flavor." One day I asked him to describe his idea of the perfect meal. "One where you don't look for rough edges or faults," he said, "where you're open to making it be anything. It'd probably be something really simple. I can remember the simple marriages of flavor, like Beethoven when he couldn't hear the notes."
In his year away from kitchen duty, Bouley had the chance -- for the first time in a decade -- to experience other restaurants firsthand and to reshape his philosophy around new ideas. He went frequently to places like Jean-Georges, Il Cantinori, Le Zoo (a village bistro owned by former Bouley waiters) and Bodega (a casual diner on West Broadway). He learned that it matters less what price you charge than what service you deliver. "I like a place that has good value for the money," Bouley says. "Somebody like Jean-Georges spends a lot of time and money making sure the ingredients are good, and so, yes, the customer pays for that. And it is nice when you go out to dinner to have as much time as you want to eat."
Bouley routinely spends four to five hours at a restaurant table (and doesn't mind when customers at his own restaurant do, too, creating long, infuriating waits to be seated). He loves nothing more than the company of his friends, a top-quality bottle of Bordeaux, unobtrusive service and a corner table. He likes a commanding view of every seat, yet can easily spend an entire evening looking at his dining companions as though they are the only people in the room. He has a cast-iron stomach that puts mere gluttons to shame. During one two-hour period together, we experienced a slice of pizza, a box of sushi, a turbulent plane trip and a bumpy cab ride; afterward Bouley showed no signs of ill health, except perhaps a little annoyance when I threw up on him in the cab.
The further away from food Bouley gets, the more difficult it is for others -- even his closest associates -- to comprehend the sum total of his vision. While the scope of his new endeavor may be groundbreaking in sheer size, most of its components resemble existing ventures elsewhere. Bouley is hardly the first chef to demonstrate a commitment to natural ingredients, or even to seek a more visible public platform than a restaurant kitchen to promote his values. Nor does the mere act of owning several different restaurants set him apart from his fellow top chefs. Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Charles Palmer of Aureole each run four restaurants. Cooking schools proliferate; one of the nation's largest, the Culinary Institute of America, is less than two hours away. The decision to open a bakery can hardly be seen as pioneering, either. His old boss Drew Nieporent opened TriBakery nearly two years ago just a few blocks away, and lately there's been critical praise for the new bakery at nearby Balthazar. ("Bread is a highly profitable food group," Alan Richman of GQ explains.) Large-scale retail gourmet-food operations have also been done in New York before; in 10 years, Dean & DeLuca has grown from a single store on Prince Street to three stores and seven cafes. Both Balducci's and Dean & DeLuca already have catalogue divisions that ship food around the country, though perhaps not to the extent that Bouley aspires. Still, as Dean & DeLuca's C.E.O., Dane J. Neller, concedes, "The gourmet-food business has plenty of room for someone like Bouley."
In some respects, Bouley is merely catching the wave at its crest. Farmer's markets crisscross the nation, and since 1989 the organic market has grown by more than 20 percent annually, becoming a $3.5 billion industry. "It is not just better for you, but it tastes better," Bouley says of pure, naturally produced food. "It is not how you cook it that matters but how it was treated before it got to your house that makes all the difference."
Bouley is determined to do it all, and to do it bigger and better than ever before. He insists that he is a reluctant celebrity, but in the end he is simply a clever one. "David doesn't like the limelight?" Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque 2000 said to me incredulously one day. "David loves the limelight. You can tell him Sirio said so."
 'I can make lasagna that will make you cry," Bouley told me one night when I asked whether he had ever cooked Italian food. All of Bouley's revolutionary fervor about food filters through his righteous and passionate belief in himself. It is a habit that some see as fatally arrogant, while others view it as the key to his success. From the beginning of his career, Bouley has earned a reputation for a my-way-or-the-highway management style; he does not like to hear of the possibility that any of his ideas might be misguided, wrong or too expensive.
A still-embittered former colleague recalls the almost constant torture of working with Bouley: "I used to come to work and say to myself: 'It is your fault. I want you to walk in the door today like every possible problem you've ever had with this guy is your fault. And today is a new leaf. David's the greatest. He is the best. You're the one who made all the mistakes. Follow his lead. Let's make the thing work.' And he'd do something even then that was beyond belief, that was so meanspirited that I couldn't do it." What this colleague objected to most was Bouley's seemingly consistent knack for making his own mistakes appear as though they were someone else's.
Bouley can be maddeningly distant one moment and utterly charming the next. He uses a lack of eye contact as a weapon, and can ignore someone standing right next to him for several minutes. Even his closest staff members find the distance vexing; they are forever trying to track him down, and were delighted in late May when Warner LeRoy gave Bouley a cellular phone as a birthday gift. "And we have the number!" a staff member crowed. The 60-person Bouley staff (most of them paid between $500 and $1,000 a week) operates by what they call Bouley Time, which means that their boss will be late to all meetings by at least 45 to 60 minutes. He will get up from a meeting in midsentence and return in an hour with no explanation.
But for Bouley's friends and followers, Bouley is always late but never too late. Those who love him describe him as a man whose personality tests the limits of friendship but who just as constantly rewards those who remain in his circle. He has been financially generous to his most loyal employees -- at Bouley, he shared about 15 percent of each year's profits with them -- and is capable of enormous warmth.
Those loyalties will be tested further as Bouley rushes to build the rest of his food empire. Soon will come the 95-seat, $2 million Danube, for which Bouley and Gutenbrunner are planning a menu of Rieslings, low-fat green borscht and $22 to $28 health-conscious entrees. Gustav Klimt reproductions will hang on the walls of a turn-of-the-century-style room. About Danube there remain the most significant doubts. "Austrian food is the heaviest on earth," says Alan Richman. "The Austrians lost wars because of their food. After an Austrian lunch, you couldn't remount."
Bouley will oversee operations at Danube from his headquarters across the street -- a seven-story landmark building that was most recently the home of Mohawk Electrical Supply Co. More than $8 million will have to go into the renovation of the Mohawk by the time the doors open. Bouley says that the International Cafe, on the first floor, will be devoted to a rotating series of chefs who will cook primarily Asian food, with entrees under $30. For the 75-seat version of Bouley on the second floor, he envisions a lavish one-sitting-a-night, vaulted-ceiling extravaganza. The third-floor design calls for two private dining rooms with fireplaces.
Above that, Bouley promises his own cooking school, where many students will train to work in various Bouley restaurants. Bouley hopes that it will function as a training ground, in much the same way as his old Bouley kitchen did. Chefs formerly from Bouley now run kitchens all over New York, including those in such top restaurants as Le Bernardin and La Caravelle. It's a critical element of his operation because he won't be doing much of the cooking in any of his restaurants; he needs disciples who have internalized his methods. He has reserved the fifth floor for what he is calling the Organic Institute, which he wants to equip with a test kitchen to provide chefs with serenity and quiet in which to explore the complexities of taste. Though not a revenue-generating operation, he believes that the institute's work will translate into recipes that attract more customers.
Bouley at Home -- a two-story, high-ceilinged retail operation that will have 200 employees -- is likely to get much of Bouley's personal attention. The $4 million plan calls for wine and Champagne bars, huge cheese displays, vast offerings of organic produce, a wide spectrum of spices and gourmet coffees and teas. He expects to sell only organic meats, chicken and fish. Bouley claims that economies of scale will give him substantially more clout in the food business, and he believes that he has now established exclusive access to the nation's top farmers, growers and fishermen.
For the anticipated catalogue business, as well as his other ventures, Bouley already has a 10,000-name mailing list of old customers. Like his old restaurant, Bouley International is likely to benefit from proximity to Wall Street expense accounts (the World Trade Center is five blocks away) and TriBeCa itself (the top-floor apartment in the co-op building that will house Bouley at Home just sold for $3.7 million). Both neighborhoods have grown substantially as affluent residential areas in the past few years, with gourmet-food retailers scrambling to serve their needs. While an economic downturn could severely hurt the restaurant business -- particularly places that charge $28 for rotisserie chicken -- it's worth remembering that Bouley's last restaurant thrived during the 1991 recession.
"There's always going to be a market for whatever David Bouley does," says Danny Meyer, an owner of Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, which took over the No. 1 spot in the Zagat survey after Bouley closed. Meyer recently announced plans to open two more restaurants himself. "The profession used to be a lot of immigrants, opening one restaurant and living above the store. Now it's highly motivated Americans with an entrepreneurial bent. We want to create vast, diversified businesses. We don't want to live above our restaurants anymore."
Though Bouley, relishing as always his defiance of expectations, has designed the top two floors of the Mohawk Building as his next apartment.
 Four days after the Fulton Fish Market expedition, Bouley at last looks rested. The Bakery is to open in 20 minutes to a select gathering of journalists, friends and celebrities, and it is at moments of the most intense panic that Bouley appears to grow most calm. The last of the workers is still packing up his tools. Bouley has put on the traditional starched white jacket of his profession, with high collar and buttons down the middle, though he has left it open as he gulps down a last-minute beer.
The very presence of Bouley in the front of his restaurant marks a dramatic shift in his approach to business. On Duane Street, he rarely allowed his customers to see him and paid only infrequent visits to the dining room during business hours. But at the Bakery, Bouley expects to be cooking only a few nights a week. He will be, instead, the public face of his enterprises. He will break his self-imposed silence and actually talk to people for a while. He will sit for extended visits in the front rooms of his restaurants and even eat there occasionally.
"Let's change the music," Bouley says after finishing his beer and realizing that the same Lyle Lovett CD has been on endless replay for the last four hours. An underling is dispatched to Bouley's office to retrieve Miles Davis's "Kind of Blue." Cooks busily prepare canapes, and servers ready trays and glasses.
A few minutes later, at 3:30 P.M., the party begins. It continues until after 11. Most of the expected celebrities end up not showing. Sigourney Weaver called to say she couldn't make it; Bernadette Peters was traveling. Still, a steady stream of friends and associates -- chefs from other restaurants like Waltuck of Chanterelle; old Bouley regulars like the theater director and acting coach Harold Guskin, and business associates like Larry Harmon, the architect -- fills the room for hours with the sound of clinking glasses and crunching bread. By 10, Bouley has taken his new front-of-the-house role even more seriously, having conversations with party-goers and passersby while he leans up against the M10 bus stop outside the Bakery. He is drinking water and every so often takes a bite of a baguette made with imported French organic flour. "Tastes like it already has butter on it," he says.
 Bouley's business success will depend heavily on his ability to keep a smoother partnership with Warner LeRoy than he managed to with his previous partner. The two men come from vastly different backgrounds: Bouley is the son of a salesman and schoolteacher, while LeRoy hails from Hollywood royalty. LeRoy's father, Mervyn, was a director and the producer of, among other things, "The Wizard of Oz." Young Warner's grandfather, Harry Warner, was a founder of Warner Brothers Studio. One morning when Warner was 4, his father brought him to the Oz set; when Warner got there, he took off for a run down the Yellow Brick Road. No one had informed the young boy that Oz was merely a painted backdrop. And so Warner went crashing through the back of the set and quickly learned that there's no place like home, which is where he spent the rest of the shoot.
In 1965, after 11 years of work in the theater, LeRoy opened the restaurant Maxwell's Plum, a swinging-singles Art Nouveau palace that became a defining hot spot of its era. (It closed in 1988.) In August 1976, LeRoy reopened New York's best-located restaurant, Tavern on the Green, in Central Park -- a place that has been described as the inside of a wedding cake. The 900-seat tourist mecca has grown to become one of the city's biggest grossers, and until LeRoy and Bouley became partners it defined Warner LeRoy's role in the New York food world. Asked what he would do if he were put in charge of Tavern, David Bouley cracked a smile and said, "Get a bulldozer."
In 1995, shortly after LeRoy first raised the idea of collaborating with Bouley, he bought the Russian Tea Room. Bouley agreed to be its executive chef and to create a parnership with LeRoy to help him raise the necessary funds to achieve his own vision as well. Bouley owns 51 percent of the stock of Bouley-LeRoy L.L.C. -- the entity that covers all the downtown properties except Bouley at Home, which Bouley intends to finance independently -- while LeRoy owns 49 percent. This effectively gives Bouley final say over all business and creative decisions, though the two men will split the profits 50-50 after Bouley takes a salary off the top. Despite frequent references in the media to LeRoy as the sole financial backer, both men say that so far Bouley has kicked in $1.5 million of his own money. LeRoy has invested roughly an equal amount in cash, along with $2.5 million in notes, for the eventual renovation of the Mohawk Building.
So what, besides his investment, is LeRoy's role in the partnership?
"You can put in your story that you asked that, and that Bouley didn't say anything," Bouley responds, then decides to say something after all: "LeRoy's reaching for the big picture. I'm looking at this little spot. I don't have the financial means to do what he can do. By the same token, what I'm doing is still within my means. I don't need Warner LeRoy to do what I'm doing. And he knows that. When I say that to you, I'm not being disrespectful to Warner LeRoy, but I didn't need him. We understand, both of us. He knows I didn't need him. I know I didn't need him."
"This isn't about need," LeRoy responds evenly. "That's totally irrelevant. My role is to encourage David to grow as much as he can, which he wants to do. To make suggestions to him, some of which he takes and some of which he doesn't. But they are substantial suggestions, and some of them are creative and some of them are not. It's his call." Beyond that, LeRoy says, the two of them will work together to raise the additional funds necessary to complete the rest of the projects. "Some of it will be through mortgages and some of it will be through loans," LeRoy says. "And if we can't do all of it that way, which we would prefer, we will have to sell some equity. And that's it."
The Russian Tea Room project has been stalled for more than a year, largely owing to difficulties in raising the $30 million in investment capital needed to transform the space. At various times over the last several months, LeRoy has believed he was on the verge of getting the money -- "I'm supposed to get the check on March 30," he told me in early February, "and from that point it is 14 months till we open" -- but as of July the money had still not been raised. By late June, LeRoy was rethinking his strategy. While his original plan was to demolish the Russian Tea Room building and erect a new nine-story one in its place, LeRoy is now also considering the more modest approach of an interior renovation. When I asked Bouley what he thought of the Russian Tea Room as an investment, he took my tape recorder and hid it behind his back.
Meanwhile, LeRoy has been coaxing Bouley toward yet another joint project: he wants Bouley to help him run the Rainbow Room. LeRoy and Bouley are among several New York restaurateurs in quiet talks to handle the operation of the landmark Rockefeller Center location. "It is an amazing part of the New York scene," Bouley says, "so I'd be interested in being a part of that."
 'It is like taking your bike out of the garage after a long winter," Bouley is saying between nibbles of a Portuguese Sardine Tart with 24-Hour Cooked Tomatoes and Black Olive and Basil Dressing that he is preparing. "You can't wait to ride it again so you head right out. The first two miles are great, too. But then everything starts going wobbly, and you realize you forgot to fill the tires and they're going flat." That, at 10 minutes after 10 on the night of Bouley Bakery's opening to the public, is the chef's candid assessment of his cooking skills after 12 months off the bike and four hours back on.
Then, within seconds, Bouley's hands begin to move. They fly across the space between the prep table and the stove, stirring and tasting and arranging and tossing and wiping.
Every movement appears to be instinctive and confident. He measures impulsively with his eyes and tastes constantly with his fingers. "It is simple," he once said to me. "You take what is already in the food and you add to it." Every plate, every pot, every saucepan passes before Bouley. He considers each dish before it leaves the kitchen and adds a personal signature, whether it is a crescent moon of mashed potatoes or a sprinkle of marjoram.
It is dead quiet in here. Bouley encourages almost no conversation except as it relates to work. His cooking team tends toward expressionless faces as they prepare their materials.
When Chef asks for fennel, it must be found. When Chef wants garlic, it must be chopped. When Chef needs a laugh, it must be funny, short and to the point.
"Miguel," Bouley says to one of his prep cooks as the young immigrant puts some shrimp in the oven for roasting, "how long have you been working in my restaurant?"
"I was born here," Miguel says.
Funny. All right. Back to work.
"Cut these lengthwise, then like this, then like this," Bouley demonstrates to a young sous-chef as he rests a perfectly formed asparagus on his palm. His index finger marks the incision spots. The sous-chef nods and goes off to chop. Bouley swings around and. . . .
"Where's the tomato water?" he wonders aloud. Someone hands Bouley a bowl, and he gently ladles the water into a pot. Behind him, Kurt Gutenbrunner (who is pitching in here until the opening of Danube) grinds a healthy amount of fresh pepper on the sardines. Just as quickly, Bouley turns again to check the order slips posted against one wall. "Table 4 has two ducks, Table 7 has two chickens and a duck," he says, and those words prompt some quick carving. Tonight, the menu offers Organic Chicken With Rosemary, Local Asparagus, Morels and Fingerling Potato Puree, and Thyme-Honey Glazed Duckling With Fresh Artichokes, Cipollini Onions and Green Potato Gratin. There's also a special four-course menu for $65. At the top of the menu is the date, and also words chosen by Bouley to mark the night: Act I.
But if the last meal at Bouley was called Intermission, then shouldn't this one be called Act II?
"I'm starting fresh," Bouley says, as he puts a handful of organic fava beans into his mouth.
 The early reviews for the Bouley Bakery have been mixed. "Once again, we're in the money -- collectively, anyway -- so say 'Look who's here!' to the double-digit appetizer and 'They're baaaack' to the $30 entree," Hal Rubenstein wrote in New York magazine. "A scattershot dinner with M.I.A. service in a cafe bakery doesn't cut it." Alan Richman of GQ ate a 75-minute dinner ($165 for two people) at Bouley Bakery one recent Saturday night. "At the old place everything was about waiting -- for the reservation, for your table, for your food," Richman says. "Now he's cooking faster than any man alive." Richman found himself amazed at the transformation of the Bouley style.
"He's created a superbly simple menu for the small restaurant adjoining the bakery, with dishes that rely on great products left to speak for themselves," Ruth Reichl wrote in an enthusiastic Diner's Journal in late June. "His Chilled Tomato Terrine is sweet and almost meaty against the fromage blanc. The clams are simply extraordinary. The chilled soup is like gazpacho, only better, the pureed vegetables perked up with a little vinegar and the fine briny flavor of fresh Florida shrimp."
This first public report that the chef was finally back prompted 4,000 calls to the Bakery in one day. The next available 8 P.M. table is in early October.

HEADLINE: Ready for Takeoff

BYLINE: By Claudia Dreifus; Claudia Dreifus is a contributing writer for the Magazine. A collection of her work, "Interview," was published last month.

 BODY:
 The chairman and C.E.O. of the Boeing Company, the world's largest space, defense and commercial jet-craft producer, occasionally talks about this or that piece of hardware with words like "neat," "awesome" and "golly." But Philip Murray Condit's Buck Rogers side is tempered by an aggressiveness that has helped him to make his huge company virtually indomitable. Since assuming the position of C.E.O. 16 months ago, Condit, a 56-year-old aeronautics engineer trained at Berkeley, Princeton and M.I.T., has navigated Boeing's absorption of Rockwell International's defense and aerospace divisions and, two weeks ago, McDonnell Douglas. Now Boeing has only two American rivals in the defense business -- Lockheed Martin and Raytheon -- when just a decade ago there were nine.
 But the $16.3 billion McDonnell Douglas merger would never have happened if Condit hadn't capitulated on a major issue. The European Union had threatened to start a trade war unless the consortium Airbus Industrie received greater access to American markets. In the end, Condit and Boeing agreed to ignore the exclusivity provisions of aircraft-supply contracts with several American air carriers. That leaves the Europeans feeling triumphant and Condit free to concentrate on new headaches, like the recent crash of the Boeing 747 in Guam, as well as on what he terms, with some awe, "building these huge birds." 
 Q: We are sitting here in the same Seattle hotel suite where last December you and Harry Stonecipher, the C.E.O. of McDonnell Douglas, negotiated your merger deal. There had been previous attempts to broker this marriage. Why did it work this time?
A: Over the past year we had some big wins. They had a couple of big losses. And consolidation in the industry was about to take another major step. Our reasons for the acquisition were strategic. This is a cyclical business. When the world economy is up, people buy civilian airplanes. And when the economy is down, they don't. Now, the military-defense-space sector has a different set of drivers: geopolitical
forces and rapidly developing technology in space. With the acquisition of Rockwell, and now McDonnell Douglas, we get some balance by having a better presence in the defense and space sectors. We'll have a ratio of 60 percent civilian aviation to a 40 percent defense-space business.
Q: The European Union fought the McDonnell Douglas merger down to the last moment. Even though the merger had been approved by our Federal Trade Commission, the Europeans threatened to place huge tariffs on Boeing products unless you agreed to concessions that gave your major competitor, Airbus, potentially greater access to American markets. There were hints that the White House urged you to capitulate.
A: We absolutely did not get any pressure to capitulate. All along, we kept thinking about what was best for our company, our shareholders. We gave in to them some in places where we needed to make a deal, and we got a lot from the European side. We were doing trades. They wanted us to divest of Douglas -- the civilian aircraft part of McDonnell Douglas -- and we argued that it should not be divested. And in the end that's what we came out with.
Q: Now that the merger has been completed, are you ready for a serious battle with Airbus?
A: My view is that the merger by itself doesn't change the situation at Airbus all that much. McDonnell Douglas doesn't bring a lot of strength on the commercial side. It brings a lot of strength on the military side.
The merger gives us power, but it is also a risk. Being big comes with a downside. There are parts of this business where agility is extremely important, and it's much harder to be quick and agile if you're really big. Part of the challenge is to build units that by themselves are agile inside that larger construct. You've got to give them the guidance to operate, but you can't micromanage them.
Q: Your company has been the target of a lot of criticism on safety issues. In promotional materials, Airbus executives often hint that their planes are safer than yours. They allude to T.W.A. Flight 800 and to the two 737 crashes, near Colorado Springs and Pittsburgh. How do you answer them?
A: I don't think it is beneficial to Boeing or Airbus to argue about who is safer in a world where both of us put safety at the very top of what we do. What we have is a very safe system. So why would you want to argue about who is safer?
Q: Federal authorities have been saying all summer that they're pretty certain that neither a bomb nor a missile took out T.W.A. Flight 800. They suspect, instead, an explosion in the fuel tank. Will you be recalling your 747 fleet to check the fuel tanks?
A: The first thing that has to happen is that you've got to determine what the cause was. You've got to fix the right thing, whatever it is.
Q: Early reporting on Flight 800 suggested that it had been downed by terrorists. As terrible as that would have been, did you almost hope for that -- as opposed to a mechanical problem?
A: One of the things I've learned is that you don't "hope" for anything. You try to find out the answer.
Q: But that would have been a better result for the company, wouldn't it?
A: I don't know how there can be a "better result" when people die.
Q: The Seattle Times won a Pulitzer Prize this year for a series investigating what it described as technical problems with the rudder system on the 737. Why haven't you recalled the 737 fleet while you've worked on that rudder problem?
A: Because there is zero evidence that that's where the problem is.
Q: But you did eventually make some adjustments in your 737's rudder. Why do it if there was no problem?
A: Because we do testing, and -- this is something I can't overstress -- whenever you do find something, whatever it is, you've got to fix it. What we found was that under a very different set of circumstances, if we did certain things, we could cause a problem. There's no evidence that this has happened. You do a microscopic analysis. You look for little tiny scratches that tell you if something jammed and didn't jam. But we did find a condition that could produce a problem. We went out to the fleet and said, Go check for this. We checked every single airplane and didn't find any of them with that problem. We changed the design so that won't happen.
Q: You've said that Boeing's mergers with McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell will strengthen your defense business. Why move so heavily into defense contracting at a moment when domestic military production appears to be drawing down?
A: Two reasons. One of them is the consolidation of defense producers. The second -- and this is where I have a strong desire that this is not true -- is that human beings have had a very poor record on keeping the peace. I believe that a strong defense industry is an important part of our Government. Every time we've let it grow weak, we had to hurry and build it back up again.
Q: So you view the post-cold-war defense downsizing as temporary?
A: We're doing our planning on the basis of relative stability, that it has come down and it will flatten out. Defense will be a relatively stable business, of which we can have a bigger part.
Q: Boeing was already a giant. With this merger, you're a colossus. Can you foresee a situation in which what's good for Boeing might not be good for America?
A: I don't think it's likely. On the other hand, if the U.S. said, We now have an isolationist policy, that would be a conflict with the Boeing view of the world. We sell to a world market.
Q: When U.S.-Chinese relations get rocky, do you fret?
A: Yes, absolutely. From a fundamental business standpoint, China's an important market. Beyond that, I have some pretty firmly held beliefs that commerce is an integrating factor. It brings people together.
I think we get very tangled up when we say, What is our human rights policy and how does it interact with our trade policy? On that I believe very strongly that we Americans tend to have a bit of a warped perspective. There's a need for recognition that we operate in a global market and that people have choices.
When we came out of World War II, the only strong industrial capability in the world was in the United States. Everybody had to come here for things. That's no longer true. Yet we still do things as if everybody has to come to us. That's why I think that we need broad international agreement on human rights principles by multilateral powers. It can't be just us.
Q: Are you saying that human rights should not be a dimension of American foreign policy?
A: I'm saying that I do not believe that human rights should be a key element of trade policy -- it should be part of fundamental foreign policy. Now, there are always places where you can't quite make that separation. But sometimes it seems as if we Americans are like the proverbial policeman chasing the fleeing criminal and pointing a gun to our own head and saying, "Stop or I'll shoot myself."
Q: Do you have personal feelings about human rights violations in China?
A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. And I'm going to put it in context: they are the same ones that I have about human rights violations in the United States.
Q: Wait a second. Americans do live in a democracy. We get to vote for our political leaders, and we aren't shot down in the streets, as the demonstrators in Tiananmen Square were.
A: Well, not in the same way. But viewed from the outside, some of the struggles we've had with civil rights don't look all that shiny. People have been shot. People have been beaten. I happened to be in China during the Rodney King beating. Now, there is a whole bunch of background that goes along with that. But watching that on CNN in China, their perspective was, what was that about?
The position that a number of Chinese leaders have put forward is that they believe that the Soviet experience was the wrong approach -- that you have to get your economy in order before you move to a more open political system. You have to make sure that you are seeing both sides. Can we move other countries in a direction that is positive in terms of civil rights? I believe that the answer is yes. I happen to believe that the most powerful way that you do that is by engagement.
Q: Last year the Chinese placed an order for some short-range passenger transports with Airbus. Was that their way of signaling that unless you can fix these squabbles we're having with your State Department, we'll trade with Europe?
A: In a word, no. I do think what it said indirectly was, We do have alternatives. If the U.S. decides to take a unilateral position, we need to be willing to acknowledge that our trading partners have other choices and that that has an impact on the United States.
Q: Returning to your merger with McDonnell Douglas -- most consolidations involve a certain amount of people losing their jobs. Is that going to happen here?
A: We have an advantage. We're making a lot of planes, and we've got growing markets -- and so normally we would be hiring a fair number of people. But one of the things that we're focused on is, How do we take advantage of the merger to not hire people? In other words, get the savings without having to lay off people. Now, that's going to mean that in some cases people will change jobs, and changing jobs is disruptive. But we should be able to get the kind of savings we're after without significant downsizing.
Q: A couple of years back, Boeing was the scene of an exceptionally bitter 69-day strike. Your contract with the machinists' union expires in 1999. Will there be another strike?
A: I see strikes as a failure of communication -- on both sides. People get set positions and they don't hear the other side. I'm not exempting management from this. We have had relatively aggressive company-union relationships. Every once in a while they have to demonstrate that they can stand up to us. And every once in a while we have to demonstrate that we can stand up to them.
Now, about the 1999 contract: I will personally try -- as will others -- to not let that happen again. Let me give you a specific example. Every one of our customers is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week operation -- NASA, the airlines. We are a five-day-a-week, two-shift and a small-third-shift kind of operation. That means we leave the majority of the week where these very high value products are just sitting doing nothing. One of the things we've said is that we want to move into being a seven-day, 24-hour company. The union says, Oh, no, we don't want to do that. But that same union represents mechanics who work for airlines that work around the clock.
Q: So transforming Boeing into a seven-day, 24-hour shop will be an issue in the coming negotiations?
A: I have no idea, by the way, whether it will be a seven-day or if we move to that through a series of gradual steps. What we're headed to right now is a lot of conversation, as opposed to taking positions and then being in a contract negotiation. The real goal is to reach the negotiating table and have nothing to negotiate -- you have already dealt with those issues.
Q: One of your personal accomplishments at Boeing has been to revolutionize the way airplanes are made. Your newest model jetliner, the 777, for instance, is manufactured by small production teams, in much the same way that automobiles are made in Japan. You're now employing computer and modem technology throughout the design process. Workers and customers are encouraged to add their ideas. Did you go to Japan and study their methods?
A: Yes, in the late 80's. We read a lot and visited a number of companies, and they had some really good ideas. And these were things we could do.
The key phrase on the 777 was "working together." It was O.K. to cross boundaries. And it's fun, it's creative. But you have to be careful. It's a little like ordering people to like each other. It might not work.
Q: This is a company that used to be called "the Kremlin" because its culture was so secretive and hierarchical. Surely there's been some resistance to your opening up the Kremlin.
A: An easy phrase: change is always difficult. The thing that inhibits change most is fear.
Q: When you first came to Boeing as an aerodynamics engineer in 1965, you worked on the development of the SST, the supersonic transport. This jet was never built. Now that you head the company, might you revive the idea of an American SST to compete with the European Concorde?
A: We are working on an SST -- have been, well, virtually continuously. We never gave up.
There are technical and economic problems to overcome. Our SST's have to operate with airport noise levels that are equal to the best current airplanes. SST's tend to be noisy. I don't think you are going to have a big market for a plane that needs a noise-pollution exemption. The second problem is high-altitude emissions. The planes put out nitrous oxide, which tends to attack the ozone. The third problem is the sonic boom. That probably won't change, so the SST would be limited to flying over the water. If we can solve these technical problems and make a plane that gets you New York to London twice as fast when the costs are the same, I want to be there.
Those are big ifs. But I don't want the Boeing Company to be in a position where somebody else solves the equation and we miss one of those turns.
Q: A final question. The remains of one of your engineers, Benson Hamlin, were recently sent orbiting into space along with those of Gene Roddenberry, the creator of "Star Trek," and the LSD guru Timothy Leary. When the time comes, would you want such a funeral for yourself?
A: I don't think so. My perception of myself is as a fairly simple person. If I was to be asked, quick quick quick, what do you consider the perfect setting, it would be in the mountains -- maybe scattered in a mountain stream. But with interesting companions like Timothy Leary and Gene Roddenberry, I'd probably go off into my own little corner.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY;
Cambodian Coup Leaves Tourist Sites Empty

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia

 BODY:
"IT'S zero," said Nongnuj Dobbs, Phnom Penh office manager for the East-West travel agency, describing tourism to Cambodia after last month's coup.
"It's nil," said Meng Hieng, managing director of the Pich Tourist Company. 
 Chenda Sophea Sok, Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Tourism, agreed. "Those images of evacuation planes killed us, killed the industry," he said.
More than a month since political tensions erupted in fighting in early July, virtually no one is visiting Cambodia for pleasure. Although both the fighting and the evacuation flights have ended, it could be months before the industry recovers.
Hotels are nearly empty. Airlines have cut back on their flights. Restaurants and nightclubs have fallen dark, and casinos have closed. Tour operators, drivers, waiters, chambermaids, vendors, guides, hawkers and ladies of the evening are mostly out of work. The National Museum in Phnom Penh opens its doors each morning, stands empty all day, then closes on schedule in the evening. Almost no one travels to visit the great temples at Angkor Wat, where gunfire could be heard in mid-July.
Political instability and, in remote areas, persistent banditry have always been part of the landscape for visitors to Cambodia. But the country's small tourism industry had begun to grow in recent years.
Since the coup, security is in question again. The fighting of early July has ended in the capital, and Angkor Wat appears secure, too. But the possibility of renewed fighting remains in the country's western and northern regions. The most recent United States State Department warning, issued Aug. 8, recommends that United States citizens defer nonessential travel to Cambodia and that those who must go not travel outside Phnom Penh, specifically mentioning Siem Reap province, site of Angkor Wat.
Despite the uncertainty of the political situation, Mr. Chenda of the Ministry of Tourism said in an interview that he was optimistic about the future, and he may be right. "I don't worry, because by the end of the year everything will be normal," he said, "even better than before."
But tourism may not recover so soon.
"I think it is O.K. to go to Angkor Wat," Mrs. Dobbs said. "It is very quiet now. But as a tour operator we cannot guarantee that nothing will happen." Even though factional fighting has ended, she said, the possibility of banditry seems to have grown.
"My father wants to go there," she said. "I recommended to him not to carry money, not to carry anything valuable. Even a small camera -- if someone wants to take it, just give it to them." This advice is much the same as always. Cambodia has always been a destination for the adventurous, and much of its attractiveness has been its very underdevelopment. But it is a nation desperately in need of commerce; even the $20 visa fees paid by arriving tourists have been a significant contribution.
The shock of the coup, which has set back foreign aid and investment across the board, has been a severe blow to the economy. The halt in the tourism industry is being felt through much of the country. In an economy as primitive as this one -- where most of the population still toils in rice fields -- the tourism industry was disproportionately significant. Until the coup it accounted for about one-third of foreign investment, second only to infrastructure development.
Mr. Chenda said it had been growing fast, from a very small base. In 1993, he said, just 90,000 tourist visas were issued. By last year the number had risen to 220,000. This figure includes people who traveled to Cambodia for business as well as for tourism. The growing number of visitors led to a hotel building boom, and several new hotels, offering a total of 1,500 rooms, were set to open soon in Phnom Penh. Much of this construction has stopped.
Daily flights from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap -- the site of Angkor Wat -- had increased from two in 1993 to three in 1995 to seven since last November, Mr. Chenda said. Those have now been cut back to just one flight a day, which is still nearly empty.
Mr. Meng Hieng said that just before the coup he attended a conference of travel agents in China, where he signed contracts with companies interested in Cambodia's emerging tourist market.
"We were expecting an increase of 10 to 15 percent in our business this year," he said. "Unfortunately, Cambodia has this kind of fighting, and this has caused us a good deal of annoyance."

HEADLINE: Making a Break For the Blues

BYLINE: By ALEX WARD; ALEX WARD is editor of special sections for The Times.

 BODY:
IT'S probably not often that what begins as a quick getaway trip turns into a pilgrimage. But when a friend called last October and suggested taking a few days off to go to a blues festival in Helena, Ark., that's more or less what happened.
Helena, 55 miles southwest of Memphis, is on the western edge of the alluvial plain known as the Mississippi Delta, where the blues were spawned by workers who toiled in the cotton fields by day and played the juke joints at night. Forming the region's spine is Route 61, the blacktop artery that carried the music north, along with throngs of black migrants escaping their sharecropper existences. 
 It was from station KFFA on Righter Street in Helena that "King Biscuit Time," the radio show that helped popularize the blues, originated in 1941. And Helena was home to one of the program's featured performers, Rice Miller, better known as Sonny Boy Williamson. The notoriously hard-living Sonny Boy died in 1965, but "King Biscuit Time" is still going, as is its longtime emcee, John W. (Sunshine Sonny) Payne.
About 65 miles east of Helena, in the hill country of Mississippi, is Oxford, the site of the University of Mississippi and the Center for the Study of Southern Culture, a sort of Vatican for worshippers of the region's literature (Faulkner is the Almighty), art, politics, economics, food and, yes, the blues.
The university also has what it boasts is the world's largest blues archive (some 32,000 blues and gospel records), a lure we considered irresistible. So Oxford was our first destination after landing in Memphis on a midday Friday flight.
The Center for the Study of Southern Culture has achieved full curriculum status at the university, offering undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and attracting students from all over the world. It is best known for high-profile literary get-togethers, particularly the Yoknapatawpha Faulkner Conference, which it sponsors each August with the English department. But the center has also produced notable books on Southern art and music, among them The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, edited by William Ferris, the center's director, and Charles R. Wilson. The center also publishes Living Blues magazine, a bimonthly mix of interviews, album reviews and festival reports.
We sat for a while in Mr. Ferris's office, on the second floor of the 140-year-old Barnard Observatory on the Ole Miss campus, while he talked about the growth of regional studies programs throughout the country and about a dream of his, in which the growing interest in the Civil War, in the blues, in Southernalia generally, will lure more visitors to his part of the world.
He also talked us into remaining in Oxford long enough to visit the town square, a source of local pride, and trying the fare at City Grocery, a nouvelle Southern bistro not far from Faulkner's house. We had planned to be in Helena for that evening's festival program, but it was a warm, cloudless, lazy afternoon, and it seemed a shame to come this far and not see more of this seductive town. Besides, we were hungry.
Several hours later, stuffed full of cheese grits and shrimp, we drove to Tunica, Miss., about 20 miles northeast of Helena, where we were booked into a spanking new hotel-casino called Fitzgerald's, which was about the only place in the area where we could reserve rooms on short notice. We checked in, wandered down to the casino to watch men in bib overalls play blackjack, and called it a day.
The next morning, Saturday, we made straight for Helena, where the music was due to start at 10 o'clock and keep going until whenever. There were four stages set up for the festival, three of them at the foot of the town levee that runs along the Mississippi River and creates a natural sloped seating area. The fourth, the gospel stage, was in a parking lot at the north end of town.
Admission was free, so we roamed from one to another, stopping whenever someone caught our attention. We listened to a young Delta bluesman with the improbable name of Fruteland Jackson; to Candy Shines, a full-bodied belter with great moves, and to the guitarist Bob Margolin, a veteran of the Muddy Waters Band, who was paired with James Harman, a harmonica player from California. We also heard Junior Kimbrough, a local legend from Holly Springs, Miss., whose stark, plaintive wail is sometimes on key and sometimes off, but either way can make those little hairs on the back of your neck stand up.
At one point, in search of a drink, we wandered down Cherry Street, the town's main thoroughfare, which was transformed into a long outdoor food and souvenir bazaar. There, on a small stage meant for clowns or magicians or other performers who can keep children entertained, was Johnnie Billington, a 70-ish guitarist who was accompanied on a rolling electric blues song by a 12-year-old bass player and a drummer who looked even younger. Known as Mr. Johnnie, Billington runs an educational program through the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale, Miss., whose purpose is to perpetuate the blues by keeping youngsters off the streets and in the juke joints, where they belong. We were told this by a friendly woman who was passing a hat for donations. With pleasure, we anted up for the scholarship fund.
As afternoon turned into evening, and Robert (Junior) Lockwood and his band completed their set on the main stage, we broke for dinner at Kathryn's, a homey restaurant across the river on Moon Lake, Miss., that Mr. Ferris had recommended.
Over broiled catfish, we fell into conversation with two men at the next table, a liquor salesman who grew up in the area but who was living in New Orleans, and a former sheriff of Coahoma County. They told us about Uncle Henry's, an inn just down the road, which Tennessee Williams had often visited and is a setting, as Moon Lake Casino, in "Summer and Smoke."
We agreed we would stop by for a closer look at the place, but not until the next day. In Helena the Saturday night program, the festival's showcase, was in full swing. It was about 8:30 when we arrived back, just in time for Anson Funderburgh and the Rockets, a band whose lead singer is Sam Myers, a 60-year-old with a big, gruff voice, a sharp wit and a demeanor best described as stately. By the time he was finished, we decided he should be declared a national treasure.
There was more to come, and we stayed for much of it. By midnight, however, the schedule had slowed to a crawl, and Luther Allison, the headliner, had yet to go on. Glassy-eyed and music-logged, we headed back to Tunica, where Fitzgerald's, our Emerald City on the Delta, awaited.
Nine hours later, we pulled up at Uncle Henry's inn. The driveway was shaded by cedar, pecan and magnolia trees; Moon Lake sparkled across the road. Why hadn't we known about this place when we were scrambling to make reservations?
Sarah Wright, the proprietor with her son, George, greeted us politely and agreed to give us a quick tour and a capsule history of her quirky, charming little place. It was a casino in the 30's, but was shut down when the townspeople discovered that its profits were going to the mob in Chicago. Sarah's foster father, Henry Trevino, whom she called Uncle Henry, later bought it, and she eventually took it over, about a decade after his death in 1976. She showed us Jitterbug Hall, a room where dances were once held, and walked us out back, where the Yazoo Pass winds quietly by.
Yes, she said, Tennessee Williams came by occasionally, usually in the company of his grandfather, a minister in Clarksdale, but as far as she knows, he never stayed there. She declined our request for breakfast -- for guests only -- and said we were welcome to stroll around the grounds, and to come back and stay any time.
 WE thanked her, got back in the car and headed south for Clarksdale, a sleepy city of 22,000, where we wanted to visit the Delta Blues Museum. Recently re located on the second floor of Clarksdale's old Carnegie Library, the museum displays photographs, paintings, sculptures (a life-size, wax-and-resin Muddy Waters sits atop a tiny platform), videos, and exhibits explaining the history of the music. We passed a pleasant hour or two there, then checked out Rooster Blues Records, a combination record shop and recording studio devoted to the work of Mississippi bluesmen.
There was not an open restaurant in sight, so we sat on a shaded bench across the street from the museum, ate peanuts from a convenience store and tried to make contact with the town's ghosts. Clarksdale has been called ground zero of the Delta Blues, so we figured there had to be plenty of them in the vicinity.
That night, after driving up Route 61 to Memphis, we took in Beale Street, once bad and brassy and deservedly storied, but now a pedestrian blues mall where all the clubs look more or less the same, with much neon and ersatz funkiness. We retreated to the lobby of the Peabody Hotel a few blocks away, and raised a glass to Sam Myers.
Memphis is, of course, the city of Elvis Presley, who not only has a boulevard named for him, but whose home, Graceland, is its most famous landmark. On Monday we had a 2 P.M. flight back to New York, which left us the morning free, and I felt it should somehow be devoted to the King of Rock-and-Roll. He was, after all, a child of the region (Tupelo, Miss.), and musically a linear descendant of its bluesmen, from whom he borrowed both material and style.
The Graceland Elvis, with its images of a glitzy Vegas showman, doesn't interest me much. But the early Elvis, the Sun Sessions Elvis, is another story. The Sun recording studio, where, the story goes, in 1953 a lanky, self-conscious 18-year-old walked in and asked if he could make a vanity record for his mother's birthday, is at 706 Union Avenue, about a mile east of downtown. There are regular tours, though the space is so small they are pretty much confined to one room.
Ah, but what a room. Its official name in those days was the Memphis Recording Service, and it was run by a restless young producer named Sam Phillips. "Rocket 88," considered by many to be the very first rock-and-roll song, was recorded here (for the Chicago-based Chess label) in 1951; the singer was Jackie Brenston, who was backed on piano by one of Phillips's talent scouts, a young man named Ike Turner.
It was here that Howlin' Wolf first recorded, where Jerry Lee Lewis made "Great Balls of Fire" and "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On," where Carl Perkins recorded "Blue Suede Shoes" and Johnny Cash recorded "I Walk the Line." And where Elvis Presley, whom Phillips invited back after hearing Elvis's demo tape, recorded "That's All Right (Mama)," and thereby changed the course of popular music.
In the four decades since, the Sun Studio has been a barbershop and a scuba diving store, among other things. But perhaps because there wasn't much to it to begin with, the place is remarkably intact, with the original acoustic tiles and control room equipment, even the same standup mike that Phillips's artists sang into. "You are standing on hallowed ground," the guide said.
Sometimes, the hackneyed phrase is the right one. I would swear I noticed some of our group, which included a pair of Dutch 20-somethings in black Sun Records T-shirts and a middle-aged couple who had arrived on a huge Harley, bow their heads. I know I did.
It turns out that Sam Phillips, now in his 70's and the owner of a group of radio stations around the country, still lives in Memphis. Why, I wondered as we headed for the airport, isn't a boulevard named after him?
 
Whole lotta music going on

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Not Just Dazzling in Their Time, but Dedicated

BYLINE: By Jack Anderson 

 BODY:
WITH THE DEATHS THIS YEAR OF Alexandra Danilova, in July, and Leon Danielian, in March, the ballet world has lost two great dancers of enormous flair. Although they appeared with several groups during their long careers, they were especially associated with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, the cosmopolitan touring company that after settling in the United States during World War II delighted countless Americans from the 1940's through the early 60's. The performances of Danilova and Danielian did much to convince newcomers to dancing that ballet could be exhilarating and inspiring -- and fun as well.
The Russian ballerina Danilova sparkled on stage. Offstage, she was always glamorous and she spoke a vivid but idiosyncratic English with a grammar of her own invention. The American-born Danielian was a brilliant technician, and a wit as well. Both his dancing and his conversation had brio. The stage personalities of these dancers were inimitable. And we can still learn from their example, even though they cannot be copied. 
 Danilova, who was 93, and Danielian, 75, were remarkably versatile. Audiences found Danilova a noble and passionate Swan Queen in "Swan Lake." She had a worldly charm as the Glove Seller in "Gaite Parisienne" and the Street Dancer in "Le Beau Danube." But she was a spectral Sleepwalker in "Night Shadow." And although she preferred narrative ballets, she was also effective in abstract pieces like George Balanchine's "Danses Concertantes" and Bronislava Nijinska's "Chopin Concerto."
Danielian took to the air in the Bluebird pas de deux from "The Sleeping Beauty" and scurried amusingly along the ground in "Gaite Parisienne," in which he portrayed a bumbling Peruvian tourist eager to sample Parisian night life. He strutted as a vain matador in "Madronos." In "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune," he was an amorous faun; in "Carnaval," a whirling Harlequin.
Both dancers had limitations. Tragic roles did not suit Danielian's temperament. Critics thought Danilova unconvincing as Giselle, possibly because she seemed too inherently sophisticated to persuade them that she was a vulnerable peasant girl. She triumphed, however, as another peasant lass: the clever and strong-willed Swanilda in "Coppelia."
Danilova and Danielian defied typecasting. Today, dancers are sometimes much too readily classified by their companies as lyrical, noble or dramatic, making it difficult for them to develop a range.
Danilova, Danielian and their contemporaries may have found it easier to achieve versatility simply because the companies of their time were smaller. While ballet troupes now often boast 80 or more dancers, those of the 40's and 50's usually had about 40, and every dancer had to perform in many sorts of ballets. Principal dancers, therefore, had opportunities to play unconventional roles. Danilova surprised and delighted audiences when she danced (and spoke lines of dialogue as well) in Ruth Page's "Billy Sunday," a comic ballet telling Bible stories in a choreographic style that tried to capture the flamboyance of the evangelist's sermons.
Danilova and Danielian had lively minds, as well as agile bodies. Although neither received much formal education, both were intellectually inquisitive. Danilova, a product of the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, was an authority on the 19th-century classics. But those were not her only choreographic loves. As a member of Serge Diaghilev's often experimental Ballets Russes of the 1920's, she danced with the most innovative troupe in 20th-century ballet. She once said in an interview: "I have been so lucky. All my life I have worked with the avant-garde. That developed me enormously as an artist, much more than if I had danced just 'Swan Lake' and 'Giselle.' "
DANIELIAN, A WELL-READ MAN, WAS interested in theatrical history and could discuss poetry and painting with considerable authority. Although a high school dropout, he was a professor of dance at the University of Texas in Austin from 1982 until he retired in 1991. The breadth of his knowledge surely helped make him an effective teacher.
But perhaps the greatest artistic virtue that Danilova and Danielian shared was a total dedication to dance. Such dedication is typical of many of their contemporaries: an example is Frederic Franklin, Danilova's usual partner at the Ballet Russe, who today, at the age of 83, goes around the world teaching classes and staging productions with undiminished energy. His bubbly version of "Coppelia" was one of the delights of American Ballet Theater's spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House.
Dancers are, for the most part, more secure in their professions today than they used to be, although some ballet companies still teeter on the edge of economic catastrophe. In the more uncertain times of the 40's and 50's, when no one quite knew what the next season might bring (or if there would be a next season), members of the Ballet Russe and the early Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet lived for the moment on stage. Many came to regard ballet not simply as a job but almost as a religious calling.
Danilova once said, "I never danced for an audience that I thought was unworthy of my performance." And in her autobiography, "Choura," she wrote: "Every woman has an image -- mother, princess, ballerina -- that she must uphold. I was privileged to be a ballerina and I, therefore, had a duty to my audience."
An awareness of artistic responsibility guided Danilova and Danielian first as dancers and then as teachers and stagers of ballets. If their spirit and sense of mission live on in young performers, the world of dance will be enriched.

Fairy Tale Without An Ending

BYLINE: By ANN KOLSON 

 BODY:
FROM THE OPENING MOMENT, WITH ITS thunderous chords of the Ronettes' "Be My Baby" and its close-ups of ecstatic young people's flashing thighs, arching backs and grinding hips, the movie "Dirty Dancing" pulled audiences into its rhythms and back to a time when everything seemed possible.
This little musical romance, made for $5 million and starring two near-unknowns, Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, was released exactly 10 years ago and quickly became a phenomenon in a way that no one associated with it quite understands, even to this day. A modern-day Romeo and Juliet story set in the Catskills, it earned more than $170 million worldwide, was the source of two top-selling soundtrack albums, inspired a group of particularly crazed fans to sit through 100 showings apiece and still has videotape sales of about 40,000 copies a month. 
 "When you find that you have lightning in a bottle, you don't waste time trying to explain it," Jimmy Ienner, the music executive who acquired rights to many of the songs for "Dirty Dancing," said recently.
Will that lightning strike twice? On Friday, Live Entertainment is re-releasing a musically re-mastered version of the film in 25 American cities, with plans to open the movie more widely the following weekend. There will be a flashy Hollywood "premiere," and Mr. Swayze, who plays the dance instructor Johnny Castle, the poor but sensitive heartthrob, will get his own star on Hollywood Boulevard. (Members of Perfectly Patrick, a group of Mr. Swayze's fans, will polish that star monthly; he suggested that weekly might be overdoing it.)
Talk of re-releasing the movie began in March, said David Bowers, Live's executive vice president for publicity. In fact, it's being promoted more as a first release, with a blizzard of television and print advertising, a campaign that Mr. Bowers says will cost a few million dollars. "We'll introduce it to a whole new generation of people," he said, "those who haven't seen it before in theaters."
At the center of this unusual effort is a belief that women still love this fairy tale of a movie. "Women really want to fall in love with a handsome man," Mr. Bowers said. "We all had a wonderful summer romance in our life. You never forget your first time."
Which brings us to the movie's creator, Eleanor Bergstein, a novelist and screenwriter. Loosely autobiographical, "Dirty Dancing" takes place during the idyllic summer of 1963 at Kellerman's Mountain House in the Catskills, a playground for the well-to-do. John F. Kennedy was President, the Peace Corps beckoned the idealistic young, and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King boomed, "I had a dream."
Into the Borscht Belt Eden comes 17-year-old Baby, bookish, slightly awkward and earnest (played by a luminous Ms. Grey), her more beautiful princess of a sister, Lisa, and their doctor father and housewife mother. When Baby stumbles into the off-limits, smoky staff quarters late at night, she discovers an erotic world of pounding music, heart-stopping dancing and heartbreaking romance in the form of Johnny, who with the crook of a finger and some sweltering dance moves mesmerizes her.
Ms. Bergstein, too, was the daughter of a Brooklyn physician, with a sister. They spent some summers at Grossinger's, the legendary resort. Her parents golfed. She still has snapshots of herself from that time. "I was a teen-age mambo queen," she said recently, "a little nymphet."
During the school year, she tutored underprivileged children. At night she went dancing to raunchy rock-and-roll in basements and rec rooms with boys from the wrong side of the tracks. "I have dirty-dancing trophies that will turn your hands green if you touch them," she said, speaking over the telephone from a house in Tuscany.
Like Johnny, she once taught ballroom dance at Arthur Murray. Was there a Johnny Castle in her life? "I think there's one in everybody's life," she said.
It was over lunch with Ms. Bergstein in a restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in early 1985 that Linda Gottlieb, then a producer for MGM, first heard the term "dirty dancing." "Eleanor, that's a million-dollar title!" Ms. Gottlieb remembers exclaiming.
MGM financed development of the movie, but when the studio changed management, it dropped the project. Ms. Gottlieb began soliciting studios. "I was turned down by everyone who could say no," she said. "I kept hearing the same responses: it's small and it's soft."
When Vestron Video chose "Dirty Dancing" to be its first venture into feature films, Ms. Gottlieb agreed to pare her proposed budget by nearly half. To economize, she and the director, Emile Ardolino, recreated the Catskills in Virginia and North Carolina, two states where labor unions were not a factor. Rain and cold prevailed in September 1986 at the Mountain Lake Hotel in Giles County, Va., where the cast and crew were ensconced -- along with a convention of bird-watchers -- at the start of the 43-day filming. As the leaves began to turn yellow, crew members spray painted them green, Ms. Gottlieb recalled.
Mr. Ardolino, who died of AIDS in 1993, had read the script while on jury duty in Manhattan. It was the first feature for the director, who in 1984 had won the Academy Award for best documentary with "He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin' ," about the ballet dancer and teacher Jacques d'Amboise.
A Queens native, Mr. Ardolino had never heard the term dirty dancing. When Ms. Bergstein invited him and the choreographer Kenny Ortega to her apartment to play her old 45's and demonstrate the moves, she served red wine and grabbed a startled Ortega for a steamy, impromptu performance. Mr. Ardolino was so embarrassed, he had to leave, Mr. Ortega recalled recently. But, Mr. Ortega added, "Emile had a very strong vision for the film." When the actors danced, Mr. Ardolino's camera was right in their midst.
"I really wanted the audience to feel what it was like for Baby to be in that room," Mr. Ardolino said in a 1987 interview. "It's exciting, it's sexually charged, and I certainly wanted that on the screen."
In retrospect, Ms. Bergstein said, "So much of the movie is about the inner life of dance and how it makes you feel." During auditions she wore what she calls "sleazy, tarty clothes," as she and Mr. Ortega showed the young cast members the gyrations.
But what "Dirty Dancing" is really about goes well beyond dance. Ms. Bergstein still receives letters from people describing how "Dirty Dancing" affected their lives. What people refer to again and again, she says, is the scene in "Dirty Dancing" when Baby goes to Johnny's room and says that she's afraid of walking out of the room and never feeling the same again. "I think this is the dead center of the movie," Ms. Bergstein said, "that moment in your life when you move one way or another. If you focus your heart and your spirit, you can hold your life in your arms and make it do anything."
For most people associated with "Dirty Dancing," the film was a career-defining project. " 'Dirty Dancing' was what sent my career into hyperspace," said Mr. Swayze, a classically trained dancer who had made his film debut in "Skatetown U.S.A." in 1979 and had been featured in the epic Civil War mini-series "North and South" in 1984. He went on, of course, to break even more hearts in the hit 1990 film "Ghost."
BEFORE "DIRTY DANCING," Ms. Grey was best known as the malevolent sister in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Afterward, she was known everywhere as Baby, and that became both a blessing and a curse for her. "I became recognizable, known and loved by so many people," she said. "I didn't look like a movie star. I had a Jewish nose. People loved seeing that."
"But I was never that character," she continued. "I was not a virgin; I hate to admit it. I also could dance. I was kind of a daddy's girl, though. The curse was that people think I was that character, and I'm not."
As sexy as "Dirty Dancing" is -- "I've had mothers from all over the world happily say, 'You're the reason my daughter lost her virginity,' " Mr. Swayze said -- earlier versions of the film had more nudity and sex. But test screenings of those versions did not go that well, Ms. Bergstein said: audiences were "a little uncomfortable." The first two times the Motion Picture Association of America panel saw it, the film was rated R, even after the nudity had been cut. "Even with the actors' clothes on, the movie aroused people, because dance is arousing," Ms. Gottlieb said.
The filmmakers also excised one profane exclamation and another line of dialogue, and on their third try, they won a PG-13 rating.
The film's sexual electricity was certainly important to its success, but today most of the principals don't believe that it was sex that made "Dirty Dancing" such a phenomenon. Mr. Swayze has a theory that he posits in this way: "The folkie Jewish girl gets the guy because of what's in her heart."
Ms. Bergstein thinks along the same lines, but phrases it in a broader way. "You can see it as a girl's fairy tale," she said. "You see a boy across the room, you get to dance with him, you get to make love with him, then you get to dance with him in front of your parents."
And, naturally, there was the music. Among a couple dozen songs, there was Otis Redding's "Love Man," Bruce Chanel's "Hey Baby" and the Contours' "Do You Love Me?" Ms. Bergstein, who wrote the script as she listened to music, sent out cassettes along with her screenplay.
Several songs were written for the movie, including the Grammy-winning "(I've Had) the Time of My Life," sung by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, and "She's Like the Wind," written and performed by Mr. Swayze. In November 1987, the soundtrack surged to No. 1 on Billboard's pop-music chart, ahead of Bruce Springsteen's "Tunnel of Love" and Michael Jackson's "Bad." The first album has sold nearly 35 million copies, and "Dirty Dancing II," an album of more songs from the soundtrack, has sold 9 million; neither has been out of release.
There has long been talk of a "Dirty Dancing" sequel, with more scripts than Mr. Swayze can recall. Most unfortunate, he says, is one that has Johnny Castle working on a cruise ship. To Mr. Swayze's mind, that and other proposed ideas "miss the boat entirely."
"Now that Emile's dead," he said, "we would have to do something that could touch people in a new way."
Ms. Grey said of a sequel, "I would love to do one, but only if it made sense."
Nobody has any idea how the re-release will fare. But then, 10 years ago, nobody had any notion that they had a major hit on their hands. "With the re-release," Mr. Swayze said, "I wonder again, Do you think it really could do anything at the box office?"

Elizabeth, Once Retail Wasteland, to Get Huge Mall

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
ONCE a retail no man's land, the northeastern corner of Elizabeth will by the turn of the century get a large mall that will be a neighbor to what will by then be an expanded existing shopping center anchored by Ikea, the Swedish home-furnishings chain.
When the projects are completed, the area will have more than 2 million square feet of retail, entertainment and hotel space, including the expanded center, covering more than 200 acres of former industrial land and a municipal landfill. 
 "These projects have all the makings to turn the area into a retail metropolis," said Donald E. Goncalves, a Union County Freeholder as well as project coordinator at the Elizabeth Economic Development Corporation.
The private, nonprofit organization helps the city in its development efforts.
Ikea was the first to prove the area's retail potential. It opened a 268,244-square-foot store on 21 acres there in 1990, betting that the site's visibility from and access to Exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike, along with its proximity to Newark International Airport, would pay off.
It did. The store draws more than two million visitors a year.
Since then, Ikea has bought 25 acres of adjacent land and built 285,000 more square feet of space, which was leased to retailers that complement its store. The complex, called Elizabeth Center, also contains a 100,000-square-foot building occupied by a Toys "R" Us Kids World.
Another building, with 185,000 square feet, housed an Incredible Universe store until last April built by the Tandy Corporation, parent of Radio Shack. The space is now being marketed.
Earlier this month, Ikea acquired a 38-acre parcel, of which 12 are developable, with the intention of increasing its store by 80,000 square feet and Elizabeth Center by up to 250,000 square feet, possibly including a multiscreen movie theater and a hotel. With the $55 million expansion, the center will sit on 58 acres and have more than 800,000 square feet of space.
Ikea purchased the latest parcel, as it did the earlier ones, from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The bistate agency took control of the entire 96-acre industrial site, once a municipal landfill, in 1981 and planned to develop an industrial park there. The remaining 12-acre parcel is dedicated to that use.
Next month, construction is to begin on a 1.2-million-square-foot mall just south of Elizabeth Center on some 110 acres near Newark Bay that also was a municipal landfill until 1972.
The project, called New Jersey Metromall and conceived three years ago, also has a new lead developer, the Glimcher Realty Trust of Columbus, Ohio, a national mall developer.
Glimcher, which became a real estate investment trust in 1994, reached a development agreement with the City of Elizabeth that was approved in June to build the $215 million mall.
An affiliate of the Southern California and Arizona Glaziers, Architectural Metal and Glass Workers Pension Plan -- which worked with the original land developer, OENJ Corporation of Elizabeth, to get the project to this point -- remains a limited partner in the venture.
All the necessary state and local approvals are in place and the environmental cleanup should be completed by next month. OENJ, which started in 1992 to redevelop the site, has sold its interest in the mall project.
But the company still owns 40 acres along the Newark Bay that it will develop, possibly with a marina, hotel and restaurants, among other uses, said Peter Aagaard, a principal.
Supporting the area's transformation, officials said, is the fact the projects sit within Elizabeth's Urban Enterprise Zone. Businesses in the zone get tax benefits and retailers can charge a 3 percent sales tax, instead of the normal 6 percent.
FOR Elizabeth, which missed the economic growth that took place in other urban areas during the mid-80's, the projects are good news.
"Elizabeth sat idly by in the 80's, but now it's our turn," Mayor J. Christian Bollwage said. The projects have already begun to spur other investment, he said, pointing out that 23 market-rate two-family homes have gone into construction near the retail projects in a neighborhood that has not seen such development in the past.
The retail projects will also bring jobs and tax revenue into the city. The mall alone is expected to create 1,600 construction jobs and 5,200 permanent jobs, as well as $4.6 million in annual tax revenue.
Each of the projects is moving ahead when New Jersey's economy is improving and the retail market is healthy, said Ted Kraus, who heads TKO Real Estate Advisory Group, a retail consulting firm in Mercerville. Rental rates have inched up, and the overall retail vacancy rate in the state is less than 5 percent, he said, cautioning, however, that with retailers continuing to open new stores there was the potential of a glut should the economy sour.
Mr. Kraus is optimistic about the Elizabeth projects. He cited the presence of Ikea as a huge anchor in a now proven location and the addition of Glimcher as a strong developer for the mall.
"They will have to work not to make the projects work," he said. "The biggest problem is traffic."
But road improvements to the Ikea site, on Center Drive and North Avenue, have been made to accommodate the expansion. Additionally, about $100 million in traffic improvements -- from ramps to an elevated roadway -- are to be made to link the mall site, off Kapkowski Road, to Exit 13A of the turnpike. Financing for that work will come primarily from the sale of taxable and tax-exempt bonds by the semi-autonomous New Jersey Economic Development Authority.
The bonds will be repaid through $8 million in annual payments in lieu of taxes the mall site is expected to generate, $53 million in equity from the developer and a special franchise fee on tenants who locate there. The bonds are expected to be sold by early this fall, when construction on the improvements will begin.
Work is under way on the expansion of the Ikea store and is to be completed in the fall of 1998, said Roy Perez-Daple, president of Ikea Center Urban Renewal Inc., the development arm of the international retailer, which is based in Denmark.
Mr. Perez-Daple said construction also would start next August on the 250,000 square feet of space planned for Elizabeth Center. He said plans called for three or four stores, with 35,000 to 40,000 square feet each, or smaller shops plus the movie theater and hotel.
"The idea," he said, "is to make the center a natural place to shop where people want to stay for longer periods of time and come back more often."
Mr. Perez-Daple said the Metromall project, which he believes will complement Elizabeth Center, would enhance that concept and increase the appeal of the region as a shopping destination.
 HERBERT GLIMCHER, chairman of Glimcher Realty Trust, said that the New Jersey Metromall was being designed as a fashion- and value-oriented outlet center with a strong entertainment component, including a movie theater. The company became involved in the project because the site was in a prime location in a densely populated area within the New York metropolitan region, Mr. Glimcher said. Some 63 million cars are said to pass the site each year.
Glimcher Realty Trust has a $1 billion line of credit for various projects, including New Jersey Metromall, with Nomura Capital Asset Management in New York.
When it opens in 1999, the mall as now envisioned will include 12 anchors and up to 200 smaller stores. Mr. Glimcher said leases had been signed with all the anchor stores, but declined to identify them.

A Renaissance, One Blossom at a Time

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
FANCY new road signs at the borders proclaim that you have just entered Newark: "Renaissance City." Frankly, this Renaissance allusion puzzles me, given the gap-toothed leer of junk-strewn lots and the fool's-gold flash of broken windshield glass that greet the eye.
A Newark-basher might crack that this Renaissance notion could only be an inside municipal joke, alluding to the fact that while schools wither and city officials are led from office with raincoats over handcuffed wrists, some City Council members are behaving like the Renaissance Medicis, in that they have commissioned artists to paint their portraits, to hang in the gallery among the generations of greats who preceded them in helping make Newark the city it is today. 
 But let's look beyond that. Let's note, for starters, that Newark still maintains a fine public library staffed by people who care about books and carry history in their heads. It should also be noted that that there are few Gothic cathedrals in America more beautiful than Newark's Sacred Heart. To see it in winter, with snow sifting through light off its great stone towers, or in spring, with a lake of cherry blossoms at its feet, is to think more kindly about Newark, butt of jokes, repository of so much that has gone utterly wrong with our cities, from within and without.
Because here and there, 30 years after the awful riots that burned so much hope and dignity out of Newark, a sonata sometimes does waft above the din. Sometimes, beauty and boldness manage to transcend the gloom. Here and there, flowers bloom.
This is a small account of one otherwise insignificant place: an acre of vacant land on which arsonists torched two houses many years ago on Halleck Street, just north of Broadway. A place where the word renaissance is not a joke, but a breath of life that comes out of rubble.
It's only an urban garden that some determined neighbors and schoolchildren brought to life from a dirty, junk-filled lot that had been used as an illegal dump site near their homes. It is one of many such gardens now blossoming on formerly vacant city lots, thanks to gardening experts who work with a Rutgers University urban program to supply the expertise. But some say the Halleck Street experiment is the among the finest. And attention should be paid.
On a hot Saturday morning in late summer, Nazly Lopez, who lives next door to this lot that neighbors now rent from the city for $1 a year, wiped her hands and showed a visitor the abundance that flourished in beds, clumps, rows and mounds at the feet of a small crowd of urban farmers. "Here we have three kinds of lettuce: iceberg, romaine and butternut," she said. "We have broccoli. There's four kinds of tomatoes. Hot peppers and regular peppers. Eggplant, watermelon, cantaloupe, sweet potatoes . . . "
"And corn," put in her daughter, Christina, 19, who was in charge of the corn patch, which she tends like a rose garden.
"Don't forget the flowers," added her husband, Carlos, a Newark illegal-dumping officer who cruises the city and works his sources like a modern Eliot Ness, tracking down people, many of them out-of-towners whose contempt for Newark is such that they regard it as a literal dump to dispose of household or industrial debris.
A firm believer that a lot strewn with debris causes neighborhood indifference toward crime, Mr. Lopez got the ball rolling. He and his neighbors pulled the land into shape, hauling out an amazing collection of junk, leveling the ground, cadging lawn mowers and supplies from local stores, and installing work tables, a hammock, some playground equipment, lights, an old drum barbecue, and a sound system that softly throbs with salsa music while the tomatoes redden in the sun and the mums and pansies blaze in weedless beds.
Mrs. Lopez and Elena Zanzo, both teachers at nearby Broadway Elementary School, enlisted 25 second- and third-graders as apprentice farmers. Skeptically, they planted seed. As they came back week by week, sprouts soon poked from the ground. The lesson, Mrs. Lopez explained, was that persistence, taking one firm step after another, brings results, in a garden and in life.
"Before, when you asked them where a tomato comes from, they said Pathmark," she said. "They never saw anything grow before and really didn't believe it would work. When things did come up, you could see in their faces a realization -- an accomplishment."
Her husband wiped his brow and brushed past a stuffed scarecrow that had a sign around its neck saying: "Just one person makes a difference." A little sheepishly, he said, "I never liked to get my fingernails dirty before."

Heart in White Plains?
What do White Plains and San Francisco have in common? Plenty, according to a survey of 145 cities. 
 In terms of cost of living for a businessman, the Corporate Resources Group of Geneva placed the City of a Thousand Stores almost on a par with San Francisco.
Comparing food, clothing, beverages, household supplies and equipment, personal care, automobiles, leisure and entertainment and housing costs, the two cities are similar, with White Plains ranking as the 75th most expensive in the United States and San Francisco as the 71st.
Rehan Mustafa, an analyst for the consultants, said the two cities were almost identical when the costs of home services, like cleaning and baby-sitting, are compared. The cost of housing in San Francisco, however, was much higher.
Comparing costs in cities throughout the world, the survey found that White Plains and Nairobi, Kenya, were the same -- just after Guatemala City.
Tokyo topped the list as the most expensive city, with Hong Kong, Moscow and Osaka close behind.
New York City ranked 31st -- up from 38th six months ago. Elsewhere in United States and Canada, low inflation and no exchange rate variation resulted in North American cities remaining steady and among the most affordable.
 
Not Judge O'Rourke Yet
The State Assembly earlier this month pushed aside Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal to create 14 new judgeships -- on the surface thwarting County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke's most recent chance for a career move. But there is still hope, according to the latest word out of Albany.
The State Senate approved the measure, but the Assembly chose not to vote on it at the close of the Legislative session early this month. But as Charles Carrier, a spokesman for State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said, "It ain't over, as they say."
Mr. Carrier added: "There is still time to do this. It's under discussion."
Mr. O'Rourke, who has decided not to run again for County Executive after 15 years in office, acknowledged in an interview last spring that he was stepping down, in part, because he wanted to be a judge.
It has been an elusive goal for the Republican politician. In 1991, Mr. O'Rourke was nominated by President Bush for a seat in Federal District Court in Manhattan, but the nomination stalled in the Senate as Democrats sensed a Presidential victory by Bill Clinton. In 1993, the nomination was revived by Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, but Mr. O'Rourke, at his party's urging, said he would run once again for County Executive.
 
Sex-Abuse Acquittal
Randall Forrest, a former dean at Woodlands High School in Greenburgh, has been acquitted of sexually abusing a 17-year-old student. In a non-jury trial, Justice Harold Klein of Greenburgh Town Court ruled earlier this month that there was insubstantial evidence to convict the former high school administrator.
Mr. Forrest, a well-respected educator who had been with the district for 24 years and who was in charge of disciplining students, was charged in February 1996 with molesting the female student and threatening to suspend her if she did not comply with his sexual demands. The student had allegedly been sent to Mr. Forrest's office for cutting classes.
John Mangialardi, Mr. Forrest's lawyer, said after Mr. Forrest was arrested that he was the victim of "unsubstantiated allegations by an unhappy student."
The plaintiff had twice tried to tape record the dean, but the pause button was on the first time and voices were muffled the second time because the recorder was in her purse, the court was told.
Mr. Forrest of New Rochelle is the father of two grown children and is also a grandfather. He was reassigned to another job after his arrest. He retired seven months ago.
 
Gun License Law
Under a measure approved by the State Legislature this month, owners of pistols and revolvers in Westchester must renew their permits every five years, and new handgun owners must take a safety course.
"Car owners have to re-register, so why not gun owners," said State Assemblyman James G. Pretlow, who sponsored the measure. And he said that drivers also have to pass a competency exam to qualify for a license.
Under the current permit system, owners are issued licenses for life. Mr. Pretlow said that because there are no renewal requirements, the County Clerk's office does not know which gun owners have moved away or died.
Last year's murder of Michael Frey, an Eastchester policeman, by a gunman was in part responsible for Mr. Pretlow's most recent efforts on behalf of the permit-renewal law, even though the sniper used a rifle.
If the bill is signed by Gov. George E. Pataki, Westchester will join New York City and Suffolk and Nassau Counties in mandating permit renewals. Currently, such laws are passed on a county-by-county basis.
 
Patrick McNeill Fund
The parents of Patrick J. McNeill, the Fordham University student who was found dead in the East River on April 7, have established a scholarship fund to help college-bound students from Port Chester High School, especially those planning to major in criminal justice.
The fund, supported by individual donors, families, municipal employees and service clubs, is being administered by the nonprofit Westchester Community Foundation in White Plains.
The student, who was nearing his 21st birthday, was last seen alive on Feb. 16, leaving the Dapper Dog bar in Manhattan, where he had gone with friends. He was a junior at Fordham, studying accounting. He grew up in Port Chester, the second of three children, and was captain of the Port Chester High School football team.
"Patrick's values and aspirations and our appreciation for the community can and will continue through this fund to help other young people's lives," said Patrick McNeill Sr., a Highway Department foreman for the village of Rye Brook, who organized teams to knock on doors, visit shops, stop in hospitals and check out subway stations and homeless shelters in an effort to find his son.
Tax-deductible donations may be sent to the Westchester Community Foundation/Patrick McNeill Scholarship, 470 Mamaroneck Avenue, Suite 304, White Plains, New York, N.Y. 10605.
The number to call for more information is 948-5166. ELSA BRENNER

Two Sides of One Mind: Works in Wood and on Paper

 BODY:
STUDIES . . . consistently show that young women receive higher average grades than young men in every subject area in high school and college, but lower average S.A.T. scores by approximately 60 points. The S.A.T. has only one major purpose -- the prediction of first-year college grades. . . .
Although the score gap between the sexes has been called a "slight underprediction" by the test publisher, it limits women's educational opportunities in three important ways. By underpredicting their academic performance, the S.A.T. affects their chances to gain entrance to nearly 1,600 colleges and universities which require S.A.T. scores or use them as cut-off scores. Unfairly low test scores also become a self-fulfilling prophecy, causing young women to lower their expectations and apply to less competitive colleges and universities than their grades would warrant. . . . 
 Lower test scores also exclude high school girls from academic enrichment programs and accelerated courses where S.A.T. scores determine admissions. . . .
Using biased tests has a severe economic impact on women who lose millions of dollars in merit scholarship awards. . . . The National Merit Scholarship Corporation, which offers the most prestigious awards for academic excellence, selects its semifinalists solely on the basis of P.S.A.T. scores, which have a gender gap similar to the S.A.T. In 1989, only 32 percent of the National Merit semifinalists were women.
All these factors contribute to a real dollar loss for women in later life as they get less prestigious jobs, earn less money and have fewer leadership opportunities. Of course, their loss of self-confidence cannot be measured in financial terms.

Floating Hospital Is at Sea in the Search for a Pier

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
The Floating Hospital is a New York institution that has provided the city's poor and sick with medical and dental treatment as well as sunshine and fresh air for 130 years. It is also an institution with a problem: Facing eviction from its East River berth, it has nowhere to go.
Moored at Pier 11, just below Wall Street, the barge Lila Acheson Wallace is the fifth vessel to be called the Floating Hospital. Despite its name, it is actually an outpatient center, offering health care and other services to roughly 15,000 poor and homeless people annually, on the boat and at outreach centers, said its executive director, Kathleen Lopez. Every summer Friday, the Wallace, which has no engine, is pulled by a tugboat around New York Harbor, a respite for needy families from the city's heat. 
 But Pier 11, structurally unsound, is soon to be demolished by the city and rebuilt as a commercial ferry site. The barge has to move, and its choices are limited. On the West Side, the Hudson River Park Conservancy has identified Pier 54, at West 12th Street, as a possibility, but that would require approval from Community Board 2, which could take years. And Ms. Lopez said the hospital, with a $2.8 million annual budget, cannot afford to install electricity there.
While the hospital might return to Pier 84, at 44th Street, where it was docked in the 1980's, Ms. Lopez said that location is too crowded. She prefers that the barge remain right where it is. "I'd love to stay at Pier 11," she said. "It's like home." Many of its major supporters, like the New York Stock Exchange, are nearby.
A spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, Bernadette O'Leary, said her agency is "making every effort to find a suitable spot for this very important facility," but she would not guarantee its return to the rebuilt Pier 11.
So Ms. Lopez keeps looking, and hoping.As do clients like Marie Ocasio, 35, of Flushing, Queens, who went to the Floating Hospital after she took 10 nieces and nephews into foster care. Now she calls the barge her "second home." The children, she said, had been neglected by their parents and needed extensive medical and psychological help, which the hospital provided. Ms. Ocasio could not be more grateful and dreams of becoming "a rich woman, so I can give the hospital everything it needs." Perhaps even a pier of its own. BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Labor Showdowns: The Effect on Stocks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THE United Parcel Service is a private enterprise, but the strike there may lead some investors to wonder whether any public companies might also soon square off with labor -- and if so, what such disputes might do to their stocks.
There is no way to predict the future, of course, but after looking at the calendar of companies' contract negotiations with organized labor, economists and other analysts say that another serious strike is highly unlikely for at least the remainder of the year. 
 Although some labor contracts remain to be negotiated this fall -- a number of airlines have to come to terms with machinist and pilot unions, for example -- most private-sector collective bargaining has already been done. Further, 1997 was not a very active year: the U.P.S. contract, which covers more than 180,000 workers, is by far the largest.
And a number of heavily unionized industries, including steel, automobiles and railroads, are under contracts that run for another two to three years.
Still, as U.P.S. and representatives of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ended the week with a marathon negotiation session, the dispute has given organized labor an issue that resonates with the American public: the plight of part-time workers. And the strike, involving more workers than the 156,000 who walked off their jobs at AT&T in 1986, has raised a threat in the minds of the investing public for the first time in years, if not decades.
"For the most part, private-sector investors haven't had to pay much attention, because organized labor's strength has been declining for the past 25 years," said Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University and a former chief economist at the United States Department of Labor.
Last year, according to Labor Department data, private industry employed 9.4 million unionized workers, just over 10 percent of the nation's work force.
"Increasingly, it is state and local governments that are unionized, not the private work force," said David Wyss, director of research at DRI/ McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting service.
Nevertheless, contract negotiations "are always something to worry about," Mr. Wyss added.
"Currently, with labor markets so tight, the questions have more to do with what the agreements will contribute to wage pressures, not other union concerns," he said.
WHATEVER the general outlook for labor disputes, what about the specific issues in the U.P.S. strike? Analysts said the two major bones of contention -- the company's desire to leave the teamsters' multi-employer pension plan and the teamsters' goal of converting 10,000 part-time positions to full-time ones -- were not likely to loom large in other labor negotiations.
"Many of the aspects of the U.P.S. strike are not going to be replicated elsewhere," Mr. Katz said. "Most companies are not involved in multi-employer pension plans, for example."
Representatives from organized labor disagree that the concerns are specific to U.P.S. And according to Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University, the unions have scored public relations points by highlighting the issue of part-time workers at the delivery service.
"Labor is getting some good press," he said, "and that could bolster their resolve in upcoming negotiations."
But as a practical matter, Mr. Ratajczak said, the issue of part-time workers is likely to be limited. "In general, unions are active in industries that have been shrinking their work forces, which means they have to protect those who are full-time employees," he said. Moreover, much of the growth in part-time work has been in industries that are not unionized, like high technology.
Thomas A. Kochan, a professor of industrial relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, said the symbolism of the part-time employment issue may be what is important.
"Workers and managers are learning from the public's reaction to the part-time issue that this is a source of tension," he said. "I think we will see companies begin to take another look at that issue, and ask themselves if they have as much to worry about in terms of a negative reaction, whether the workers are unionized or not."
And Deborah Dion, a spokeswoman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., made it plain that organized labor plans to push the issue further.
"We do not speak just for the union member," she said. "The part-time work issue will be a big one for us, regardless of whether our members are full-time or not."
In addition, Ms. Dion said, the A.F.L.-C.I.O, which has 78 affiliate unions and 13.1 million members, many in state and local government, plans to fight against any erosion in health care benefits, to "hold the line" on pensions, and to fight for what she characterized as "decent" wages.
IF push comes to shove on any of those -- or on any other -- issues and a labor strike ensues, the effect on a stock price can be hard to forecast.
In 1986, for example, AT&T's shares rose modestly during the communications workers' strike.
And since Aug. 1, the last day of trading before U.P.S. workers walked off the job, the price of Federal Express stock has increased less than 4 percent, to $65.3125 at Friday's close, despite a huge increase in the competing delivery company's business.
"A strike is not going to cause a company's stock price to plunge," said Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own stock market advisory firm. "Nor is a settlement necessarily going to be a plus. Issues like strikes, and sales or purchases of shares by management, are way down the list in determining a stock's value."
But Byron Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said investors should be concerned about the impact a U.P.S. settlement might have on wage costs throughout the private sector.
"Since the recession ended in 1991, management has gotten a disproportionate share of profit growth, because workers have been concerned about job protection," he said. "Markets have been looking for signs of higher inflation, and since labor represents about 70 percent of manufacturing costs, the importance of this strike will be if it is the first in a series of efforts by labor to be better compensated."

HEADLINE: The King of Posh

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
IF he were the head of an American company, many business school students would aspire to be him. As it stands, many of them probably do not even know his name.
Still fewer are familiar with the complex stories of how Bernard Arnault took control of an international chain of luxury goods stores, cowing his rivals in the process; got in the way of a merger of two British beverage giants; inserted himself into an ugly family battle for the heart of France's wine legacy, and weighed in on whether feathers and fake blood were proper ingredients in haute couture. 
 And that was just this year.
Mr. Arnault is the chief executive of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., the largest luxury products company in the world. Its brands range from Christian Dior to Moet & Chandon, from Louis Vuitton to Veuve Clicquot, to name just a few units of the $6 billion company.
As conversant in complicated balance-sheet maneuvers as he is in the nuances of French fashion, Mr. Arnault, 48, has built his business largely by mastering two worlds that few executives straddle comfortably. There are the products -- and all the silk, scents, celebrities and advertising that go into them -- and then there are the hardball negotiations that make the products his.
Consider the tie test.
When interviewing prospective LVMH executives, Mr. Arnault takes the candidates into a room with 100 neckties, some of them Dior, some of them from competitors -- some of them, at least in Mr. Arnault's opinion, downright gauche. They are told to choose 10.
"It is very interesting," Mr. Arnault said. "Some choose 10 ties that are really the worst. If he does that, then we move on to the scarves. If he is bad with the scarves, well, then he is really in a difficult position."
Should bad taste in neckwear really count against a man brought in to, say, crunch numbers for a multinational corporation? "It is like when you send someone to listen to a concerto and they don't feel anything," said Mr. Arnault, whose mother was a concert pianist and who still practices Chopin himself. "It is as if they can't tell the difference between the Berlin Philharmonic and the orchestra of Columbus, Ohio."
Given the juicy names in his portfolio and the controversial ways he acquired many of them -- his current attempt to out-duel Guinness and Grand Met in reshaping Europe's liquor industry is only his latest obdurate move -- the fact that Mr. Arnault is largely unknown in the United States reflects just how differently the French and Americans view their business elite.
In the United States, Bill Gates manages in certain circles to exude the sex appeal of, say, Brad Pitt, simply by virtue of his fat bank account and financial acumen. But in France, Catholic and Socialist tradition are the odd bedfellows that have joined in fostering disdain for the business class. And Mr. Arnault's hardball ways are particularly out of keeping with French hauteur, which has contributed -- along with decades of Government micro-meddling in industry -- to France's sluggish growth, high unemployment and squeamish participation in a globalizing economy. Only slowly are the French coming around to his ways.
"For a European, I have a U.S. approach," Mr. Arnault said in a recent interview -- one he resisted for several weeks. "That is, I face reality as it is and not as I would like it to be. I build for the long term."
Between his many acquisitions over the years and his recent overhauls of the French fashion houses of Christian Dior and Givenchy, Mr. Arnault has built himself into one of the most formidable forces in the world of luxury, a business that draws the lusting attentions of people across many slices of society.
The headline-grabbing bankruptcy of Barney's Inc., the crush of Japanese tourists searching Hong Kong for Gucci lug-soled shoes, the obsession with what celebrities wear to the Academy Awards and the cottage industry built around knocking off anything brand-named -- no matter how objectively unattractive the product -- all this underscores one thing: the toys of the rich fascinate. And they have made Mr. Arnault a very wealthy man.
In the last 13 years, he has built an empire out of companies he pried, for the most part, from the resistant grasps of others, one by one. But now has picked one of its most audacious fights, against bigger and tougher foes. This time, the furor is over Mr. Arnault's efforts to pare down his holdings in alcoholic beverages, LVMH's slowest-growing product line, rather than to add to his stable.
WHILE LVMH's liquor brands are patently luxurious -- names like Veuve Clicquot Champagne and Hennessy Cognac have graced honeymoons and power lunches for decades -- they are not nearly as profitable as bottles of perfume, which are cheaper to make and distribute.
Nor do they have as much potential for growth. The company's liquor sales shrank by 13 percent from 1992 to 1996, while sales of perfume and beauty products skyrocketed 65 percent and sales of luggage and leather goods almost doubled. The trend is continuing this year. Although LVMH's sales rose 55.4 percent in the quarter that ended on June 30, compared with the corresponding period a year earlier, those gains were largely from acquisitions and sales of leather goods; sales of Cognac and spirits, excluding Champagne, fell.
So it appears that Mr. Arnault's strategy is to tap the cash flow of his spirits business for acquiring new toys.
To meet that objective, he first must block the planned merger of two of the largest drink companies in the world, Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. and Guinness P.L.C., which in May announced their intent to combine into a $19 billion wine and spirits giant. Mr. Arnault, who has longstanding joint ventures with Guinness and is a shareholder in both companies, has no intention of letting the two marry and leave him at the altar, a lesser competitor.
What Mr. Arnault proposes instead is that Guinness, Grand Met and LVMH merge their drink businesses, with Grand Met spinning off its food entities -- including Burger King and Pillsbury -- and Guinness doing the same with its breweries. He would hold a 35 percent stake in the three-way merged company (which he refers to as Drinksco), in one stroke becoming a leading shareholder in the world's largest spirits company, eliminating some of his most fearsome competitors and removing the liquor monkey from LVMH's back.
"This is an investment he has had for a considerable time, and I suspect this particular one is closer to the end game," Mark Francis, a managing director in New York for UBS Securities, said of Mr. Arnault's liquor holdings. "Under this proposal, he will have a smaller investment in a much stronger and larger company, and have an elegant exit. Meanwhile, he is investing in other things."
So far, Guinness and Grand Met have officially told Mr. Arnault to buzz off, but the battle is far from over. Mr. Arnault has increased his holdings in Grand Met to 11.1 percent and decreased his position in Guinness to 11.47 percent -- enough to give him the 10 percent stake needed to call a special shareholder meeting in each company. He has also resigned from the Guinness board, threatened to end his many joint ventures with the brewer and begun lobbying Guinness and Grand Met institutional investors in London to look at the cost savings he says will follow from doing things his way.
In a recent telephone interview from the south of France, where he has holed up with his fax machine for August, Mr. Arnault stated his plans for LVMH in blunt, if broad, terms.
"We will have more brands five years from now," he said. "Luxury products, obviously, and also in the area of the distribution of luxury products."
And liquor? "I do not think you can get the same type of growth in wine and spirits that you can get in the luxury products," Mr. Arnault said. "But they have a good cash flow, and they give us stability in earnings." While luxury goods and fashion are growing faster, he said, they "are also a little bit more risky."
Many analysts question Mr. Arnault's ability to pull off the liquor merger. But all agree that he is unaccustomed to losing.
Mr. Arnault grew up in Roubaix, in northern France, where his family owned a construction company. He learned business at the knee of his grandfather and his father, but his passions were reserved for design and the arts.
"I have always been very interested in creativity," he said. "Even when I was working in construction, what I liked was to work with architects. I have always liked very much creators, and in luxury you are in a sense working with artists, those who have the capacity to transform creative ideas in reality."
Like many French business people, Mr. Arnault left France in the early 1980's, as the Socialist administration of President Francois Mitterrand came to power. In 1984, after a four-year year stint in New York running a real estate concern, Mr. Arnault returned to France. There, he soon brought one company after another under his hegemony, often by means similar to that of the snake in "The Little Prince" of Saint-Exupery: He charmed, seduced and, eventually, took a fatal bite.
With $15 million of his own cash, raised mostly through his real estate ventures, Mr. Arnault hooked up with Antoine Bernheim, a managing partner of the French bank Lazard Freres, to create the $80 million purse needed to buy Boussac, a bankrupt textile company.
(His relationship with Lazard may be cooling, some analysts surmise: the French bank is now representing Guinness in the merger with Grand Met.)
Although Mr. Arnault pledged to revive the ailing Boussac and keep its employees working, he ended up dismissing 9,000 workers and eventually unloaded its diaper and textile units. He retained the Boussac fashion house, Christian Dior, which lost money but which possessed Mr. Arnault's favorite quality: a name known around the world.
The next victim was Henri Racamier, then the chairman of LVMH. Mr. Racamier had invited Mr. Arnault to invest heavily in LVMH in 1987, largely as a way to get rid of a partner who ran the beverage side of the business.
Investing through a joint venture with Guinness, Mr. Arnault indeed disposed of the partner. But after accumulating a majority stake by exercising previously purchased warrants -- a first glimpse at his creative financing, which was unsuccessfully challenged in court -- Mr. Arnault got rid of Mr. Racamier, too.
That was a bitter blow to the man who had turned Louis Vuitton from a small family business into an international brand. In fact, many of Mr. Racamier's principles were adopted by Mr. Arnault for LVMH's growth: Keep products exclusive. Tap Asian markets, with their wealthy consumers. And never become No. 2.
Those rules guided Mr. Arnault as he swept up companies that had clear synergies with LVMH: the fashion houses of Christian Lacroix, Givenchy and Kenzo; the leather goods companies Loewe, Celine and Berluti; the jewelry company Fred Joailler; and retailers of luxury goods like DFS Group, the world's biggest duty-free chain, and Sephora, a recently acquired French chain of perfume stores. The retailers hawk his perfumes; his fashion companies share production and distribution facilities.
He finds financial synergies, too. Analysts say Mr. Arnault has created several holding companies for the brands and has floated debt and equity alike off various units to fuel the interests of others.
DIVIDING and conquering is not his favorite mode of business, Mr. Arnault said, but it is clear that he is willing to resort to it.
Last spring, he acquired a majority share of San Francisco-based DFS against the furious and litigious opposition of two of the four owners -- Anthony M. Pilaro, an American lawyer, and the flamboyant financier Robert W. Miller. The two men's partners wanted to sell out; they didn't, and they lost. Mr. Miller still holds more than 38 percent of the company.
Not missing a beat, Mr. Arnault recently took up with one set of feuding cousins divided over the fortunes of Chateau d'Y'quem, perhaps France's finest maker of white wines. While family members argued and literally came to blows over the future of the business, Mr. Arnault acquired the majority position in the company. That acquisition is now tied up in court.
Elegant perfumes, supple leather handbags, expensive gowns that are worn but once -- this is the stuff that thrills Mr. Arnault. He is deeply interested in how such goods are packaged and advertised, and where and how they are sold. While his divisional presidents are all quick to commend Mr. Arnault for granting them autonomy, it is clear that he is also a keen observer of the minutiae.
Robert L. Brady, the president of LVMH's Parfums Givenchy U.S.A., recalled a recent trip Mr. Arnault made to New York. The two men visited the cosmetics section of a store that Mr. Arnault had seen six months earlier.
"He looked at the space and location that my company had in this store, and then looked at a sister company's space and location," Mr. Brady said. "He immediately recognized that we had picked up more space and the sister company had not. I mean, it was a matter of feet.
"To me that was incredible," Mr. Brady added. "This man is all over the world and only visits periodically, is not engaged on a daily basis, but he recognized something that was very subtle."
Mr. Arnault's acumen is not perfect. Some people close to LVMH recall that Mr. Arnault took a hard look at Gucci before Investcorp, a Bahraini investment bank, began acquiring it in stages in 1991. "Arnault did tons of due diligence," one person close to the situation said. " But he backed off. He said the brand would never go anywhere."
Oops. Gucci brought in the American designer Tom Ford to freshen its image. Distribution was severely rolled back to restore the brand's exclusivity. Investcorp took the company public at $22 a share in October 1995, and made a bundle in a secondary offering in March 1996; it closed on Friday at $59.75.
Mr. Arnault said he did not want to comment on Gucci, but it is clear that he followed a brand restoration similar to Investcorp's with Christian Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton.
Last year, for example, French runway-watchers wilted into their fluttering fans as Mr. Arnault installed Alexander McQueen -- a 27-year-old British designer celebrated as much for design tricks like striping jackets and shirts red to resemble bloodstains as for his fine cutting abilities -- at Givenchy's helm.
Dior was placed in the hands of John Galliano, another Briton, who once stood up the Queen for dinner and whose eccentric designs -- and personal eccentricities -- are a far cry from the stuffy traditions of French fashion.
And Mr. Arnault has enlisted yet another foreigner -- the American sportswear designer Marc Jacobs -- to create Louis Vuitton's first ready-to-wear collection.
Vogue's editor in chief, Anna Wintour, said of Mr. Arnault: "He is backing designers from everywhere, and God knows he is a force to be reckoned with. He has taken the most incredible risks in the designers he hired for what were very conservative houses. And he has brilliantly understood the power of their magnetism with the press."
But Mr. Arnault, a slight man who wears fine suits but will never be the subject of a men's fashion spread, wants no part of the press crush for himself. He attends fashion shows, but sits quietly, inviting the paparazzi to focus elsewhere. While he has homes in St.-Tropez and one of the best neighborhoods in Paris, he does not offer celebrity-encrusted parties. In photographs, he often appears grim and slightly unnerved.
"I like the attention on my products, not on me," Mr. Arnault said. Indeed, he seems to understand that getting Nicole Kidman into a Dior dress is as crucial, in its way, to his company's success as successfully bringing off the most complicated convertible bond offering.
"What is very important is the image of our brands," Mr. Arnault said. "Our products are about making people dream. We take it really seriously."
AMONG the places Mr. Arnault has taken those dreams is Asia, where he has heavily marketed his spirits businesses for years. In 1996, LVMH bought Celine, the French leather goods company, in part because he was impressed with the locations of its stores in Japan. Growth plans for Sephora, too, in large part focus on the Pacific Rim.
In all this, he has been a pioneer among French executives. "More and more the French are trying to get to Asia, but they still have a pathetically small presence there," said Paul Horne, chief international economist in Paris for Smith Barney. "It is a long way away, and they don't speak French there."
Mr. Arnault's role as renegade entrepreneur has its contradictions. He has breathed life into French luxury brands, but installs etrangers to manage many of them. He raids American-style, but he hews to the French executive's way of life, in which the arts and leisure are as important as business.
"He is 100 percent capitalist in a country that has never accepted capitalism," said one person who worked for several years with Mr. Arnault in Paris and spoke on the condition of anonymity. "And he has rubbed everybody in the wrong way. He comes across as guy who is torn over being nice and being awful."
Mr. Arnault's enemies have complained bitterly -- and, for the most part, not for attribution -- that he treats those who get in his way with little compassion. His divisional managers acknowledge his toughness, but say he is swift to reward good performance.
"He has always been a gentleman and courteous to me," said Mr. Brady, the perfume executive. "But I have always made my numbers. Do you think there is a correlation?
"One man's perspective on ruthlessness," he added, "is another man's perspective on efficiency."
Mr. Arnault denies that he is ruthless at all. "I don't fire people quickly," he said. "On the contrary, I try to keep my people motivated."
Most shareholders probably could care less if he is nice, as long as the stock rises.
For the last 18 months, the company's American depository receipts have hovered between the mid $40's and the mid $50's on the New York Stock Exchange. Each A.D.R. represents one-fifth of a share on the Paris Bourse; the A.D.R.'s closed on Friday at $47.25, or 17 percent below their 52-week high, as the market has punished his increased position in Grand Met. At a price-to-earnings ratio of 27, many American and European analysts agree that the securities are expensive.
LVMH faces risk on all fronts, from the softening spirits business to a slowdown in luxury sales as weakness persists in the Japanese yen. And many in the markets doubt that the menage a trois with Guinness and Grand Met will ever come to fruition: there are huge tax implications, the British companies are not likely to cotton to Mr. Arnault's big ownership stake and, so far, other big holders are not lining up behind him.
"What he has done makes no sense," complained one institutional investor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "If he is not interested in the food business, why has he taken such an interest in Grand Met? It doesn't fit, other than he thought it would force the hand of Grand Met and Guinness. But he is appearing more like a financial operator driving a hard bargain than a man with a vision for LVMH."
Yet according to John Ford, portfolio manager and vice president of the T. Rowe Price International Stock fund, which owns LVHH shares, any move that focused LVMH on luxury products and companies that distribute them would ultimately be advantageous.
"From shareholders' perspective, the more capital they put in luxury, the better," he said. "Arnault is trying to address the returns on a lower return area, which is good news. And if he extricates himself from that area, well, that would be good news, too."

As Inventories Rise, Will There Be a Ripple Effect?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LARGELY ignored in the latest blizzard of economic figures was one indicator that is notoriously hard to interpret but that by autumn could be on every investor's lips. Inventories.
After rising a hefty $64 billion in the January-to-March quarter, the Commerce Department initially estimated that inventories jumped another $67 billion during the spring. But now, because of a huge upward revision for June, inventories appear to have swelled far more, enough to raise the economy's growth rate for the quarter to perhaps 3 percent from the 2.2 percent the Government estimated at the end of July. 
 The sum "will be upped to about $95 billion, which would be a record rate of inventory accumulation" for a quarter, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. And this, he contended, has "crucial negative implications" for the economy for the rest of 1997. Stock market implications, however, are less clear, even if he is right.
The theory is straightforward. When goods pile up excessively on store shelves -- and in warehouses and factory yards -- this costly situation must be redressed sooner or later. This, by ripple effect, means production is cut back and economic growth sags -- or even disappears.
Often, a huge stockpile "eventually sows the seeds of a slowdown," said Richard D. Rippe, senior economist at Prudential Securities.
In practice, though, it is often difficult to tell to what extent mounting inventories reflect a retrenchment by consumers or justified confidence by companies that they will be able to sell larger volumes of goods.
Or, for that matter, if inflation is in the air, inventories may rise because businesses are buying heavily before prices go up.
A significant clue, of course, is how well sales are keeping up with inventories, which now total a cool $1 trillion, or about 15 percent of the country's total annual production, including services.
By this gauge, there may be little to worry about so far. The inventory-to-sales ratio was 1.37 in June, the same as in May, and down slightly from the 1.39 that prevailed a year ago. The trouble is, this ratio -- telling how many months it would take to exhaust stockpiles at the current level of demand -- is officially designated a lagging indicator, meaning that it tends to move only after the economy does.
And some analysts suspect that production curtailments have already started. Industrial output has risen at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent over the latest three months, less than one-third the pace of the three months through April, according to the Federal Reserve.
Another clue to the meaning of rising inventories: the type of inventories involved.
In June, stockpiles of retailers and manufacturers expanded by small fractions of 1 percent while those of wholesalers, which account for about one-quarter of the total, soared 1.9 percent, the biggest advance in 15 years.
This increase may reflect a surge of imports, spurred by the strong dollar, since imported goods tend to enter the country through middlemen. Except for foreign goods that compete directly with domestic ones, such inventories have a relatively small effect on the American economy. Cars, though, are imported in vast quantities.
For the retail sector, where June's overall inventory-to-sales ratio of 1.51 was the same as in May, the only businesses with possibly overstocked shelves are clothing stores and outlets selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes. Each averaged inventory increases of eight-tenths of 1 percent for each of the latest two months.
Some observers profess little concern about the inventory growth. "I see the inventories as a transitory phenomenon," said Richard B. Berner, economist at Mellon Bank.
Or as Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers put it, noting this summer's economic rebound: "With consumers bullish and interest rates stable, individual companies may not see any signal that the aggregate inventory situation is unsustainable."
But Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch frets that these mountains of unsold goods may act as a "drag" on the economy during the balance of 1997. And some evidence, like the apparent slowing of the increase in industrial output in the second quarter, might heighten such fears.
But even if high inventories do curtail economic growth, this doesn't mean the stock market will suffer. Stock prices, a component of the index of leading indicators, traditionally have predicted the economy, not the other way around. Also, if the economy slows interest rates would likely come down, providing that inflation doesn't rise. That would be good for stocks.
Still, for those concerned about an overhang of inventories, there are certain things to do. One is to invest in industries whose output can't be stockpiled, such as banking or airlines. Another is to pay more attention to the top line of corporate reports, which shows total revenue, while keeping a close watch on the bottom line.
When a company is about to be buried by inventories, Mr. Rippe said, "the first hint is that sales disappoint."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Let's Just Close the Market On Fridays

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Maybe there was pent-up selling, just waiting for lower tax rates.
Or maybe valuation suddenly matters. 
 Or maybe only the bulls can afford to take long summer weekends, leaving the bears in charge on Fridays.
The most remarkable thing about the slide in stock prices that began a day after President Clinton signed the tax bill is that it has been accompanied by an unrelenting stream of good economic news. Is the market worried about inflation? The latest inflation reports are the best in memory. Is it worried about a recession? All the economic news looks good, but not so good that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise long-term interest rates. And bond prices actually rose last week.
Those looking for fundamental reasons for the market turmoil can point to the currency market, where the collapse of the Thai baht had roiled Asian markets this summer and increased volatility around the world. But it is not easy to explain how that has hurt American stock prices.
So why sell?
David Shulman, Salomon Brothers' chief equity strategist, points out that the latest tax cut is the largest since 1981, when capital gains taxes were also cut. And, he notes, the stock market swooned in the days after President Reagan signed that bill, falling almost 10 percent in less than a month. The performance after the signing of this year's tax bill is similar so far. Of course, there were far fewer profits available for taking in 1981, when the Dow was lower than it had been five years earlier.
This column, we note with humility, had opined that this time would be different, because even a 20 percent capital gains tax rate would not be attractive to a new crop of investors who have learned that prices can only go up, at least in the long term. Now we will see whether proof that prices can go down, at least in the short term, will stimulate selling. Or whether the public will once again buy on weakness, as it has done repeatedly in the last seven years.
The Dow's performance -- a fall of 4.2 percent in a week and 6.8 percent since the Aug. 6 peak -- badly overstates the damage that has been done so far. Just as most investors did not do as well as the Dow on the way up, few have done as badly as the Dow on the way down.
Across all American markets last week, about three stocks rose for every four that declined. Not exactly a rout. And far more stocks hit 52-week highs than reached annual lows.
The selling has been concentrated in some of the stocks that went up the most. Coca-Cola is down 19 percent from its peak, but is still selling at 36 times its historical earnings. Gillette, Friday's disaster du jour, is at 46 times earnings even though it, too, is off 19 percent from its peak. Clearly, if valuation concerns start to become important, as they have not been lately, some stocks could have a lot further to fall. But there have been earnings-related selloffs in many stocks over the last year, even as stock indexes zoomed higher and higher.
The summer Friday theory is the most attractive one, if only because there are just two more Fridays before Labor Day ends the summer vacation season. The Dow is down 201 points, or 2.5 percent, since July 4. But that is because it has slumped on five of the six Fridays in July and August, losing a cumulative 528 points on Fridays -- almost half of which came this week. Perhaps all would be well if stocks were not allowed to trade on Fridays.

Why Labor Feels It Can't Afford to Lose This Strike

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
FOR years American workers have grumbled about downsizing, the rise in part-time and temporary jobs, and the trend toward businesses offering fewer workers health insurance and pensions. But they did little to protest that cost-cutting -- until now.
The mighty International Brotherhood of Teamsters, in its strike against the United Parcel Service, has mounted the first crusade against what many economists call "the contingent economy," and what many business critics call corporate America's scaling back of its responsibilities to employees. 
 But while the teamsters' labor allies praise the union for fighting for more full-time jobs with full benefits at U.P.S., some labor experts say that if the teamsters win big, victory could be a mixed blessing.
On the one hand, a union victory would be an important signal that John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, has re-energized the labor movement, encouraging some of the 85 percent of the work force that isn't unionized to think more about joining.
On the other hand, even with a teamster victory, the strike could ultimately hurt job opportunities and job security at U.P.S., the world's largest package deliverer, and one with a good record in dealing with organized labor. If the teamsters achieve a big victory in terms of higher wages and greater restrictions on U.P.S.'s use of part-timers, that could push up the shipper's costs, pushing business even after the strike to competitors that are largely non-union (the major exception is the Postal Service) and that also rely on lots of part-time workers.
U.P.S. executives have repeatedly boasted that the company has been a job-creating machine over the last four years, adding 46,000 unionized jobs. But the teamsters complain that 38,000 of those new jobs were part-time, paying too little to support a family.
Last week, U.P.S.'s chairman, James Kelly, warned that the company would have to lay off 15,000 of its 185,000 teamster employees because of business lost from the strike. While teamster officials angrily called that warning an exaggeration and "intimidation," economists say that lost market share, and the accompanying loss of some jobs, is a result of many strikes.
"Every customer whose life has been turned upside down by the U.P.S. strike might think about using a shipper where there won't be strikes," said Paul Schlesinger, a transportation analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "If the strike slows the growth of the U.P.S. job machine, it's going to hurt the teamsters."
In addition, the increased wages and the restrictions on part-time jobs sought by the union could make U.P.S. less competitive against Federal Express, DHL Worldwide and other competitors, particularly in the overnight shipping business that U.P.S. has fought so hard to enter, and which is so dependent on part-timers.
Ever since U.P.S.'s teamster members walked out on Aug. 4, company officials have said that the union's demands would make the company uncompetitive and cost it customers. That suggested an analogy to the high wages of auto workers helping Japanese car manufacturers make huge inroads in the 1970's and 1980's, causing the loss of many auto workers' jobs.
 
Offering Part-Timers Hope
 In their defense, teamster officials say their wage demands are modest and should not cause U.P.S. to become uncompetitive, especially since the company's relatively high profit margins give it room to lower prices. In addition, teamster officials contend that their demands to restrict the number of part-time jobs shouldn't make the company less competitive than a prime rival like Federal Express, because while two-fifths of Federal Express workers are part-time, three-fifths of U.P.S. workers are.
Mr. Sweeney of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said the teamsters' focus on improving working conditions for part-timers might pressure other employers, unionized or non-unionized, to treat them better. Not surprisingly, he also said that the teamsters' fight, especially if victorious, would make more part-time workers interested in joining unions -- and more unions interested in organizing them.
"This has raised the level of focus on part-time workers and that's why companies that use a lot of part-timers, like Sears Roebuck, have been urging U.P.S. to hang tough," he said.
But some labor experts say Mr. Sweeney is overly optimistic if he thinks legions of part-timers will join unions in response to the strike. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 23.2 million Americans -- 18.3 percent of the work force -- work part time.
"Certainly a teamster victory would encourage part-time workers to be a little more interested in unions," said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University. "But part-time workers have a high turnover and have been very hard to organize historically. Even though the strike could improve labor's image, I wouldn't imagine many major incursions into the part-time market."
Another hope of labor is that a victory would encourage workers at Federal Express and other shippers to think that a union could help them. A big obstacle to organizing Federal Express, however, is its successful lobbying last year to be placed under the Railway Labor Act, instead of the National Labor Relations Act. Under the railway act, which generally covers airlines and railroads, a union can organize workers only by having representation elections for all of a company's workers at once, instead of conducting separate elections at individual sites. It would be a tall order to organize Federal Express's 110,000 workers all at once.
"I'm not sure precisely how a victory at U.P.S. would enable the teamsters to conquer Federal Express or U.P.S.'s other non-union competitors," said Melvyn Dubofsky, a labor historian at the State University of New York at Binghamton. "Symbolically, a teamsters victory would be very very important because so many of the other major labor battles of the past five or six years, like Caterpillar, were largely defeats."

HEADLINE: Arrest of Gang Gives Albanians Hope That Chaos Is Ending

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The last of the foreign troops who came to Albania to contain nationwide violence have now sailed off, leaving the country's new Government this week to fend for itself against armed gangsters and the effects of an economic meltdown.
So far so good, it seems. 
 The new Prime Minister, Fatos Nano, announced on Wednesday that 100 police commandos who descended on the port town of Vlore on Monday had arrested 30 members of an armed gang and had the gang boss, "Zani," cornered. Another 100 soldiers, about the only intact unit of the Albanian Army, have taken control of Vlore's harbor, the transit point to Italy for smuggling drugs and people, he said.
Since Vlore was the heart of a rebellion against the Government of President Sali Berisha, which was turned out of office in elections in June, Albanians are taking the restoration of order in the town as a harbinger of better times.
The State Department declared on Tuesday that Albania was safe enough for the return of embassy staff and other officials who were evacuated in mid-March. Even so, Mr. Nano, 45, the leader of the Socialist Party, acknowledged in an interview on Wednesday that it would not be easy to bring Albania even to a tenuous hold on normalcy, which it was struggling to achieve after the collapse of the grim Communist system seven years ago.
"To rebuild this country will take a long time but we have the mandate and the people support us," he said in the Prime Minister's office, a rare oasis of polished wood and soft carpet in a corner of a scruffy Government building. "People didn't vote left or right in the election. They voted for putting an end to all the primitive political history."
Albania erupted into armed chaos in March over the collapse of fraudulent pyramid investment schemes, which caused heavy financial losses for most households. More than 7,000 European troops were dispatched here to help calm the country and discourage Albanian refugees from pouring into Italy. The United States, in particular, was concerned that a weak Albania with a heavily armed population could be a destabilizing force in the rest of the Balkans.
The last of those troops pulled out early this week, but Italy plans to send back some 600 to help Albania with police and military training.
The worst fears -- that the chaos here would spread to Albanian communities in neighboring Macedonia and Kosovo, a part of Serbia -- have not been realized.
But the legacy of the violence and the economic losses has left Albania, Europe's poorest country, much poorer.
The pillaging went so far that gangs pulled up the rail track in northern Albania, loaded it onto trucks and sold it as scrap metal in neighboring Montenegro. Mr. Nano said he was staggered to learn from the Defense Ministry that 10.5 billion bullets had been stolen from Albania's armories, which were all now empty.
To receive financial support promised by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Mr. Nano said, his Government first had to restore a semblance of order. In addition, he said, the international community was demanding that the failed investment schemes be audited by a Western accounting firm to determine what happened to depositors' money.
Many financial experts have suspected that the schemes were fronts for criminal activities, and Mr. Nano said the auditors would try to find out whether there were "money laundering, illegal drugs or prostitution connections."

HEADLINE: Study Links Violence Rate To Cohesion In Community

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
The largest study ever undertaken of the causes of crime and delinquency has found that there are lower rates of violence in urban neighborhoods with a strong sense of community and values, where most adults discipline children for missing school or scrawling graffiti.
In an article published last week in the journal Science, three leaders of the study team concluded, "By far the largest predictor of the violent crime rate was collective efficacy," a term they use to mean a sense of trust, common values and cohesion in neighborhoods. 
 Dr. Felton Earls, the director of the study and a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the most important characteristic of "collective efficacy" was a "willingness by residents to intervene in the lives of children." Specifically, Dr. Earls said in an interview, this means a willingness to stop acts like truancy, graffiti painting and street-corner "hanging" by teen-age gangs.
What creates this sense of cohesion is not necessarily strong personal or kinship ties, as in a traditional village, said Robert Sampson, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the study. It does help if many residents in a neighborhood own their homes or have lived there for a long time, Mr. Sampson added.
But cohesion, or efficacy, seems to be still another quality, Mr. Sampson suggested, "a shared vision, if you will, a fusion of a shared willingness of residents to intervene and social trust, a sense of engagement and ownership of public space."
The finding is considered significant by experts because it undercuts a prevalent theory that crime is mainly caused by factors like poverty, unemployment, single-parent households or racial discrimination.
These problems do play a role, according to the new study. But some neighborhoods in Chicago are largely black and poor, yet have low crime rates, it found -- so some other explanation is needed for the causes of crime.
The study has been conducted in all areas of Chicago since 1990 as part of a major continuing research program known as the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. It was financed at first by the MacArthur Foundation and the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department, and now also has financing from the National Institute of Mental Health and the United States Department of Education. The study, which has so far cost about $25 million, is scheduled to continue until 2003.
The research team selected Chicago as a site because its racial, ethnic, social and economic diversity most closely match those of the United States as a whole, Mr. Sampson said. For the study, Chicago was divided into 343 neighborhoods, and 8,872 residents representing all those areas have been interviewed in depth.
Among those neighborhoods with high levels of cohesion, the authors said, are Avalon Park, a largely black neighborhood on the South Side; Hyde Park, a mixed-race area around the University of Chicago, and Norwood Park, a white neighborhood on the Northwest Side.
The study at least indirectly contradicts the highly acclaimed work of William Julius Wilson, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who in a series of books, most recently "When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor" (Knopf, 1996), traces many of the troubles of poor black families in Northern cities to the disappearance of factory jobs as industries moved to the suburbs or overseas.
Both Dr. Earls and Mr. Sampson said they thought that the results of their study suggested that Mr. Wilson's argument was too narrow and did not account for the differences in crime they found in largely black neighborhoods. Still, Professor Sampson acknowledged, concentrated poverty and joblessness "make it harder to maintain" cohesion in a neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Chinese Happily Break the 'One Child' Rule

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

DATELINE: DAZU, China

 BODY:
At the end of a summer's day, as a dusky light tinged the old wooden stools scattered around his open doorway, Li Feng gazed affectionately at his young daughter and son playing outside.
"I wanted at least two children," said Mr. Li, a soft-faced man whose work at a thriving cement-maker down the road now fills his day, and his pocket. "For eight years, we only had one. Now, if you can afford the fine, you can have an extra child." 
 Like untold millions of other parents, Mr. Li and his wife, Chu Lanping, are bending the rules of population control in China by having a second child. As townspeople, they were supposed to be content with one, but a little determination and a little more cash now win permission from local officials for one more.
In many parts of China, the one-child policy is melting away. The country's strict population control program, begun in the late 1970's and by no means gone, is becoming significantly looser in many places because -- as with so much in China today -- relentless economic growth is eroding the old system of control over ordinary people's lives, creating loopholes large and small.
Rather than spurring an explosive increase in the country's overall population, however, economic growth seems also to be reducing the number of children born to millions of other families, as they break out of the poverty that has traditionally encouraged childbearing. For every family like the Lis that has two children instead of one, there are other families in the countryside choosing to have two children instead of, say, five, and urban couples who are having none at all.
China's total population of 1.22 billion, the largest in the world, appears to be growing steadily each year at just over 1 percent, or about 13 million, and officials express confidence that they will stay well within their target of 1.3 billion by 2000. At the same time, demographers say that an unknown number of births go uncounted, leaving official statistics slightly unreliable.
In the past, local family-planning goals were sometimes enforced brutally. Forced abortions and sterilizations, while not the norm, were frequently reported in the early 1980's, especially in small villages where a local official wanted to show who was in charge.
It is that image of China that has provoked strong objection from religious and political groups in the United States, where thousands of Chinese apply for political asylum each year by asserting that being limited to one child is a form of political persecution.
 
Millions Now Having Multiple Children
Yet the worst excesses of local officials seem to have diminished in recent years, and millions of Chinese who want multiple children are now having them.
In a country where baby girls have traditionally been neglected or abandoned in favor of boys, reports that the one-child policy spurred the abandonment or even murder of baby girls caused great concern. Yet the current ratio -- 106.6 males for every 100 females in China -- is still lower than in 1930, when the ration was 108.5 males, or in 1953, when it was 107.6.
Worried that modern technology would allow couples to learn the sex of a fetus and abort females at a greater rate than males, Chinese officials banned the practice, though it may occur in some cases anyway.
The one-child policy is still strictly enforced in the nation's largest cities like Shanghai and Beijing, where penalties for having a second child remain onerous, like loss of a job and a fine equivalent to three years' salary for each parent.
It is in the medium-sized cities and towns like Dazu, tucked deep in China's interior in Sichuan Province, where things are changing.
Not long ago, local Communist Party officials wielded wide power over people's private lives, telling them when to marry, procreate or use contraception. Although local officials were judged in part by how well they adhered to family-planning goals, residents say the way they instilled fear and respect was at least as much about exerting personal authority as about enforcing national policies.
Nowadays, people like Mr. Li, who earns $100 a month at a private company instead of the $25 he used to make at a state-run factory, can deflect and ignore officials more easily because they no longer control his job, or his grain rations.
At the same time, as state subsidies to local governments dwindle, many local officials have turned to money-making and found it a better route to influence than the old way of cowing residents with threats and pressure. As a result, in countless towns and provinces, officials now accept a flat fee in exchange for permission to bear an extra child.
In the case of Mr. Li, a second child brought a fine of $1,200, a large but affordable sum because he borrowed from family members. Mr. Li, who said part of his desire for a second child was a wish for a son, said he faced none of the other pressure that used to accompany official efforts to discourage extra childbearing.
"They didn't try to talk us out of it," said Mr. Li, 32, referring to the local family-planning officials. "They just wanted to be sure we would pay the fine."
In other places, officials have aggressively encouraged residents to have a second or third child so fines could be imposed. The money collected belongs to the local government and so may sometimes be spent by the same officials who levy the fines.
In Mizhuang, a village in Henan Province, local officials encouraged several residents to have extra children so fines could be collected and then helped the pregnant women hide when national inspection teams came to check the population, a Chinese newspaper reported
"The town's family-planning association often told villagers to act this year because the fine might be increased in the future," said the newspaper Fortnightly Talks. "The phenomenon occurred not only in Mizhuang but in many other places, and the reason was simple: money."
 
A Shift in Enforcement Conceded by Officials
Officials at China's State Family-Planning Commission insist that the broader policy of strongly encouraging population control has not changed and that "money for children" cases are discouraged. But they say the Government's approach to enforcement has shifted over the last five years.
"You can't simply threaten people anymore; you have to try to persuade them," said Wang Guoqiang, director of the Policy Legislation Department at the State Family-Planning Commission in Beijing. "Relations between the local government and the people are changing greatly, and this is precisely why we are changing our methods."
Chinese leaders recognize, Mr. Wang said, that rural families producing the most children -- traditionally, the only form of social security -- are often farmers who would benefit from low interest loans and other economic assistance.
"Only economic development is going to control population growth," Mr. Wang said flatly. "Even if we wanted to make every family have only one child, it would be impossible."
The hordes of migrant workers who travel to find work outside their home areas also pose a tremendous challenge to China's population planners. Living outside the old Communist social system, these migrants -- officially estimated at more than 100 million -- are difficult to keep track of.
Although most migrants are men who leave home with the sole purpose of making money, untold numbers are couples who have extra children away from the prying eyes at home.
"So many people know how to work around the system that it's impossible to block them from having children if they really want to," said an American academic who has studied population control in China for more than 10 years. "The system cannot keep up with all these people."
He Gong, who runs a fruit stand with his wife and five children in the southern city of Haikou, on Hainan Island, said he left his home in a nearby province eight years ago after being fined and punished there, but had never had any dealings with family-planning officials in his new home.
"We wanted more children," said Mr. He, a balding man with a wide smile. "Even if we had to move, it was worth it."
It is impossible to measure how much families like Mr. He's migrate for the purpose of having extra children, because most are technically living illegally in their new residences -- another sign of the old system breaking down.
Yet the notion of traveling families gained wide currency a few years ago when a skit was performed on the Chinese New Year celebration on television, the most-watched program of the year, with 600 million estimated viewers.
The skit coined the term "population guerrillas" for a family that moved all over China to avoid family planning officials, naming each child after a different residence. True or not, many Chinese seem to believe that there are millions of "population guerrillas" at work.
In fact, enforcement of China's population control program varies from province to province and town to town. Many rural areas have never been able to keep families from having two, three or four children, while in others officials have been quite strict.
Typically, however, women have been encouraged to get an intra-uterine device after giving birth to a first child, and to be sterilized after a second birth. Many exceptions are made, for ethnic minorities or fishing families claiming they need many hands or families whose first child is handicapped.
Judith Banister, who until recently headed international programs at the United States Bureau of the Census and now teaches at the University of Science and Technology in Hong Kong, argues that urban areas can afford some relaxation of the one-child policy precisely because they have been so successful since 1980 that the population has become distorted, with many more people in their 20's than in their teens.
"The one-child policy in general has worked very well in large cities," Dr. Banister said. "China can afford some loosening."
In Shanghai, where the penalty for an unauthorized second child is a fine three times the annual salary of the father and mother, more residents have died than have been born in the last three years.
This negative population growth spurred some officials to suggest abandoning the one-child policy, though that option was rejected, said Jin Xuegong, a senior official at the Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission.
For one thing, it is only negative population growth on paper, since in the same period the migrant population of Shanghai has swelled to nearly 4 million, none of them counted among Shanghai's 14 million legal residents.
But in Mr. Jin's opinion, since many young urban couples are choosing not to have any children at all, it is unlikely there would be a huge population surge even if the policy was loosened more.
"Even I wonder if it's worth having a single child," said Mr. Jin, who explained that he was having a hard time at home with his 15-year-old son. "He doesn't do any housework, he won't obey orders, he doesn't study."
 
So Routine a Matter, Couples Know the Fines
In many other cities and towns, however, having a second child is becoming so routine that residents know exactly what the fine is in different areas.
In Anhui, a populous province in central China, couples who have a second child are typically fined $400.
In Guangdong, the only province where everyone living in the countryside is automatically allowed to have a second child, the fines are higher. In Guangzhou, a prosperous city near Hong Kong, the current fee is $1,500. In nearby Dongguan, a medium-sized city, it is $1,000.
Mr. Wang, the family-planning official in Beijing, acknowledged that there are many known cases, especially in southern China, where rich businessmen deliberately have second, third and fourth children by different women, as a way of displaying wealth and position through traditional means.
All of this raises the question of how accurate China's population statistics are. Demographers like Dr. Banister say that unreported births represent a small percentage of the overall population growth each year, but some longtime residents of China are skeptical that anything can be measured accurately.
"They say 1.2 billion, but it may be far more because there's no reason to register," said Sid Engst, an American farmer who has lived in China for nearly 50 years. "We like to say in America, 'Only God knows.' But how many children are out there in China's countryside, even God doesn't know."

HEADLINE: Writings by Iran's New President Due to Be Published in U.S.

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
In a move that is generating unusual excitement among Middle East scholars and policy makers, two American research institutes this week will co-publish the first English-language translation of writings and speeches by Mohammed Khatami, the new President of Iran.
Mr. Khatami, 54, won a surprise election victory last May that was widely interpreted as a protest vote against the Islamic Republic's repressive policies and continuing economic stagnation. 
 Mr. Khatami was largely unknown in the West before his election, and Middle East scholars and American officials have been seeking to learn more about the senior cleric, who was forced out of his post as Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance in 1992, reportedly for his liberal views.
The Iranian-born scholars who organized the publishing venture say they hoped that permitting Mr. Khatami's political views to be heard in his own words might encourage better relations between Washington and Teheran.
The decision to publish the book now seems aimed at strengthening Mr. Khatami's political base at home, where he has met considerable resistance from Iran's conservative Parliament.
"Given Iran's preoccupation with what Americans think, if his image is good in the West, it will make it easier for him to maneuver," said Roy P. Mottahedeh, a professor at Harvard's Center for Middle Eastern Studies.
Scholars who have read the manuscript said it contained highly unorthodox views for someone who ranks among Iran's senior clergy.
While his book contains the usual denunciations of the West for imperialism, neo-colonialism and a desire for cultural dominance, Mr. Khatami warns against confronting the West though violence or military struggle.
"We must confront the thought of the opponent through reliance on rationality and enlightenment, and by offering more powerful and compelling counter arguments," he writes in one passage.
The book indicates that he finds much to admire in the West, and not just its science and technology.
"We have to keep in mind that Western civilization rests on the idea of 'liberty' or 'freedom,' the most cherished values of all mankind," he writes. "To be fair," he adds, the West has cast aside the "regressive thinking that had been imposed on the masses in the name of religion," and "broken down subjugation to autocratic rule." All these things he calls "positive steps."
He warns that "dogmatic believers," who in the name of Islam project "the aura of religious legitimacy," are seeking to return to a vanished Islamic golden age by trampling religious and intellectual freedom.
"When confronting the enemy in the name of rejecting the West and defending religion, if we step on freedom, we will have caused a great catastrophe," he concludes.
The book is being published jointly by research centers at the State University of New York at Binghamton and at Brigham Young University.
Richard Bulliet, the director of Columbia University's Middle East Institute, said the book presents an "enlightened and cohesive image of Islam and an Islamic revolution which is much more open to the West and new ideas than we've seen before."
The book, with an initial printing of 5,000 copies, is to be sold through the two institutes. While aimed at scholars and policy makers, it is priced at $12 to make it accessible to a broader audience. Iran had no part in financing the venture.

HEADLINE: Praise and Criticism for Clinton Education Policy

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton advised parents today to telephone the Education Department's toll-free telephone line to find out how their children could take advantage of new school initiatives, but he was criticized by the Republicans for not supporting public vouchers for private school tuition.
"In the new economy of the 21st century, what our children earn will depend more than ever on what they can learn," Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address. "Almost 90 percent of the new jobs being created today require more than a high school level of literacy and math skills. Yet more than half of the people entering the work force are not prepared with these skills, so we still have a lot of work to do." 
 The President listed the Administration's education initiatives, including tax credits for college, access to Individual Retirement Accounts for tuition payments and more Pell Grants. The Education Department telephone number is (800) 872-5327.
But in the Republican response, Gov. Arne Carlson of Minnesota criticized President Clinton for his refusal to support the idea of using public money for private school tuition.
"We want every child in America to have the same choice as Chelsea Clinton," Governor Carlson said. The President's 17-year-old daughter recently graduated from Sidwell Friends, a private prep school in Washington.
The Governor said Democrats were not doing enough for the nation's schools.
"What are Democrats so afraid of when it comes to choice, competition and accountability in our schools?" he asked. "Democratic answers include a few national tests, a few more summits and a truckload of dollars, which will not solve the problem."
The governor said Minnesota gave tax deductions for tutoring, summer enrichment camps, private or parochial school tuition and other educational purposes.

For Old South Boston, Despair Replaces Hope

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

DATELINE: BOSTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Kevin Cunningham, 17, was buried last month, four days after he hanged himself from the porch of his family's house, leaving no note.
He was the sixth young man from fiercely proud, mostly white, mostly Irish South Boston to commit suicide since the end of December. 
 His name was added to the roll call that echoes from the rows of tidy three-decker houses to the low-rise brick housing projects, from the saloons to the street corners, where groups of sad teen-agers remember their lost friends: Duane Liotti, 21; Kevin Geary, 17; Jonathan Curtis, 16; Tommy Mullen, 15; Tommy Deckert, 15. They all died the same way, by hanging.
The priest at St. Brigid's parish, the Rev. John Culloty, was at a loss as he began the funeral Mass for Kevin Cunningham. Kevin's older brother, Christopher, is in jail, charged with robbing Father Culloty at gunpoint last year of the church bingo receipts.
"There is something unreal, unnatural about all of this," Father Culloty told the mourners who filled the church. "We seek answers, we seek explanations, but there really aren't any answers."
What is clear is that there is a contagion of despair among many of the young people of South Boston. It is not only the six suicides that have staggered the neighborhood. Since January, city officials say, about 70 teen-agers -- most of them male -- have been hospitalized for attempts at, or thoughts of, suicide.
The despair runs like an electric current through a community once celebrated for its dynamic ability to overcome any obstacle. For well over a century, Southie, as it is called, was a place where Irish immigrants, and later Italians, Lithuanians and Albanians, too, could climb the ladder from poverty to middle-class success.
Bordered on three sides by Boston Harbor, Southie was a self-contained world that could educate its children, instill in them spiritual faith and community loyalty, and provide them with the certainty of decent jobs.
Southie was especially proud of its men. They were known as priests and politicians, as policemen and firemen, as longshoremen, fishermen and factory workers. They were hockey stars and football players, and a few of them were organized crime leaders.
Now, the priests of staunchly Roman Catholic Southie have said funeral Masses for six young men in seven months.
For decades, the neighborhood fought to protect its children by raising barricades against outsiders and change. When change arrived, in the form of court-ordered busing in the 1970's, Southie waged war against it, becoming a national symbol of Northern resistance to school desegregation, its motto of Southie pride hardening into a battle cry.
The threat was always viewed as from the outside: from Protestant Yankees, the Federal courts, minorities and suburban liberals. Outsiders could be blamed for even a relatively recent plague of drug abuse, and a string of fatal heroin overdoses that immediately preceded the suicides.
"People could say, 'Oh, it's the drug dealers' fault, it's outside,' " said Kathy Ahern, a 26-year-old native of South Boston, who works with teen-agers at the South Boston Neighborhood House. But the suicides were a thundering declaration that there was an enemy within. "Kids killing themselves," Ms. Ahern said. "Who do you pin that on?"
The suicides have prompted an extraordinary public self-examination in a neighborhood that has long maintained a code of silence around private troubles. Southie residents are talking about the area's problems, which are not all that different from other Boston inner-city neighborhoods: poverty, drug abuse, broken homes, too many high school dropouts, lack of jobs.
They are also beginning to say that South Boston's legacy of anger over busing may have hurt the children they were trying to protect.
For Southie, the ground has shifted. The blue-collar jobs that once bought houses and security for men and women with high school educations are disappearing.
And with the waning influence of Southie's politicians -- after six decades of Irish rule Boston has its first Italian mayor -- the political patronage that once assured jobs as court officers and bus drivers for Southie residents is no longer certain, either.
In the aftermath of busing, the public schools, as well as the church, which supported desegregation, no longer command the same respect they once did. South Boston High School, where today most of the students are bused in from other neighborhoods, is regarded as the lost secular shrine.
There are many South Bostons, and there are many young people from the neighborhood who are succeeding in some of the city's most academically demanding schools, and whose prospects are bright.
But for many of Southie's young people, the once-thriving ethnic enclave has turned in on itself, and become a trap.
Michael MacDonald, 30, who grew up in a housing project in South Boston and is now a neighborhood organizer, sees a horrible symbolism in the method of suicide. Statistically, hanging is relatively uncommon among teen-agers.
"Who hangs themselves?" he asked. "People in prison hang themselves."
 
The Mood
The Shared Grief Of a Small Town
They call South Boston "the town," and with 29,000 residents, it still feels like a small town. People sit on their stoops at night and call hello to their neighbors. The streets are relatively safe. Every few blocks there is a community center, a gym or a park. It is not surprising that in this tight-knit world the six suicide victims all knew each other.
Kevin Geary wanted to be a state trooper. He lived with his mother in the Old Colony development, a housing project that some demographers have rated one of the poorest white neighborhoods in the country.
Kevin hanged himself on Dec. 30 after getting an $85 traffic ticket for running a blinking red light.
"Kevin was the first," said his mother, Linda Reid, who cut her youngest child down and spoke through a haze of inconsolable grief. "It's like he showed a way out."
Duane Liotti was the second, in February. He was also from Old Colony, where he lived with his mother, an administrative worker in a nursing home. The teen-agers at Old Colony looked up to him.
Mr. Liotti, a high school dropout who had earned his equivalency diploma, had been a campaign precinct captain for Southie's new State Senator, Steve Lynch. Shortly before Mr. Liotti's death, Mr. Lynch had helped him get a $14.65-an-hour apprentice's job with the electrical workers union.
Tommy Mullen, gregarious and popular, was drunk the night before St. Patrick's Day, when he and a friend each wrapped a belt around his neck at the West Broadway housing project. Tommy's friend, also 15, changed his mind in time.
Tommy lived at the project with his mother, a produce clerk at the Stop and Shop supermarket, and his four sisters. Tommy had been suspended from South Boston High School for a fight not long before his death.
Jonathan Curtis was the cut-up of his crowd. Turf is important in South Boston, and Jonathan and his friends owned the corner of I and 8th Streets, two blocks from the water. Jonathan, who had dropped out of South Boston High School, was trying to get his high school equivalency diploma.
He lived a few doors up from the corner with his mother, a nurse, and his stepfather. His father had died several years earlier. Jonathan killed himself in April, the day after one of his close friends, 23-year-old Shawn Austin, died of a heroin overdose. The whole corner, 40 to 50 teen-agers, went to Jonathan's funeral.
Tommy Deckert, a former altar boy, was taken to the hospital after attempting suicide on June 8. Never regaining consciousness, he died of his injuries five days later. His bereaved mother has asked friends and neighbors not to talk about her son, or his death.
If the first five suicides seemed to fit a pattern of young men trying to cope with financial struggles and absent parents, the death of Kevin Cunningham did not. He lived with his mother and father in the coveted City Point section, with its stately homes and ocean views. His father, Lawrence, a supervisor for the city's water and sewer department, had worked extra jobs to put his five children through parochial school.
The Cunninghams had been shaken by the arrest of Kevin's older brother. The code of ethics in Southie holds that robbing the church is unthinkable and unpardonable.
Kevin, an honor student who had a job parking cars at Fenway Park, was the pride of his family. But in June he had wrecked his father's pickup, and was charged with drunken driving in the accident.
Each of the suicides may be inexplicable in its own way, shrouded by the mystery of each young man's personality and family history. Collectively, the suicides have become a statement by a group of confused, inarticulate teen-agers for whom death has brought a recognition unknown in life.
Karen Powers's two daughters, Katelyn, 15, and Heather, 17, knew all the victims, but were especially close to Jonathan Curtis. Ms. Powers says she has tried to emphasize to her daughters the senselessness of the suicides. "I told them, 'Jonathan made the front page of The Herald, but he wasn't around to see it,' " Mrs. Powers said.
Nor is Jonathan here to listen as the suicides have reverberated in the community and beyond, signaling unmistakably that many young people in Southie do not think life has much to offer them. Many of those from the poverty and drug-plagued projects view the future as especially grim. And yet Katelyn and her sister still pledge their loyalty to their neighborhood.
"My mother always said 'Southie pride,' " said Katelyn, who wears green streaks in her hair and wants to be a marine. "You have to have Southie pride. It's who you are, it's where you're from."
Heather, who has a part-time job at a CVS drugstore, held out her left wrist to show the black dot tattooed there. It is the Southie dot, the badge of one of the neighborhood's own.
Heather's friend, 14-year-old Joelle Riley, declared, "You're proud of your neighborhood, no matter how bad it gets."
Robert Coles, the child psychiatrist and Harvard professor, studied the effects of school desegregation on Southie in the 1970's, and more recently he has been visiting the neighborhood with his students, who do community service work in Southie's projects.
"There are bleak prospects for these kids, socially, economically and culturally," Professor Coles said. "It used to be they could knock on the door of a politician, or the church would look after them and get them good jobs. That's all closed off now."
Southie, he added, has become a victim of its own history. "You've got a frustrated, isolated, scorned and rebuked community."
It was not always that way. Once, Southie was king. Thousands of poor and half-starved Irish immigrants had begun flooding Boston in the mid-1800's. Shunned by the Brahmin Boston establishment, many of them retreated to South Boston. They created an ethnic neighborhood out of necessity.
By the 1920's, there was a pipeline to jobs, and they were in it. James Michael Curley was the Mayor, and eventually became Governor. Though he had risen from the Irish slums of the Roxbury neighborhood, South Bostonians saw him as their adopted son.
They were rewarded for their loyalty with jobs as policemen, firemen and street car conductors. They also worked as longshoremen, as pipe fitters, plumbers and carpenters at the gas and electric companies and in neighborhood factories.
The Catholic Church wielded complete authority. So did the police. There were neighborhood schools. The neighborhood even got its own anthem, "Southie Is My Hometown":
There's something about it,
Permit me to shout it,
It's known for miles around.
 
The Fight
Still at War, Feeling Betrayed
At St. Augustine's Church, where he has been preaching his message of love and hope for 18 years to a dwindling and ever poorer flock, Father Thomas McDonnell quoted an Irish proverb the other day: "A man becomes the song he sings."
"What song are we singing?" he said, his sorrow as thick as the heat in his un-air-conditioned rectory. "Despair or discouragement, anger, escapism."
South Boston began declining after World War II, when people started moving to the suburbs. The banks had cut off home mortgages in South Boston, and also redlined many of the other poor neighborhoods.
But the real turning point, when the walls of the fortress began crumbling, was busing for school integration. A siege mentality developed, encouraged by South Boston's political leaders. Parents hurled stones, and racial epithets, at school buses carrying the outsiders -- terrified black school children from Roxbury. And many Southie children were bused to schools in Roxbury. Those people who could afford to moved to the suburbs, or paid for private and parochial schools.
Many of the neighborhood children stopped going to school. Dropping out was an act of loyalty to the neighborhood. The dropouts were known as Garrity's children, after the Federal judge, W. Arthur Garrity, who ordered the busing. Some say that today's dropouts are Garrity's grandchildren.
"We lost an entire generation," said Thomas Crowley, a South Boston police captain.
The violence had eased by the end of the 1970's. What was left for those who could not afford the alternatives was a poor and overwhelmingly minority school system. With some school choice allowed, busing continues today.
Southie never got over the fight.
"They felt betrayed," said Thomas H. O'Connor, a historian who grew up in South Boston and is the author of "South Boston: My Home Town, the History of an Ethnic Neighborhood" (Northeastern University Press, 1988). "The church betrayed them. The priests betrayed them. The justice system betrayed them. The cops betrayed them. Ted Kennedy betrayed them."
Many people say it is Southie's history that accounts for the lack of respect for authority, and education, among many of the neighborhood's young people.
"After busing, everybody saw authorities as the enemy," said Michael MacDonald, whose mother was among those who marched against the court-ordered busing. "We became outlaws."
The South Boston Tribune, a widely read weekly, is still rehashing the fight; in a recent issue it blamed "dumb white liberals," among others, for ruining the schools, and the lives of thousands of residents.
Asked about busing, Katelyn Powers said: "I hate it, I hate it. There's a lot of people from Southie who want to go to Southie High, but people from Roxbury and Dorchester get in before we do."
Captain Crowley hears that sort of anger frequently. "I tell these kids, 'You weren't even born, get on with your lives,' " he said.
 
The Change
Disappearing Jobs, Rising Costs
 Billy Coleman, an 18-year-old dropout who grew up in the West Broadway project and called Tommy Mullen his best friend, was giving a driving tour of his neighborhood.
"No other town looks like our town," said Mr. Coleman, who wants to become a youth counselor. He pointed out the flower pots hanging from the porches, the grid-like pattern of Southie's streets, the miles of beaches. "This is my town. I feel important here."
And yet Southie does not belong to Billy Coleman. While it remains the most distinctive of all the city's neighborhoods, even Southie is changing. Young professionals who work in Boston's nearby financial district are moving in. With real estate prices spiraling, longtime residents worry that their children will be priced out of the neighborhood. Cappuccino cafes are opening beside the Irish saloons.
While South Boston is 95 percent white, the project where Billy Coleman grew up is about 50 percent minority, the result of a 1989 Federal court order that it be desegregated.
Like many South Bostonians, Billy is still furious about it. "They were trying to take over our town," he said, describing the fights that broke out among the project's teen-agers in the beginning. "They should have their own town. This was our town."
None of the old paths are certain for Billy and his friends.
To illustrate how things have changed, Kathy Ahern talked about her father, Bill Ahern. He graduated from South Boston High School in 1964. He was the captain of the hockey team. It hardly mattered that he was not a star in the classroom.
"By the time he was 24, he was married and had four children and was working at Boston Gas," Ms. Ahern said. Eventually, he bought a house on East Seventh Street for his family. Today he is a supervisor at Boston Gas, earning about $70,000 a year.
But now Boston Gas is laying people off. The neighborhood factories have closed. Computers have gobbled up the old jobs at the utilities, and computer training is needed for the jobs that are available.
The other day Mr. Coleman and his friend from the project, Jimmy Connolly, 20, and also a dropout, talked about the future. "Around here you don't hear no one talking about college," Mr. Connolly said. "Half my friends didn't even finish high school."
Mr. Connolly, who spent six months in jail recently for aggravated assault with a weapon, said he knows of one man in the project who has gone to college. That man had an advantage, Mr. Connolly said, explaining, "He had a mother and father his whole life."
Mr. Connolly was 10 when his stepfather, whom he considered his father, hanged himself. Mr. Coleman was 3 when his father, who was 19, died of a gunshot wound to the chest. The authorities ruled it a suicide.
 
The Struggle
Pulling Together, Hoping for Revival
In the spring, Steve Lynch, the State Senator, a former ironworker, persuaded the ironworkers union to hold a job fair for the neighborhood young people. The turnout was disappointing. "There's a weakness of spirit inside some of these kids," Mr. Lynch said, adding that he sees the roots of that weakness in missing parents, and in the absence of the church in their lives.
Mayor Thomas M. Menino has pledged to help South Boston. The city has opened a health center in the Old Colony project and promised to refurbish gyms and community centers. Teams of mental health workers have been dispatched to the neighborhood.
Southie has been pulling together to stop the suicides. A neighborhood women's group has been formed, a first for Southie. Mary Ulrich, a mother of eight who helped start the group, said, "The Irish have this thing: If something happens, you suck it up, and march along, you keep it to yourself."
Jack Leary, the chief probation officer at the courthouse, who has devoted himself to South Boston for 18 years, has been spending his free time getting teen-agers who need it into treatment, and finding summer jobs and training programs for others.
Southie's residents have been reaching out to other neighborhoods, inviting black mothers from Roxbury and Dorchester to tell them of the sons they have lost to violence.
A community meeting in May drew more than 500 people trying to help themselves.
Michael MacDonald, the community organizer, says the challenge is clear. "We know what we're against," he said. "But what the hell are we for?"

HEADLINE: In Shift to Labor, Public Supports U.P.S. Strikers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Standing alongside his wife in their cramped kiosk in the Chicago Loop, Mark Wier complains that the strike against the United Parcel Service has delayed the arrival of some watchbands that he is eager to sell, but that has not stopped him from siding with the people who shut down U.P.S.
"I agree with the teamsters," Mr. Wier said on Friday. "U.P.S. has 80 percent of the market. They are a successful company, and they can afford to pay full-time jobs. Those workers work hard and they deserve full-time pay and full-time benefits." 
 Even though the 13-day-old walkout by the teamsters is inconveniencing far more Americans than most strikes have, the American public strongly agrees with Mr. Wier and supports the workers in this high-stakes showdown, the largest strike in the nation in two decades.
That is a surprising switch because the public sided with management in most other recent work stoppages that grabbed the nation's attention, including the 1994 baseball players' strike, the 1982 football players' strike and the 1981 air controllers' strike.
To be sure, many Americans have warmer feelings toward their friendly U.P.S. drivers, whom they often see lugging around 75-pound crates, than toward baseball players making $2 million a year. But, public opinion experts say, several factors far more profound than that help explain why Americans are siding with the U.P.S. strikers.
"There's been a pendulum shift that's led people to support unions in disputes with management because Americans have gotten a much more jaundiced view of how corporations treat workers," said Geoffrey Garin, a pollster who does some work for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "There's a very strong perception that management is less fair and less loyal to workers than it used to be."
According to a CNN/USA Today Gallup poll, 55 percent of Americans back the teamsters in this dispute, while 27 percent support management. The poll of 819 adults was taken last Wednesday and Thursday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
In dozens of interviews conducted in the past two days in cities around the country, support for the teamsters came through strongly, though many people backed U.P.S. Some people said it was wrong for a company with such high profits to insist on hiring so many part-timers, instead of full-timers. But others opposed the strikers, saying they were hurting the economy and putting a gun to management's head.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has insisted that the main issue in the strike is U.P.S.'s widespread use of part-time workers, who the union says earn too little to support a family. That issue has apparently struck a chord with a public sensitized to workers' issues by years of downsizing and stagnant wages.
The union has repeatedly attacked U.P.S. because more than four-fifths of the 46,000 new jobs the company has created since 1993 have been part time. U.P.S. officials have insisted that the principal issue in the dispute is the company's demand to set up a new pension plan, but that issue has not resonated with the public the way the issue of part-time workers has.
"This is a popular strike because it involves issues that many workers all across the country identify with," John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, said in an interview. "People understand when you talk about the transition from full-time, middle-income jobs to part-time, low-income jobs. People sympathize when they see a company that makes a billion dollars and is taking it out of the workers and is not giving them their fair share of the profits they create."
Sixty percent of the company's 185,000 unionized workers are part time, and the union wants 10,000 of the part-time positions converted to full time over the next four years. U.P.S., which has offered to make 800 of the part-time positions full time, says it needs so many part-time workers because its average day contains several short bursts of intense sorting and loading. Part-timers earn an average of $9.50 an hour after two years while full-time drivers earn $19.95 an hour.
While eating his lunch on the 16th Street Mall in downtown Denver, Greg Callaghan, a government employee, voiced clear support for the teamsters, even though it is a union toward which Americans have traditionally felt scant sympathy. "If it's true they've made billions, then they ought to take that money and put it into the employees," Mr. Callaghan said. "That's an awful lot of money to have in profits and not be able to pay the workers what they want. A part-time job just isn't going to get people off of welfare."
But in Atlanta, where U.P.S. has its headquarters, Robert Schochet, owner of a flower and gift shop, was firmly in management's camp. "Unions will be able to hold large corporations for ransom," he said. "I hope U.P.S. holds out, otherwise you give into unions just like a terrorist.'
Those who sympathize with U.P.S. management predict that the public's support for the workers will diminish as the strike drags on.
"Let's see what happens when people get tired of the response from ordering things by catalog taking longer and longer," said Karl Rove, a Republican pollster in Austin, Tex.
He said this strike was far different from the air controllers' strike in 1981, when President Ronald Reagan dismissed 11,500 strikers. Mr. Rove asserted, "Then, the air controllers said, 'Let's inconvenience everyone in the nation,' and there was no sympathy for them because those guys were making $100,000 a year."
The public's attitude toward the teamsters is far different from its views toward the air controllers. In a Harris survey in 1981, 51 percent of the public backed President Reagan and 40 percent the controllers. The public's pro-teamsters view also contrasts with attitudes toward the baseball strike, in which, according to a CBS News/New York Times poll, 43 percent of the public supported the owners and 22 percent the players.
In Brooklyn, Michael Rodriguez, owner of Open Road Cycles, said he sympathized with the teamster strikers partly because he was so fond of his brown-suited U.P.S. driver. "The workers do work hard," he said. "I have some feeling for my regular guy. They do deserve something."
Leonard Feldman, a Manhattan lawyer, said: "I go with the workers. Management is trying to enforce a conservative push, something happening across the nation, which is not in the interests of middle- and lower-income people."
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials say the public has not suddenly warmed to labor because of the U.P.S. strike, noting that the pro-labor trend has been a decade in the making. In a Los Angeles Times poll in 1984, 34 percent of the public said they supported labor and 45 percent backed management when they were asked which side they generally supported when they heard about a labor dispute. Asked an almost identical question last year in a poll done by Peter D. Hart Research, 44 percent said they favored the workers, and 24 percent backed management.
U.P.S. officials insist that the union has mischaracterized the part-timers' working conditions, asserting that this had wrongly led many people to back the union.
"The part-time job at U.P.S. is a great job," said James Kelly, chairman of the company. "The average wage is $11 an hour. They receive a full level of benefits. They have 25 paid days off."
That type of argument resonated with Richard Arzola, a commercial printing salesman, in East Austin, Tex. "I don't support the strike at all," he said. "We don't need unions. At one time, maybe back in the '40's or '30's, but now, you don't need a union. Those guys are getting a pretty deal to work."
In Atlanta, Joni Roberts, a clerk at Stacy's Pharmacy, agreed, saying, "I think with the amount of money they're getting and all the benefits, they should be happy."
U.P.S. took solace in the response to one part of the CNN/USA Today poll: by 65 to 28 percent, the public said it backed the company's demand that the union should hold a vote on the contract even though its negotiators had rejected it. But in a rebuff to the company's position, only 21 percent of respondents said the Clinton Administration should intervene to settle the strike, while 75 percent said the company and workers should settle it themselves.
Milly Kaslov, who owns a psychic shop in Los Angeles, said she supported the strikers -- and she predicted that the strike would end soon. She said her U.P.S. delivery man was always courteous and prompt, and she insisted that his $20-an-hour wage was not too high.
"What's $20 an hour today?" she asked. "Prices are going up. In my day, $20 was a lot, but not anymore."
Even many people who supported the strike acknowledged that they were unhappy with how it was hurting their business. Voicing support for the teamsters, John K. Kim, manager of the Two Brothers clothing store in Chicago, said: "They are not being treated fairly and so they are doing what needs to be done to get what they want. However, my business is being hurt, so I just hope it is over as soon as possible."

HEADLINE: For National Parks Workers, a Housing Crisis

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif., Aug. 13

 BODY:
"Water would be a big improvement," said Harold Rudd, assessing the wood and canvas shack that the Government gives him to live in as he works, wearing the uniform of the National Park Service, along the spectacular ridges that adorn one of the most precious tracts of real estate in the world.
"Maybe if we had more showers, or two or four more toilets," he said yanking a thumb toward the communal bathhouse at one end of the row of tent-cabins, occupied by seasonal employees who pay $10 every two weeks to live under canvas roofs. "But just having water in there would make it so much more convenient," he said. 
 More than an hour's drive away, in the village of El Portal on the park's fringe, the employees-cum-tenants had no such complaint.
"This is the best house I've lived in, in my whole Government career," said Dean Clark, who manages the National Park Service's program of controlled fires within Yosemite.
The Government built his two-bedroom home a few years ago at a cost of $400,000. He pays $550 a month, which he called "equitable," for the 1,200-square-foot house, which has energy-saving features, a two-car garage and nearby tennis courts and ball fields.
The contrasting living situations of the two Park Service employees illuminate one more festering problem for an agency plagued by years of tight budgets and booming tourism. Substandard housing for Government workers -- and for employees of park concessionaires as well -- is a problem all across the national park system, one the Park Service is struggling to address as it tries to provide appropriate shelter for some 5,000 employees in areas where commercially available housing is too remote, too expensive or both.
The new housing project at El Portal was criticized by the Interior Department's inspector general last year because its 19 single-family homes and 37 apartments cost, on average, $580,000 per unit -- two to four times the going rate for local housing. A similar situation was found at Grand Canyon National Park, where there is also an acute housing problem.
In part that is because the expenses included a share of the costs of road building, architectural design and environmental studies.
"The Park Service decided to build high-quality, energy-efficient, single-family homes, which resulted in high-cost employee housing and unmet housing needs," the inspector general for audits, Robert J. Williams, concluded in his report. "At least 70 seasonal employees at Yosemite National Park will still be living under the same conditions that prompted the funding for the employee housing."
As career employees mature, the agency's managers worry about losing some of the best of them because they will not put up with decrepit housing or because they are tired of moving from one Government house to another without ever building up any home equity.
In the most rugged reaches of Yellowstone, some workers live in dilapidated trailers, tucked under sturdy freestanding snow roofs to protect them from crushing blizzards. On seashores like Cape Hatteras, N.C., summertime rents are far beyond the means of seasonal employees.
The Park Service, a branch of the United States Department of Interior, estimates its backlog of maintenance, repairs and replacement for housing at $300 million, said Donna Compton, the official in Washington who is responsible for housing programs. Its annual budget for the programs is $12 million.
The highest priority, she said, is to replace old, supposedly temporary, trailer homes, which often present safety problems for the occupants. The overall goal is to replace 35 percent of all substandard housing by the year 2002.
Last year, in the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, Congress ordered the service to assess its overall housing needs, including who qualifies for government-owned housing and what it would cost to bring the entire housing stock up to acceptable standards. The review is under way.
At the same time, Congress authorized the Interior Department to enter contracts with private housing developers to build and manage housing, on either public or private lands, that would be leased to eligible employees. The Government could provide subsidies in cash payments, occupancy guarantees or below-cost leases of Federal land.
The service is pleased with the new entrepreneurial spirit, but any such arrangement would require further Congressional appropriations and raise complex issues of fairness and practicality, according to Government and private experts.
"There are things the National Park Service does well -- educational programs, search and rescue operations," said Palmer Jenkins, chief of strategic planning at Yosemite. "And there are things we probably don't do particularly well. Being in the housing business is a necessity for us, but it has not necessarily been a core competency."
The park has enlisted the assistance of Joshua D. Hannah, a graduate student in business at Stanford University who is working as a volunteer to examine the economics of the idea. He has sounded out developers and found them enthusiastic, but he thinks financing the projects will require careful analysis.
"They are all very enthusiastic that public-private partnerships are the answer," he said of his talks with developers. "But that is before they run the numbers. Any way you slice it, it is going to cost lots of money."
Meanwhile, the Park Service is trying not to repeat the mistakes of Yosemite, a park that is struggling to move as many workers as possible out of the spectacular valley to enhance its natural appeal.
"We are trying very, very hard to contain the costs," said Ms. Compton, citing a standardized housing design that can be modified slightly and built at one park after another.
Some costs are unique to the Park Service, like the need for extensive environmental impact studies of each housing development. But the high-cost homes at Yosemite also have solar water heaters, commercial grade flooring and other features. Although these amenities might hold down operating costs and wear and tear, they have added to the up-front costs.
On one thing, the Park Service and the inspector general agreed: the housing conditions at the park were not solved by the development at El Portal. Park Service officials maintain, however, that seasonal employees often climb the housing ladder, into trailers and other homes that permanent employees leave when they move into the new houses.
But the men and women living in tent-cabins along the park's high Tioga Road could not afford the rents in the new housing.
"They are pulling people in here that are just making a few dollars over minimum wage," said David McCarl, a seasonal maintenance worker who returns each year. He added, "We push ourselves by saying we get paid in views."
Their home improvement is accomplished by their own hands, as when they sheeted in the walls of their tents with plywood.
Steven Lusch, who makes $11.44 an hour operating road equipment for the park, helped the crew build a barbecue pit. The crew also installed water lines closer to their tents, saving the walk to the bathhouse.
"We haven't got the sinks in yet," Mr. McCarl said. "They keep promising us sinks."

HEADLINE: Union and U.P.S. Officials Negotiate Through the Night

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Representatives of the United Parcel Service and the striking teamsters' union continued negotiations today after holding all-night talks in an effort to end the 13-day-old strike by 185,000 workers.
Teamster officials played down the chances of an imminent agreement, but some union officials said there just might be a settlement this weekend, although one official said it was possible the talks could still collapse. 
 Labor Secretary Alexis Herman occasionally joined the talks, which began at 9 A.M. Friday and continued for more than 30 hours. The two sides took a short break early this morning to wash up and nap.
"The two sides are hunkered down," a Labor Department official said.
On Friday afternoon, Ronald Carey, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, gave a pessimistic prognosis in his one public appearance since the marathon negotiations began. He said no agreement had been reached on any of the main areas in dispute, namely subcontracting, the size of a pay increase, company plans to set up a new pension plan and the widespread use of part-time workers.
Urging the strikers to maintain their solidarity, he said: "A contract that provides good jobs for working families certainly won't be won at the bargaining table. The only way you can win that is either on the picket lines or in the community."
To step up pressure on the company, the teamsters are organizing rallies in 30 cities Thursday, which the union has designated "Action Day for Good Jobs." Teamster officials said the community rallies were an important way to maintain the strikers' spirits and to show U.P.S. that most of the American public sides with the strikers.
U.P.S. officials continued to argue on Friday that teamster leaders should let their rank and file vote on what the company calls its "last, best and final" offer. But union officials say such a vote is unnecessary, because the rank and file voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike.
Showing the business community's growing impatience with the strike, Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, wrote President Clinton on Friday to say that the union should let its members vote on the U.P.S. offer and, if that does not happen, the president should seek an injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act to end the strike. Under that law, presidents can seek an injunction to end work stoppages that imperil the nation's economy or security.
"I am urging you to use the powers of your office to end this intolerable situation," Mr. Donohue wrote. "You are the only person who can help thousands of struggling employers and employees all across the country. By stepping in today, you can send a message to the entire country that you represent the interests of all Americans."
The teamsters and their labor allies oppose use of a Taft-Hartley injunction because they say it would strip the teamsters of their strongest weapon against U.P.S.: the strike. They also say the strike does not endanger the nation's economy.
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials released a letter today that John J. Sweeney, the federation's president, sent to all members of Congress, asserting that Taft-Hartley should not be invoked because the economic damage caused by the strike does not satisfy the high standards set by that act. The letter was in part a response to a letter that U.P.S. sent lawmakers last week urging them to press the President to invoke Taft-Hartley.
"Strikes and lockouts may cause inconvenience and location," Mr. Sweeney wrote. "But the economic impact of collective bargaining is not ground to have the government intervene by executive fiat and and cast aside the free system of collective bargaining which has been the foundation of our nation's labor laws since the 1930's."
The talks were being held at the Hyatt Regency Washington Hotel, and aides to Secretary Herman said she was staying at the hotel to make sure that she was readily available if the parties needed her. John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, has also joined the talks.
The strike has largely shut down the domestic operations of the United Parcel Service, the world's largest package delivery company, which handles 12 million parcels on an average day.
The company's competitors, including Federal Express and the Postal Service, have struggled to fill the gap left by U.P.S.

HEADLINE: How New York State Walked Into a Veto of Its Medicaid Item

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, learned long ago how to grease the legislative machinery by helping colleagues with provisions of special interest to them.
So when Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, approached him last spring with a favor he wanted included in this year's huge budget bill, Mr. Roth agreed, especially since the Finance Committee's senior Democrat, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, also supported it. 
 Mr. D'Amato's seemingly obscure and parochial provision -- resolving in New York's interest a long-running and complex dispute over Medicaid financing -- became the center of a national political debate last Monday when President Clinton used his line-item veto power for the first time to excise it from the budget bill he had just signed into law.
Mr. Clinton characterized the provision as an unjustified and inequitable handout to New York that would set an unacceptable precedent for settling similar disputes with as many as 14 other states. Mr. D'Amato and other supporters of the measure, including Gov. George E. Pataki, denounced Mr. Clinton for vetoing a measure that was part of an intensively negotiated, bipartisan balanced budget package.
A look back at how the provision evolved shows that Mr. D'Amato calculated that it would be better to push for a full victory rather than accept the half loaf offered by the White House. The White House, for its part, gambled that it could withstand the political heat of using its new line-item veto power against a provision backed by nearly the entire political establishment of the nation's second-most-populous state.
"This is politically painful to us in a state that we care about," said Gene Sperling, the White House's economic policy adviser. "But we felt it was good policy and that it sends the right signal nationally that we're changing the rules on impermissible government spending."
But the veto, in fact, may have given a boost to Mr. D'Amato. As he prepares for a tough re-election battle next year, the Senator has been handed an opportunity to portray himself as the protector of his state's neediest people against the Washington bureaucracy.
The issue behind all the political sniping -- whether New York and other states should be allowed to tax health care providers in a way that increases the level of Medicaid money the state receives from Washington -- has been festering since 1991, when a new Federal law strictly limited use of such taxes.
The intent of the 1991 law was to keep states from increasing their eligibility for matching Federal Medicaid funds by assessing taxes on health care providers, labeling the revenues as state Medicaid funding that would be matched by Washington, and then effectively refunding the taxes to the health care providers. Critics of the practice said it was a scheme to milk more Medicaid financing from Washington.
But the 1991 law recognized that some states were levying taxes on health care providers for legitimate purposes that would expand access to health care for the poor. So the law allowed states to apply for waivers. Fifteen states, including New York, and the District of Columbia eventually applied for waivers.
But the waiver process by all accounts moved very slowly. Because it had to wait for the Federal Government to complete its detailed regulations for enacting the new law, New York was unable to file its waiver request until 1995. In the meantime, believing that its provider taxes would be found allowable by Washington, New York continued to levy them.
New York's waiver requests covered a variety of provider taxes. The Clinton Administration told state officials that it was sympathetic to its request for a waiver for one of the taxes, known as a regional pool. The tax was levied primarily on hospitals, with the revenues paid back out to those hospitals that accepted a disproportionate share of poor patients unable to pay the bill. Although the tax did not meet the criteria laid down in the 1991 law that all provider taxes be "broad-based and uniform" because hospitals in different regions were taxed at different rates, the Administration agreed that the tax was being used to improve health care for the poor and should be allowable.
But the Administration still did not issue the waiver. And it continued to offer New York and other states little guidance on whether other provider taxes would be deemed acceptable. Between 1992 and May 31 of this year, New York received $2.6 billion in matching funds from the Federal Government for Medicaid based on provider taxes that remain in dispute, and state officials said they were growing impatient about removing the uncertainty that the unresolved issue had created around the state's finances. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the state actually had no more than $200 million at risk, a figure that state officials said they cannot explain.
"The issue was not moving, period," said Robert R. Hinckley, a spokesman for the New York State Health Department. "It's 1997 and we're still waiting for the waiver. Our concern was that we didn't want to be preparing a budget two or three years down the road and have the Federal Government act and require reimbursement from the state."
Mr. Pataki took his concerns to Mr. D'Amato, his political mentor. They decided to try to sidestep the regulatory process through a legislative provision that would, in essence, do an end run around the Federal Department of Health and Human Services and declare New York the victor. And because both of New York's Senators serve on the Finance Committee, which oversees spending for entitlement programs like Medicaid, Mr. D'Amato, along with Mr. Moynihan, had considerable leverage with Mr. Roth to insure that the provision would be included in this year's spending bill.
"This was an effort on our part to deal with an inequity and to allow the state's health care system to continue to provide the necessary care for the uninsured and the poor," Mr. D'Amato said in an interview on Friday. "Otherwise the burden could become one that could pose serious threats to our health care system."
The provision had a close call even before making it into the final legislation. During a Finance Committee hearing in mid-June, Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, offered an amendment that would have banned in all states the very Medicaid-financing practices that Mr. D'Amato wanted approved for New York.
Saying that states were using the taxes on providers to "game the Medicaid system" through a "ruse" that put a bigger burden on the Federal budget, Mr. Gramm called on the Finance Committee to end a practice "that we are all against."
Mr. D'Amato ripped into Mr. Gramm's proposal during the hearing as "ridiculous" and "mean-spirited," prompting Mr. Gramm to withdraw his amendment. Mr. D'Amato said his provision was placed into the spending bill on the Senate floor in late June with the approval of the Republican leadership and the knowledge of the White House.
Indeed, while many special interest provisions are slipped into legislation at the last minute and therefore get little scrutiny, this one got a prompt response from the White House.
"It would have been a classic Washington-based rifle shot provision for one state and one state only," said Chris Jennings, the White House's health policy adviser. "And it would have been impossible for us to say no on provider taxes in other states that we believe to be impermissible under current law and statute."
Mr. Jennings met with staff members from the House and Senate to offer a compromise. Mr. Jennings said the Administration would agree to legislative language approving New York's regional pools, but not the other provider taxes it had been using. Mr. Jennings said the compromise would have freed up about half the money in dispute.
The offer was transmitted to Mr. D'Amato, who passed it along to Mr. Pataki's office. State officials rejected the compromise, saying it would not remove the financial uncertainty hanging over the state's Medicaid system.
"For the state to get one waiver, even for a significant chunk of the money, would not resolve the issue and would leave the other pools at risk," Mr. Hinckley said.
The issue then went unaddressed until after the budget bill was passed by Congress last month and signed by the President early this month. Mr. Clinton's budget and economic advisers said they quickly identified the provision as one that they considered bad policy.
Although they said they knew that vetoing the provision would bring protests from New York, they said there was a compelling case to be made that New York should not be allowed, because of its political muscle on the Senate Finance Committee, to receive a break that no other state would enjoy and that could undermine the Administration's efforts to toughen on abuses of the Medicaid system.
Mr. D'Amato said he believes Mr. Clinton did not fully understand that New York was only intending to shore up its Medicaid system.
"I don't believe that people gave the President the right information," Mr. D'Amato said. "I believe he was misled."

HEADLINE: Clinton Looks for Inspiration From the Left

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton, searching for new intellectual energy and vigor for his White House, has brought two longtime partisan loyalists into his inner circle and given them broad latitude to work on political strategy and Presidential themes.
Mr. Clinton has turned to outside tacticians at critical turnings before. In 1993, after a rough first six months in office, he tapped David Gergen, the Reagan-era message meister, to court the Washington establishment. In 1995 after the Republican ascent in Congress, he turned to Dick Morris. 
 Those two men had strong Republican ties, but the two who began work this week are decidedly Democrats: Paul Begala, 36, one of the political consultants who was at Mr. Clinton's side in 1992, and Sidney Blumenthal, 48, a former journalist who as early as 1987 heralded Mr. Clinton as one of a new generation of Democratic leaders.
Most of Mr. Clinton's confidants contend that advisers exert little gravitational pull on the President these days. Mr. Clinton, they say, is charting his own moderate course, one that embraces once-Republican ideas like balanced budgets and free trade, yet includes Democratic grace notes like a children's health care program, environmental activism and tax cuts for higher education.
"The debate about the vital center versus the invigorated left is over," said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Clinton's senior adviser, insisting that Mr. Clinton will not make a leftward surge. "He has chosen the course he enunciated both in 1992 and 1996."
But White House aides acknowledged that having checked the self-proclaimed Republican revolution of 1994, Mr. Clinton now hopes to push public opinion slightly leftward toward a greater acceptance of activist government.
As an example, White House aides noted, two years ago Mr. Clinton was fighting simply to stop Republicans from turning the Federal Medicaid program of health insurance to the poor from an entitlement program into a block grant. But this year the Republican Congress agreed to create a new $24 billion entitlement program as part of the budget deal to give health insurance to five million poor children.
The President is also determined, his aides say, to win the House of Representatives back for the Democrats next year, despite historic trends that have seen the President's party lose seats in midterm elections.
Mr. Begala and Mr. Blumenthal, both of whom are expected to include speech writing in their duties, could help set a tone. Mr. Begala was known in 1992 as an aggressive populist who believed in using themes of class struggle against a corporate elite. He argued in favor of investments in training and education programs in 1993 and against a strict emphasis only on deficit reduction.
Mr. Blumenthal most recently wrote in the World Policy Journal that deficits had become a tool for causing a paralysis of social policy and he accused the Republican right of seeing tax cuts as "a fiscal weapon to regain insolvency and thus political dominance."
In some ways, Mr. Clinton could simply coast right now, with the roaring economy washing away the nation's discontents. A new poll by the Pew Research Center found this week that Mr. Clinton's 59 percent approval rating was coming close to Mr. Reagan's in the summer of 1986. The figures were even more remarkable because Mr. Reagan was re-elected in a landslide while Mr. Clinton did not even get 50 percent of the vote.
Moreover, the Pew poll found that for the first time since the the victory in the Gulf war, most Americans are happy with the country's direction.
But officials say that the President and Mrs. Clinton, who still has substantial behind the scenes influence, want new energy and ideas in the White House, which is still living off the small idea-a-day style of the 1996 campaign.
The President himself is said by his aides to be tired and sorely in need of a vacation. And more members of the first term staff are leaving. Mr. Blumenthal is taking the place of Donald A. Baer, the just-departed communications director, and Mr. Begala will eventually take the place of Doug Sosnik, counselor to the President, who is expected to leave soon.
While Mr. Clinton is in Martha's Vineyard for the next three weeks, the White House will be preparing for what is expected to be the new, post-balanced budget phase of the political debate.
White House officials say that the balanced budget agreement served Democrats by erasing their tax-and-spend image while also giving them distinct programs to call their own, like the tax credits to pay for community college tuition.
Across the White House, officials are engaged in a policy review to identify new initiatives for the President in such areas as health care, child care and education. None of them are expected to be vastly ambitious. There are still the realities of a Republican Congress facing Mr. Clinton and the fiscal constraints of the balanced budget agreement.
But such measures could form a campaign platform for the midterm Congressional elections of 1998 and the Presidential race of 2000, when Vice President Al Gore is expected to run. Such issues allow the Democrats to continue to distinguish themselves from Republicans by pointing to small, activist government programs that they endorse. They are also designed to help Democrats expand their potential electoral base to suburban swing voters.
Mr. Begala, officials say, is expected to write speeches, advise on political tactics and work with the Democrats as next year's elections near. He was recommended by Mr. Emanuel and is expected to work with him.
For Mr. Begala, the White House job is a type of resurrection. He had fought against Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction emphasis in 1993 and eventually fell out of favor when a new chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, decided to bring more order to the White House by ending the free access given to the 1992 campaign consultants, including Mr. Begala.
Mr. Blumenthal -- who is expected to work on speeches and high-profile projects like the White House's newly announced emphasis on the millennium -- is a more controversial figure. He is friends with Mrs. Clinton and his hiring caught several high-ranking White House officials by surprise. Some of his new colleagues express skepticism that a career in opinion journalism is the requisite background for a White House staffer.
One thing Mr. Blumenthal will not be is a a Gergenesque image polisher. A former writer for the New Yorker, Mr. Blumenthal has had notoriously bad relations with many of his former colleagues in the Washington press who saw him as too close to the Clintons. When his job was announced by the New Republic, for whom he used to write, the magazine sniffed that perhaps "he'll get his back pay."
"A beat is just an assignment but a slut is who you've become maybe," the magazine said.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 19, 1997, Monday

 CORRECTION:
 An article yesterday about Presi dent Clinton's search for new intel lectual energy and vigor in the White House focused on the recent hiring of two political advisers, Paul Begala and Sidney Blumenthal.
The last paragraph, a quotation that appeared to be a cynical and uncomplimentary allusion to Mr. Blumenthal, a former journalist, was truncated and misattributed because of an editing error. One word was incorrectly transcribed, compound ing the misimpression.
The quotation, as it appeared in The Times, said, "A beat is just an assignment but a slut is who you've become maybe." It did not appear in The New Republic, which wrote about Mr. Blumenthal's appoint ment.
It was, in fact, a line from a play by Mr. Blumenthal that lampooned the White House press corps in which a reporter is bemoaning his career, and should have read, "A beat is just an assignment but a slot is who you've become maybe after being on a beat so long it becomes your life."
The article made the point that Mr. Blumenthal has had tense relations with some of his former colleagues, and the quotation was intended to serve as an illustration of the au thor's observations about some White House reporters.
The word "slot" was incorrectly transcribed from an audio tape of the play as "slut."

HEADLINE: Where Have All the Antiques Gone?

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
DEALERS in American antiques could hardly contain their excitement at an auction last May in Austerlitz, N.Y., not far from Stockbridge, Mass.
At the center of all the buzz were four pieces of 18th-century Connecticut furniture by the same maker, pieces that had been in one family for 200 years and that had never been on the market before, according to Maine Antique Digest. The collection attracted just about every major dealer in the country who specializes in formal American furniture. Robert Herron, an auctioneer since 1953, sold a highboy that was among the four pieces; it was the most expensive item he ever handled, he said, and a dealer from Ohio bought it for $418,000. 
 William Hosley, curator of American decorative arts at Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, said the highboy, bookcase desk, serpentine-front chest and tall clock were "one of the few major discoveries of the year." The keen interest in the sale reflects a demand for American antique furniture that is exceeding the supply, dealers say. Coveted pieces like those at Austerlitz are at a premium and sell at prices beyond the reach of many lovers of Americana.
That is why reproductions, which, of course, cost considerably less, are increasingly popular. A young couple unable to afford a $20,000 antique may be happy to take home a reproduction, just to be able to live with the Early American look. But they cannot expect to recoup their investment, as they can with antiques, warned Zeke Liverant, whose family has bought and sold American antiques and art in Colchester since 1920.
Where have all the treasures gone? A lot of them are being sold to collectors and dealers in other states. Thomas Schwenke, an appraiser and antiques dealer in Woodbury, explained that 18th- and 19th-century craftsmen made a limited amount of furniture, some of which found its way into 25 major collections formed over the last 50 years. In addition, the market is no longer confined to New England, as it once was.
"We're in the information age, the travel age, the age of the fax machine. Someone living in California can bid by fax on something at an auction in New York and have the item shipped to California," Mr. Schwenke said. "Once an estate is disbursed, the antiques go somewhere else. It's like dandelion seeds."
In 1955, Mr. Schwenke recalled, dealers at an estate sale would find more merchandise than they were able to handle. "Now, we spend hours, days and months trying to search out things to buy and can't find anything," he said. "If there are 300 items in an estate, 290 of them are garbage."
Connecticut farmhouses are cleaned out, and many family heirlooms were sold years ago, Mr. Liverant said. Antiques from Connecticut are more apt to turn up in places like Ohio and Missouri, where the economy is stronger, or in spacious apartments on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Two of the four pieces of cherry furniture auctioned at Austerlitz, however, were bought by dealers from Connecticut.
Mr. Liverant's son, Arthur, paid $77,000 for the secretary desk, and the chest was bought by Marguerite Riordan of Stonington for $57,200, according to Maine Antique Digest. Ms. Riordan said she added the chest to her stock. When asked where the secretary desk ended up, Zeke Liverant would say only that it was placed in a collection in Connecticut.
New England was the center of the antiques market in the 1930's and 40's. In fact, it was unusual before World War II for anyone outside New England to collect antiques seriously, Mr. Hosley said. In the 1950's and 60's, Connecticut was famous for its antiques and collectors.
There was little antiques buying in the 1970's, when Wall Street was a dim place and real estate and art failed to draw investors. Then the Bicentennial sparked tremendous interest in Americana that continued into the robust economy of the 1980's. Today, investment in art and antiques remains lively, and museums are unable to buy a significant piece of American furniture for less than $100,000, Mr. Hosley said.
Tim Mallon, a wholesaler and manufacturer of reproductions in Danbury, said he got out of the antique business because few people were able to afford the high prices. "With the economy the way it is, Joe Schmo can't go out with his family on a Sunday and buy antiques anymore," he explained. "Five or seven years ago, I could buy a dresser for $300. Those days are gone. That traffic isn't there. A dresser with a marble top probably costs $1,500 to $2,000 now."
Mr. Mallon imports reproductions from Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, China and Mexico. His customers like the fact that the decoration on the furniture is carved by hand, no two items are the same and the furniture is solid mahogany and teak.
Distressed painted furniture from Indonesia is a hot item, Mr. Mallon said. The armoires, small tables and cupboards, which resemble French country furniture, are finished in pastel paints that appear to be cracked and worn. The process used to create the appearance of age is a secret, he said.
There are also many well-made 19th- and 20th-century reproductions around.
Buyers are still able to afford the real thing if they make a commitment to it, said Ms. Riordan. "Buy the best example of any category that you can afford. There are good values, if you take the time to learn," she adfvised.
The rule is beware, because the tag on a piece of furniture does not always indicate whether the item is an antique or a reproduction.
In most cases, a thorough inspection with an eye sharpened by a number of authenticated examples of the style is all that is needed. The furniture should be examined from every angle as well as inside and out. There may be a reason it is stuck in the corner of the shop or backed up against a wall.
June Neal, director of communications for the State Department of Consumer Protection, learned a hard lesson. She bought five pieces of furniture she thought were made in the Victorian period. When she sold four of them a few years later to the same dealer from whom she bought them, she was told that they were reproductions. "I was heartsick. I paid $1,000 for a sofa and sold it for $300," she said. "I lost a couple of thousand dollars on the four pieces."
But Ms. Neal had no recourse. "I didn't have the proverbial leg to stand on, because I didn't have the receipt," she said.
A dealer should always be willing to write a receipt that states the approximate age of the piece, its condition, where it came from, where it was made and any additional history associated with the furniture, if it is available, Mr. Liverant said.
He also advised buyers to get help from a trustworthy dealer. "The reputable dealer is not necessarily the dealer with the full-page ad," he added as he flipped through a magazine about antiques and held up various advertisements as examples. "Go to a museum and ask them to recommend someone."
One way of detecting repairs, replacements and fakes is to look at the patina on the furniture. Almost as soon as wood is exposed to light and air, it begins to change color. This is especially true of unfinished wood, although stains and paint will also fade or discolor to some degree. Generally speaking, identical woods exposed to the same conditions will color identically. If they have not, something is wrong, and it usually indicates replacement of some sort, wrote Harold L. Peterson, author of the book, "How Do You Know It's Old?"
Patina is usually most noticeable on the unfinished surfaces, like the sides and bottom of a drawer, the backs of chairs or the underside of a tabletop. Various areas of a piece of furniture are more exposed to light and air than other areas, so there will be some differences in patina.
Mr. Liverant pointed out variations in color on the drawers of a 1780 tiger maple desk in his shop. The drawers of a secret compartment inside the desk were lighter than the drawers facing the outside.
"There's nothing like the patina that comes from time and use. Look at the mellowness and softness of the wood," he added. Mr. Liverant, a man who uses all his senses in appreciating fine antiques, noted that reproductions smell new.
Copies of antique furniture have not surpassed the work of 17th- and 18th-century cabinetmakers, who designed and made furniture that expresses simple elegance, Mr. Liverant said. "Show me some new furniture that has survived 200 years."

HEADLINE: Keeping Score;
Big Social Changes Revive the False God of Numbers

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, after a furious debate within his own party and even among his own advisers, President Clinton signed the most radical revision of the nation's welfare policy in history. Last week the President declared the change an unqualified success.
"I think it's fair to say the debate is over," Mr. Clinton said in St. Louis on Tuesday. "We know now that welfare reform works." 
 His evidence? A 1.4-million-person drop in welfare rolls nationwide over the past year.
But that figure proves only that the number of people on public assistance fell, not that welfare reform "works" to foster self-sufficiency. There are a score of possible explanations for the decline, some attributable to government policy, many wholly unrelated.
President Clinton is not the first chief executive to draw categorical conclusions from scanty data. But his declaration of victory in the war on welfare based on a single statistic illustrates the political pressure to keep score on complex issues of public policy. This pressure is especially evident now with so many hotly contested social and economic transformations under way, some only in their early stages. Although Washington places talismanic power in numbers as it tries to judge the good or bad of such changes, statistics have often proved a false god.
Who are the winners and losers in the new budget agreement? Who benefits most from the North American Free Trade Agreement? What are the social costs of affirmative action? Has the quality of health care deteriorated under managed care? How bad is corporate streamlining in a dynamic, competitive economy? Or wage stagnation at a time of low inflation and technology-driven improvements in the lives of ordinary people?
In the national obsession with market statistics, quarterly profits and the won-loss column, Government and private experts find themselves trying to measure the largely unmeasurable. They attempt to apply the scientific method to questions that do not lend themselves to simple quantification. In the name of accuracy or advocacy, they fashion a veneer of seeming numerical certainty over what are fundamentally questions of belief.
 
The What, Not the Why
 Americans love to keep score -- look at how much newsprint is devoted each day to the stock tables and the small-type charts in the sports section. But is it possible to reduce to numbers such questions as the success of a major shift in welfare policy or the social value of new pollution rules that will cost industry billions of dollars?
Governments try, every day. Whole bureaus are devoted to assessing the costs and benefits of programs based solely on numbers. Thus welfare reform is declared a success because the rolls are dropping by more than 100,000 people a month. New air-quality standards are justified at any cost because they will supposedly prevent precisely 15,000 deaths a year from respiratory ailments.
"This is the glory and the curse of the one-number summary," said Bruce Levin, a statistician at Columbia University's School of Public Health. "You take a hundred-dimensional problem like welfare reform and reduce it to one number."
While numbers have long been used to deceive and to manipulate public opinion -- Vietnam War "body counts" come to mind -- the more frequent problem is that they tell only part of the story. Statistics can sometimes describe the "what"; they seldom illuminate the "why." Of course, the alternative -- reliance on anecdote or the unsupported testimony of "experts" -- is even less useful.
Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution, an economist who oversaw the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995 and was thus Capitol Hill's chief scorekeeper, said that today's obsession with numbers is an overreaction to the past, when public officials were not held accountable for the results of their actions.
 
Tyranny of the Sound Bite

 In the search for precision in assessing policies, Washington has stepped off into the realm of the unknowable, he contended.
"We live in a society where policy evaluations have to fit into a sound bite, so there is a tendency to focus on quantitative measures even when they may not be measuring the most important dimensions," he said. "A full evaluation of most policies would be multi-dimensional and include both quantitative indicators and more subjective measures of success and failure."
Mr. Reischauer cited as an example studies that show that commuters spend more time in their cars getting to and from work because of traffic congestion and business relocations. According to a 1996 study, the average one-way commuting time lengthened by 40 seconds between 1986 and 1996, to 22.4 minutes. The widely reported conclusion was that since time spent on the freeway is wasted, the American quality of life was diminishing.
But what the survey doesn't reflect is that many of these commuters voluntarily moved farther from their jobs to bigger homes, greener lawns and better schools. And many say they enjoy the added time in their four-wheel-drive, air-conditioned, six-speaker capsules away from the pressures of home and office.
Similarly, raw statistics on divorce and labor force participation of women have been used to support wildly differing interpretations. Soaring divorce rates are cited to "prove" a breakdown in the family and worsening conditions for children. But are women in abusive relationships always better off staying married? Does that improve their children's lot?
And do the growing numbers of women in the work force mark the American family's effort to stay afloat in a time of falling wages -- or the professional liberation of millions of women?
Depends on your point of view.
Meaningful evaluations of public actions and social trends take years, sometimes decades. Only now are the mixed results of President Lyndon B. Johnson's anti-poverty programs becoming clear. Sorting out the effects of the 1996 welfare bill and several years of state welfare experiments that preceded it will similarly take years.
"You can't tell whether welfare reform is working simply from caseload numbers," said Wendell Primus, a welfare expert who quit the Administration in protest last summer over Mr. Clinton's signing of the welfare bill. Those figures do not tell how many former recipients moved from welfare to work, or simply from dependency to despondency, he said.
"You have to look at where these people went," Mr. Primus said. "In the short run, a year later, we just don't have the measurement tools to really assess the impact of all of this."
While Clinton Administration officials admit that there is a paucity of data to explain why so many people are leaving welfare rolls, they nonetheless say the falling number of recipients represents a stunning success.
"Certainly some of the success is due to a booming economy and very low unemployment," said Bruce Reed, the President's chief domestic policy adviser. "But there's also something else going on, which is, for the first time most states are taking welfare reform seriously and putting in place impressive programs to move people from welfare to work."
Analysts are employing ever-more-sophisticated models to measure the behavior of the economy and the consumer, but there will always be things they can't measure in a rapidly changing workplace.
As the United Parcel Service strike has dramatized, more employees are working part-time or on a contract basis than ever before. Has the United States become a nation of temps doing piecework for heartless corporations for want of better jobs? Or do the figures reflect decisions by a growing body of workers to trade full-time work and benefits for more freedom and family time? Do both situations coexist? And is the current state of the work force only a temporary phenomenon as the global economy undergoes seismic shifts based on new technologies?
Again, statistics can describe what is happening. They cannot necessarily explain why.
Professor Levin said that politicians labor in vain to apply the discipline of the hard sciences to matters of conjecture and opinion. The physical sciences like chemistry and physics proceed by controlled experiment, biology and medicine by longitudinal studies and clinical trials. In scientific inquiry, a statistician can locate sources of bias and error and try to correct for them.
But how does one measure the success of crime-control programs, or pre-kindergarten education or immigration policy? Statistics are tools of the scientist, Mr. Levin said. But when numbers are crunched in politics, axes are usually grinding, too.
DREAMS OF MY RUSSIAN SUMMERS
 By Andrei Makine
 Translated by Geoffrey Strachan
 241 pp. New York:
 Arcade Publishing $23.95.
ANDREI MAKINE's moving novel impressed me when I read it in the original French, and it has lost none of its qualities in Geoffrey Strachan's attentive translation. Upon its appearance in 1995, "Dreams of My Russian Summers" received both the Prix Medicis and the Prix Goncourt, the first time this double accolade had ever been awarded. The novel's Russian-born author, who sought asylum in France a decade ago at the age of 30, is a master of limpid French prose. It is therefore ironic that in order to have his first books published in Paris he had to pretend they were translations from Russian manuscripts. French publishers simply could not believe that a recently arrived emigre could write so well in their language.
In "Dreams of My Russian Summers," Makine employs a highly poetic voice to blend memory and imagination, merging the particular realities of Soviet life with a timeless evocation of a sensitive adolescence. Skillfully constructed and elegantly written, the novel records a series of eventful recollections that never descend to the trivial or the strictly anecdotal. Rather, everything contributes to a total effect -- even the dramatic ending, when the true meaning of a mysterious old photograph is revealed.
Makine has special gifts, but he also has a special story to tell. It is the story of Carlotte Lemonnier, born in France at the turn of the century, who as a child moved to Russia, where her father practiced medicine. Traveling back and forth over the years, she found herself in France on the even of World War I, only to return to Russia with a Red Cross mission during the Revolution. There she remained to see the horrors of civil war and famine, and later witnessed the Stalinist purges, the war with Germany, the dehumanizing industrialization of the country and ultimately the fall of Communism's idols. By the time her grandson, the novel's narrator, begins visiting her for his summer holidays, she has been long settled in the sleepy Siberian town where her Russian husband lies buried. Her story is that of a double allegiance: to her French past, for which she feels a sensuous nostalgia, and to her Russian destiny, which she accepts without flinching. Between these two worlds hangs an iron curtain.
Charlotte's grandson grows up loving and admiring the infinite compassion of this remarkable woman, her buoyant spirit, her moral strength. But what he loves above all is the splendor of the "grandmaternal tongue" in which she teaches him and his sister unforgettable lessons about poetry and freedom. The narrator is entranced by the stories Charlotte tells about the fabulous city of Paris during the belle epoque, stories she shares during long summer evenings on her balcony. In the process, she instills in the boy a sense of the beauty of the French language. Quoting Baudelaire, Nerval and Hugo, she introduces him to a world of dreams and hints at the secret meanings of words -- the way that subtly, often by indirection, they can succeed in saying the unsayable.
As Charlotte sits on her balcony under the halo of a turquoise lampshade, she creates a hypnotic mirage of memories, making France appear to the boy like a resurgent Atlantis. But for the narrator Russia has its own poetic associations. Makine vividly captures the dry air and silent vistas of the steppe, the smell of wet earth on the evening wind, the excitement the boy feels when fishing through the ice of a frozen river. There is also the special poetry of growing up: the pain, yearnings and loneliness of the vulnerable adolescent.
Viewed from the industrial city on the Volga where the narrator lives with is parents, Charlotte's France seems like another planet, a terra incognita whose singularity and unreality make him feel like a stranger in his own country. His grandmother's influence leads him to see Russia from a French point of view, which alienates him from the society around him. As his schoolmates taunt and bully him, he is increasingly isolated, ashamed of his eccentric thoughts, which he attributes to the implant of French culture. And indeed his Frenchness does seem a blemish at a time when "cosmopolitanism" is considered almost a crime in the Soviet Union. As he grows up, his French sensibility comes into conflict with what he considers the maleness of Russia. Feeling like a "strange mutant" unfit for the real world, he tries to erase his French identity and become like other youngsters, who are passionate about soccer matches and dream of driving tanks, who enjoy their paramilitary training and excel at dismantling and reassembling automatic rifles, at hurling practice grenades.
Yet even in the darkest moments of the struggle between his two identities, the narrator knows that alienation has its virtues, that perhaps one needs to be a foreigner to understand the country in which one lives, that his French illusion can become a form of protest against tyrannical encroachments and thus an instrument of liberation and survival. This is no doubt one of the meanings of the novel's original title, "Le Testament Francais," which is betrayed by the bland one chosen for the American edition. In French, a "testament" is a last will, a legacy, a posthumously revealed secret -- all of which are relevant to the essence of the story. "Testament" also connotes a linguistic legacy, one that confirms for the narrator the overwhelming power of literature.
But the American title is, in its way, appropriate too. For "Dreams of My Russian Summers" is not about France but about Russia: the Soviet Revolution, the ensuing massacres, the police state of Stalin and Beria, the enormous human sacrifices of the years following the German invasion of 1941, the bankrupt utopias of an empire surrounded by barbed wires, the drabness and vulgarity of daily life under Communism.
It is difficult to forget the novel's scenes of mutiliation and rape, its depiction of the brutish stupidity of officials and bureaucrats. Makine manages to suggest volumes in the silent glances that are exchanged after a black car has whisked away an entire family -- or in the manner by which the authorities eliminate people crippled in the war, who are grimly referred to as "samovars" because their stumps resemble the feet and handles of the familiar copper vessels used for preparing tea. At one point, Charlotte recalls a gruesome fight among these maimed survivors, who wield knives clenched between their teeth.
At times, it seems as if Makine is at his most effective when he sketches moments so painful that there appear to be no words to describe them, as when Carlotte's hideously scarred husband returns from the war and silent tears stream down her face after she sees the wounds on his naked body for the first time. Nonetheless, the power of words is always at the heart of the novel -- because the unspeakable requires a special language. Charlotte is most often portrayed in the act of reading, reciting, telling. Her mythical France is a bookish country. And so the circumstance of finding oneself between two languages is related to the magical displacements, the mediating authority, of literature.
For "Dreams of My Russian Summers" is also about a budding writer's need to invent a new language in order to reveal his secrets. And such a language, committed to changeless beauty and giving permanence to the fleeting moment, represents at its deepest level a struggle against death. Makine is telling a story about the apprenticeship of a writer as well as about the making of a book. It is a book about death and rebirth, about rescuing fragments of memory and not allowing them to disappear. If the epic background of war and revolution brings Pasternak to mind, it is also true that Proust's esthetic quest in search of a timeless time can be perceived subtly woven into these pages. Andrei Makine has given us a major novel.

THE MARKETS
Worst Slide for Stocks In Nearly Six Years
Stocks plunged late Friday as investors worried that equities may be overvalued, given the outlook for corporate earnings. Gillette, whose Braun unit had disappointing results in Germany, fell 4 1/8, to 85 15/16. Other large multinationals, including Procter & Gamble and General Electric, also fell, as traders began taking profits after the big run-up in recent months. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 247.37, or 3.11 percent, to 7,694.66 on Friday. In points, the drop was the steepest since a plunge of 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987. In percentage terms, it was the steepest decline since November 1991. With the loss, the Dow has fallen 6.8 percent from its record closing of 8,259.31 on Aug. 6. But the average is still up 19.3 percent for the year to date. The Nasdaq composite index fell 24.66 on Friday to 1,562.03.
 
THE ECONOMY
A Machine Keeps Humming
An avalanche of fresh economic data did little to change the prevailing view that growth is solid, inflation is subdued and Federal Reserve policy makers will stand pat on interest rates at their meeting this Tuesday. "Why fool with an economy so balanced?" asked Cliff Waldman, economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. Consumer prices climbed 0.2 percent in July, as expected, but producer prices fell for an unprecedented seventh consecutive month. Industrial output also expanded by only 0.2 percent last month. Retail sales, however, climbed 0.6 percent. The Labor Department reported that productivity rose at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the second quarter, but several economists and business people -- in a view that was far from universal -- insisted that the official data understated a flourishing efficiency. 

U.P.S. STRIKE
Unions Help Teamsters Dig In
Ratcheting up the stakes in the strike against United Parcel Service, John J. Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., announced that the nation's labor unions would lend the International Brotherhood of Teamsters $10 million a week for "many, many weeks" to provide benefits of $55 a week for the 185,000 striking workers. The move indicated that labor leaders, increasingly assertive, viewed the dispute as a pivotal showdown. With businesses and consumers feeling pressured, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman persuaded U.P.S. and the teamsters to resume talks with a Federal mediator, as the company hinted at new flexibility.
 
SHONEY'S SETTLEMENT
A Happier Son, for Now
Shoney's Inc. and Raymond D. Schoenbaum, a dissident shareholder whose father, Alex, founded the company 50 years ago, settled their differences, at least temporarily. Shoney's, which has lost 70 percent of its market value over the last three years, amended its bylaws to increase the number of its directors to 11 from 7, and named Mr. Schoenbaum and his ally, Michael J. Bodner, to the board. In return, Mr. Schoenbaum put aside plans for a proxy fight to replace the restaurant company's management, at least until May 1, 1998.
 
HOUSING PRICES
A Seller's Market, Again
For the first time in a decade, housing prices are rising nearly everywhere, helped by rising employment and a strong stock market. Indeed, 80 percent of the nation's metropolitan areas are showing an increase in home prices that exceeds the inflation rate. Bidding wars are no longer uncommon, particularly in affluent areas of northern New Jersey (where the median home price has risen to $203,600, up 4 percent from a year earlier), Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and Boston, as competing buyers push selling prices well beyond the asking price. The last time that happened was just before the stock market crash of 1987.
 
THAI BAILOUT
Japan Leads a Rescue
The International Monetary Fund and a group of Asian nations, led by Japan, agreed to a $16 billion rescue of Thailand's troubled financial system. And China, in a show of solidarity, said that it would extend $1 billion in emergency credit to Thailand. A currency crisis set off by a plunge in the baht has spread through South and Southeast Asia, threatening the region's rapid growth. The loan package is the second-largest international bailout, behind the $50 billion rescue of Mexico from the peso collapse of 1994-95. Thailand will use the money to help shore up its foreign reserves, depleted by a futile attempt to save the baht from devaluation last month.
 
A.M.A.'S DEAL
Selling a Seal of Approval
The American Medical Association, in a deal with Sunbeam, agreed for the first time to allow its name to be used in endorsing a line of products, including blood-pressure monitors, heating pads, thermometers, humidifiers and vaporizers. Royalty payments from Sunbeam, potentially millions of dollars, will provide the 150-year-old medical association more money for health, educational and research programs covering smoking, family violence, women's health and other health topics. Nevertheless, critics saw a potential conflict of interest that could compromise the association's objectivity.
 
ACQUISITIONS
An Exit From Packaging
W. R. Grace, seeking to focus on its main business of specialty chemicals, plans to divest itself of its packaging business. Essentially, Sealed Air, another big packaging company, will buy Grace's Cryovac packaging business in a complex deal valued at $5 billion. In the media industry, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, the Texas buyout firm that is already has a big presence in radio, agreed to acquire the Lin Television Corporation for $1.45 billion and to assume $260 million in debt. The acquisition, the firm's biggest, is its first major venture into television. Lin Television is 45 percent owned by AT&T, which announced in December that it planned to sell. And as expected, the F.C.C. approved the $25.6 billion merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex.
 
GAS GUZZLING
Big Cars, Bigger Oil Imports
Americans are driving ever-larger vehicles and consuming record quantities of gasoline this year, with about half of it coming from imported oil. Indeed, the nation's dependence on imported oil -- an average of 9.9 million barrels a day in the first half of the year -- is also setting records, as domestic oil production slowly declines. And that could make the economy vulnerable to any unexpected surge in oil prices. Imports were less than two-thirds as large, about six million barrels a day, during the last two oil crises, in 1973-74 and 1979, both of which provoked recessions after prices soared.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Montclair, N.J.;
Culture, Parks and Broad Social Diversity

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
MONTCLAIR is a magnet for young urban professionals seeking to raise their children in the suburbs but still thirsting for the culture and diversity of city life.
Although just 6.2 square miles in area, it has safe streets, abundant parks, 50 houses of worship, a well respected art museum and the 13,000-student Montclair State University. It also has some of the oldest local theater groups in the country, vibrant business districts and 38,000 trees, one for each resident of the township. 
 Its housing ranges from tiny colonials in low-income areas to $2.5 million mansions set back far from the road and hidden behind thick foliage. Many of the mansions lie along the eastern slopes of the Watchung Mountains, which form the western boundary of the town.
Perhaps one of the more unusual draws for newcomers is the racial situation. With a population that is roughly two-thirds white and one-third black, Montclair's residents take pride in the way the races get along. The residents often use the term "lighthouse" to describe the school system's policy of allowing liberal school choice as long as each school maintains a racial balance.
"We moved here because we wanted our children to grow up in a diverse, integrated town with a fully integrated school system," said Robin Ross, a lawyer, who with her husband, Dr. David Marks, a neurosurgeon, bought a four-bedroom colonial on Highland Avenue three years ago, moving from Hoboken. "At the time, we had a one-year-old daughter and were expecting twins," Ms. Ross said.
But a dispute that the couple is having with the public school system shows that the search for fairness has its price. Historically there have been sharp public disputes in Montclair over school integration, urban renewal and transportation, which often have divided people along racial lines. They are generally resolved through compromise, but sometimes they go to court.
Ms. Ross has filed suit against the school system protesting her daughter's exclusion from a pre-kindergarten program that starts in September. Although all students were being admitted three years ago when the Rosses moved in, just 175 of 285 applicants were accepted this year because of budget cuts. They were chosen on the basis of their presumed need to be prepared for kindergarten by the school system.
But Ms. Ross maintains that the effect of this was to discriminate unfairly against children from higher-income, better-educated families. "We feel cheated," she said.
The school system has a total of 6,722 students in seven elementary schools, two middle schools and Montclair High School. The system is based on "magnet" schools, each of which stresses different subjects and learning systems. For example, the kindergarten-grade 5 Bradford Academy is an information technology magnet that offers a core curriculum enhanced by courses on information gathering.
Other schools offer curriculums for the gifted or courses in science, technology and the environment. Parents may choose the magnet school, based on ability and interest of their child, with the proviso that racial balance is maintained.
According to statistics posted on the Montclair Chamber of Commerce Worldwide Web page, 10 percent of students from Montclair go to private schools, twice the New Jersey average.
EDNA Harris, interim Superintendent of Schools, called both middle schools and the high school as excellent. One middle school is a magnet for the arts; the other is oriented toward science and technology.
Of this year's graduating class of 348 in the 1,417-student Montclair High School, 85 percent went on to higher education. The high school offers advanced placement courses in biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, foreign languages, English and history.
The system is entering the final year of a $1 million, two-year technology overhaul that has already placed computers in every classroom. By the end of the next school year, all classrooms are expected to be networked together and have Internet availability. Montclair State University sends student teachers into the classrooms for experience and helps the school develop new teaching strategies.
Another town issue is transportation. Lately there have been rumblings in the black community over perceived discrimination in transportation planning. Charles L. Smith, town councilman from the mostly minority Fourth Ward, is angry about N.J. Transit's plans to link two lines that are three blocks apart in the Pine Street area. The plan, known as the Montclair Connection, has been under discussion for more than 30 years and still lacks final approval.
"The connection would save time for the passengers, but would go through 17 properties in a working-class neighborhood that doesn't use the train to go to work in New York City," Mr. Smith said.
Claims of discrimination are part of the dynamics of an unusually diverse community, in Township Manager Terence Reidy's opinion. "We have 38,000 people, with 38,000 viewpoints, and each feels it is his civic duty to express his viewpoint," he said.
One of the best-known figures in the black community, 77-year-old Rose Catchings, a Montclair resident for 44 years, said she had seen the town "open up" to minorities in housing, education and local government.
She noted that her late husband, the Rev. Dr. L. Maynard Catchings, was the first minority president of the local school board. But not enough is being done to combat crime and the drug problem in low-income areas, she said.
Disputing this, Police Chief Thomas J. Russo said that crime of all kinds has been reduced by 20 percent over the last five years to a rate of 48 reported incidents per 1,000 residents annually. There are 112 officers on the Montclair force -- 23 of them black, Chief Russo noted -- and a special task force of 9 deals with street crime. Seven officers work in the Drug Awareness Resistance Education program in the elemntary schools.
Montclair's early history foreshadowed its current diversity. The first Europeans settlers were the Speers, a Dutch family that in the 1660's built their houses on the mountain slopes in what us now Upper Montclair. Thirty years later two Englishmen, Jasper and Azariah Crane, left the overcrowded settlement of Newark and built their home two miles to the south.
The Dutch Speertown and the English Cranetown both prospered, sprawled and eventually met at the current Watchung Avenue. Although no Revolutionary War battles were fought in Montclair, General Washington had headquarters in Cranetown and General Lafayette had headquarters on the heights at Speertown.
In 1868, when the combined towns known as Montclair were part of Bloomield Township, the section seceded and formed the Township of Montclair. Five years later the Greenwood Lake Railroad, now part of the N.J. Transit line, arrived to link Montclair to Newark and New York and from 1880 to 1930 the population soared from 5,100 to 42,000. By then, most of the existing housing had been built.
ADRIANA O'Toole, a broker with Remax Professionals Realty, said that her current single-family listings ranged from $78,000 for a tiny, 2-bedroom ranch on Pine Street to $1.65 million for a 5-bedroom Tudor with a Manhattan view on Lloyd Road.
There are 6,410 rental units in 161 apartment buildings, garden apartment complexes and private homes. The largest apartment building is the 135-unit Hawthorne Towers, where rents start at $710 for some studios and go up to $1,300 for the largest 2-bedrooms, for which the building has a long waiting list.
Montclair has 10 condominium complexes with close to 500 units. Recent sales range from $15,600 for a 2-bedroom on Pine Street to $156,000 for a two-bedroom unit on the more prestigious Union Street.
Montclair has been known as a cultural center since the 1870's, when landscape artist George Inness began coming out from Manhattan to paint. Today, it is home to hundreds of artists, writers, actors and dancers. Olympia Dukakis, the actress, lives in town and is the artistic director of one of the four local theater companies.
The Montclair Art Museum, a colonnaded Greek Revival structure built in 1914, has a collection of more than 1,100 American art and relics, with a heavy emphasis on Indian items. It is open from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday and 1 to 5 P.M. Thursday and Saturday. Admission is $4 for adults, free for children 12 and under.
Montclair has seven shopping districts, four movie theaters and five supermarkets. One of the best-known local restaurants is Blue Sky on Bloomfield Avenue, with an eclectic cuisine that employs exotic spices and mushrooms and goat cheese.
The town has 18 public parks and 152 acres of parkland. There are 21 tennis courts, 7 playgrounds, 3 public swimming pools, 6 baseball diamonds and 4 basketball courts.
Among the more unusual public facilities is the Presby Memorial Iris Gardens in Mountainside Park on Upper Mountain Avenue. Dedicated in 1927, it has more than 4,000 varieties of irises and is on the National and State Registers of Historic Places.
It has two nature reserves -- the 20-acre Alonzo F. Bonsal Wildlife Preserve off Alexander Avenue and the 408-acre county-owned Eagle Rock Reservation, off Gates Avenue, known for its extensive network of nature trails.
 The Gazetteer listing with the article misstated the tax paid on a median-priced house. It is $9,500, not $5,940.
 The article also misstated the selection basis for the program. Of 172 children selected, 52 were picked based on the need to be prepared for kindergarten. The rest were chosen by what the Board of Education described as a racially balanced lottery.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption last Sunday about Montclair, N.J., misidentified a building in the lower right-hand photograph. It was the Montclair Art Museum, not part of Montclair State University.
Because of an editing error, the article misidentified the listing broker for two houses. The one for $78,000 was Joan Logan of the Fallivene Agency of West Caldwell, N.J.; for the $1.65 million house it was Linda Guilbert of the Stanton Company of Montclair; neither was Adriana O'Toole.
An article on Aug. 17 about living in Montclair, N.J., misstated the occupation of Dr. David Marks, a resident involved in a dispute over his child's rejection from a prekindergarten program. He is a neurologist, not a neurosurgeon.
An article on Aug. 17 about living in Montclair, N.J., included an outdated reference to the actress Olympia Dukakis. The Montclair theater group of which she was the artistic director is no longer in existence.

AN ART COLONY'S FOUNDER: George Inness, considered one of the finest landscape artists of the late 19th century, settled in Montclair in 1884, after frequenting the area and painting there for six years. Inness, his son, George, Jr. and his son-in-law, the portrait sculptor Jonathan Scott Hartley, formed the core of Montclair's early art colony. Inness's work, which combined scenery with signs of civilization, such as trains, houses and mill dams, was a departure from the wilderness scenes painted by the Hudson River School artists. At the Paris Exposition of 1900, an important international art event, Inness was hailed by critics as the father of the new American art.

HEADLINE: Tomorrow's Gossip Today

BYLINE: By Mark Katz; Mark Katz is a speechwriter, humorist and author.

 BODY:
Matt Drudge freely admits it: sometimes he's dead wrong. "I have no editor," the 30-year-old writer says. "I can say whatever I want." But his on-line gossip sheet, the Drudge Report, is rapidly becoming a must-read for the political and entertainment elites on both coasts. -- Newsweek

THE GRUDGE REPORT
Good morning, shameless gossip addicts and on-line character assassins! Rather than ruin my entire weekend waiting for actual tattles and tidbits from Barbra Streisand's nuptials to muddy my modem, I transmit this detailed report of the wedding -- before it even happened!
Remember, you heard it here first.
 
 BARBRA-PALOOZA'S MOSH PIT
THE GRUDGE REPORT has learned the names of the lucky few who sat on the dais with the bride and groom. Those honored include: President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her date, Senator Jesse Helms; Robert Kuttner, economics columnist; Stephen B. Hawking, physicist; Donna Karan, designer and gal pal; Prof. Anita Hill, and a furloughed Susan McDougal wearing either too-much jewelry or very tasteful manacles.
The presence of the Republican Senator from North Carolina kept the politically correct audience on edge all day.
The day's most tense moment came during the wedding vows when the room was asked: "If any one person wishes to hold up this entire wedding with a petty, personal objection, let him speak now or forever hold his peace."
Capitol Hill sources tell the GRUDGE REPORT that a subpoena will be issued to a wedding guest, the novelist Joyce Carol Oates, to answer allegations that President Clinton placed his hands on hers during a festive line dance immediately following dessert.
THE GRUDGE REPORT has learned the wedding was originally scheduled for the weekend of July 12 on Long Beach Island, N.J. But it was delayed until Mr. Brolin agreed to a prenuptial agreement that gave Ms. Streisand a line-item veto and the authority to subject him to means-tested Social Security benefits beginning in 2005.
Other sources close to Ms. Streisand said she was too involved in the recent budget negotiations to concentrate on wedding arrangements at that time.
 
SEEN & HEARD
. . . All nine of the Baldwin brothers were on hand, including the previously unknown Zeppo. Their attendance was conditional on a promise to be "poster boys for good behavior."
. . . The groom's agent at I.C.M. is confident his client can now demand double scale for all future Aamco commercials.
 
WOMEN IN BROWN
At the last minute, Donna Karan outfitted the bridal party in gowns of chocolate brown in an expression of solidarity with striking United Parcel Service employees. Her decision to wear only a single spaghetti strap across the left shoulder symbolized the insufficient support provided by part-time work schedules.
Other guests, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Feldman and Goldie Hawn were seen sporting brown ribbons and digital tracking codes.
 
ONE ENCHANTED SEMINAR
Sources reveal that Ms. Streisand and Mr. Brolin met for the first time in 1994 at a Hollywood Political Action Committee panel discussion of the Clinton Health Care Proposal.
Ms. Streisand was there to testify about the economies of scale that might be achieved under managed cooperative insurance groups while Mr. Brolin reprised his role from the popular television series "Marcus Welby, M.D." to offer insights from the medical community.
The chemistry between the two was obvious when Mr. Brolin announced, under oath, "Well, you look plenty healthy to me."
 
BRIDE COVERS THE ANGLES
The GRUDGE REPORT has learned that in addition to serving as musical arranger, choreographer, floral arranger and chief of protocol, the multi-talented Streisand also served as the wedding's director.
Guests report that the entire right half of the chapel was cordoned off so photographs of the bride could only be taken from the left side, which she prefers. However, the seating arrangement embarrassed the groom's family members, because it appeared as if they did not attend. Guests on the left side complained of the room's diffused lighting and a hazy, eclipsed view of the couple created by excessive use of gauze around the huppah.
 
AWKWARD MOMENTS
. . . Secret Service agents were visibly confused when the Marine Corps Band struck up "Hail to the Chief," after the President was already seated. No one informed them it was also the wedding's bridal march. Mr. and Mrs. Clinton later exited the room to the theme to "Hello, Dolly!"
. . . A momentary scuffle ensued when Ms. Streisand yelled at her own photographer for hounding her relentlessly throughout the wedding. Ms. Streisand's manager later agreed to pay for the damage to Ms. Leibowitz's camera.
 
GRUDGE REPORT EXCLUSIVE
The couple will honeymoon at Pocono Pine Inn, 5228 Independence Highway, East Stroudsburg, Pa., Cottage #4.

HEADLINE: P.L.O. Feels Pinch as Talks Open on Security Strategy

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Israeli and Palestinian officials alike said today that a closed-door meeting tonight could serve as an important test of the other side's willingness to ease tensions after a July 30 bombing in Jerusalem that killed 16 people.
The meeting of intelligence officials, with the United States serving as referee, marks the first under an arrangement worked out last week to share security information in a way designed to rebuild trust between Israelis and Palestinians. 
 The session was convened at a time of increasing international concern about the economic plight of the Palestinian Authority. Israel cut off nearly $40 million in payments to the Authority after the Jerusalem bombing on the ground that it was not doing enough to curb terrorism.
Under the peace accords, Israel is obligated to transfer to the Palestinians each month most of the tax, customs and other revenue it collects from Palestinian workers and consumers. This year, projected payments of more than $500 million amounted to nearly two-thirds of the Palestinian Authority's budget.
The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and his Government have managed to pay about 60 percent of the Authority's 80,000 employees the salaries they were owed for July, American officials said today. But Mr. Arafat has been able to do so only by persuading local banks to lend the Authority tens of millions of dollars, creating what Salam Fayyad, the International Monetary Fund's representative in the West Bank and Gaza, described as a "situation that is quite worrying."
Israel has said it would resume the payments only if the Palestinians crack down on militants, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded since the bombing. Aides to Mr. Netanyahu said they hoped that Palestinian officials would present evidence at tonight's meeting that such an operation had begun.
"We have reason to believe that something concrete will come out of it, but we just don't know for sure," said David Bar-Illan, the Prime Minister's communications director.
American officials have said they do not intend to comment publicly about the information shared in the meetings, and it appeared unlikely tonight that any of the other participants would do so.
It was at the urging of Dennis B. Ross, President Clinton's special envoy to the Middle East, that the Israelis and Palestinians agreed last week to share any information they have gathered about the bombing and about the measures each side has taken in response. Having an American intelligence officer on hand as an arbiter is intended to mute the bitter debate that has raged between Israelis and Palestinians since the bombing as to whether the Palestinian Authority is doing enough to combat terrorism.
Both in public and private, Mr. Ross has told the Palestinians the United States believes more should be done. But he also raised strong objections to Israel's resort to economic sanctions against the Palestinians. On Friday, the State Department spokesman, James B. Rubin, called them "counterproductive."
The United States was being represented by the C.I.A. station chief in Tel Aviv, whose identity is being withheld by American officials. Others attending tonight's meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah were representatives of the Israeli domestic intelligence service, Shin Bet, whom Israeli officials have similarly declined to identify. The Palestinian side was to be represented by Mohammed Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub, who head the Palestinian Preventive Security forces in Gaza and the West Bank, respectively.
In one sign that the two sides have resumed some security cooperation, Israeli officials said that on Saturday night Mr. Netanyahu dispatched an envoy to thank Mr. Arafat in person for the help provided by Palestinian forces over the weekend in tracking down the killers of an Israeli taxi driver. The driver disappeared late Thursday night, and after close coordination between the two sides, his body was discovered by Palestinian police late Friday in the West Bank.
By Saturday afternoon, three young Palestinian men, who said their plan was merely to steal the man's car, had been arrested, tried and convicted of murder in a Palestinian court. All were sentenced to prison, two of them to life terms.
But for the most part, the Israelis and the Palestinians continued all weekend to display the mutual mistrust that has characterized their relationship since the July 30 bombing. Indeed, some Israeli officials suggested darkly today that, far from a gesture of goodwill, the swiftness shown by the Palestinians in convicting and sentencing those it held responsible for the slaying of the taxi driver may have been motivated mostly by a desire to prevent what surely would have been an Israeli request to extradite the men for trial in an Israeli court.
For now, Mr. Bar-Illan said today, the Government is withholding judgment about the Palestinians' handling of the case. What was most important, he said, is that the Palestinians employ the same kind of dispatch in reining in the Islamic extremists whom Israel has accused of carrying out acts of terrorism.
Israel's refusal to release money owed to the Palestinians is a clear violation of the peace accords signed by the two sides, and Mr. Arafat condemned it over the weekend as an attempt "to steal money" that "belongs to the Palestinian people."
After using similarly harsh language against the Palestinians, Mr. Netanyahu has taken a four-day vacation this weekend, and he has remained mostly out of the public eye. But other Israeli officials have continued to defend the move as necessary to persuade the Palestinians to cease their own violations of agreements under the accords to provide full security cooperation with the Israelis and to combat terrorist organizations.
One new source of friction that has emerged in recent days is a plan by Mr. Arafat to bring together most Palestinian factions for what he has called national unity meetings this week. Among those invited to the gathering are officials from two militant Islamic groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, regarded by Israel as terrorist organizations. Mr. Arafat has held such gatherings before, and he defended the plan today as necessary to maintain dialogue among all Palestinians, even those who are his rivals. But Mr. Bar-Illan, the Netanyahu aide, criticized the decision as amounting to "a kind of appeasement."

HEADLINE: Europe's Late Converts to Reform

 BODY:
Earlier this month, the Romanian Government shut 17 money-losing state factories, relics of the Communist era. The closure is the latest sign that Romania is braving worker protests to stick to harsh but necessary free-market reforms. Until a few months ago, Romania and Bulgaria clung to Socialist subsidies and state enterprises while other Eastern European nations liberalized their economies. In both nations, economic devastation forced a more responsible course, including the election of more democratic and competent leaders.
Until April, Bulgaria was led by former Communists hostile to reform or by conservative leaders so distracted by infighting that they did almost nothing to modernize the economy. Last winter 90 percent of the people fell below the poverty line. In 1989, Bulgaria was richer than Poland. Last winter Poland lent Bulgaria 100,000 tons of wheat. 
 After public protests forced aside the Socialists, an interim Government signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to end the wanton printing of money, privatize banks and state enterprises and liberalize markets. The coalition of rightist parties that won elections in April seems chastened by its past failures and has continued with reforms. Last month it introduced an austere budget and pegged its currency to the German mark. Bulgaria's politicians have seemed refreshingly willing to work together, but this political maturity may be tested because Bulgaria will probably show no substantial growth until 1999.
In Romania, reform was slowed for seven years by President Ion Iliescu, a former Communist who led a corrupt and authoritarian regime. He was defeated in November by Emil Constantinescu, a geology professor. He and his impressive Prime Minister, Victor Ciorbea, are modernizers committed to Western-style liberalism. They have improved relations with Romania's neighbors, Hungary and Ukraine, and have included the party of the Hungarian minority in the Government. Both measures were taken in part to enhance Romania's chances of joining NATO. Mr. Constantinescu also seems to have dropped Mr. Iliescu's practice of suing or prosecuting critical journalists.
The Government talked about reforms for several months and received large loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, but, distracted by its campaign to join NATO, it did little until the privatizations this month. The reforms will likely face serious opposition, not only from Romania's powerful labor unions, but also from politicians in the Government coalition.
The pain of subsidy cuts and closure of inefficient state enterprises will try the commitment of both nations to reform. They will need support from the West, strictly conditioned on adherence to their reform plans. The United States and Europe can also encourage the foreign investment both nations desperately need. The temptation to flinch will be great, but the two nations should not forget the misery brought by their reluctance to shed old habits.

HEADLINE: A Reborn Erie Canal

 BODY:
Historically, New York State has done a poor job of opening up its extensive marine environment for commercial and recreational use, shortchanging its citizens and economy. That may be changing. On Thursday, the Federal Government threw a lifeline to a faltering upstate project to transform the Erie Canal from a marginally useful ditch into a vibrant recreational waterway for boaters, hikers and tourists. That followed an agreement a few days earlier in which the state and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad promised to provide fishermen and boaters easier access to the Hudson River.
A rejuvenated Erie Canal could well provide the economic stimulus that upstate New York has been looking for, and lead to the resurrection of many small communities that time has passed by. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Andrew Cuomo, had just that goal in mind when he announced that his agency would provide $137 million in loans and grants to 57 cities and towns along the 524 miles that make up the Erie canal and three linked canals that stretch from Buffalo to Albany and up to Lake Champlain. Combined with funds from private sources and from the Canal Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York State Thruway Authority, the Federal funding should be enough to return life and commerce to a historic waterway that was all but abandoned a decade ago. 
 There was some interesting historical symmetry in Mr. Cuomo's announcement, as well as obvious long-term political benefits for his own career, The idea for reviving the Erie Canal first took wing during his father's tenure as Governor of New York, and the man who did more than anyone else to carry it forward was Peter Tufo, whom Mario Cuomo had named to run the New York State Thruway Authority. Mr. Tufo, well aware that the Thruway itself had helped render the 170-year-old canal obsolete, decided that one way to make amends was to create a riverine playground and, with it, a bustling waterfront economy along the canal. The Federal money will be used to help create important parts of that economy -- housing, marinas, shops, restaurants, museums and other tourist attractions.
It is also nice to see some of those tax dollars that flow in such profusion from New York to Washington flow back. Further, with the Federal money in hand, the canal project will require little from the state budget -- which is just as well, since Gov. George Pataki and his administration have never been wildly enthusiastic about an idea they felt was foisted on them by their Democratic predecessors.
Still, there is plenty that Mr. Pataki can do to demonstrate that he, too, has an interest in exploiting the state's abundant waterways for the public good. First, he can follow through on his pledge last April to add $100 million in state money to a like amount already pledged by New York City to create a waterfront park stretching from 59th Street in Manhattan to Battery Park -- a stretch once occupied by the old West Side Highway and now dominated by rotting piers. He has supported the restoration of this area, but the project needs his continuing attention.
Second, he can think anew about a controversial but useful proposal to create a 23-acre riverfront park on Manhattan's Upper West Side, adjacent to the old Penn Central railroad yards where Donald Trump plans to build high-rise apartments. Creating public access to the river would involve moving part of the existing West Side Highway inland and covering it with an ample lawn sloping to the river.
There is little enthusiasm for this idea among the Governor's associates and in the Giuliani administration, where it is seen as a luxury. Our own view is that it constitutes a rare chance to recapture a big chunk of the riverfront for recreational purposes. But it will never happen without the political will that the upstate mayors and a few of Mr. Cuomo's officials brought to an idea that seemed equally remote 10 years ago -- the rebirth of the Erie Canal.

HEADLINE: China Considers U.S. Suggestions for Summit Harmony

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
Visiting China last week, President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, made his best case to President Jiang Zemin about how to produce a substantive and image-enhancing summit meeting here at the end of October. But the Chinese are still debating necessary steps on human rights and the export of weapons and other dangerous materials, senior American officials say.
Chinese leaders, at their summer retreat of Beidaihe, are hammering out major personnel changes before next month's Party Congress, which is held only once in five years. They must decide who will replace the conservative Li Peng, who has completed his terms as Prime Minister, and what job Mr. Li will receive. 
 But the Chinese are also discussing summit meeting issues, American officials say. They add that Mr. Jiang is eager to have a useful and substantive but noncontroversial state visit to the United States to help seal his supremacy at home after the death of Deng Xiaoping.
"We're throwing ideas at them and suggesting how to bridge the gaps toward some real agreements," one senior official said. "They've got some things to think over."
In public, Mr. Berger is playing down the prospect of "dramatic breakthroughs" during the long-anticipated summit meeting, scheduled for Oct. 28. But in China, he laid out various initiatives Mr. Jiang could take to make the meeting more substantive, attract fewer protesters and reduce Congressional criticism.
Those steps include the completion of a "road map" on human rights issues, which would include the release from prison on medical grounds of noted dissidents like Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng and an agreement to let the International Committee of the Red Cross make prison visits in China. The United States also wants China to resume serious human-rights discussions with American officials and nongovernmental organizations, to invite noted American religious leaders to visit China, and to sign a United Nations Covenant on social and economic rights.
China's imprisonment of political dissidents and leaders of religious groups not sanctioned by the Government has drawn considerable anger among both human rights groups and members of Congress. And the F.B.I. is investigating charges that the Chinese funneled money into the 1996 election campaign.
"Berger made crystal clear the difficulty Jiang will face in the U.S. in terms of public, media and Congressional reaction, especially about human rights and religion," said another senior official. "He pitched it in terms of things they should be thinking about now to make the summit better, arguing that they should think of the summit as starting now and ending Oct. 30."
The Chinese leaders engaged "in great detail" in "a clear, candid discussion, with questions," another official said. "I think Jiang gets it."
The Chinese complained to Mr. Berger about pervasive anti-China sentiments in Congress, the officials said, and again denied that the Chinese Government illegally funneled money into the 1996 American elections. They also urged Mr. Berger to stem support in Washington for a more independent Taiwan.
For the summit meeting, President Clinton would like to be able to certify that China is now careful enough about nuclear exports that a 1985 nuclear cooperation agreement can finally go into effect. The pact would allow American companies like Westinghouse and General Electric to sell commercial nuclear equipment to China, including reactors.
American officials say much progress has been made on the nuclear issue, especially during Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's fourth meeting this year with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China, last month in Malaysia.
But snags remain. The United States first wants to insure that China will not share any nuclear equipment, technology or training with Pakistan or Iran. A combination of American pressure and a poor Iranian payment history led China recently to suspend a sale of two nuclear reactors, and it appears to have canceled the sale of a uranium-conversion plant that particularly worried Washington.
China has kept to its May 1996 deal with the United States not to assist any unsafeguarded nuclear program, meaning that of Pakistan. But China has not yet put into place effective export controls for nuclear materials, components and especially dual-use materials -- which could be used either for peaceful purposes or a weapons program.
In August, the Chinese State Council approved a national export control program in priniciple, the officials say, but the Americans are pressing China hard to put the program into effect and to develop a similar set of controls on dual-use items.
Finally, the Americans want China to take part in a nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty committee of equipment suppliers, known as the Zanger committee, that prepares lists of equipment that should not be exported. Mr. Qian told Ms. Albright last month that China would join and attend its first such meeting in October, the officials said.
In the past, the United States has imposed sanctions on China for nuclear and missile sales to Pakistan and Iran. On May 21, after many warnings, the United States imposed sanctions on some Chinese chemical companies for knowingly selling Iran materials that can be used to make chemical weapons. The Americans are also concerned about the ongoing sales to Iran of Chinese anti-ship cruise missiles, C-801's and C-802's, fearing that Iran's acquisition of such weapons would raise tension in the Persian Gulf.
But at a time of such political transition and uncertainty in China, American officials say, they do not expect China to make a serious offer of economic reform that would ease their way into the World Trade Organization, though the two Presidents will discuss those issues as well.

HEADLINE: Little Shaken, Small Investors Say Stock Plunges Are to Be Expected

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Bud Sadoff was sitting in front of his computer terminal last Friday when the big stock market plunge began. And his television set, not too far away, was tuned to CNBC financial news.
As he watched, the Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply, culminating in a 247-point loss, the biggest one-day selloff in almost six years.
But the 64-year-old retired engineer, who has made a hobby of tracking the market's every move, was unshaken by the news. 
 "I don't think it's all that surprising," Mr. Sadoff said in a telephone interview from his home in Chevy Chase, Md. "It'll go down another 100 or 150 points, but I'm not that nervous."
Mr. Sadoff is unfazed because market adjustments like this have repeatedly occurred in a long bull market that many analysts say began in 1982. He remembers October 1987, when the Dow plummeted 508 points in a single session, to 1,738.41. Yet just 12 days ago, the blue-chip index reached 8,259.31, a fourfold gain.
It is that kind of return that has drawn millions of first-time investors into the stock market in the last decade. And it is that kind of investor attitude that has kept the market upbeat, even in sharp downturns like the current one.
Of course, no one is willing to say that the Dow will not fall further this week, but few of the dozens of investors interviewed this weekend believe that the market is seriously ailing, or about to collapse. Indeed, many displayed a degree of self-assuredness that seemed to border on arrogance.
"Yes, a 247-point drop is a big number," said Lou Methner, 70, of Denver. "But out of how many Dow points?"
7,942.
"And what was the Dow at six months ago?"
6,988.
"Well, there you go. It's been a good run this year."
This is much the same sentiment that was expressed in March and April, when the Dow tumbled 9.8 percent over several weeks after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to slow what appeared to be an overheating economy.
But then, as now, confident investors said they considered the downturn in market prices to be a good buying opportunity.
Still, with the Dow off 6.8 percent in the last seven sessions, some people on Wall Street wonder whether the market will now see its first 10 percent decline since 1990. This is the longest stretch that the Dow has ever gone without such a drop. And some Wall Street analysts wonder whether reaching that level might depress investor sentiment.
On the whole, though, analysts are unshaken by the market's recent slide, partly because they had been calling for such a pullback. After all, the Dow was up nearly 29 percent in little more than three months, and that kind of pace cannot be sustained, they said. Broader market gauges, like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, have also risen sharply.
To those analysts, the selloff might have been sparked by any of a number of reasons: the United Parcel Service strike, for example, which created fears of rising labor costs. Or a spurt of selling linked to the recent reduction in the capital gains tax rate. Or warnings of profit slowdowns from Coca-Cola and Gillette, which had been two of the steadiest performers.
But many individual investors pointed out that the market had been spooked before by similar concerns, only to rebound. In other words, the decline is only a mild correction, they said over and over, using the Wall Street lingo for a sharp, but temporary, price decline that interrupts a longer, upward trend. Some called it a buying opportunity, and others suggested that a short-term slump was healthy for the market.
This is the individual investor as stock market guru. And why not? While some of Wall Street's best-known strategists have been bearish for years, Americans have been piling into the stock market in droves. The explosion of money invested in mutual funds, notably in 401(k) retirement plans, is what has given the bull market its momentum.
Besides, they say, the economy is humming along, inflation seems to be absent, interest rates are stable, the dollar is king and corporate profits remain strong. There is even talk that the economy has entered a qualitatively new era, one in which all these market-friendly trends converge and can be sustained.
Of course, last week -- as the market was sliding -- mutual fund companies began reporting that the big inflows of July had slowed, and even turned around, according to Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a tracking service. About $3.2 billion was redeemed from stock funds last week, the biggest pullback since the late-winter selloff. But many investors interviewed this weekend said that they had sold some shares simply to take profits after the recent gains and to wait out the current downturn -- not to flee.
Indeed, it is that kind of investor -- investors like Robert Boisselle -- who are powering the bull run. Mr. Boisselle, a retired real estate broker in Redding, Calif., tunes in to financial news every day, and calls up his stock portfolio on the Internet each evening. His advice to friends: stay the course.
"We had a pretty fat correction on Friday," he said. "But I've been through corrections before. In fact, I look forward to them as a cleansing of the market."
Vince Capurso, a tax lawyer in New York, also sees therapeutic effects in a quick, sharp downturn. In fact, for more than a year, he has been slightly bearish on the market, worrying that his fellow investors were too euphoric.
"I've got a friend who, at 50 years old, retired and got a severance package," he said. "He took that money and invested it, and he's been making 30 or 40 percent a year. Now he has a couple million in the stock market, and he wants to be a money manager. He thinks it's so easy to make money, but the fact is, these are the golden years."
In fact, Mr. Capurso said, four of his six closest friends all want to quit their jobs to become money managers. A nice correction, he said, might temper such exuberance.
While Mr. Capurso frowns on overly optimistic market sentiment, he believes that the heightened interest in the market will help buoy its long-term prospects and prevent a small downturn from becoming a collapse. Ordinary investors, he reasons, are more sophisticated than ever, aided by technological advances that bring Main Street and Wall Street closer.
Throughout the country, investors are trading shares over the Internet, tuning in to financial news networks and even wearing beepers to track companies that plan to split their stock; these investors believe that splits augur well for a company's future, and they quickly buy those shares on such news.
Indeed, market news just will not go away. CNBC superimposes minute-by-minute Dow industrial figures, allowing viewers access to every uptick or downtick. CNBC can also be seen by passersby in Times Square, on a gigantic outdoor television screen.
But that is not all. Customers at Brooks Brothers, while hunting for a nice new blazer, can check stock quotes at a Bloomberg financial news terminal. The Regency Hotel in New York also has a Bloomberg terminal, in its restaurant.
There are also scores of Internet sites devoted to the markets, like Wall Street City, or the Silicon Investor for technology-stock buffs. And on the World Wide Web, stock talkers were debating over the weekend whether the market was primed for a full-fledged crash.
On a Web site devoted to the market, one disturbed investor posted a message that read: "In the past two weeks, the Dow is down 7 percent. I am sick and tired of people calling this a technical correction. The fact is the market is crashing."
But another replied: "I think it is a normal (probably overdue) correction. Why do you think we will have a crash? What economic/political/financial event has given you this belief?"
As for Mr. Sadoff, the unperturbed engineer, he said he would wait out the downturn and then sink more cash into the market. "I've been lightening up on stocks a little in the past few weeks," he said. "But when the charts start to show it's safe, I'll start sticking my toe in the water again."

HEADLINE: Dark-Horse Albanese Seeks His Stride

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Sal F. Albanese spent just three minutes the other day discussing his mayoral candidacy in the basement of a Greenwich Village church, finally giving up after trying to compete for attention in a clamorous room filled with elderly New Yorkers more interested in the 75-cent plates of chicken, corn and watermelon than in a serving of mayoral politics.
"Does anyone have a question for our mayoral candidate here?" asked Caryn Resnick, the moderator of the "Ninth Annual Political Picnic" at Our Lady of Pompei Church on Carmine Street. She scanned the steamy basement, filled with delegates from three local senior-citizen groups, most of them Democrats and more than a few wearing Giuliani buttons. 
 "We have no questions for our mayoral candidate?" Ms. Resnick continued. She paused again. "Are there any questions?" There were not, so Mr. Albanese smiled cordially, thanked his audience, and gamely proceeded to work the room before heading for the stairs.
Six months ago, Mr. Albanese, a personable Councilman from Bay Ridge with an iconoclastic voting record and some definite ideas about ways to defeat Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, loomed as potentially the most unpredictable force in the mayoral contest.
He appeared, on paper at least, the perfect challenger to Mr. Giuliani: an Italian Catholic from a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood, a former public-school teacher, a liberally inclined Council member who had represented one of the most conservative districts in the city for 15 years. So it was that Mr. Albanese seemed to be in the best tradition of the dark-horse candidate: the unconventional scrapper, poised to topple first the Democratic front-runner, Ruth W. Messinger, and then the Mayor himself.
Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader and one of Mr. Giuliani's main political advisers, said that he had long feared that Democrats, tepid at the prospect of a Messinger candidacy, would surprise Mr. Giuliani and select Mr. Albanese in the Sept. 9 primary. "Albanese would be the stronger candidate," Mr. Harding said.
But in politics, what looks good in the script often does not look quite as good on the stage -- and particularly, it seems, when it comes to the understated and underfinanced Mr. Albanese.
With just three weeks to go until the primary, Mr. Albanese's candle remains unlighted. He is still the little-known Councilman from Brooklyn, trailing in polls and, to his constant irritation, struggling to break into the pages of the city's newspapers or onto the television news shows with his singular message: a dramatic curb in campaign contributions and a warning that New York is in danger of becoming a city of two economic classes, the rich and the poor.
 Mr. Albanese's best hope may be a burst of late television advertising. But he cannot afford it: fund-raising efforts have been so lackluster that he will be forced this week to head to Buffalo to produce advertisements -- it is cheaper to film there than in the city where he wants to be mayor.
New York primaries are always unpredictable, and Mr. Albanese said that a combination of factors could thrust him into the lead after Labor Day. Those factors could include the lack of enthusiasm for Ms. Messinger, a strong showing by the Rev. Al Sharpton -- particularly after the attention he received in the days following the allegations of police brutality in Flatbush -- and what Mr. Albanese described as the compelling rationale of his own candidacy.
"We're beginning to climb and she's beginning to decline," Mr. Albanese said, referring to Ms. Messinger. "I happen to believe that even though we're working hard -- we're working seven days a week -- the bottom line is people still aren't paying attention. I believe the last three weeks will be critical.
"I'm very happy with the way our campaign is being conducted," he said. "We're raising some very important issues that the other candidates aren't raising."
But as the primary approaches, Mr. Albanese may be almost alone with that perception. "Potentially, it is there: but it would take a massive, massive Messinger mistake at this point," said Hank Morris, a Democratic consultant. Indeed, talk about Mr. Albanese has shifted -- if unfairly -- from what might have been to what went wrong.
"He was fresh," said Henry A. Sheinkopf, a consultant who worked for the now-ended mayoral campaign of Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President. "He was entirely candid. He was certainly the least disingenuous quantity I've seen in politics for along time, and he was an outspoken ethnic who appeared to relate to people in the outer boroughs. But it never jelled."
Mr. Albanese has heard these tidings, yet pushes ahead optimistically, alternating between bursts of frustration and wry humor. So when the sound system failed in Brownsville after he had waited 30 minutes for the chance to speak for 30 seconds (someone had stepped on the plug), Mr. Albanese just grinned, if tightly. "A bad omen," he said. And when State Assemblyman William F. Boyland of Brooklyn introduced him as someone with the "dubious distinction of running for mayor," Mr. Albanese hiked an eyebrow and muttered to himself: "Did you hear that? Dubious distinction?"
The other morning at Times Square, Mr. Albanese even seemed unfazed as many people rushed past him, ignoring his pleas for them to stop so he could register them to vote. He did not even seem to mind that a young aide in aviator sunglasses kept bellowing at his back, "This is your last chance! This is your last chance!" -- a reference not to Mr. Albanese's electoral prospects but to the voter registration deadline.
"Here's my analysis, and I know the city pretty well," Mr. Albanese said as his campaign van bounced along the Belt Parkway. "If you got problems in your own base -- which Ruth has -- and then she doesn't have a real appeal in the outer boroughs, and to top that off, she was banking on a heavy African-American vote, which isn't going to be there . . . " Mr. Albanese ended the sentence with a "Well-what-do-you-think-is-going-to-happen?" shrug of the shoulders.
Still, a few hours later, Mr. Albanese let his poise slip for a moment, turning in his seat to inquire, "Will you be shocked if I pull it out?"
A number of things are working against him. He is not a particularly accomplished campaigner; on the stump, his words come out in a quick and mumbled monotone. Mr. Albanese's lack of campaign funds reinforces his indistinct image. While Ms. Messinger drives in a van filled with six aides, Mr. Albanese travels with a single assistant, who drives the car, guides the candidate from apartment complex recreation rooms to street fairs, and hands out literature.
To succeed, observers say, Mr. Albanese has to find a way to emerge from two shadows at once: Ms. Messinger's and Mr. Giuliani's. And he has to do that as a City Councilman who is barely known outside his own neighborhood.
In truth, Mr. Albanese has distinguished himself with the kind of explicit and contrary campaign themes that are rarely heard from Ms. Messinger (though such ideas are often floated by Mr. Sharpton).
His central argument is that campaign contributions should be sharply reduced. "It's one of the big issues in the campaign," he said. "The system is polluted. The system is being driven by big money so that what happens is when you get there, you simply can't run the city properly."
Mr. Albanese has said he would support some tax increases -- like a change in the city's tax structure that would increase the tax rate on the wealthy. "People are willing to pay a little more if they can get something in return," he said.
And Mr. Albanese's style, if low-key, can be endearing to voters more accustomed to the higher-voltage breed of politician. "I wish he were running for another office so I could vote for him," said Anita Schmidt, a Democrat from Manhattan, who plans to vote for Mr. Giuliani. "He seems like a fine, decent man."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Albanese has his dark moments. He refers to Ms. Messinger as the "alleged front-runner," and complains that Ms. Messinger's excitable and quotable press secretary, Leland T. Jones, gets more public attention then he does.
He is most displeased with the media, which he describes as biased in favor of the Mayor. "I happen to believe that Messinger is the weakest candidate against Giuliani and I think there are some in the media who are trying to prop up Messinger so she can be Giuliani's opponent," Mr. Albanese said. "I just don't think we're getting a fair shake."
But Mr. Albanese endures, and people seem to notice that -- though it remains to be seen if that will count for much on Election Day.
"Giuliani is a shoo-in," said Sylvia Seidman, a Democrat and a retired school teacher who lives in Chelsea, after shaking Mr. Albanese's hand at the Greenwich Village church. "But this guy is trying so hard, I have to give him credit. He may not win, but maybe next time."

Dr. Doom Becomes Dr. Pangloss

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Every economist gets used to the ridicule. We peddle the "dismal science." We know the price of everything, but the value of nothing. Two economists produce three conflicting opinions. But now, courtesy of researchers at Harvard, comes news that it is the economists who think the nation is in fine shape and everyone else who predicts doom and gloom. To a practitioner, this turnabout feels good.
The dismal science crack came from Thomas Carlyle, reacting in part to the late-18th-century nostrums of Thomas Malthus, who predicted that population growth would eventually drive wages down to starvation levels. In the process, rents would rise, making landlords rich and planting the seeds of ferocious, unending class warfare. It was definitely a dismal vision. It was also spectacularly wrong. Yet every few years another group of economists resurrects the Malthusian vision, re-establishing economists' reputation as doom-sayers. 
 But the economists' gloomy reputation goes beyond these Malthusians. We compulsively remind people to eat their spinach. Where others fantasize about the benefits from this or that government subsidy or regulation, we wallow miserably in contemplation of the costs. Ordinary human beings ponder the beauty of perfectly clean air over the Grand Canyon. Economists calculate the extra dollars it would cost to remove 1 percent of the ozone that fouls the air. The profession, in short, is methodologically small bore, and rarely exhilarating.
But perhaps all that is changing. The poll by Harvard, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and The Washington Post shows massive role reversal. Almost 30 percent of the ordinary public thinks that living standards will fall over the next five years. But -- and pay attention here -- less than 10 percent of economists agree. In the survey, no economists believe that technology hurts the economy. (Who says no two ever agree?) By contrast, nearly one-fifth of the general public thinks that technology actually hurts.
Indeed, economists nowadays seemingly see good everywhere. Almost 90 percent think trade makes us richer, and over half even think downsizing is good for the economy. Almost a third of the public fears trade and a large majority condemns downsizing.
One possible explanation for this odd switch is that the public is often misled by gloomy and outdated information. At the time of the survey, 1996, unemployment was at a 7-year low and inflation at a 30-year low. But many citizens did not know these facts. Less than a third of the public knew that the economy had been recovering and adding jobs. Seventy percent of the public, but only about 20 percent of the economists, believed, incorrectly, that family living standards had been on the decline.
I have to admit, however, that an alternative explanation of these figures strengthens the canard that economists know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Economists take solace from the numbers: average incomes are rising. But because of soaring inequality that concentrates winnings in relatively few hands, many families see little or none of the gain. The economists are right on the numbers, but the families may be right on the facts. O.K., so we may have made another mistake. At least this time, we are the ones who are smiling. MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

INTERNATIONAL A3-9
 
A Mexican Tale of Drugs, Crime, Torture and the U.S.
The case of Alejandro Enrique Hodoyan, an American citizen who was kidnapped and detained illegally in Mexico, illustrates the perils for the United States of working with the secretive Mexican military, which has been given a central role in the drug war despite a growing record of corruption and brutality. A1
 
Mexico Challenged on Rights
Human rights groups released a report rebutting the Mexican Government's previous claims of cracking down on torture. The organizations said that Mexico has manipulated statistics to cast a better light on its human rights record. A9 

Optimism in India and Pakistan
Prime Minister I. K. Gujral of India and his counterpart in Pakistan have used their countries' 50th anniversary to say they want peace, more relaxed borders, arms reductions and increased trade. But in almost the same breath, the two leaders set conditions that seem likely to thwart their efforts. A3
 
Arabs and Israelis Meet
A closed-door meeting of Israeli and Palestinian officials, with the United States serving as referee, was convened in Jerusalem in an effort to share security information and rebuild trust lost since last month's deadly marketplace bombing. The session comes at a time of financial difficulty for the Palestinian Authority, because Israel has stopped making payments that had been agreed to in peace accords. A3
 
South Africa Talks to Resume
The Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party said it would return to peace talks with President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress after a 10-day boycott. The talks are aimed at stopping a conflict that has claimed more than 10,000 lives in the KwaZulu Natal province over the past decade. Inkatha withdrew from the talks to protest what it called bias by the panel charged with investigating politically motivated crimes during apartheid. (AP)
 
A New Problem for Mir
A new misfortune befell the battered Mir space station when officials at the Mission Control Center outside Moscow put off its planned docking with the Progress supply ship, citing a malfunction in an on-board computer. The docking -- the same kind of maneuver that ended in a collision for Mir's previous crew -- is to take place today. (AP)
 
Six Die in Kenyan Violence
Machete-wielding youths killed at least five people, burned houses and sent hundreds of terrified residents packing in violence along Kenya's coast. Officials said the police shot and killed one suspected raider. Tensions are on the rise ahead of this year's elections. On Saturday, two opposition leaders accused President Daniel arap Moi's Government of orchestrating the violence as an excuse for a crackdown on the opposition, a move reminiscent of the state-sponsored ethnic clashes that marred the 1992 elections. (AP)
 
NATIONAL A10-16
 
Clinton Strongly Urges End to U.P.S. Strike
Striking U.P.S. drivers in Riverside, Calif., gathered food for their families as negotiations continued in the two-week-old strike. President Clinton, making his strongest comments so far about the importance of reaching a settlement, called on the teamsters' union and the company to end the walkout. A1
 
Not since last Christmas have officials at the headquarters of the United States Postal Service had to cope with such a nationwide torrent of parcels. The Postal Service, which has about 761,000 career employees, has hired about 4,100 temporary workers to help handle the overflow caused by the U.P.S. strike and has resorted to Sunday deliveries in some cities. A16
 
Document Shows Nuclear Work
The United States is hard at work on new or modified designs for nuclear arms, a formerly secret Federal document reveals, despite the fact that the cold war ended years ago. Critics say the Energy Department document shows that the nation is undermining a treaty that is intended to halt innovations in making weapons of mass destruction. Government officials strongly disagree and insist that the work complies with the international accord. A1
 
Lutherans Debate Cooperation
Leaders of the nation's largest Lutheran denomination, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, began their final debate on a sweeping proposal for closer ties with three major Protestant churches. Those who wish to move closer to the other three churches say the move offers a historic opportunity for advancing Christian unity, but opponents warn that crucial differences should not be overlooked. This proposal and a similar one between the Evangelical Lutherans and the Episcopal Church are regarded as the most significant efforts in ecumenical cooperation in years. A10
 
Force of Nature
By late summer, the snow has usually melted off Colorado's Gold Dust Peak, where an Air Force A-10 attack jet that was 600 miles off course crashed in April, killing the pilot. The cleanup team is still searching for an arsenal that includes magnesium flares and four 500-pound bombs, and the weather and terrain make it a Herculean task. A10

Immigrants Recall Brutality in Haiti
Accusations that police officers brutalized a Haitian immigrant after his arrest last week have sowed fear, anger and a sense of betrayal among people who have traditionally tried to keep authority figures at arm's length. Many members of New York's booming Haitian community said that the incident has particular resonance not only because of their past in Haiti, where the police have been feared as the source of brutal oppression and torture, but also because of their uneasy status in New York City. A1
 
A second police officer from the 70th Precinct has given investigators an account of the sexual assault against the Haitian man, a law enforcement official said, and police were preparing to arrest at least two more officers in the attack. B3
 
Union Leader's Ouster Sought
The parent union of a New York-based local representing 30,000 hospital and nursing home workers has decided to oust the local's president after union officials found financial mismanagement, intimidation of opponents and overspending, including a $257,530 dinner dance. But Frank Russo, president of Local 144 of the Service Employees International Union, has blocked the parent union from entering or taking control of the local's headquarters and has gone to court to prevent his ouster.

Despite a 247-drop in the stock market on Friday -- the biggest one-day selloff in almost six years -- few of dozens of investors interviewed believe that the market is seriously ailing.

HEADLINE: Israelis Turn Military Skills Into Software Export Boom

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: GIVATAYIM, Israel

 BODY:
Sharon Carmel and his old army buddies used to work on computerized battlefield simulations when they were in the service. Now heading their own software company in this Tel Aviv suburb, they plan a multimedia blitz on the Internet, hoping their software will be the underpinning of a new generation of sites on the World Wide Web.
In Ramat-Gan, another of the suburbs ringing Tel Aviv, Gil Shwed will not say much about where he served in the army, but he does allow that he learned there about linking computer networks with different levels of security clearance. Now he presides over Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., a software company that is the world market leader in creating the corporate firewalls that are an essential element of Internet security. 
 People like Mr. Carmel and Mr. Shwed are the reason why the software industry has boomed in Israel in recent years, fueled by the skills of army-trained computer engineers. Along with Russian immigrants and native Israeli graduates of top-flight schools, engineers who learned their trade in military jobs -- which they won't discuss -- are bringing a combination of discipline, obsession and anarchic inventiveness to a business that thrives in that kind of environment.
Software is Israel's fastest growing export industry, the engine of an expanding high-technology sector that in turn has powered the Israeli economy's 6 percent average annual growth rate in the 1990's.
And the software industry not only gets a good share of its manpower from engineering divisions of the Israeli military; the technology at some Israeli-run companies was developed in the defense industry.
Sales figures for other American software companies with Israeli roots -- a growing group that includes Net Manage, based in Cupertino, Calif., Tecnomatix Technologies Ltd., of Herzliya, Israel, and Novi, Mich., and Geotek Communications Inc. of Montvale, N.J. -- have climbed over the past three years, although their share prices have been volatile.
Software is still no rival to the largest of Israel's traditional exports. (Polished diamond exports earned $5.2 billion last year.) But high-technology exports as a whole are $5.5 billion, more than a quarter of the $20.5 billion total Israeli exports in 1996, according to the Israeli Trade and Industry Ministry. Software exports totaled $198 million in 1994, $287 million in 1995 and $413 million in 1996.
The software produced by the new Israeli companies ranges from applications suited to new media games to highly specialized software development tools. But no matter what the product, it often owes its origins to the Israeli military.
For instance, Mr. Carmel and two friends from a high-technology army unit formed their company, Geo-Interactive Media Group, three years ago along with a veteran business executive. Mr. Carmel says the bonds forged during military service have given them a competitive edge.
"We have a soul, not only structure," he said. "We worked together on the same projects in the army, often under pressure, and we're very close-knit. We're very fast, and interest in our products is accelerating."
Mr. Carmel, 26, and his partners also gained vital expertise during their army service in a unit that specialized in simulations of combat zones. After their discharges in 1993, they went into separate business ventures but joined forces in 1994.
They began by producing multimedia CD-ROM titles, working out of an apartment in Tel Aviv. Later they used their knowledge of data compression and transmission technology to create software that would allow people creating Web sites to make their multimedia features more easily accessible to the average Web surfer.
Geo-Interactive nearly doubled its sales last year. to $1.4 million. Its 1996 public offering on the AIM London Stock Exchange -- which specializes in small-capitalization issues -- brought in $19.2 million.
Geo-Interactive's flagship product is called Emblaze Creator -- a program unveiled last March that enables people to send interactive multimedia over the Internet that can be seen and heard in real time with no more than a standard Web browser. Video, animation and audio can be received directly without downloading the materials or installing special software.
Other Israeli companies tend to follow the strategy of trying to spot and mine niches not filled by large international companies.
Vocaltec Communications Ltd., also based in Herzliya, produced the first Internet phone in 1995, making it possible to conduct international and long-distance calls for the price of an Internet connection. Its 1996 sales revenue, however, was still less than $10 million.
Another Israeli company, VDOnet, based in Herzliya with offices in Palo Alto, Calif., specializes in live video broadcasts on the Internet. And earlier this month, the Microsoft Corporation selected VDOnet to help it provide live video capabilities for networks carried over cable modems or other broadband delivery systems.
In the area of Internet security, Mr. Shwed's Check Point has about 40 percent of the world market in internet firewall programs, which protect corporate networks from outside intruders.
The secret of Israel's software successes, however, does not lie entirely in military connections. The country has a reservoir of skilled computer engineers and programmers who have studied in schools like the Technion, Israel's leading technology institute.
In addition, the arrival of more than 700,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union since 1990 has increased the pool of computer experts. Another core of expertise is provided by returning Israelis who have studied in the United States and worked in Silicon Valley.
Israel has the world's highest percentage of scientists, with 135 engineers per 10,000 citizens, according to the Israel Yearbook and Almanac. The United States has 85 per 10,000.
Israel's small size and population permit easier links and more familiarity between people who can form working teams to design software, while the Internet bridges the distance to foreign clients, serving as both a marketing tool and technical support system.
"Israel is almost exactly the right size," said Ed Mlavsky, president of Gemini Capital Fund Management, an Israeli venture capital group. "If a country's too small, there's not enough diversity, and if it's too big, there aren't enough connections between people. There's also an innovative attitude here, a nonconformity in methods which in some senses is undisciplined."
Mr. Shwed, who, with two partners, founded Check Point, agreed that there was an Israeli tendency for unorthodox experimentation.
"Israelis have a tendency to work fast, to improvise and find solutions," he said. "That's the way the state was created here from zero. There's also a lack of business culture here. People don't do things by the book and they're willing to break the rules, which can be an advantage. The lack of a local market has forced people to think globally and create universal products."
Mr. Shwed's own story is a case in point. A computer whiz-kid who during his army service set up and linked computer networks with different levels of security classification, he spotted a golden market opportunity with the growth of the Web in 1993.
Closeting himself with his colleagues in an apartment for three hot summer months, he worked with them to develop a prototype of a firewall security program that served as a basis for their company. In 1996, Check Point's sales totaled $32 million, Mr. Shwed said.
The software boom in Israel has its parallel in the growing Israeli presence in the United States.
The Mercury Interactive Corporation, for example, an Israeli company that makes automated software testing tools, has located its corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., while maintaining research and development operations in Israel. Aryeh Finegold, Mercury's founder and chief executive, divides his time between Israel and Silicon Valley. The company reported $54.6 million in sales in 1996.
Geo-Interactive has a U.S.-based subsidiary, Geo-Interactive Publishing Inc., handling sales, marketing, distribution and technical support, as well as advertising and public relations. Check Point has its United States headquarters in Redwood City, Calif.
One of the biggest of the American offshoots of Israeli companies, Geotek Communications, is working with I.B.M., which announced in June it would provide $200 million in equipment for Geotek's wireless networks and would jointly market Geotek's services.
Geotek's specialty is communications software that allows small companies with fleets of vehicles, like local delivery services or even hotel chains with airport shuttles, to communicate with drivers and track fleets using satellite tracking technology.
The products, which helped bring the company $93 million in sales in 1996, are based on software licensed to Geotek from Rafael, the research and development arm of the Israeli Defense Ministry.
The reaction of American high-technology companies to these emerging companies has been threefold: In some cases, Microsoft and I.B.M. have invested in or underwritten their technologies, in others, they have eclipsed Israeli companies by coming out with competing products, and both companies now operate research and development facilities in Haifa, Israel.
Marketing may be the weak point of Israeli software companies. "The commercial successes of Israeli software firms are smaller than they seem," said Nisso Cohen, who heads the Israeli office of the International Data Corporation, which conducts market surveys.
"Israel is a significant world player from a technological point of view, but in revenues its share is very small," Mr. Cohen said. "In 20 years, virtually no Israeli start-up company has succeeded in reaching $100 million in annual sales. They haven't invested enough in marketing."

HEADLINE: Congress Whittles Away Power of Capital's Mayor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
In these financially strapped times for the District of Columbia, this was a rare moment for celebration. Officials from a group of private health care organizations gathered at a city clinic the other day to announce programs that would provide medical insurance for 1,000 children.
Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. was the scheduled guest speaker, but he had not arrived for the start of the ceremony. "We'll go ahead, anyway," said a woman at the lectern. "It's too hot to wait." He never made it. 
 The event seemed emblematic of the plight of a mayor who has served 15 of the last 19 years yet now presides as little more than a titular leader whom many District residents blame for the city's downfall.
The real power now belongs to Andrew F. Brimmer, an economist and former board member of the Federal Reserve who heads the financial control board created by Congress two years ago to correct decades of inefficiency in the city government.
Through a swirl of legislative action since Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, powers of the Mayor have steadily shifted to the board, which is to remain in control until the District has a balanced budget four years in a row. In the latest measure, the budget bill signed by President Clinton this month included a provision that gives the board the right to reject anyone the Mayor appoints as head of a major municipal agency.
While Mr. Brimmer's schedule last week included a meeting with parents who were outraged about an announcement that the public schools would open three weeks late because of roof repairs, Mr. Barry greeted National Black Deaf Advocates, the Fishing Buddies and students from the Pure Love Alliance, a group of young people who advocate no sex before marriage.
Even so, the Mayor has begun using his weakened state to political advantage, denouncing legislation that he says has "raped democracy and freedom" and criticizing anyone who would deny District residents the basic right of representation.
Many of his supporters think the power shift will only make him a martyr, catapulting him to a fifth term next year if he seeks re-election. He has steadfastly refused to say whether he will, and at his weekly news conference on Wednesday, someone asked, "With no powers, what is the point of even holding elections next year?"
Mr. Barry did not answer the question. But other remarks suggest that a re-election campaign is well under way, with a little something for everybody. At his news conference, he carefully explained how he would fight further Congressional intrusion in the city, a strategy that plays especially well to blacks, while cooperating with the control board to improve the local government, a promise intended to blunt criticism that he had caused the city's ills.
"I can do both," he said.
Whether he can or not, the promise is providing Mr. Barry a rather large soapbox, one he uses liberally to lambaste the budget bill provision that removed his remaining powers, and its Republican sponsor, Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, who heads the District appropriations subcommittee. The Mayor accused Mr. Faircloth of using the provision "to cover what he really wanted to do: promote the Republican agenda to take away power in the District of Columbia."
As evidence, Mr. Barry cited a House ruling in 1995 that stripped the vote of Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District Representative, a Democrat; the control board's appointment of trustees to assume the powers of an elected board to run the public school system; and the right of the control board to approve all city contracts.
"The Faircloth amendment," Mr. Barry said, "takes democracy further down the drain."
Mr. Faircloth, in an interview, strongly defended the need for management reform in the city government, saying, "It was glaringly evident the city was spiraling into a catastrophic state."
He also dismissed Mr. Barry's criticism, including his oft-repeated assertion that the provision "has raped democracy and freedom" in the city.
"I've heard so many meaningless statements from Marion Barry that one more doesn't matter," Mr. Faircloth said. "It's airy persiflage."
By now, it almost does not matter which of them might be more persuasive in such a dialogue. The mere engagement has given Mr. Barry what some residents perceive as the moral high ground in fighting for home rule, the limited self-government that Congress granted the city almost 25 years ago.
"In terms of the big picture, he's got the right platform in home rule," said Clifford E. Barnes, a lawyer who attended the clinic ceremony. "That plays pretty well around the city. It's an issue that many folks can sympathize with."
During the week the budget bill passed, more than a dozen people in the District were arrested protesting the shift of power from elected officials. Others disrupted a control board meeting.
As reporters entered the room where Mr. Barry's news conference was held last week, fliers were stacked on a table. On one side, the words "War Zone" were written over a map of the District; the other side promoted Friday night rallies to protest actions by Congress.
"I didn't pass them out," Mr. Barry said when asked why the fliers were at his news conference.
In playing to those who regard him as the core of the problem as a former drug user who lost control of the city in the 1980's and spent six months in prison for cocaine possession, Mr. Barry has been quick to deflect blame for the city's current problems. They have included a lack of money to pay for better human services, to fix school buildings in shambles, to add police officers and to fill potholes in the streets.
His argument has always been this: Despite his personal drama, he returned to office in 1994, inheriting a $335 million budget deficit from his predecessor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, whom he defeated soundly in the Democratic primary.
"I've been asked about this a dozen times," Mr. Barry said, referring to his role in the District's financial problems. "I initiated a management reform plan on Day One. It was Senator Faircloth who had an agenda, long before he took over. He's using me as cover, as an excuse."
Some residents are not swayed. Sandra Seegars, coordinator of the Committee to Recall Mayor Barry, said the budget bill had only helped her group collect more voter signatures. The group needs about 30,000, 10 percent of the number of registered voters, for a recall vote, and so far has about half that number. Ms. Seegars, who lives in Mr. Barry's ward, said the tide was turning against him, for many of the reasons the committee lists on its Web site under "50 Reasons to Dump Barry."
"If the election were held today and he was on the ballot with Carol Schwartz," she said, referring to the Republican Mr. Barry defeated by 55 to 41 percent of the vote in the 1994 general election, "she would win."
In any case, the conflict is attracting interest well beyond the city as a sad tale of a national capital. In addition to the usual reporters who cover his weekly news conferences, journalists from England, Canada, Australia and Japan attended the latest. All were eager to learn how Mr. Barry was dealing with political emasculation.
With the election more than a year off and dozens of problems yet to be solved, it is not entirely clear whether Mr. Barry can ride his carefully planned strategy into another term. Many city voters, like Rosie Faulkner, a 20-year-old student at Johnson C. Smith College in North Carolina, have mixed feelings.
"I still love him," Ms. Faulkner said. "He gave me my first job, as an assistant to an elementary-school teacher when I was 14, and I appreciated that. But he's the Mayor. The city's going downhill now, and he should be held accountable."

HEADLINE: CLINTON PRESSING 2 SIDES TO SETTLE THE U.P.S. STRIKE

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Monday, Aug. 18

 BODY:
President Clinton, making his strongest comments so far about the importance of reaching a settlement in the United Parcel Service strike, on Sunday called on the teamsters' union and the company to end a 14-day walkout that has hamstrung the delivery of packages nationwide.
"This strike is beginning to hurt not only the company but its employees and the people who depend on it, and I think they ought to redouble their efforts to settle the strike and they ought to do it today," Mr. Clinton said before heading to Martha's Vineyard for a vacation. 
 After more than 60 hours of nearly nonstop talks, the two sides recessed their negotations shortly after midnight, and agreed to meet again at noon today.
Several Government, union and company officials said Sunday was a crucial day for the negotiations.
The officials said that after the nearly nonstop talks, the two sides were exhausted. Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president, has slept four hours since talks began at 9 A.M. on Friday, an aide said.
After arriving at Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Clinton suggested that an agreement might be reached soon.
"It's my gut feeling they'll settle," he told a reporter. "It's a good deal. It will set a precedent for unions."
He said that the teamsters had public sentiment on their side but that the support would turn with time. Holding his thumb and forefinger close together, he said, "They're that close."
Some Administration officials say they fear that Mr. Clinton will face far more pressure to intervene to end the strike if the walkout drags on for several more weeks. A protracted strike could present numerous economic and political problems for the White House by slowing economic growth and creating tensions with organized labor, which does not want the President to intervene.
The leaders of U.P.S. and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said on Sunday for the first time since the strike began on Aug. 4 that progress had been made at the bargaining table. But both sides also said they had a distance to go before reaching a settlement for the company and its 185,000 drivers, loaders and sorters.
"There has been some movement," Mr. Carey said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
Mr. Clinton was briefed on Sunday on the negotiations by the White House deputy counsel, Bruce R. Lindsey, and by Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. Ms. Herman has sat in at the talks and has repeatedly urged the two sides to keep talking at the Hyatt Regency Washington Hotel until they agree on a new contract.
The strike involves more workers than any other walkout in over a decade and has largely shut down U.P.S., the world's largest parcel delivery company, which handles 12 million items on a normal weekday.
The effects of the strike have been widespread. Blood banks have complained of being forced to destroy blood because they have not been able to ship it quickly enough.
Some factories have laid off workers because components they need have not been delivered. Many school systems are worried that they will not receive books before the school year begins.
Also appearing on "Meet the Press," James P. Kelly, the chairman of U.P.S., said the company had made a generous offer to the workers. Mr. Kelly insisted that the strike was unnecessary and had severely damaged the company's customers.
Mr. Kelly repeated his plea that Mr. Clinton seek an injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act to end the strike. The act allows Presidents to seek injunctions when a strike imperils the nation's health or safety -- a standard that White House officials have said has not yet been met.
"This strike," Mr. Kelly said, "has had a devastating impact on many of our customers."
Mr. Carey again insisted that the main issue in the dispute was U.P.S.'s widespread use of part-time workers, a group the union says earns too little to live on. Mr. Kelly, on the other hand, boasted that the company's part-time workers, who he said earn $11 an hour on average, made more money than the average full-time worker in the nation.
Other subjects in dispute are pay, subcontracting and the company's demand to pull out of the teamsters' multi-employer pension plans and start a new pension plan.
In recent days, business organizations have stepped up calls for President Clinton to seek an injunction.
"The President's comments today," said Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the United States Chamber of Commerce, "show that he is beginning to recognize what small business has known for at least a week or longer, that this strike is having a devastating impact on their ability to do business."
John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, argued vigorously against invoking Taft-Hartley.
"It's still not a national emergency, and it's not a safety and health issue," Mr. Sweeney said on Sunday on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." "I believe that the President is committed to the right of workers to bargain collectively and also their right to strike. And I think the fact that the parties have been meeting so intensely over the past couple of days is an indication that the collective bargaining process can work."
Thomas E. Mann, the director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, said in a phone interview, "My reading is that we're still some time away from sufficient pressure from the economy and the business community that would lead the President to reconsider his decision to basically stay on the sidelines."
Mr. Mann said that at least in the short term, it was an easy decision for the President, especially with the American public so solidly supporting the strikers.
Former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, on "Fox News Sunday," offered this view of the U.P.S. strike: "What's happening here -- and it's happening in a lot of other companies as well -- we have now very high corporate profits. We also have very tight labor markets and we have a long expansion in which many blue-collar workers have not seen their pay and benefits go up, and this is an incendiary combination."

HEADLINE: Hopeful, Poignant Mood at India-Pakistan Border

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: WAGAH BORDER CROSSING, India, Aug. 14

 BODY:
At dusk every evening, crowds of Indians and Pakistanis gather on either side of a painted line across a narrow road here in Punjab, a region that was divided when British India was partitioned into the separate countries of India and Pakistan.
The line, about a foot thick, is called Zero Point, and it marks a frontier that stretches north and south from here for 1,250 miles. 
 Because of the bitter legacy of Aug. 14, 1947, when 200 years of British rule ended with a bloodbath among Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims enraged by the partition, this is the only road crossing point between countries with a combined population of 1.1 billion. Sometimes, people try to cross on foot between the watchtowers visible across the wheat fields, and sometimes frontier guards shoot them dead.
Zero Point is a place of perplexing ambiguities, and they tell something about how relations between India and Pakistan are changing as the two nations celebrate their 50th anniversaries.
The crosscurrents are most evident at dusk, when the two armies stage a flag-lowering ceremony that reflects the defiance and nostalgia, as well as the official rigidities and popular yearnings, of two peoples sundered from each other when independence half a century ago created Pakistan as a homeland for Indian Muslims unwilling to chance life in an India dominated by Hindus.
These crosscurrents in the two countries are attracting fresh attention, and not only because of the anniversary. India and Pakistan have new Prime Ministers -- I. K. Gujral in New Delhi and Nawaz Sharif in Islamabad -- and they have begun a new effort at detente.
Both have used the anniversary to say they want peace, more relaxed borders, arms reductions and increased trade.
But in almost the same breath, the two leaders, in separate interviews in their capitals this week, set conditions that seem likely to thwart their efforts.
The main issue, now as it has been for 50 years, is the divided territory of Kashmir, the Himalayan region of snow-capped mountains and lakes just north of here. Two of the three wars between India and Pakistan were fought over Kashmir.
Mr. Gujral said that while he wanted the border between the countries to become "very soft, like Canada and the U.S.A.," there could be no territorial changes, because "we must respect that partition was final."
But Mr. Sharif was emphatic that progress hinged on concessions on Kashmir. "We would like to repose trust and confidence in each other," he said. "This is possible, but outstanding problems have to be resolved first."
Something of the conflicting attitudes is apparent at Zero Point. First, soldiers from the two countries engage in a mirror-image minuet that involves members of the flag parties marching at high speed to the frontier strip, with a high-stepping, stamping gait, then pausing inches from each other, hands on hips, exchanging haughty stares.
As crickets chirp in the trees, the Indian flag of white, orange and green, with its spinning-wheel emblem, comes down inch by inch, precisely in tandem with Pakistan's dark green banner with its crescent moon and star.
But then, after buglers from the two sides sound the retreat, another mood takes over. As the steel gates on either side of Zero Point are closed, Indians and Pakistanis who have gathered to watch the ceremony rush forward to stare at each other across a space of about 15 feet. Since most Indians and Pakistanis who get visas are required to travel by rail or air, leaving Zero Point to be used mainly by foreigners and freight traffic, this is as close as the two peoples get.
Some wave, some take photographs, but most remain silent, as if mesmerized by being so close yet so far.
For those with a sense of history, there is also the memory of the tragedies that unfolded along this stretch of road in 1947. Then, it was choked with bullock carts and migrant families on foot, struggling to escape the slaughter by frenzied mobs that eventually killed at least half a million people in Punjab and Bengal, the other region split at partition.
For a few moments after the flag-lowering, the Indian and Pakistani military commanders at Zero Point relax together between the gates, chatting, laughing and at one point even holding hands.
Then the soldiers move forward again, shouting in Hindi and Urdu, the predominant languages of India and Pakistan. "Move back!" they say. "Move back! This is a border!" The crowds melt back into the darkness settling over the two separate Punjabs, each now a province of its respective country.
For Paramjit Singh, 37, a Sikh who is a cloth trader in Amritsar, an Indian city 15 miles east of Zero Point, being at the flag ceremony was a chance to reach out to his family's past in Lahore, a Pakistani city 15 miles west of the border.
"What is Lahore now?" he asked wistfully.
On the other side, Altaf Rashid, 50, an electronics merchant from Lahore, had a similar curiosity about Amritsar.
"Are they richer than us over there?" he asked.
If the bid for a new relationship founders, there will be a special irony for Mr. Gujral, 77, and Mr. Sharif, 47, who, though far apart in age, are in one respect each other's mirror image. Both come from among the millions of migrant families who lost their homes and properties in the vast and often violent exodus that accompanied the partition -- Mr. Gujral's in what is now Pakistan, Mr. Sharif's in India.
Although the property issues have long since passed into history, each of the two leaders spoke of the special emotional stake that this gave him in the new talks.
Mr. Gujral recalled that anti-Hindu rioting in Karachi in February 1948 drove him out of Pakistan, where his family had lived for generations. But he also spoke of an affection for Muslims that he said had deepened as a result of his experiences at the time of partition. These include the mood in Karachi on Jan. 30, 1948, the day a Hindu nationalist in New Delhi assassinated Mohandas K. Gandhi, a fellow Hindu.
"There wasn't a Muslim in Karachi with a dry eye," Mr. Gujral said.
Mr. Sharif, who was born in Pakistan two years after partition, recalled that his family, originally Kashmiris, had settled in Amritsar, where they owned land as well as a home. These were lost when his father, an industrialist who had started engineering and steel businesses in Lahore in the 1930's, chose to move the family there in 1947, he said.
In the interviews, Mr. Gujral's relaxed demeanor contrasted with the stiff approach of Mr. Sharif, who hesitated while finding his words.
This appeared to reflect something that many experts in India and Pakistan have said about the new dialogue: that India, with a population and an economy that dwarfs those of Pakistan and an increasingly outward-looking approach born of its adoption in recent years of free-market economics, is less anxious about Pakistan, while Pakistan, with a national consciousness rooted in its founders' rejection of India, is finding it harder to abandon old enmities.
Mr. Gujral spoke enthusiastically of his vision for a new relationship in which families divided at partition would be able to move freely back and forth to weddings, funerals and other occasions. That has often been impossible because of visa restrictions, but India has begun to relax them without waiting for Pakistan.
The Indian leader also said he saw virtually unlimited potential for trade, now $1 billion a year, a fraction of the two countries' commerce with the United States.
Mr. Sharif said he, too, would welcome these changes if the Kashmir issue could be settled, but his tone seemed defensive compared with Mr. Gujral's.
Even on the issue that has dominated many of the 50th anniversary commemorations, the human suffering involved in the partition, Mr. Sharif was cautious, as though admitting to a legacy of sadness might undermine the self-confidence of Pakistan.
"There's no sadness in Pakistan," he said. "Everybody's happy. Independence was a great achievement as far as Pakistan is concerned."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 7, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 18 about observances of the 50th anniversary of India's independence from Britain referred incorrectly to the emblem at the center of the Indian flag. It is the dharma chakra, the wheel of the law, an ancient symbol associated with duty and piety. It is not the spinning wheel adopted as the symbol of the Indian National Congress, the nationalist movement that led the campaign for independence. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

Dollar Rises Against Mark, Aided by Remarks on Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday, buoyed by an impressive recovery on Wall Street after Friday's plunge. The dollar was also helped by remarks from a member of Germany's central bank that cast doubt on prospects for higher German interest rates.
The dollar rose to 1.8305 German marks from 1.8245 on Friday. But it edged down slightly against the Japanese yen, falling to 117.82 yen from 117.90, though that was up considerably from the level at which it had been trading earlier in Tokyo, before the opening of the American financial markets. 
 The dollar's rebound against the mark was aided by remarks from Hans-Jurgen Krupp, a member of the German central bank's policy-setting committee, who said that a rise in German interest rates at the present time would be "very damaging" to the German economy.
Mr. Krupp added that recent weakness in the mark was worrisome but that he saw little evidence that the weaker currency was fueling inflation by making imports more expensive.
Traders had feared that the central bank might nudge interest rates higher this week to try to curb the mark's fall and ward off inflation pressures, but Mr. Krupp's comments suggested such a move was unlikely.
"The comments highlight the fact that Germany's economy is not running away and that they are not importing inflation, so there is no real reason to hike rates," said Robert Sabia, a vice president at ING Barings Capital Markets.
Dealers said dollar activity was kept in check by caution before the meeting today of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
But like the German central bank, which will meet on Thursday, the Fed is not expected to change interest rates at its regularly scheduled gathering.
The dollar's decline against the yen came despite a report from the Japanese Ministry of Finance showing that the rise in Japan's trade surplus in July was less than had been expected. The customs-cleared surplus rose 70 percent in July, to 849 billion yen, but some analysts had expected a 100 percent increase.

HEADLINE: Israel Releases Some Palestinian Funds, but Sticking Points Remain

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Rewarding what it called "partial cooperation" from the Palestinian Authority, Israel said today that it would pay part of the money owed to Palestinians that was frozen as punishment after the suicide bombing last month in a Jerusalem market.
But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel would not call a complete halt to the financial blockade until Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, heeded Israeli demands for a widespread crackdown on Islamic militants. 
 "The main thing has not been done: unconditional, systematic, and incessant Palestinian Authority action against terror groups," said Israel's Cabinet Secretary, Danny Naveh.
The decision to hand over $12 million of the $40 million that Israel owes to the Palestinian Authority was announced this morning after a Sunday night meeting of intelligence officials that included senior C.I.A. officers.
During the meeting, Palestinian intelligence officials shared with their Israeli counterparts samples of explosives seized last month in a raid on a suspected bomb-making factory near Bethlehem. The Israeli authorities have been eager to determine whether there were similarities between the makeup of those explosives and the ones used in the bombs that killed 16 people on July 30.
But accounts from both sides indicated that they were continuing to bicker over Israeli calls for the arrest of more than 200 suspected Islamic militants.
An aide to Mr. Arafat, Nabil Abu Rdainah, called Mr. Netanyahu's decision to release the money, which is to be transferred on Tuesday, "a positive first step." But Palestinian officials have continued vehement objections to Israel's demand for further Palestinian action as the price for unfreezing any more of the taxes and customs fees still being withheld. "It's not his money," Saeb Erekat, a top Palestinian negotiator, said of Mr. Netanyahu. "It's our money."
The Israeli action went only partway toward addressing a similar complaint from the United States, which has criticized the withholding of the payments -- on which the Palestinian Authority relies heavily -- as counterproductive.
Senior Israeli officials conceded tonight that Palestinian security officials were now cooperating fully in the investigation into who might have carried out the Jerusalem market bombing.
But an aide to Mr. Netanyahu, David Bar-Illan, said it was not enough for the Palestinian authorities to cooperate in that investigation alone, calling the bombing "a symptom of the broader problem."
From the Palestinian side, there was no indication that security forces were preparing to round up the suspected Islamic militants, a demand that Mr. Arafat has rejected as "an Israeli dictate."
Instead, senior officials of the Palestinian Authority said that they were preparing a plan to boycott all but essential Israeli goods and that they were drawing up lists -- including Coca-Cola, Israeli-made cigarettes, televisions and other items -- that they said they intended to bar from being imported into Palestinian-governed territory.
"We have economic weapons that we can use, too," a senior Palestinian official said tonight.

HEADLINE: A Timely Message to China

 BODY:
American diplomatic design and the luck of Beijing's political calendar have given Washington its best chance in years to press for constructive change in Chinese policies at home and abroad.
The Clinton Administration has invited President Jiang Zemin to visit Washington in late October, enhancing his prestige at the very moment Chinese leaders are sorting out the succession to the late Deng Xiaoping. As that visit approaches, Mr. Jiang is eager to assure a harmonious meeting with President Clinton and to mute Congressional and public criticism over China's abuses of human rights and religious freedom. 
 Mr. Jiang's concerns give America the kind of leverage it has not enjoyed since Mr. Clinton abandoned his abortive early attempt to link China's trade status to progress on human rights. The Administration should make the most of this new opportunity, presenting Mr. Jiang and other Chinese leaders with a list of realistic and consistent steps Beijing could take to improve relations and avoid the repeated crises of recent years.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, have already made a good start. Mr. Berger met Mr. Jiang in Beijing last week and suggested ways that China can contribute to a successful summit meeting. These include releasing jailed democracy advocates like Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, allowing Red Cross visits to Chinese prisons and inviting American religious leaders to visit China. Last month Ms. Albright reminded her Chinese counterpart of the importance Washington attaches to restraining Chinese nuclear exports, especially to Iran and Pakistan.
Improving relations also depends on wise American conduct. But most of the recent problems have resulted from provocative Chinese behavior. Although China is becoming an increasingly important economic and military power, its Government remains hypersensitive about its standing in world affairs and responds belligerently to perceived slights. Beijing particularly worries that Washington is trying to contain Chinese power. On the contrary, the Clinton Administration until recently acted as if maintaining good relations required Washington to ignore Chinese human rights abuses and dangerous weapons transfers.
Both sides now appear to be learning from past mistakes. Mr. Jiang knows that he is considered inexperienced in foreign affairs and that he could burnish his reputation by leading the way to less acrimonious relations with Washington. The Clinton Administration now seems to recognize that trade, human rights and restraining the spread of nuclear and missile technology need not be conflicting objectives. Rather, Washington's ability to expand American economic relations with China is directly related to how well Beijing respects its treaty commitments abroad and the rule of law at home.
Beyond the immediate political calculations in Beijing, this is a particularly appropriate moment for Washington to take a more active stance on human rights issues in China. The Chinese political system is plainly evolving from a Leninist totalitarianism that tried to control all aspects of human life toward a dictatorship more narrowly focused on political repression. As economic reform progresses, social controls on ordinary people tend to diminish, even as the regime tightens its grip on political dissent.
American policy should be aimed at consolidating these gains while encouraging the Chinese to extend them to the political sphere as well.

HEADLINE: Fred C. Galda, 79, Retired Judge

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Fred C. Galda, a retired New Jersey Superior Court judge and former prosecutor and Mayor of Paramus, N.J., died on Thursday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 79 and a resident of Saddle River, N.J.
He suffered a long illness, his family said. 
 He was a key figure in two noted criminal cases that reverberated well beyond the New Jersey state line. He was a prosecutor in the trial and conviction in the 1963 killing of two Lodi police officers and was also one of the first judges to allow the battered-wife defense in a case of a woman accused of killing her spouse.
His six-term tenure as Mayor of Paramus in the 1950's and 60's witnessed a building boom that left modern shopping centers as reminders of a thriving economy. Most recently, he was with the law firm of George A. Vaccaro in Paramus, a practice from which he retired in 1995.
He grew up in Cliffside Park, N.J., where he excelled in football and basketball. He was place-kicker on the football team while studying at Michigan State University.
Known for his outspokenness, Mr. Galda turned from law to politics, and the voters of Paramus chose him as their Mayor in 1952, the first Democrat at City Hall in 17 years. Voters kept him in the job until 1964.
He served as first assistant county prosecutor in the case of Thomas Trantino, who was sentenced to death in 1964. Mr. Trantino was found guilty in the slayings of a police sergeant and a trainee responding to a noise complaint at a bar on Route 46 in Lodi, N.J.
Mr. Trantino remained on death row until 1972, when his sentence was commuted to a life term. He asked for parole eight times, more than any other current inmate in New Jersey, was denied eight times and was most recently at Riverfront State Prison in Camden, N.J.
Gov. Richard J. Hughes appointed Mr. Galda to Superior Court in Bergen County in 1967 and he served as presiding judge of its criminal court division until his retirement in 1983. Two years before that, he allowed a defendant, Dorothy Rapp, to testify that she shot her husband, William, in self-defense in 1981 in their backyard in Fair Lawn, N.J.
She told the court that her husband had dragged her from bed, pulled out clumps of her hair, savagely beat her and vowed to kill her before she picked up his loaded rifle and turned it on him. It took the jury less than two hours to acquit her. Judge Galda was the state's first judge -- and one of the first in the nation -- to allow such a trial defense.
Judge Galda is survived by his wife, Ellen Molloy; five sons, Dwight, of Forth Worth, Fred Jr., of Montvale, N.J., Thomas, of North Bergen, N.J., William, of Ramsey, N.J., and John, of Saddle River; a sister, Ester Lansdowne, who lives in Texas; a brother, Karl, of New York City; eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Gain Amid Stock Turmoil

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday, amid continued turmoil in the stock market.
The volatility in stocks has bolstered shorter-maturity securities as investors move from stocks to the relative safety of the bill market. Indeed, yesterday's regular weekly auction of Treasury bills was well subscribed from investors still reeling from Friday's tumble of 247 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 The longer maturities were also higher yesterday, lifted by expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers would leave interest rates unchanged at today's meeting.
Even as stocks rallied late yesterday, with the Dow gaining 108.7 points, bond prices held to their gains. The price of the 30-year bond increased 10/32, to 98 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.52 percent from 6.54 percent on Friday.
The gain in bonds came on the eve of a one-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making panel.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said none of the chief economists at the 39 primary dealers in United States Government securities expected the Fed to raise short-term interest rates at today's meeting.
"The really interesting question is what happens next," Mr. Harris said. "While one in every four Wall Street economists foresees the Fed tightening at the following F.O.M.C. meeting on Sept. 30 and around three-fourths expect some tightening before year-end, we still see the Fed on hold for the remainder of 1997. This is because we still expect continued low inflation and real G.D.P. growth near our longstanding 2 percent forecast."
Because little data are due this week, Jack Ablin, executive vice president and head of fixed-income securities at Barnett Capital Advisers, said he expected a week of consolidation for the bond market. "Our sense is that we are in slightly bullish positions, and if we can get rates back to 6.40 percent on the long bond we can bring our portfolios back to neutral," he said.
Doug Burtnick, managing analyst at Technical Data of Boston, said that the fact that the market continued to trade nearly tick for tick against equities proved that some of the factors supporting the bond market had dwindled.
"Actually the bond market doesn't have that much to look forward to in the next few weeks, so it's not surprising it has taken its cues from stocks and other related markets," Mr. Burtnick said. "I don't expect a tightening at Tuesday's F.O.M.C meeting and frankly nobody does either. The real question boils down to whether or not the investment community will get involved and start buying the market on pullbacks. With the summer vacations in full swing, it may take a week or two to find that answer."
At yesterday's Treasury auction, the rate on the three-month bill came in at 5.08 percent, down from 5.17 percent last week, and the rate on the six-month bill was 5.12 percent, down from 5.23 percent. Following are the results of the auction:

HEADLINE: New Ferry Terminal Is Planned on Hudson

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The largest operator of Hudson River ferry boats, New York Waterway, is planning a new glass-enclosed ferry terminal at the foot of West 39th Street.
The plan, which the company has described privately to government officials and civic groups, is to replace what is now a blighted, city-owned parking garage that juts 100 feet into the Hudson and surrounds ventilation towers for the Lincoln Tunnel. 
 In its place, New York Waterway would build a terminal with six slips for ferry boats -- double the number it now has at a neighboring Hudson River pier at 38th Street -- and a building with public walkways, seating and viewing areas.
"We see this as the Grand Central Station of ferry terminals," said Arthur E. Imperatore Jr., the president of New York Waterway, which estimated that the project would cost $10 million. "Some of the greatest public buildings have been transportation buildings, and that is what we hope for here," he said.
The plan won a generally favorable response from members of Community Board 4, who learned about it last week.
"We have mixed feelings, but this plan is probably as good as we are going to get," said Edward Kirkland, a member of the board's waterfront committee. "It has a handsome, open design, which we like very much."
Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, said, "Both the concept and the location make sense to us, and we are very much on board."
New York Waterway is negotiating with the city on a long-term lease for the use of the 39th Street garage. Advisers to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said they had not been given details of the proposal, but were inclined to favor a plan that would accommodate more ferry boats.
"The Mayor is proud of the increase we've seen in ferry service and would like to see more," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
The terminal plan has attracted broad interest from community groups, because it would be the first structure to be built along the river between Battery Park and 59th Street under guidelines approved by the city and state last year that call for preserving the area as a river park.
Although the park would be little more than a sliver of public walkways and greenery between the river and a newly rebuilt West Side Highway, the intent is to give pedestrians, cyclists and skaters access to the shoreline. The guidelines have challenged developers and architects who hope to find new commercial uses for several blighted piers, including the one that New York Waterway wants to rebuild at 39th Street.
Mr. Kirkland said members of Community Board 4 had hoped New York Waterway would obtain rights to rebuild another pier farther south, thereby freeing up the 39th Street pier and other property near the foot of 42d Street for open space and recreation.
In its plan for the pier, by the architecture firm Skidmore Owens & Merrill, New York Waterway said it would erect a glass-enclosed terminal building that would be 30 feet high and would occupy the entire space of the existing garage, which is 400 feet long and 100 feet wide. Since the new building would be the same size as the old, approval by the City Planning Commission would not be required.
The terminal would include a public walkway along the shore, beside the eastern side of its main entrances. Since those entrances are likely to be crowded during the morning and afternoon rush hours, an alternate shoreline walkway would be provided, a promenade along the roof that would be accessible by stairways or elevators.
New York Waterway has been operating ferry service between Weehawken, N.J., and its 38th Street dock since 1987, and it now carries 9,000 passengers each weekday. It said it needed the new terminal to meet growing demand, and expected to be carrying more than 17,000 passengers each weekday by 2000.
The company, anticipating a city requirement, said it would make docks available to competing ferry operators. One of them, New York Fast Ferry, is known to be searching for docking space along the Hudson in midtown Manhattan.
New York Waterway said it hoped to obtain a lease on the 39th Street garage by the end of the year and to complete construction of the new terminal by the end of 1998. The company plans to rebuild the dock it uses in Weehawken at the same time.

HEADLINE: To Argentines, Judges Are Often Biggest Lawbreakers

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 17

 BODY:
At first, Judge Hernan Bernasconi seemed courageous last year when he jailed the agent of the soccer star Diego Maradona for drug trafficking after the police discovered a large stash of cocaine in his apartment.
The agent, Guillermo Coppola, is a close friend of President Carlos Saul Menem, and in Argentina, under a legal system that critics say is corrupt, grossly inefficient and highly politicized, corruption cases involving top officials or their associates are usually not resolved. 
 But Mr. Bernasconi's valor is now in question: Government investigators said they had found that the judge concocted the entire scandal. They said he had hired police officers and a woman to put the cocaine in a vase in Mr. Coppola's apartment, which was in the judge's jurisdiction.
Investigators said Mr. Bernasconi, who denies any wrongdoing, was trying to supplant Mr. Coppola, who United States drug enforcement agents said was on their list of suspected drug dealers, with his own group of traffickers. The judge is now facing impeachment charges before Congress.
To many Argentines, Mr. Bernasconi epitomizes all that is wrong with their ailing justice system.
"In most countries, judges try to avoid the appearance of impropriety, but in Argentina it seems to be the exact opposite," said Domingo Cavallo, a former Finance Minister in Mr. Menem's Government. "Those who are responsible for administering justice are themselves breaking the laws, and they make no attempt to hide it."
The country's Roman Catholic bishops warned recently that widespread corruption and growing public distrust in the judicial system "threaten to disintegrate Argentine society."
The Archbishop of Resistencia, Carmel Giaquinta, said inequity in the justice system had become so acute that the bishops had placed it at the top of their social agenda along with poverty and unemployment.
"We have a judicial system that does not dispense justice," the Archbishop said.
Argentina's judicial system is administered by federal, national and provincial judges, who respectively handle cases involving the federal Government, the capital district of Buenos Aires, and the provinces and municipalities. Judges typically specialize in one of three areas: criminal, civil or commercial cases. There are courts of appeals and a supreme court for each level of the judiciary.
In recent years, dozens of judges have been secretly videotaped demanding or accepting bribes. In March, for example, prosecutors filed impeachment charges against a federal judge, Juan Carlos Branca, after a television station videotaped him agreeing to provide smugglers with protection from prosecution for a fee.
Many federal judges, who earn $5,000 a month, have luxury apartments, country homes and imported cars.
Last year, another federal judge, Francisco Trovato, was charged with accepting a $25,000 wardrobe for dismissing a case involving the death of a 4-year-old. Prosecutors are still waiting for Mr. Trovato to explain how he acquired his $700,000 apartment in the fancy Recoleta district, and the lower house of Congress is considering impeachment.
In the last 18 months, scandals have forced the resignation of two justice ministers. The first, Rodolfo Carlos Barra, stepped down after a news magazine disclosed that he had lied about his participation in Nazi groups as a young man.
The second, Elias Jassan, resigned after he was shown to have had daily telephone contact with a tycoon who was under investigation for the killing of an investigative journalist.
Not surprisingly, public confidence in the judiciary is very low. In recent public opinion polls, Argentines have consistently ranked the justice system as the public institution having the least credibility.
In a recent survey of 1,400 people in Buenos Aires, 39 percent said they had no confidence in the justice system, 16 percent said they had very little confidence and 34 percent said they had little confidence. Only 9 percent said they had some confidence in the justice system, while just 1 percent indicated they had a lot of confidence. The poll was taken by Guzman Heredia and Associates.
"This feeling of wanting to live outside the law, or to change it to serve narrow interests, encourages private and public corruption and creates a state of widespread skepticism, fear of others, impotence, and anger," the Catholic bishops noted in their statement.
Justice Ministry officials maintain that despite the recent scandals involving judges, Argentina's justice system is sound and that judges who commit crimes are being punished.
The officials said that Congress is now considering 181 impeachment petitions for national and federal judges. While anyone can file an impeachment petition against a judge with the lower house of Congress, only about 20 percent of all petitions are ever seriously debated. If the lower house decides to remove a judge, the case then goes to the Senate.
So far this year, Congress has removed 10 judges, compared with an average of 3 or 4 judges in past years.
Many lawyers and legal experts say the main problem with the country's judiciary is that it is controlled by Mr. Menem's Government. They say the Government has exercised considerable influence over judges through appointments and bribery.
Mr. Cavallo, the former Finance Minister who is now running for Congress as an independent, said that during his six years in the Menem administration he saw officials conceal corruption and manipulate judges.
"Cabinet members regularly called judges and prosecutors to give them instructions on how to handle important cases," said Mr. Cavallo, who was sentenced to a four-month suspended prison term last month for slander after he accused a customs official of corruption.
Mr. Cavallo said he was convicted of slander because the judge overseeing the case was controlled by Mr. Menem. But as Finance Minister, Mr. Cavallo benefited from the Government's sway over the judiciary when Menem officials convinced the Supreme Court not to issue a ruling that would have ordered the Government to pay billions of dollars to settle lawsuits. Mr. Cavallo had publicly opposed settling those suits because the Treasury was broke.
Officials of the Menem administration deny that they control the country's judges, and Mr. Menem accused Mr. Cavallo of making "unsubstantiated accusations."
One judge, who spoke on condition that she not be identified, said officials of Mr. Menem's administration had approached her several years ago to determine if she was a "proper candidate" for promotion to federal judge. "They told me that the job included a $10,000 a month bonus, but I told them I was not interested," the judge said.
Adrian Ventura, who writes a column on the law for the newspaper La Nacion, said the first step toward eliminating corruption in the judiciary is to change the process by which judges are selected and appointed.
Mr. Ventura said the Government has yet to carry out a 1994 constitutional reform that called for the creation of a council of lawyers, judges and academics who would select candidates for the judiciary.
But the creation of such a council has been delayed in political gridlock and seems unlikely to take place anytime soon. In the meantime, lawyers and legal experts said Argentines who feel that they are being forced to pay a bribe to get justice should resort to a new defense: the hidden video camera.
Indeed, Argentina's largest and most prestigious law firm -- Marval, O'Farrel & Mairal -- said recently that it had videotaped two men claiming to be lawyers, who said they could arrange a favorable ruling for one of their clients, a private electric distribution company, for $2 million.

HEADLINE: Developer Chosen to Build F.D.A. Center in Queens This Fall

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
A developer based in Houston has been awarded a contract to build the Food and Drug Administration's new, $85 million regional headquarters on the York College campus in Jamaica, Queens, officials announced yesterday.
With the selection of Hines GS Properties, construction is scheduled to start in the fall on what will be the F.D.A.'s largest laboratory outside its headquarters in Rockville, Md. When it is completed in 1999, the 230,000-square-foot center will test pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products for Government approval, including samples arriving at nearby Kennedy International Airport. 
 Claire L. Shulman, the Queens Borough President, said the project, which will create 400 construction jobs, was another major step in revitalizing downtown Jamaica. Over the last two decades, the area has been pulled from the edge of urban decay by government investments totaling more than $1 billion, including the construction, in the 1980's, of a local Social Security office and the York College campus, part of the City University of New York.
According to the agreement between Hines and the United States General Services Administration, the company will finance, build and operate the building at Liberty Avenue and 158th Street, and lease it to the Government for $9.4 million a year over 20 years.
The new building will allow the F.D.A. to move from the center that it has outgrown in Sunset Park, on the Brooklyn waterfront, once a major port of entry for the products it tested, and expand its research programs and staff. The F.D.A. currently employs nearly 300 people at the lab in Sunset Park, and it expects to add more than 100 jobs when it moves into the new building.
At a news conference yesterday at Queens Borough Hall, George Boone, the F.D.A.'s regional laboratory director, and Dr. Charles C. Kidd Sr., the president of York College, said they expected close ties between the researchers and the college.
United States Representative Floyd H. Flake, who has been enormously successful at directing public funds to his district in southeastern Queens and who recently announced that he would resign from Congress in October, said the F.D.A. center was one of his proudest achievements. "This is probably the best kind of retirement present one can have," Mr. Flake said.
In 1993, Mr. Flake slipped a stipulation into a Federal appropriations bill to build a new regional headquarters for the F.D.A. -- but only at York College. The move angered officials in other boroughs, especially the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, who said Queens was "stealing jobs from Brooklyn."
In a statement yesterday, Mr. Golden said: "It is irresponsible to take jobs out of a community much in need of employment opportunities. I maintain that the relocation of the F.D.A. labs is a misguided move that will be detrimental to the Sunset Park community, to Brooklyn and to the city."
Yesterday, Mr. Flake let Ms. Shulman answer Mr. Golden's criticism. "It is the same region and it is the same city," she said.
Mr. Flake has also been pressing the Federal Aviation Administration to build a new regional office in his district. Karen R. Adler, the regional administrator of the General Services Administration, said the contract to build the F.A.A. office, most likely in Queens, would be awarded next month.

HEADLINE: Life Gets Harder on the Already Mean Streets

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
Carolyn, a prostitute who many years ago abandoned her young son to the care of her churchgoing mother, works a "crack stroll" in Harlem, where men come to buy fleeting sex along with their drugs.
"The best thing to do is be where the crack is, because that's where the money is," she said. "When they buy crack, once they take that pull, they want a woman." 
 But because of crack, Carolyn, 40, has also found herself working harder to make the same amount of money. Commercial sex is one of the few commodities in New York whose street value has plummeted over the last decade, with crack-addicted women, desperate for the next fix, driving down the price from $20 or $30 for oral sex to as little as $2 or $3.
"Before, they used to pay you $50 or $100," complains Carolyn, who often fortifies herself for her long nights with crack or heroin. "Now they're telling you $5."
Crack, whose use is declining in the wider society, has left most of the 4,500 to 5,000 prostitutes walking New York's streets earning less and hustling harder, with few prospects beyond police arrests, assaults by customers and sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS.
A survey of 4,200 street prostitutes by researchers for Frost'd, a nonprofit organization that helps prostitutes, showed that about 26 percent of those interviewed were homeless or on the verge of becoming so. Ninety percent reported having children taken away and assigned to relatives or to foster care.
While crack's appeal has declined among younger, newer drug users, crack remains entrenched in the subculture of street prostitution, where the women who took to smoking crack a few years ago for its cheap, fast jolt often find themselves unable to break their addiction. More than two-thirds of those surveyed said they smoked crack and nearly 40 percent injected heroin or cocaine.
"There's a complete feeling of hopelessness," said Dr. Joyce I. Wallace, the founder of Frost'd, an acronym for From Our Streets With Dignity, "and there's such a lack of self-esteem that they don't feel they're going to get out of it."
Her organization provides not only AIDS tests, clean syringes and free condoms, but also sustenance as simple as peanut butter sandwiches and the counseling that many woman need and few can afford.
"Half the time, they're on the street because they had a drug problem and got thrown out of whatever homes they came from," said Dr. Wallace, who gave up a Greenwich Village medical practice to work with prostitutes. "But half are on the street because it's less violent than home. They turn to drugs to make life tolerable."
While drugs and alcohol have long been a factor in the trade, interviews with outreach workers and 20 prostitutes throughout the city confirm that crack has hurt profits in the trade and made the lives of the prostitutes even more miserable. The women spoke only on condition of anonymity for fear of attracting the police and embarrassing relatives.
A Brooklyn prostitute named Thea said that, with earnings down, she was homeless and relied on men she met to give her somewhere to sleep. Thea, who is 34 and trying to quit heroin, said she wants to become a hairdresser, but "I can't get a normal 9-to-5 not knowing where I'm going to rest my head."
With competition from crack-addicted women, a 30-year-old Bronx prostitute named Tracy said, "The johns are bargaining now."
"I ask $15, but the johns want $10," Tracy, a heroin user, said. "I won't say I haven't done it for $10 when I need the dope."
There have been reports of some pimps, eager not to see their profits eroded, relocating the prostitutes they control to neighborhoods less affected by crack. On Caroline's stroll, which is linked to crack, the pimp's protective role has passed to the traffickers.
"The drug dealers look out for us, and we look out for them," she said. "We don't need no pimp."
While they complained that crack created more competition, most of the working or former prostitutes interviewed admitted to trying it themselves. Only two denied using hard drugs, saying they smoked marijuana.
Priscilla Alexander, the research director for Frost'd and a veteran of Coyote, an early prostitutes' rights group, estimated that crack first influenced the trade in 1988 or 1989. By 1993, she said, crack exerted "a profound impact" on how much prostitutes could charge.
Crack differed from other street drugs, Ms. Alexander said, "because it's a frequency drug," driving addicts to binge rather than space out their highs. As more women became homeless, they took to selling "survival sex" at cheap prices.
Street hookers represent the most visible part of an underground economy in New York that may employ as many as 50,000 sex workers. In a study for the Midtown Community Court in Manhattan, Rick Curtis, a sociologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, identified three levels of prostitution.
At the higher level involving call girls and hotels, he said, drugs do not play a role. At the middle level, in brothels and massage parlors, drugs are used, sometimes recreationally. At the lower street level, Mr. Curtis found that street prostitutes generally need drugs to function.
Tracy Quan, a member of Prostitutes of New York, or PONY, a local advocacy group, said that drug use is "not necessarily representative of the industry" as she witnessed it at the higher level. "There are health freaks who take care of their bodies and don't use drugs," Ms. Quan said.
Ms. Alexander said that there were more drugs in street prostitution because the work was more stressful. "Street prostitutes are also more likely to use drugs because they started as runaways," she said.
Brenda, a former prostitute in Chelsea, said that she began using cocaine more than 20 years ago. "There were a couple of months I didn't use at all, but I started using again because that was the only way I could stand the tricks," she said, alluding to her customers. "And they had the drugs, so why not use it?"
"If you're miserable and very unhappy in life, it's very easy to talk you into something," said Brenda, who asked that she not be identified because her former pimp was searching for her.
"I was tired of being abused and mistreated when I was making all the money," said Brenda, who is 36. "It was cold, and I was freezing and he wouldn't let me buy a coat. I took his $2,000 and I took off."
Brenda found refuge in a drug treatment program run by Project Return, an organization that helps women overcome substance abuse.
Street prostitution, the prostitutes say, can still be lucrative if customer turnover is high enough. Carolyn aspires to earn $400 a night, of which $120 goes to finance her need for heroin and crack. John Megaw, the clinical director at the Midtown Community Court, which processes many of the prostitutes arrested in Manhattan, said that the first step for getting prostitutes out of the trade was breaking the link to crack and other drugs.
After Michelle was arrested last September, she joined a program at the Midtown Community Court. "The excitement and money was not there anymore," she said of her old trade. "But I kept doing it because I didn't think I could do anything else."
Though depressed prices have made more prostitutes willing to consider an alternative, the alternatives are not easy to find or create. Dr. Wallace's attempt to open a halfway house in SoHo for recovering prostitutes was blocked by irate neighbors. Without such programs, such women say they have little option but to continue earning their drugs with sex. Some have no interest in changing.
"I like being high," Carolyn said. "I'm not going to stand here and lie. This is a real job because I'm getting paid. Through this I pay my rent, I buy my food, my clothes -- and my highs."

HEADLINE: U.S. Considers Easing Travel to Cuba During Visit by the Pope

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Weighing its aversion to Fidel Castro against its regard for Pope John Paul II, the Clinton Administration is leaning toward easing restrictions on travel by Americans to Cuba during the Pope's scheduled visit there in January, officials said today.
The temporary easing would allow hundreds and perhaps thousands of people to go to Cuba for the Pope's visit, now scheduled to last five days, starting Jan. 21, the officials said. 
 The Administration also wants to allow Catholic churches and charities to ship supplies and equipment to help Catholic officials in Cuba organize the visit.
While measures being considered would mark a significant relaxation of the restrictions against Cuba, which the United States has maintained for more than three decades, the officials insisted that the Administration was in no way proposing a more general lifting of the economic embargo, which the United States has tightened in recent years.
"The Secretary of State views the Pope's visit as an important development in bringing to the Cuban people a message of hope and faith and the importance of respecting human rights," James P. Rubin, a spokesman for Madeleine K. Albright, said today. "And therefore out of respect for His Holiness, we are facilitating travel and the delivery of certain goods for the purpose of that trip."
The officials could not yet say exactly how many people would be allowed to go or whether Cuba would grant them visas. But they said the Administration was prepared to grant special licenses to large groups, presumably Catholics, which would be organized by the Church.
Currently, the embargo does not ban travel and the sending of relief supplies outright, but severely restricts citizens or even residents of the United States from spending money in Cuba, with few exemptions. It also requires that anyone who receives permission to travel to Cuba do so by flying there from a third country, a rule that the Administration is also considering easing. Although no final decisions have been made, the Administration has been quietly reviewing the matter for months.
It is working in consultation with the United States Catholic Conference in Washington and Archdioceses from around the country, including those in New York, Newark, Philadelphia and Boston.
The Archdiocese of Miami, which includes a large population of Cuban Americans, has requested permission to dispatch a cruise ship to carry more than 1,000 people to Cuba for the visit, according to other Administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Peter D. Coats, a special assistant to Bishop Thomas G. Wenski, auxiliary bishop of Miami and director of Catholic Charities there, welcomed the Administration's consideration, noting that the Pope's visit would have major reverberations for Catholics in the United States and Cuba.
"This is going to be a historic visit," he said. "The interest is going to be very high, not just in the Cuban-American community, but in the community at large."
Reflecting the political sensitivities of anything to do with Cuba, Administration officials have also discussed the easing of the restrictions with members of Congress prominently involved in policy toward Cuba. They include Representative Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from Florida.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, whose district includes a politically potent population of Cuban-Americans, expressed some reservations. While she supported the Pope and his message, she said she opposed allowing pilgrims from the United States to travel there for the visit.
"This is an end run on the embargo," she said, suggesting any easing would lead to further attempts, despite the Administration's insistence otherwise. "If you want to listen to the Pope, buy his tapes or visit him somewhere else."
The Pope, who is credited by some with accelerating the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, accepted an invitation to Cuba last fall when he met with President Fidel Castro at the Vatican. A visit by the Pope anywhere carries enormous significance, but the trip to Cuba, which has evoked memories of his visit to his native Poland in 1979, offers a chance to bolster the Church's revitalization in Cuba after years of repression.
After seizing power in 1959, Mr. Castro's Government nationalized church property and closed Catholic schools. In recent years, though, the Government has eased restrictions and allowed Cubans more freedom to worship. For Mr. Castro, the visit appears to be a way to win greater international recognition, despite Washington's efforts to isolate him. The visit could also highlight the embargo, first imposed by President Kennedy on July 8, 1963, which the Vatican has opposed on grounds that it hurts Cuba's people more than its Government.
The embargo also forbids all commercial trade and restricts relief assistance, like gifts of medicine. For the Pope's visit the definition of relief assistance could be broadened to include such things as fax machines.
The prohibition on spending money in Cuba allows exemptions for people with close relatives there, journalists and others with "clearly defined educational or religious activities."
The Administration now reviews applications to visit Cuba on a case-by-case basis, but for this visit only it would grant permission in blocks.
The embargo was tightened last year after Congress enacted legislation known as the Helms-Burton Act that extended the restrictions on trade to foreign companies using property confiscated by the Communist Government.

HEADLINE: Will U.P. S. Strike Draw Workers to Unions, or Scare Them Away?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Mark Levinson (Op-Ed, Aug. 17), an economist for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, believes that the strike by the teamsters' union against United Parcel Service can be a pivotal event. It can define the balance of power between unions and management, change that power through its outcome and thus take on greater meaning than the specific issues at the bargaining table. 
 The widespread public support for the strikers does reflect the public's fear of downsizing, sympathy with the part-timers and anger at apparent corporate greed. But the wider significance of the strike won't be felt in the outcome of negotiations, which will almost surely be a technical compromise.
Rather, look for the impact on union organizing -- the ability of the unions to replace the nearly five million members lost since 1980. Will more part-time workers seek union representation, seeing greater strength through solidarity with each other and with full-time workers? Or will they reject unionism, fearing a U.P.S.-style conflict with management that could jeopardize their already insecure jobs?
Last week workers at Fieldcrest Cannon, a large textile manufacturer, voted against representation by Mr. Levinson's union after management pointed out how strikes like the one at U.P.S. can jeopardize job security (news article, Aug. 15). Will U.P.S. now become the centerpiece in employers' anti-union litany during organizing campaigns? How can unions counter it?

Deal Is Reached to End Strike Against U.P.S.
Teamsters' union officials said that they and the United Parcel Service had reached an agreement to end the 15-day strike by 185,000 workers that largely crippled the world's largest package delivery company.
The officials said they expected the strikers to return to work tomorrow. First, however, two union committees -- including the bargaining committee -- must approve the agreement. [Page A1.] 

Texaco in Billion-Dollar Deal
Texaco has agreed to acquire Monterey Resources, the oil assets of the former Santa Fe Railroad, for $1.12 billion in stock. The deal, which bolsters Texaco's reserves in California, builds on the company's strategy of increasing its domestic fields because of concerns about possible political obstacles overseas. [D4.]
 
Hewlett-Packard Below Forecasts
Hewlett-Packard's quarterly earnings came in below expectations, driving the stock price down sharply, even though the company reported strong growth in orders and revenue. Analysts said it was apparent that the company was accepting lower profit margins to gain market share from weaker players in the PC industry. [D2.]
 
Court Setback for Dow Chemical
A jury in Louisiana found that Dow Chemical had knowingly deceived women by hiding information about the health risks of silicone used in breast implants. Dow Chemical, which owns half of the implant maker Dow Corning, has always maintained that it was never itself involved in the testing or manufacture of the devices. [A1.]
 
Mexican Economy Back Strongly
Mexico said its economy surged by 8.8 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier, surpassing economists' most optimistic expectations. The figures showed that Mexican consumers, after more than two years of crisis prompted by the bungled devaluation of the peso in December 1994, are finally going out to shop. [D4.]
 
Strong Results for Big Swiss Banks
Despite an international black eye for their handling of the accounts of victims of the Nazis, the big three Swiss banks are staging a remarkable financial recovery from the worst year in their history. Market Place. [D8.]
 
Stock Turbulence Helps Bonds
The volatility in the stock market -- shares closed sharply higher yesterday after bouncing around all day -- has bolstered short-maturity Treasury securities as investors move from stocks to the relative safety of the bill market. In the longer maturities, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.52 percent from 6.54. [D18.]
 
The dollar rose against the mark, buoyed by the gains in stocks and by remarks from a member of Germany's central bank that cast doubt on prospects for higher interest rates. But the dollar slipped against the yen. [D15.]
 
Labor Sees Chance For Strong Harvest
In what may be the largest unionizing effort under way in the nation, the teamsters -- with a former rival, the United Farm Workers of America -- are aiming at a class of workers they used to ignore: the armies of low-wage workers who pick and pack apples in Washington State. [A10.]
 
Utne Reader Seeks Investor
The Utne Reader, the Reader's Digest of the alternative press of the left, has retained an investment bank, Veronis Suhler, to help it find an investor or a buyer. [D6.]
 
New Looks for Fall
Three major fashion retailers -- Bergdorf Goodman, Barneys and Henri Bendel -- have reinvented their private-label collections to cater to women's changing tastes. [A20.]

HEADLINE: A Clean, Well-Lighted Place for Loans;
Pawnshop Chains Grow As They Remake Image

BYLINE: By SARAH JAY 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
When Misty Jones, a 23-year-old mother of three, fell behind on a nagging bill this summer, she knew just what to do. She brought a battery charger for the family car to Cash America, a local pawnshop, to ask for help. "It rained for, like, two weeks," said Ms. Jones, whose husband, a house framer, depends on good weather for his work. "We knew that if we came to a pawnshop, they would give us a little loan."
Not long ago, Ms. Jones returned to the shop, which is in a strip mall in Riverdale, Ga., a suburb of this city that has long been a Mecca of pawnshops, to pay back the loan -- $50 plus $12.50 interest. She unfolded her pawn ticket, and not only was she greeted warmly, but an employee even volunteered to carry Ms. Jones's battery charger out to her car. 
 That treatment, such a contrast to the traditional image of pawnshops, was no accident. Indeed, it fit right in with the bright and spacious appearance and the young, efficient and affable employees. The merchandise on display was clean, well marked and easy to find. Signs directed customers to appropriate areas, whether they were asking for a loan on a pearl necklace or looking for a bargain on a used lawn mower.
"Cash America looks more modern," Ms. Jones said cheerily, "and I prefer the ones that don't have guns."
Ms. Jones is precisely the sort of customer who has made an unexpected success of a new breed of pawnshops that swept across the South in recent years and is now just beginning to extend its reach elsewhere. Led by Cash America International, which is based in Fort Worth and is the first and largest of the new wave, these modern chains have been simultaneously consolidating this age-old industry and sprucing up its seedy image. In the process, they have changed the landscape of the trade, perhaps one of the last mom-and-pop businesses in America to be brought into the contemporary era.
"All of us are consolidating the industry," said John Thedford, president of Value Pawn and Jewelry, which has opened 22 pawnshops throughout Florida in the last three years. "We're putting a fresh coat of paint on these locations. Our employees wear shirts and ties and name tags. We're cleaning up the image of this industry."
And the customer-friendly approach of the chains has been contagious. On Peters Street in Atlanta, once known for its many old-style pawnshops, those that remain have more or less mimicked the new wave. As a general manager at one of them said, "You have to treat it like a business: be nice to customers, send out flyers and treat people with respect, as opposed to saying, 'Here, I'll give you $2 for that,' the way some shops used to do."
Until recently, nearly all local pawnshops lived up to their reputation as dingy, cramped outlets -- with merchandise piled to the ceiling -- and used on occasion as a dumping ground for petty thieves. But that scene has ceased to be the norm, thanks to a handful of visionaries who saw the industry as ripe for a revolution. Inspired by a sagging economy, a rash of personal bankrupcies and a growing segment of the population that had bad credit and limited access to the banking system, these entrepreneurs gambled that the pawnshop trade was primed to grow.
And it has. In 1988, when the National Pawnbrokers Association was formed, there were an estimated 6,800 pawnshops nationwide. Now there are more than 15,000. Some of them are owned by Cash America and three other publicly traded chains, Ezcorp of Austin, Tex., First Cash Inc. of Arlington, Tex., and U.S. Pawn in Westminster, Colo. As investments, though, none of the companies has done particularly well; U.S. Pawn is even embroiled in a fight with a group of stockholders who want to oust management because of its poor stock performance.
While the chains have taken the the lead, scores of others are also owned and operated by individuals who have followed Cash America's formula of acquiring new shops, improving customer service, computerizing operations and remodeling the stores in a conscious, deliberate effort to dispel the old perceptions.
These new leaders are shaping the industry in several ways, from pressing state legislators for more regulation to distancing themselves from the old icons. In Florida, for example, the traditional symbol of three balls -- which hails from at least the days of the Medicis -- is absent from all Value Pawn and Jewelry signs. In New York, the trade group for the industry changed the very name of the business, from pawnbroker to "collateral loan broker."
The vast majority of pawnshops are clustered in the South, mostly because state regulations allow them to charge more favorable interest rates. For example, in Florida and Texas, which each support more than 1,000 pawnshops, interest rates and service fees can run to 20 percent a month, and Georgia pawnshops can charge as much as 25 percent. In contrast, New York City's rates are held at 3 percent, which explains why the city has only about 70 licensed pawnshops, down from 150 in the 1960's.
There is no Federal pawnshop law, so it will fall to state legislators to determine the future growth of the industry, according to John P. Caskey, an associate professor of economics at Swarthmore College who studies the pawnshop industry. "There's a huge potential market," Mr. Caskey said. "The key is to change the regulations. If they can effectively change state laws, then there can be a lot more growth."
A typical pawnshop transaction usually proceeds as follows: An individual in need of cash enters the store with an item to be pawned, often a piece of jewelry. The pawnbroker appraises the item and offers a cash loan, usually for less than the full value. If the customer accepts, he or she leaves the merchandise in exchange for the cash and a pawn ticket. In most states, the loan matures within 30 days but can be refinanced for another two months. If the customer does not repay after 90 days, the store may put the item on its retail shelves. In some states, like New York, the item is put into foreclosure and is sold at public auction.
For pawnbrokers in states with high interest rates, the profit potential is obvious. For the borrower, who may have bad credit, no bank account and an urgent need for cash, the pawnshop is one of the few safe and palatable short-term financial solutions.
People may gravitate toward the chains because of their easy loan policies, their retail feel or perhaps simply because they seem more credible.
"Any time you deal with a chain, it's better," said Eddie Johnson, an unemployed construction worker who pawned $400 in jewelry at a Cash America in Atlanta last week. He compared the operation to a regional supermarket. "It's better to go to a Winn-Dixie than a mom-and-pop grocery store. It's more organized."
Still, going to a pawnshop, even the up-to-date ones, means acknowledging financial difficulty and few people are comfortable with that.
"I hate pawnshops," said one woman at a Cash America store where she was pawning a laptop computer for $350 in cash. "But I'd rather walk in here than some place dirty. It's the atmosphere. They have friendly people and it feels safer."
And that's what the industry is counting on as it enters the mainstream.
"It is so fast, so easy and there are no questions asked," said Tom Horn, executive director of the National Pawnbrokers Association, which is based in Dallas. "You don't have to give your life history."
You do, however, have to provide a state driver's license or other photo ID. In most cases, fingerprints are required, which pawnbrokers say helps deter thieves from coming to them to unload stolen goods. They say that those crooks who do show up run a good risk of being caught since copies of the pawn tickets are forwarded to the local police. It was just such an incident that helped the Miami police link Andrew Cunanan to the murder of Gianni Versace last month.
Proprietors of the smaller independent stores, which still make up more than half of all pawnshops, say they do not mind the encroaching chains. Some even seem grateful for the nudge to change their ways.
"I used to be afraid of the way chains were coming in, but now I see who they are and what they're providing," said Chip Hurd, president of National Pawn and Jewelry in Plantation, Fla. "From a competition standpoint, I'll know who I'm competing against, as opposed to whole bunch of independents."
Morgan Jones, president of American Pawn in Dallas, agreed. "They've done a lot to give an air of real legitimacy to our industry," he said. "I don't look at Cash America, EZ Pawn or First Cash as companies to be scared of. It's friendly competition."
Mr. Jones noted that he has sold seven of his stores to First Cash. Mr. Hurd also seems to have an "if you can't beat them, join them" attitude about the chains, and imagined a day when he might consider merging his company with a larger one. Both pawnbrokers said they appreciated the arrival of the big chains if only because they have spearheaded the campaign to improve the industry's image and lobby for state regulation.
Yet even as the industry reinvents itself, it may never completely shed its unsavory reputation. "The pawnshop industry is constantly battling its image," Mr. Caskey, the Swarthmore professor, said. "Even if you change reality, you'll still notice that really bad things happen in pawnshops in Hollywood films."

Chart: "Money in a Hurry"
 
Pawnshops offer people a way to raise money quickly by using valuable items they own as collateral on loans. Here is how a transaction at a pawnshop works.
 
A person needing a quick loan goes to a pawnbroker with an item to be pawned, often a piece of jewelry.
 
The pawn-broker appraises the item and then offers a loan, generally much less than the item is worth.
 
If the person accepts -- at interest rates from 3 to 25 percent a month, depending on the state -- the borrower takes the cash and leaves the item behind with the pawnbroker.
 
Most loans are due after 30 days, although many are refinanced for an additional two months.
 
If the loan is not repaid, the broker sells the pawned item to recoup the loan. In some states, the loan is foreclosed and the item auctioned. (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: TEAMSTERS AND U.P.S. AGREE ON A 5-YEAR CONTRACT PLAN TO END STRIKE AFTER 15 DAYS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Tuesday, Aug. 19

 BODY:
After more than 80 hours of intense negotiations, teamsters' union officials and the United Parcel Service said early this morning that they had reached a tentative agreement to end the 15-day strike by 185,000 workers that largely crippled the world's largest package delivery company.
Ron Carey, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said the agreement called for the first increase in the starting pay of part-time workers since 1982 and the conversion of 10,000 part-time jobs into full-time jobs over the five-year life of the new contract. Under the agreement, union workers at U.P.S. would remain in the multiemployer pension plans, with benefit increases for most workers. In addition to the 10,000 new full-time positions, the two sides agreed that five-sixths of all new full-time openings created though attrition or expansion, would be filled by current part-timers, up from the four-fifths in the contract that expired July 31. 
 Mr. Carey, hailed the agreement as a "historic turning point for working people in this country."
"American workers have shown they can stand up to corporate greed," he said.
David Murray, the chief U.P.S. negotiator, said, "We believe it's an agreement that we'll be able to remain competitive with."
Teamster officials said they expected the strikers to return to work on Wednesday. Before that can happen, however, two teamster committees must approve the agreement. One is the 50-member bargaining committee. The other is a committee made up of two representatives from each of the 206 locals representing U.P.S. workers. Both of the committees are expected to act on the tentative settlement today.
Final ratification by the membership will be by mail ballot, which is expected to take three to four weeks.
Mr. Carey said a news conference called to announce the settlement was delayed for more than two hours because the agreement almost fell apart at the last minute.
The company and the union clashed over language on subcontracting and other issues.
Mr. Carey acknowledged that the union made what he considered a major concession -- it accepted a five-year contract, when he would have preferred a three- or four-year accord.
President Clinton thanked representatives of United Parcel Service and the Teamsters union for their "hard work and determination" in reaching a settlement.
 "I am pleased that the parties negotiated in good faith," Clinton said in a written statement read to reporters shortly after the settlement was announced.
The company and the union had been narrowing their differences since the President pressed them to redouble their efforts.
The strike carried high stakes for labor and business. It was a pivotal test for the re-energized labor movement, which strongly backed the teamsters while saying its goal was to insure that a company with more than $1 billion in profits treated its workers fairly.
For corporate America, the strike was a test to see whether one of the nation's biggest and most admired companies could stand up to a revived labor movement and preserve the flexibility and cost structure it said it needed to compete in the global economy.
The settlement came as the strikers, at hundreds of U.P.S. sites in all 50 states, were growing increasingly restive about not working and living on $55 a week in strike benefits. Because of the strike, the workers missed tens of millions of dollars in wages, while the company lost more than $600 million in business.
The strike created myriad inconveniences, large and small, for companies and consumers across the nation. Small businesses complained they were having a hard time restocking their shelves, while hospitals said it was hard to obtain needed supplies.
Among the main issues in the strike was the union's demand that the company convert 10,000 part-time jobs to full-time jobs over the next four years. The company offered to convert 800 workers from part time to full time over that period. As part of a public-relations offensive, the teamsters noted that four-fifths of the unionized jobs U.P.S. created since 1993 were part time, and the union complained that those jobs did not pay enough to support a family.
At U.P.S., part-time workers, for the most part sorters and loaders, average about $9.50 an hour after two years, earning about $10,000 a year.
Full-time workers, largely drivers, average $19.95 an hour, earning more than $40,000 a year.
Mr. Carey said the increases amounted to $3.10 an hour for full-time workers and $4.10 workers.
Another major issue was the company's demand to withdraw from the teamsters' multiemployer pension plans and start a new U.P.S. pension plan. The company promised that pensions would rise by an average of 50 percent, but the union's negotiators opposed that proposal because they feared that U.P.S.'s withdrawal would jeopardize the financial health of the multiemployer plans.
Other issues included pay increases, subcontracting and the company's demand to scrap language in the contract that allowed the teamsters to honor other unions picket lines.
The agreement was a triumph for the new Labor Secretary, Alexis Herman, whose behind-the-scenes work persuaded the union and company to return to the bargaining table last Thursday. For the past five days she stayed in the Hyatt Regency Washington Hotel, where the talks were held, to help keep the two sides at the bargaining table until they reached a settlement.
Sunday was a make-or-break day for the negotiators on both sides, a Labor Department official said. Ms. Herman arrived at the hotel before 8 a.m. and spent most of the day and night going from room to room, helping each side focus on the issues at hand. When she wasn't needed, she paced the corridors and her own private meeting room.
Sunday "was crucial," the official said. "There was a sense it had gone on for a long time and they wanted to bring it to an end. It was clear we would know. They would either be able to cut a deal or not cut a deal."
The rooms on the second floor where each side gathered and both sides met, started to look lived in, with used coffee cups, newspapers, and half-eaten club sandwiches strewn across tables.
"There were real roller coasters," the official said. "More times than I can count, I thought it was coming to a conclusion."
By this morning it was clear they would need another day, so Ms. Herman canceled her appearance on a morning news show. She had a string of private conversations with the mediators throughout the day and the sense of urgency seemed to mount.
Both sides say the main challenges now are to heal the wounds the strike created between management and workers and to regain the business that U.P.S. says it lost to competitors, most notably the United States Postal Service and Federal Express.
The strike hobbled package deliveries around the nation, cutting U.P.S.'s volume to less than 10 percent of normal and nearly overloading the post office and Federal Express, which said it could not guarantee overnight delivery during the strike.
U.P.S. officials said they feared that shipping customers who used to rely exclusively on U.P.S. might have developed some loyalty to the company's competitors during the strike or might have decided it was unwise to rely on just one shipper.
The settlement came on the same day that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. told the White House that it was unhappy with the President's comments on Sunday that the teamsters had been offered "a good deal" in negotiations with the United Parcel Service.
Gerald Shea, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. official in charge of governmental affairs, said he protested to the White House and the Labor Department that the President's statement placed improper pressure on the teamsters to accept U.P.S.'s offer.
"People here were very unhappy that the bully pulpit was being use in a one-sided way," Mr. Shea said in an interview.
On Sunday, President Clinton had voiced optimism about the talks, saying, "It's my gut feeling they'll settle. It's a good deal. It will set a precedent for unions."
Mr. Toiv, the White House spokesman, said, "We understand that both sides in a difficult negotiation sometimes perceive even-handedness as something other than that."
Administration officials said they were surprised that A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials criticized Mr. Clinton for not being even-handed, because for the past two weeks many business leaders have accused the White House of siding with the strikers by not seeking an injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act to end the strike.

HEADLINE: Teamsters and Ex-Rival Go After Apple Industry

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: WENATCHEE, Wash.

 BODY:
The apples from one of the world's most bounteous fruit-producing regions are nearly ripe. The economy is flush. And an army of low-wage workers who pick and pack the crop is stirring for change. For organized labor, it all adds up to the kind of membership drive that would have been unheard of in previous years.
In what may be the largest unionizing effort under way in the nation, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters is aiming at a class of workers it used to ignore and, with its former rival, the United Farm Workers of America, is trying to revive a sagging union presence. It is part of a national drive to increase membership and court public support for people left out of the economic boom. 
 In the 40,000 fruit pickers and 15,000 warehouse workers who are the backbone of Washington State's $1 billion annual apple crop, labor leaders say they have perfect candidates for the new campaign. Most of the apple workers earn barely a few dollars above minimum wage.
After years of shrinking membership in a farm workers union built primarily in California, most of the nation's two million farm workers and packing house employees are not affiliated with unions. But labor leaders have opened two fronts in their new drive. They are trying to unionize 20,000 workers in the California strawberry industry at the same time they move into Washington's apple orchards.
Both efforts are part of a broader campaign symbolized by the strike at United Parcel Service to enhance labor's influence with low-end workers.
"We have a whole new attitude about organizing," said Rich Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who is in Washington State this week to assist the unionizing effort in the apple orchards and packing houses. "We're reaching out to everyone from the top to the bottom."
In the West the teamsters have taken charge of the effort to unionize warehouse workers, who sort and ship the fruit, while the farm workers are trying to bring the pickers into the union fold. The top ranks of the labor movement, from the farm workers union president, Arturo Rodriguez, to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney, have led rallies in the apple country.
The growers say their business is largely a family industry, reliant upon low-wage entry workers, with a narrow profit margin and variables of climate and price. A large-scale unionizing effort, like the one under way here this summer, could radically change the industry and hurt many orchardists, they say.
A boycott or strike could cripple the growers in the brief season when a harvest of 40 billion pounds of apples is picked in Washington. But the strongest leverage, for labor, may be the fact that the state best known for producing software and airplanes now has an acute labor shortage, especially at the low end of the wage scale.
"We have record-low unemployment in this state and it has become a very competitive business trying to hold on to the best people," said Mike Gempler, executive director of the Washington Growers League, which represents the orchard industry.
The very threat of union membership may already have had an effect. A recent memorandum to growers from the Washington Farm Bureau, which represents agricultural interests, suggested paying as high a wage as possible as one way to thwart union activity.
"Praise employees for their work," it said. "If necessary, increase wages and benefits."
Competitive it may be, but the business of picking and processing fruit has remained a low-wage industry. On average, warehouse workers work about 10 months a year and make about $7.50 an hour, a wage that, adjusted for inflation, has not changed in more than 10 years. In the fields, apple harvesters make $8 to $9 for picking a 1,000-pound bin of fruit, and work pruning the trees in the off-season. A fast worker can fill five or so bins in a day.
Though the unions have not asked for a specific contract, one goal is to increase wages by as much as 50 percent, an increase that growers say would devastate them.
Labor leaders are taking an unusual tack in trying to organize the apple industry. They have not specifically requested that packing houses or farm fields hold a vote on whether or not workers can join a union, as is usually done. Instead, they are asking for a contract first, and will then ask for a Federally sanctioned vote on union membership.
The unions are afraid to call for open elections, the growers contend, saying that most field and warehouse workers do not want to join unions. They accuse labor of taking a backdoor approach at gaining a huge number of new, dues-paying members.
For the United Farm Workers, for example, bringing the apple pickers into the union would more than double the membership, now around 20,000 workers, most in California. The teamsters, with 1.8 million members, would gain a new type of worker, but the addition would not greatly increase membership, at first.
For the teamsters, the apple campaign is also an opportunity to make inroads into the Hispanic community. An overwhelming majority of farm workers in this state are from Mexico, though most now live year round in Washington State. Nationwide, women and members of minorities are the fastest-growing segment of new union membership.
The national teamsters leadership has included several Spanish-speaking members among the dozen or so representatives sent to Washington.
"We want all of our organizations to reflect the new work force of America," Mr. Trumka said.
It is a long way from the early 1970's, when the A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders said they did not want low-end agricultural workers in their federation, and they feuded with the farm workers, then led by Cesar Chavez, who died in 1993. Now the two unions are working closely together in the apple campaign, joined by members of the Roman Catholic clergy and some Democratic politicians.
The apple growers say the union effort is driven by outsiders, and is little more than an effort to flex union muscle after years of decline.
"This is not something that's home-grown," Mr. Gempler said. "It is a pretty classic campaign from the outside."
Inside some of the bigger fruit-packing warehouses, where apples are stored in year-round compartments, it is difficult to gauge sentiment, because no votes have been taken. Pedro Navarrete, a 46-year-old father of seven children, works at two jobs, sorting fruit during a swing shift, then getting up early during the harvest to pick. After 25 years in the industry, Mr. Navarrete said he made less money now than when he started, and for that reason, he favors the union.
"I get home at 1 A.M. and then get up at 4 A.M.," Mr. Navarrete said. "I would like to see us at least get a raise and some benefits."
Only a handful of the packing plants offer medical benefits; the employees usually have to pay part of the cost of insurance, not an uncommon arrangement but in this case few workers can afford it. Workers also contend that plants are unsafe, and they point to a recent carbon monoxide leak at a packing house in the small town of Brewster, north of here. The leak sent nearly 100 people to a hospital.
After 10 years at the same fruit-packing plant here in Wenatchee, Jorja Starr said she made only 90 cents an hour more than someone hired this year.
"In 1988, I grossed $11,770," Ms. Starr said. "In 1996, I earned $14,000 and this increase was mostly due to increasing full-time work. Not a lot to look forward to."
At the same time, revenues in the apple industry have tripled over 10 years, to $1 billion for the state. Growers attributed the increase to more farmers growing more apples. The profit margin has not increased in most years, they say. The big money being made in the apple industry, both sides agree, is by retailers, whose share is better than 50 percent of the consumer price of an apple. Washington provides 60 percent of the nation's apples.
Granting apple packers a 50 percent raise, said a teamster spokesman, Patrick Lacefield, would add only 2.4 cents a pound to the price of apples to consumers.
Growers say wage increases would come from their revenues, forcing many of them to lose money.
If labor leaders succeed in their apple campaign, they plan to apply the tactics used here and in the California strawberry fields to other agricultural sectors. But Washington is different from other regions; it is a state with a long labor tradition and an economy that was booming well before the rest of the country recovered from economic downturns.
Labor leaders say they do not plan, at this time, to call for a strike or a boycott of Washington apples. Instead, they are courting public opinion.
At the same time, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has started running television advertisements intended to improve the public perception of unions.
The $5 million advertising campaign, which began in Seattle this week and will run in selected cities around the country, shows women and members of minorities, amid patriotic trappings, espousing the benefits of union membership.
Union membership, nationwide, hit a high of 36 percent of the work force in 1945, and fell to a low of 14.5 percent last year.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about an effort to unionize apple pickers and warehouse workers misstated the expected apple harvest this year in Washington State. It is up to 5 billion pounds, not 40 billion.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
NOT many years ago, the Far East was a booming market for Cognac and wine was mostly an afterthought. Since then, Asia has become the newest market, and potentially one of the most lucrative, for fine wine, apparently at Cognac's expense. Cognac is in trouble around the world, but particularly in the Far East.
Wine makers from all over the world have been flocking to Japan, China, Singapore and Thailand and have been received with open arms. Part of this new enthusiasm stems from the perception that wine, particularly red wine, is good for you, and part of it from the ever-growing demand for Western consumer goods. What does it matter, as The Wall Street Journal reported recently, that some Asian wine drinkers cut their Chateau Lafite-Rothschild with Coke and 7-Up? Customers are customers. 
 In 1988, Joseph Seagram & Sons bought Martell & Company, one of the four top Cognac producers. Martell was a big player in Asia and it seemed to Seagram like a good way to gain a foothold in that market.
But a decline was about to set in. Last year alone, Cognac shipments to Hong Kong were off 26 percent, to Singapore 18.9 percent, to Malaysia 4.2 percent, to Taiwan 27.4 percent and to Thailand 13.6 percent, according to Impact, a trade publication.
In 1996, the total world market for Cognac was 9.8 million cases, according to Impact, down from almost 12 million cases in 1990. The six top Asian markets -- Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand -- accounted for just under 35 percent of the world market. China has been particularly disappointing. The Cognac market there declined by 11 percent last year, to about 600,000 cases, following a 10 percent decline in 1995.
Moreover, Asian Cognac fans have been moving to cheaper stuff. The average price paid for a bottle of Cognac last year was almost 18 percent below the 1995 figure in South Korea, 6 percent in Taiwan and 8 percent in Thailand. (Cognac prices range from $20 to $300 a bottle.)
Cognac shipments to the United States, which declined steadily between 1990 and 1995, were up 17 percent last year, thanks, according to Impact, to the upbeat economy and a renewed interest in luxuries like cigars and single-malt Scotch. But middle-class America's return to the good life can't do much to alleviate the problems of the Cognac region of France, where overproduction has become a crisis.
If every Cognac grower there were to close up shop for the next seven years, it would have little effect on the market. Currently, there is an almost eight-year supply in the warehouses of the Charente and the Charente-Maritime, the two western departments of France where Cognac is made. The ideal would be about four years' supply.
The Cognac region encompasses about 2.8 million acres, of which about 80,000 acres are planted with the two most important Cognac grapes, ugni blanc and folle blanche. Last year, 145 million bottles of Cognac were produced from the grapes planted on those 80,000 acres, more than two times what the producers can sell.
Most Cognac is not produced by big distillers but by individual grape growers and small cooperatives. Some distill and age it themselves, but most Cognac is distilled in small batches and then sold to the major producers, who blend and age it.
In the past, these producers like Hennessy, Martell and Courvoisier bought whatever the farmers produced. They assumed big crops would be followed by small ones. But now the large Cognac houses are owned by conglomerates -- Hennessy by LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, Martell by Seagram and Courvoisier by Allied Domecq -- and the emphasis is on financial return. The big companies do not buy grapes or Cognac that they do not need.
And so an effort is under way to pull up at least 30,000 of the 200,000 acres of vines currently in production. For every hectare (2.5 acres) of vines a grower in the Cognac region agrees to remove, he can earn almost $17,000 in financial incentives from the industry's trade group, from the French Government and from the European Union. According to the trade group, some 4,000 growers out of 6,000 have agreed to participate in the nine-year plan.
In addition to cutting back on the Cognac surplus, the plan envisions a change to diversified grape growing. Cabernet sauvignon and merlot have been suggested as new tenants.
Wine can be made from both folle blanche and ugni blanc (the French name for the Italian trebbiano), but not very good wine, which is why, for several hundred years, it has all been distilled into Cognac. Whether cabernet and merlot grown in the chalky soils of the Charente will fare any better is debatable. The wines made from them will have to compete with cabernets and merlots from the vast new vineyards in the Languedoc, which were also planted at the urging of the European Union.
Meanwhile, the Cognac companies have embarked on a campaign to encourage more people to drink their product, especially in France, which has never been much of a market for its own Cognac. About 95 percent of French Cognac is exported.
Drink Cognac on the rocks, the companies suggest. Drink it with tonic as an aperitif.
Cognac with tonic? Strange talk from the people who boast of their special soils, of their distilling methods, of their painstaking blending and the delicate tastes and aromas they produce. Are they not advocating something along the lines of Lafite-Rothschild with Coke?
 
TASTINGS
Brolio Chianti Classico 1994, Tuscany, Italy. About $10.
 
For years now, Chianti producers have reveled in experimentation. Their goal: to break away from the traditional Chianti formula of sangiovese, canaiolo and trebbiano or some other white wine grape. Recently, there has been a trend back to the classic blend, and if anyone should lead it, it's Brolio. Baron Bettino Ricasoli created the formula for Chianti Classico at Brolio Castle in the heart of the Chianti region in 1835. The grapes for this wine, about 90 percent sangiovese, 8 percent canaiolo and 2 percent white malvasia toscana, all came from the same estate vineyards the baron cultivated almost two centuries ago. The wine is medium bodied with intense blackberry sangiovese flavors and is destined to enhance any Italian-style chicken or veal dish.

HEADLINE: Several Retailers Report Earnings That Beat Estimates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Retailers of very different stripes -- Home Depot, Dayton Hudson and Tiffany -- reported second-quarter earnings yesterday that surpassed Wall Street's expectations.
But earnings at two women's clothing chains, Ann Taylor and the Limited, fizzled. 
 Retailers that focused on customers, that had a strong brand identity and that controlled costs outperformed rivals, analysts said.
"It doesn't matter if it's an appliance store or home furnishings, people feel freer to spend the extra couple of dollars for the brand, the customer service and the quality," said Art Bonell, a portfolio manager with the Bonell Growth Fund, which owns shares of Home Depot and other retail stocks. "That's the basic underlying reason for strength in retail sales."
Earnings at Home Depot Inc. rose 32.5 percent in the quarter, to $357.9 million, or 48 cents a share, from $270.1 million, or 37 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The results were 2 cents higher than consensus estimates by First Call Inc.
The results were fueled by a strong economy and swelling ranks of homeowners, analysts said. Home Depot, which is based in Atlanta, also benefited from consolidation in its market, with the Hechinger Company planning to combine with Kmart's Builders Square, and with Payless Cashways Inc. and Grossman's Inc. in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
"They are really starting to benefit from the obvious acceleration of consolidation in the industry," said Don Trott, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman.
Analysts also cited good inventory control and expense management. Selling and operating expenses for the stores fell to 16.8 percent of sales, from 17 percent in the period a year earlier.
Sales rose 24 percent, to $6.55 billion. Sales in stores open at least a year rose 5 percent.
The Dayton Hudson Corporation, which owns department stores and the Target discount chain, said earnings rose 28.7 percent, to $130 million, or 56 cents a share, from $101 million, or 44 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The most recent quarter included a charge of $11 million, or 5 cents a share, for the retirement of debt. The results before the charge surpassed Wall Street forecasts of 56 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by I.B.E.S. International Inc. Revenue rose 9.4 percent, to $6.29 billion.
Dayton Hudson, which is based in Minneapolis, benefited from growth at its Target stores. Target accounted for three-fourths of second-quarter revenue.
Dayton Hudson said Target's operating profit rose 14 percent, to $274 million. The division's sales also increased 14 percent with those at stores open at least one year up 6 percent. Target's margins narrowed as it made larger markdowns on clearance items.
The department store division more than doubled its operating profit, to $33 million from $12 million. Sales increased 1 percent, with those at comparable stores down 1 percent. Margins improved at its Marshall Field's, Dayton's and Hudson's department stores on lower expenses and higher merchandise markups.
Tiffany & Company reported a 25.3 percent gain in earnings. The company earned $10.4 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with $8.3 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. That beat by a penny the average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S.
Helped by strong jewelry sales at its year-old Tokyo store, revenue rose 7.1 percent, to $217.1 million.
Tiffany received a lift from international sales, which rose 3 percent, to $90.9 million, even as the dollar rose in value.
Limited Inc. reported sluggish sales for the quarter. Earnings fell 17 percent, to $27.6 million, or 10 cents a share, from $33.2 million, or 12 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. The results matched analysts' expectations.
"We haven't seen a turnaround at Limited," said Peter Schaeffer, an analyst with Dillon, Read & Company. "I can't blame it on the customer; I have to blame it on the company."
Revenue rose 6.6 percent, to $2.02 billion. Sales in stores open at least a year, were unchanged, he said.
The Limited owns 83 percent of Intimate Brands Inc., which operates the Victoria's Secret clothing chain, and 84 percent of the Abercrombie & Fitch clothing chain. It also operates Lane Bryant, Lerner New York and Henri Bendel.
At the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation, sales of clothing, shoes and accessories faltered as customers shunned fashions tailored more for younger women than for the professional and conservative customers above the age of 25.
"Sales fell below plan every month in the second quarter," said Maura Hunter Byrne, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities.
The company earned $812,000, or 3 cents a share, compared with $627,000, or 3 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. The most recent quarter included a charge of $173,000, or 1 cent a share, for the repayment of debt.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Little Change In Bonds as Fed Stays Put

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities closed mixed yesterday, with a token gain, after the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee decided to keep interest rates unchanged.
The benchmark 30-year bond rose 4/32 to a price of 98 9/32 for a yield to maturity of 6.51 percent, down from 6.52 percent on Monday. 
 Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the central bank's decision had been widely anticipated because of the lack of inflation pressure.
"Indeed, despite the solid pace of economic growth," he said, "the Fed is likely to refrain from another tightening move until it has reason to believe that the business advance is strong enough to produce a sustained uplift in prices, in which case the central bank will act pre-emptively as a deterrent."
The Fed last raised an interest rate in March, increasing the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, by 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent. Its policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, left rates unchanged at meetings in May and July.
Strong economic expansion has pushed the official unemployment rate to 4.8 percent, the lowest in more than two decades, resulting in a tight labor market that has not, however, brought the inflationary pressure often associated with expansion. Fears of layoffs, new technology and global competition have been cited as factors that have helped keep price and wage pressure at bay.
Data on housing starts in July, released yesterday, were unchanged at 1.47 million units, an outcome that Mr. Fine called slightly below expectations. "Nevertheless, the housing market remains very vibrant and healthy, particularly for this mature phase of the economic expansion," he said. "Tomorrow's June trade balance should help shore up revisions to second-quarter G.D.P., while the Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing survey on Thursday will provide an early peek into the August economic environment."
The bond market, Mr. Fine added, appears to be in a trading range for now, and buyers are likely to wait for some major indicators to be released over the next three weeks, the first of which will be data on durable-goods orders next Tuesday.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said the housing data indicated continuing growth in consumer spending in the coming year.
"We have maintained that consumer spending will continue to grow at a healthy, but not excessive rate in the second half of the year, and the housing data support this analysis," Mr. McCarthy said. "For the Fed, the persistent strength of the housing sector is something they will monitor. If housing activity accelerates, it could be a cause for concern about possible overheating of the economy. But as long as starts remain in the range of the past two years, 1.4 million to 1.5 million units, they will have no impact on monetary policy."
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said he did not foresee a tightening of money by the Fed at its next rate-setting meeting on Sept. 30, but "we do foresee another 25-basis-point Federal funds rate rise in response to the inevitable string of very strong retail sales reports, although we currently do not see this happening until early 1998."
That view runs counter to the prevailing view among Wall Street economists that the Fed will tighten money before the end of the year, with one in four expecting a rate increase at the Sept. 30 meeting.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, Discover Card priced $789 million of asset-backed securities through a special trust, Discover Card MT 1997-1. Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley priced the securities, which are backed by credit card receivables, in two parts. The first part consisted of $750 million in securities with an average life of five years, that were priced to yield the London interbank offered rate plus 9 basis points. The second part, $39.5 million in securities, was priced at the London rate plus 27 basis points.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Again vs. Mark On Bundesbank Rate Decision

BYLINE: By Bridge News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday for a second consecutive day after the Bundesbank, the German central bank, left an interest rate unchanged. The dollar also benefited from a strong recovery in United States stocks.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar advanced slightly as a Japanese economic official distanced himself from previous comments that record-low interest rates there were poised to rise later this year. 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.8388 marks, from 1.8305 marks on Monday. The dollar also rose to 118.21 yen, from 117.82 yen. The British pound rose to $1.6054, from $1.6047.
The decision yesterday by the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady was expected and had only a minor impact in the market.
The dollar rose against the yen in Asian trading after Taro Aso, the director general of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, distanced himself from a remark earlier this month that Japanese rates would rise by the year's end. Mr. Aso had said that it would merely be natural if rates rose once the Japanese economy recovered from its stagnation.
Against the mark, the dollar climbed after the Bundesbank left its benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at 3 percent at a weekly securities repurchase auction. That decision, coupled with a smaller-than-expected July rise of 5.7 percent in the M-3 measure of Germany's money supply, convinced many currency traders that the Bundesbank would not raise German rates when its policy council meets tomorrow.
The rise in the money supply "eliminates the chance of a rate hike on Thursday because if you believe what the Bundesbank says, it closely watches the M-3, and today's number handcuffs them," Michael Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco, said.
Comments from the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, also helped dash expectations for higher German rates. He told a Spanish newspaper that recent dollar strength was not a risk for European inflation and that the Bundesbank should wait before raising rates.
The dollar was also bolstered by continued strength in the United States stock market.

HEADLINE: In Mir's Path: Hard Lesson

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Big rockets can launch warheads as easily as astronauts and throughout the space age have been used interchangeably for such wildly dissimilar jobs. This fact of technological life is one of the main reasons that Washington puts up with the tragicomedy of the Russian Mir space station.
As Mir has lurched from glitch to near-disaster, Americans who watched NASA astronauts join their Russian counterparts on the station wondered why the space agency would put them in a situation so seemingly unsafe. 
 The answer may be that NASA -- and the Government -- have a lot riding on the Russian program.
After the nightmare of the cold war, Washington wants to do all it can to help the shaky Russian economy, especially its aerospace component. The United States wants to encourage Russia to use its aerospace brawn for constructive rather than destructive ends. In particular, it wants to discourage the Russians from selling big rockets to countries that might use them for nuclear war and blackmail.
Many in official Washington, especially Vice President Al Gore, have forged cooperative links between Mir and the American space program and work hard to keep the bonds strong. When the cooperative program got under way, the United States provided cash incentives, and nowadays when things go awry, they look the other way.
These costs are considered small compared with the political, economic and technical benefits.
"Mir documents the possibility of big changes in the relationship of countries that used to be enemies," a White House official said yesterday. American astronauts gain valuable experience from their service on Mir, the official said, adding, "It looks like a tough day at the office, but people know how to handle these problems."
Perhaps no one in Washington has worked harder on the Mir conundrum than Daniel S. Goldin, the head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
"You can't make this unbelievable transition from pointing weapons at one another to working together without bumps in the road," Mr. Goldin said in June 1995 as a space shuttle roared aloft for the first Mir rendezvous. "If you put your mind to something and search for common interests, you can build bridges."
Despite recent woes and cliffhangers (some aerospace experts would say because of them), the aging Mir outpost is considered an important learning experience for the Americans, who have nothing similar.
It is also seen as important bridge to an even bigger East-West endeavor -- the international space station, a behemoth the size of a football field. Beginning next year, it is to be built piecemeal in space, and by 2003 it is to hold up to seven astronauts. Fifteen nations are contributing to its construction.
The deal includes financial aid to Moscow in the form of a $400 million contract for space hardware and launching services. Not coincidentally, Moscow gave in to American calls for it to drop a planned sale of advanced rocket engines to India, which Washington viewed as dangerously destabilizing the tense subcontinent.
As a warmup to the international station, shuttle astronauts are now making seven visits to Mir; five have occurred so far. The final visit is to end next June, just as work gets under way on the bigger outpost.
"It's the early phases of the long-term marriage of the U.S. and Russian" programs, Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said yesterday in an interview. "And it's a bargain in programmatic terms, aside from the broader geopolitical security elements."
If all goes well, the East-West collaboration will lead to a 470-ton, 356-foot-long outpost for scientists studying the heavens, the Earth and things like the physiological response to extended periods of weightlessness -- key information if people are ever to venture to distant worlds.
The big station is meant to last at least 10 years and will cost some $50 billion to build and run.
The woes of the 11-year-old Mir have raised questions about whether it should be abandoned in favor of the big outpost, which is viewed as safer. But many analysts say the new international station will have its own accidents and dangers, some of which could be major.
"All the things that have happened could happen in the future," said Jerry Grey, policy director of the American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics in Washington, a professional group of aerospace engineers. "If we planned the use of Mir in the most effective way," he added, "we would have had all these accidents. It's invaluable experience."

HEADLINE: Air Force Acts To Cut Stress Among Pilots

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Worried by reports that the pilots of its jet fighters and other warplanes were being worked too hard, the Air Force said today that it was sharply curtailing the number of major flight competitions and canceling a large training program.
The move came after a study prepared for the Air Force found that the high stress levels among its pilots were leading to alcoholism, divorce and low morale. 
 The Air Combat Command, which is based at Langley Air Force Base, Va., and which operates all of the service's warplanes, said in a statement that "reducing operations tempo is a top priority."
The Air Force said it was canceling two large pilot competitions planned for later this year, Gunsmoke '97 and Proud Shield, and rescheduling them for next year. Two competitions scheduled for 1998 were rescheduled for 1999. And a large training program, Checkered Flag, which was established in 1979 to insure the wartime readiness of the Tactical Air Command, was ended.
Commanders have been alarmed in recent years by the number of pilots who have chosen to leave the service, many complaining that their assignments were too long and too stressful. Earlier this summer, the Air Force said it would reduce the standard overseas deployment for air crews to 45 days from 90.
But the new study prepared for the Air Force by the Rand Corporation, a research organization based in California, shows that those cuts may not have gone far enough to deal with the pilots' concerns.
The Air Force declined to make the report public, but a copy was obtained by The Washington Times, which reported today that the Rand study had found widespread complaints among air crews about the pace and stress of their jobs.

HEADLINE: CONCLUDING THE U.P.S. STRIKE: THE PENSION PLAN;
Teamsters, Not Company, Will Reap Benefits of Bull Market

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The teamsters' tentative settlement with the United Parcel Service maintains a pension plan in which the benefits of the rising stock market flow to workers through increased retirement benefits instead of to the company through lower costs.
Because of the rising stock market, the typical U.P.S. driver's pension improved by about 60 percent from 1987 to 1994, said Teresa Ghilarducci, an associate professor of pension economics at the University of Notre Dame. 
 Had the kind of pension plan that U.P.S. wanted been in effect during those years, Professor Ghilarducci said, pension benefits would have risen by a fraction of that amount, but the company would have seen its annual pension costs decline or possibly even vanish.
U.P.S. participates in 21 defined-benefit pension plans, called multi-employer plans, which cover workers at many trucking companies. The teamsters union and the companies jointly oversee investment of the pension funds in stocks, bonds and real estate.
In multi-employer plans, each company contributes a fixed amount that is usually based on the number of hours worked by its employees. Over all, 8.1 million workers participate in such plans, the Labor Department said yesterday.
The more common type of plan, called a single-employer plan, covers workers at one company. The Labor Department said 32.3 million workers were in such plans.
Single-employer plans may be owned by the company or jointly administered with a union, as U.P.S. had proposed. In either case, the company contributes as much as is needed to cover benefits, with many companies not having to make any contributions in recent years because of the rising stock market.
The reason that the 20 percent of workers in multi-employer plans benefit from the rising stock market has to do with tax law. Congress limits the amount of money in pension plans, denying tax deductions for new contributions to any plan that has 1.5 times as much as it needs to pay pension benefits. When that limit is reached, the only way to make future contributions tax-deductible is to increase benefits until the funding ratio falls below the limit in the tax code.
When the full funding limit is reached in a single-employer plan, the company not only can stop making contributions, but it can also even take back the surplus.
Companies can also increase benefits, but that happens far less frequently, Professor Ghilarducci found after analyzing every pension plan report filed with the Labor Department in 1980 and 1993 to determine their generosity factor, which is the year-over-year increase in the value of benefits to each worker.
The generosity factor for single employer plans rose to $900 from $700, she said, while multi-employer plans increased to $1,000 from $400. That means that the generosity of multi-employer plans grew at nearly nine times the rate of single-employer plans.
Increased generosity shows up in bigger pension checks and other benefits, like shorter eligibility requirements for retirement benefits, larger payments to a surviving spouse and retirement with full benefits at the age of 50, compared with the typical normal retirement age of 65 in single-employer plans.
The tentative pact also works to the advantage of teamsters in the plans who do not work for U.P.S.
"The fact that U.P.S. is going to remain in the multi-employer plans is very good news for the teamsters institutionally," said Bob Walter, a pension lawyer with Buck Consultants in Secaucus, N.J. "If U.P.S. had won in this issue, it could have started a run on these plans by other employers."
Multi-employer plans, which are common in trucking, construction and other highly fragmented industries, allow workers to switch employers within an industry without reducing the value of their pension. Thus any U.P.S. drivers laid off because of business lost during the strike will not lose pension benefits if they find work with other employers in the multi-employer plans.
Workers in single-employer plans who switch employers end up with smaller retirement checks because their pension from the first employer is frozen and they must start over earning retirement benefits. Under Federal pension rules, an individual who works for nine such employers over 40 years can end up with no pension, while the same person in a multi-employer plan would get full benefits.
Harry Conaway, a pension expert at William M. Mercer, the nation's largest benefits consulting firm, said one reason U.P.S. wanted out of the multi-employer plans was the way the law treats money owed to such plans by employers that go out of business without having made all of their contributions. The other employers must make up these shortfalls if gains from investments do not cover them, said Mr. Conaway, a former chief of pension tax policy in the Reagan Administration.
He said a dominant employer in such plans could end up subsidizing competitors. Mr. Conaway cited as an example a multi-employer plan that requires 1,000 hours of work annually for full benefits and which requires a specific dollar contribution by the employer for each hour worked. A company whose workers average 1,600 hours, but whose competitors average 1,000 hours, would effectively subsidize the pensions of workers at competing companies.

HEADLINE: CONCLUDING THE U.P.S. STRIKE: THE EMPLOYEES;
Rank and File's Verdict: A Walkout Well Waged

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 19

 BODY:
When money for a baby sitter ran out several days ago, Maria Leon, a striking United Parcel Service worker, stood in the rain on the picket line with her 3-year-old son, Adolfo, and nearly wept at her powerlessness.
"But we didn't give up," Mrs. Leon said today, her eyes now as bright and full as sunshine on the prairie, "and that made all the difference." 
 On picket lines outside U.P.S. depots across America, as here in Chicago, there was downright elation over the terms of the tentative pact between the company and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
"It's a big win not only for the union but for labor," said Robert Ridley, a 44-year-old U.P.S. driver in Austin, Tex. "This was labor against corporate America."
In Chicago, home of the nation's largest teamster local representing U.P.S. workers, with about 12,000 members, the strike will last a day or so longer, a result of a longstanding tradition of independence by the local, No. 705.
The Chicago local will sign its tentative pact with U.P.S. soon after the national union formally completes its deal, probably only a day or two later, said Paul Waterhouse, a spokesman for 705. The terms of the Chicago agreement are unlikely to differ from the national package in any significant way.
Many United Parcel workers said they were eager to see the details of the agreement, but they voiced unreserved joy over two central provisions: the company's promise to add 10,000 full-time jobs over five years and to raise the pay of part-timers about $4 an hour during the same period.
"I'm looking for one of those full-time jobs," said Bob Hojnacki, a stocky 32-year-old in a baseball cap, who has been a part-time worker for U.P.S. in Chicago since 1984. "I can't tell you how happy that would make me."
Outside the United Parcel depot on the West Side of Manhattan, triumphant strikers were lifting clenched fists in celebration and shouting thanks to passing motorists who leaned on car horns in support.
"I'm ready to jump up and down and shout," said David Johnson, 49, who has worked for U.P.S. since he was a teen-ager. "I'm also looking out for the people who will come after me."
For all the brave talk during the walkout, strikers generally acknowledged that they had been taking a big risk, even in a time of a robust national economy. Indeed, Mr. Hojnacki, among others, said he probably would have voted to support what the company had repeatedly described as its "last, best and final offer," which came nowhere close to the settlement ultimately reached on Monday night.
"Everybody knows what's happened to some unions in this country," Mr. Hojnacki said, tracing the decline in the labor movement's power to President Ronald Reagan's dismissal of striking air traffic controllers.
What is more, many workers said, most American companies have become so focused on raising the price of their stock that interests of workers routinely take a back seat to the interests of shareholders.
Still, the teamsters had gambled that United Parcel had just as much to lose from a strike as the workers.
"Personally, I thought it wouldn't last more than a week, with so much money at stake," said Bill Tom, a $12-an-hour sorter at the main U.P.S. depot in Seattle.
Outside the huge U.P.S. center in the western Chicago suburb of Willow Springs today, hundreds of workers lined up to collect strike benefits. The plant -- which employs 5,500 workers, the vast majority of them part-timers -- has been plagued by problems of turnover and absenteeism, for which many employees blame the nature of an overwhelmingly part-time work force.
"They've even got a problem with workers' pilfering things," said Jeff Ernst, a 29-year-old part-time clerk. "Those problems are always worse when you don't have loyalty. And why are part-timers going to be loyal?"
Gloria Harris, 39, said the strikers had felt inspired by a sense that they were standing up for other working people.
"This sent a message to other companies that you can't keep pushing people so hard, and expect to get away with paying them part-time," said Ms. Harris, a single mother who lives in a two-bedroom apartment in the rough-at-the-edges Chicago neighborhood of Englewood.
Except for those who crossed the picket lines, Ms. Harris said, the strike brought people together in a way that company picnics and bowling leagues never could.
"We now feel more like brothers and sisters than co-workers," she said, noting the diversity of the strikers, who, until the walkout, had often kept to their own racial or ethnic group. "We all learned something about color. It comes down to green."

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE LETS RATES STAND

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, continuing a remarkable economic experiment in which the central bank has kept interest rates low despite shrinking unemployment and unusually strong economic growth.
Today's meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee was the third consecutive time that the central bank has passed up a chance to raise short-term interest rates. The last increase in the key short-term rate that the Fed controls came in March, a quarter-point rise, to 5.50 percent. 
 The Fed's action today was no surprise. A wide variety of recent economic measurements have shown that inflation remains at barely noticeable levels, below an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of the year. That is the lowest inflation rate since the early 1960's, and wholesale prices have declined this year, the first time that has happened in more than four decades.
But the Federal Reserve's job is to anticipate economic trends and to act on such assumptions months in advance. So its decision today to hold its fire may only spur arguments over whether it is missing signs that wages and prices will increase toward the end of this year or in the beginning of 1998.
So far, such evidence is scant. But the concessions made by the United Parcel Service to striking teamsters late Monday, hours before the Federal Open Market Committee met here, are bound to figure in those arguments in coming months.
Some economists were already suggesting today that the wage increases won by the union could signal the end of a remarkable period during which companies have been hard pressed to find qualified new workers, yet there has been little effective pressure from workers for higher wages. Other economists, however, suggested today that the teamsters' gains were more symbolic than precedent-setting, and that global overcapacity, particularly in the production of automobiles, would keep prices down even if companies were forced to pay their workers somewhat more.
The U.P.S. agreement would raise average hourly wages over the life of the five-year contract for full-time workers by $3.10, to $23, and for part-time workers by $4.10, to $15.
As usual, the Fed did not explain its reasoning today, simply announcing that the Federal Open Market Committee had met and adjourned. But that was enough to help extend this week's rebound on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 114.74 points, closing at 7,918.10. Taken together with Monday's gains, the index is now up 223 points from Friday, when it lost 247 points in a broad-ranging selloff.
The stock market's potential reaction may have had some influence on today's decision to hold interest rates steady. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has made no secret of his fear that the air could come out of the high-flying market too quickly; that may have been why he declined last month, in Congressional testimony, to repeat his warning that investors risked "irrational exuberance."
Among economists and traders, there has been widespread speculation in recent weeks that Mr. Greenspan now fears that even a modest increase in interest rates could bring about the selloff he has been trying to avoid.
"Clearly, the market is overvalued," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation. "And with everyone this jittery and unsure, it would have been a very, very poor time to raise rates."
But Mr. Sung is among those predicting that rates may rise modestly after the Open Market Committee's next meeting, on Sept. 30. "By that time, there will be more evidence about growth in the third quarter," Mr. Sung said. That growth figure is widely forecast to be around 3 percent, meaning that growth over the past four quarters would average around 3.6 percent.
If such figures hold, the Fed will have to face anew the question of whether huge investments by American businesses in recent years -- combined with new technology, the effects of which are not easily measured -- have given the economy greater capacity for noninflationary growth than would be expected under conventional economic theories.
Over the last year, Mr. Greenspan has suggested that the economy may be able to grow beyond its traditional speed limits without risking trouble.
"There is scant evidence," he said in an assessment in May that still applies today, "of any imminent resurgence of inflation."
The question is when he might decide that such experimentation has reached its limits. A few months ago, economists were predicting he would do so this month. But Mr. Greenspan has acted less like a theoretician than a pragmatist, and the indicators he surveys each day have shown little sign of change. Many of the same economists who believed that rates would be increased in July are now saying that the raise will come at the Fed's meeting in September.
But whenever the Fed does decide to raise rates, Mr. Greenspan will have to marshal evidence to justify the move. He was harshly criticized in Congress for a series of increases in 1994 and early 1995, and the White House was visibly uneasy. Now, after a spate of revisionist history, Mr. Clinton's economic policy makers say those increases were vital to sustaining the current expansion.
So far, both organized labor and business have insisted that no interest rate increase is necessary, a position the National Association of Manufacturers restated today.
"The Federal Reserve has acted wisely by choosing not to act at all," the association said in a statement. "Clearly, there are no major cost increases in the pipeline. In fact, as these price declines feed through to the final sales level, the inflation rate should slow even further." The association said its own forecasts predicted that in the year 2000, inflation "will still be in the range of 2 percent."

No Change in Rates, For Now, Fed Decides
The Federal Reserve voted to leave interest rates unchanged, continuing a remarkable economic experiment in which the central bank has kept rates low despite shrinking unemployment and unusually strong economic growth.
Still, the Fed's action was no surprise, as a variety of recent economic measurements show that inflation remains at barely noticeable levels, indicating no need to apply the monetary brakes. [Page A1.] 

While growth has been strong, the pace has shown signs of moderating. That trend continued in the housing market in July, with the Commerce Department reporting that housing starts remained at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.45 million, the same as in June. Analysts had expected a slight increase. [D6.]
 
The economic developments appeared to have little effect on the bond market, despite a surge in stocks. The 30-year Treasury bond was almost unchanged, with the yield slipping to 6.51 percent from 6.52. [D15.]
 
Teamsters Celebrate U.P.S. Deal
Teamsters like Kevin Hartman in Watertown, Mass., are going back to work, celebrating an agreement with the United Parcel Service that they assert is a major victory. Though company officials said that as many as 15,000 workers may be laid off because of losses of business resulting from the strike, they acknowledged that they had made a series of concessions on pay, pensions and part-time workers. [A1.]
 
Mixed Results for Retailers
Retailers of very different stripes -- Home Depot, Dayton Hudson and Tiffany -- reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. But results were disappointing at two women's clothing chains, Ann Taylor and the Limited. [D3.]
 
Higher Bid for Canadian Insurer
A group led by Great-West Lifeco opened a bidding war for London Insurance Group of Canada, offering $2.1 billion, in a move to create Canada's biggest insurer. The offer is 22 percent higher than a previous one from Royal Bank of Canada. [D4.]
 
Strong Dell Results Lift Stock
Dell Computer reported earnings that exceeded estimates, as it continued to take market share away from other personal computer makers. In anticipation of the results, which were reported after the close of the market, investors bid up the company's stock. [D2.]
 
Settlement, but No Explanation
Presstek, a company whose stock was one of the fastest climbers in the mid-1990's and is still trading at more than 100 times earnings, disclosed that it had agreed to settle charges to be brought by the S.E.C. But in an unusual announcement, it provided little elaboration of what the charges involved.
Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D6.]
 
Ameritech Bid Is Rejected
Regulators, as expected, rejected Ameritech's proposal to become the first Baby Bell to offer long-distance phone service, but they tried to spell out how those companies could qualify in the future. [D3.]
 
Watching the Market, Nervously
Many universities are growing increasingly dependent on endowments that involve stock -- no problem, perhaps, when the market is booming, but cause for concern when there are price gyrations. [B9.]

HEADLINE: Center of Local Power in Capital Resides With Assertive Economist

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Over lunch recently, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. got the word from the man who has essentially taken over his job, Andrew F. Brimmer, the chairman of the financial control board. Dr. Brimmer said he would gladly approve Mr. Barry's nominees to head the major city agencies, as long as the Mayor picked the right people.
"I said, 'Look, we'd like very much if you were to recommend these, then we'd vote to approve your recommendations,' " Dr. Brimmer said in an interview in his office. 
 As Dr. Brimmer told it, the Mayor, after being stripped by Congress of almost all but the power to annoy the chairman, waited for a day before faxing over his acquiescence to the list of names -- minutes before the control board meeting at which the appointments were to be announced.
"I was literally out the door and we still didn't have his list," Dr. Brimmer said. "My secretary called the Mayor's secretary and she said it was being typed. We got it five minutes before the meeting."
Ultimately, he said, the right names were on it, "so we could say 'upon the recommendation of the Mayor.' "
Mr. Barry declined through a spokeswoman to comment on a discussion that she said Dr. Brimmer had promised to keep private. But the spokeswoman said the list had come late because the Mayor had had trouble reaching two of the nominees on it.
Such are the games the players play in the nation's capital, where a buttoned-down Harvard-trained economist, the private but prideful Dr. Brimmer, has faced off with an elected leader, Mr. Barry, whose credentials come from the civil rights movement and whose street smarts got him re-elected even after a misdemeanor cocaine conviction.
Dr. Brimmer, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board, has emerged as the real power in this power-loving town. The budget bill signed by President Clinton earlier this month gave the down-at-the-heels District almost $1 billion over five years -- and transferred more authority from elected to appointed officials, at least temporarily, on a board that was created by Congress two years ago.
The legislation expanded Dr. Brimmer's already considerable power by giving the control board the authority to approve agency heads. As a result, Dr. Brimmer has come under extreme pressure from both ends of the political spectrum.
Some community advocates call him an aspiring dictator, eagerly overseeing what Mr. Barry ceaselessly refers to as "the rape of democracy." Some Congressional Republicans grouse that he has not moved quickly enough to neutralize a breathtakingly inefficient local government with a history of corruption.
Even Dr. Brimmer's supporters seem to take an extreme view, tagging him as the last hope for an unruly place where the timely distribution of parking tickets is widely regarded as the most reliable city service. There are those who see him as a little too regal -- running through the streets shouting 'L'etat, c'est moi!' -- and those who feel reassured that he seems willing to do whatever is necessary to make the schools safe and fill the potholes.
But there are few who feel they really know him; unlike the flamboyant titular head of local government, Dr. Brimmer is understated. And with a manner that is quite formal -- some would say forbidding in these come-as-you-are times -- not many ordinary people dare to approach him, he said.
"For someone to come up and speak to me takes an effort, and I know that," Dr. Brimmer said. "I am widely recognized, but no one just rushes up to me."
They do feel free to swamp his home answering machine with messages -- he is listed in the directory -- but he said he got most feedback secondhand, or from taxi drivers.
Several dozen protesters chanting "Free D.C." disrupted the recent control board meeting where Dr. Brimmer announced that he was in charge of most of the city government. Still, he said he believed his mail, which he said was mostly positive, and discounted the critics.
"While the decibels have been very strong, I've never thought it was widespread or deeply rooted," Dr. Brimmer said of the opposition to his expanded powers.
Mark Plotkin, a political analyst for WAMU, a local affiliate of National Public Radio, who originally supported Dr. Brimmer, said he was out of touch with public sentiment.
"He's gone power mad," Mr. Plotkin said. "He doesn't respect the democratic process, and he's totally removed from the citizenry. His personality is such a handicap. There's no human face to the control board. We're a sick patient and he has no bedside manner."
But Dr. Brimmer, 70, who describes himself as the head of a rescue operation and his city as "in crises, in numerous crises," is not much inclined to explain himself. And he presents himself as immune to criticism.
Asked how he responded to specific complaints, Dr. Brimmer said: "I don't. I don't engage in public debate. I don't need the drama. Why should I produce drama when I can produce action?"
He is not cocky for nothing: His story is downright inspirational. But he cannot seem to help digressing into little tutorials while giving a guided tour of his life. ("I was born two miles from the Mississippi River on Lake St. Joseph, one of the oxbow lakes. How did they become lakes -- long, crescent-shaped and narrow? Because of soft soil.")
He grew up in rural Louisiana, the son of a sharecropper, and as a boy picked cotton and was in charge of raising the family's pigs. He went to a segregated high school that gave blacks mainly vocational training, left home at 17 to join a sister in Washington state and was drafted into the Army five days before World War II ended in Europe. Later, he went back to school on the G.I. Bill. And he becomes unusually animated when he talks about the first days of his love affair with economic theory.
"When I went to college in 1947, virtually every economist you talked to was caught up in ways to avoid another Depression," he said.
Later, he went to India on a Fulbright scholarship and taught at Michigan State University, the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University, where he received his Ph.D.
His research assistant at Michigan State, Bernard Anderson, now an Assistant Secretary of Labor, said Dr. Brimmer was the most exciting teacher he ever had, a brilliant man whose passion for economics was contagious. Mr. Anderson recalled a seminar taught by Milton Friedman and said Dr. Brimmer had interrupted the presentation to correct the equation he was working on.
"Friedman said, 'You're right,' " Mr. Anderson, recalled. "He challenged the guru of monetary theory! It was thrilling, and not just because we were the only two African-Americans in the room."
In 1966, Dr. Brimmer was the first black person appointed to the Federal Reserve Board, where he is still remembered by longtime aides as an exceptionally hard-working and prolific researcher.
Even in those days, he was a controversial figure among blacks. He once said black banks were "ornamental," rather than engines for economic development, and presented a rather dire economic assessment of crime among blacks.
"They didn't use the word 'traitor,' " Dr. Brimmer said, "but they said I had provided our enemies with ammunition."
And then, as now, he said those who doubted his loyalties should "be concerned about stopping the deterioration rather than stopping the messenger."
Asked why he had taken the unpaid position of board chairman, which routinely takes at least four days a week from the consulting business that made him a millionaire, he said: "Maybe it's conceit. But first of all, I've been flattered that several Presidents thought I had talent to put to public service."
He was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce under President John F. Kennedy. Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. Brimmer to the Federal Reserve Board. And he was named to lead the control board by President Clinton.
Dr. Brimmer insisted that life in the District was getting better and said a mandate to fill the potholes had recently been sent to the new head of the public works department.
"I said, 'This is a campaign and you are the general,' " he said.
He said no one should expect a flash of light and an overnight turnaround. He also acknowledged that he had been extremely frustrated by city officials who did not respond to the board's recommendations until they were forced to.
"At first we thought we'd make recommendations and the City Council and Mayor would accept them and follow through," he said. "But instead, we'd make recommendations and nothing would happen."
"We were ignored," he said, until Congress expanded the board's powers. Finally, last fall, the board pushed out the schools superintendent, turned the elected school board into an advisory body and installed a retired Army general to run the schools.
Although critics saw that act as undemocratic, Dr. Brimmer said he had no doubts about whether he had done the right thing.
"I don't have sleepless nights, I don't toss and turn and I don't dream about the control board," he added, laughing at some length at his own jocularity.
Does he never doubt himself?
"No, of course not," he said firmly. "I mean, I don't always say everything I say and do is right. But I've never thought of myself as muddle-headed and I see no reason to start."
