HEADLINE: Resurrecting The Tale That Inspired and Sank Melville

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
In the early 1840's, as a whaling seaman not yet embarked on his prodigious literary career, Herman Melville read Owen Chase's "Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex." Later he wrote in his own copy of the "Narrative": "The reading of this wondrous story upon the landless sea, & close to the very latitude of the shipwreck had a surprising effect on me."
The surprising effect was to give Melville the inspiration for the ending of "Moby-Dick," the sinking, or "the stoving," of the Pequod by the white whale. In the fictionalized version there is only one survivor, Ishmael. In the case of the Essex the 20-man crew lived through the attack, but in the long, disastrous voyage that followed, 12 of them died, some cannibalized by their shipmates. 
 The sinking of the Essex and the aftermath are brought viscerally to life in Nathaniel Philbrick's "In the Heart of the Sea," which begins where "Moby-Dick" ends.
"The Essex was absolutely crucial to Melville's conception of the novel," Mr. Philbrick said during a recent visit to New York from his home in Nantucket, Mass. "A book that we think of as such a discursive wandering into the imagination has a ballast of real fact that was very important to Melville. This could happen. This did happen. That's what my book is about."
Almost every year there are new books dealing with aspects of Melville, and adaptations of his work onstage, in films or on television. "Melville is in the air," said Mr. Philbrick, who has hit the crest of that wave. His book is both a critical success and an international best seller. For a time it was first on best-seller lists in London and Dublin.
Recognizing the increasing interest in Melville, Hershel Parker, who is completing the second volume of his monumental biography of the author, attributed it partly to "a general desire to be stirred, moved, exalted, ennobled by what we read," in particular by Melville's mythic voyages. "The boom is not over by any means," he said. "Only in recent years has Melville entered the national consciousness beyond 'Moby-Dick.' "
Led by books like "In the Heart of the Sea," he added, "We are ready to look at Melville as a participant in one of the great American adventures: the whaling industry."
In addition to "In the Heart of the Sea," Elizabeth Hardwick's "Herman Melville," an intense psychosexual analysis of the author's art in the Penguin series of brief lives of famous people, and Tim Severin's personalized expedition, "In Search of Moby Dick: The Quest for the White Whale," have recently been published.
Rinde Eckert's "And God Created Great Whales," a bold experimental musical starring Mr. Eckert as a composer attempting to write an operatic version of "Moby-Dick," had a brief run at Dance Theater Workshop in June and is scheduled to reopen next month off Broadway. For the show Mr. Eckert has written -- and sings -- several songs that have the power of the novel.
In the works is "Melville's World," a book by Andrew Delbanco that will be an "effort to see the world Melville lived in through his eyes" and his "incredibly penetrating intelligence." Mr. Delbanco, an author and critic who has been teaching Melville for more than 20 years, plans to deal in the book with the novelist's "response to the Civil War, industrialization, human sexuality and changes in race and religion in America."
The fascination with Melville begins, of course, with "Moby-Dick." In 1850 Melville moved from Manhattan to Pittsfield, Mass., where he bought a farm he named Arrowhead. Two important things happened while he was there. He met Nathaniel Hawthorne, who became his friend and mentor, and, looking out the window of his study toward the whalelike Mount Greylock, he completed "Moby-Dick" and dedicated it to Hawthorne.
When his masterwork was published in 1851, Melville was only 32 and already the author of five novels, beginning with "Typee" and "Omoo," popular adventure stories based on his life at sea. Readers apparently had hoped for another "Typee" and were not prepared for a daring metaphorical exploration of a man's obsession with good and evil and his monomaniacal act of vengeance. The book was unappreciated and sold few copies, in contrast to Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter," which was published the previous year.
Melville immediately followed "Moby-Dick" with the obdurate "Pierre: or the Ambiguities" and became increasingly bitter at his lack of success. He also felt abandoned when Hawthorne moved from the Berkshires to Concord, Mass. During the last two decades of his life, Melville worked as a clerk in the Customs House in Manhattan and gave up writing fiction, more or less becoming a real-life counterpart to the passive clerk he wrote about in "Bartleby the Scrivener." During this time he was writing his epic poem, "Clarel."
Long after the author's death, "Moby-Dick" was rediscovered and became the foundation of his career and of American literature itself. Acknowledging the book's neglect in the author's lifetime, the English critic James Wood says: "Melville wrote the novel that is every writer's dream of freedom. It is as if he painted a patch of blue sky for the imprisoned."
Mr. Philbrick, a former sailing journalist who has written several books about Nantucket and is himself an expert on Melville, calls "Moby-Dick" "the most profound book about America, whaling -- and the world."
He got the idea for "In the Heart of the Sea," he said, while cruising with his wife and children on a ship off the coast of Maine. It was the summer of 1997 -- of "The Perfect Storm" and "Into the Air" and the movie "Titanic." These were, he said, "survival stories, and the ultimate survival story" was the Essex. "It's a piece of American history," he said. "Before the Donner Party, there was the Essex disaster."
His father, Thomas Philbrick, a professor of English, had told the story of the Essex to him and his brother when they were children, and diverse books had been written about it. Mr. Philbrick was just finishing a book about the "Native American legacy on Nantucket," he said, and the epilogue referred to the Essex, "tying it in with Melville's mythmaking."
He wondered if the story could be approached in a new way, profiting from contemporary information about areas like oceanography and starvation. He gathered books and other documents into what he described as his war room. While writing the book he took a leave from his position as director of the Egan Institute of Maritime Studies on Nantucket.
Drawing upon Chase's "Narrative" and Thomas Nickerson's "Desultory Sketches," a first-person account by the cabin boy on the Essex, he weighed one report against the other. It was from Nickerson's monograph that he learned that Chase, the first mate, had an opportunity to lance the whale after its first attack but decided not to take the chance. The two narratives and other first-person accounts were recently published in a book, "The Loss of the Ship Essex, Sunk by a Whale," edited by Mr. Philbrick and his father.
The tragic paradox of the Essex was that the captain, George Pollard, recommended that they head for Tahiti instead of remaining at sea, but the crew was fearful of encountering cannibals and overruled him. As Melville wrote in his annotations in his copy of Chase's "Narrative": "All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might, in all human probability, have been avoided had they immediately after leaving the wreck, steered straight for Tahiti, from which they were not very distant at the time. But they dreaded cannibals." Melville knew that missionaries had been on the island and that it was safe.
"In the Heart of the Sea," published by Viking, is also about Nantucket, the port from which the Essex and the Pequod sailed. At the time, the early 1800's, the island's economy centered on whaling. Young men signed on for periods of two or three years. After several trips they could afford to retire. There was, Mr. Philbrick said, a "brotherhood of workers" on whaling ships. At the same time, in his book, he contemplates the fact that none of the African-American seamen survived the Essex disaster.
Although Melville had not been on Nantucket before he wrote "Moby-Dick," he was able to give a knowledgeable history of the island and he also borrowed many local names for his characters. In his first visit, after the novel was published, he met Captain Pollard, who was then working as a night watchman. He was, Melville wrote, "the most impressive man, tho' wholly unassuming, even humble -- that I ever encountered."
Pollard, Mr. Philbrick learned, was a "short, fat, jolly man who loved the good things in life but fasted every Nov. 20 in memory of the Essex survivors." He believes that in many ways Pollard, in his adjustment to the tragedy, was like Ishmael, and that Chase was like Ahab, haunted forever by his experiences at sea.
"I think Melville identified very strongly with Pollard," Mr. Philbrick said. In a sense both their careers were "sunk by a whale." He said that while writing his book he was keenly aware of Melville's looking over his shoulder. "I'd see him walking the streets of Nantucket at night, waving at me," he joked,
As for the title, he said he had looked up the word sea in a biblical concordance and found "in the heart of the sea" in Exodus. Explaining his interest, he said that he regarded the sea as "a frontier that was never civilized." He continued: "You go to the west and there are cities and railroads. You go to the sea and we can pollute it all we want but it's still out there. It's as close to an eternal frontier as we're going to get. There's nothing better than the sea in ridding you of the illusion of mastery," as man is forced to battle elemental forces beyond his control.
"The more I got into the Essex disaster," he said, "the more it seemed that in 'Moby-Dick' there is a deep secret, a darkness lurking. I really feel that's informed by the survival and the suffering of the men of the Essex." He added, "I remain impressed with the dignity, stoicism and discipline of the Essex crew" throughout their ordeal.
In tribute to Melville he ends his book by recalling a scene from "Moby-Dick" in which Ishmael sees a reconstructed skeleton of a whale and realizes how "vain and foolish" it is to try to comprehend such a creature by studying its remains. Melville concludes, "Only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out."
Mr. Philbrick suggests that after "all hope, passion and force of will have been expended, the bones may be all that are left" -- except, of course, for books like "Moby-Dick" and "In the Heart of the Sea."

HEADLINE: How Taxes Trickle Down

BYLINE: By Charles W. Kadlec; Charles W. Kadlec is managing director of J & W Seligman Company, an investment management firm, and author of "Dow 100,000: Fact or Fiction."

 BODY:
It's common for leaders of the Democratic Party to claim that Republican tax cut proposals "favor the rich," but this shows a lack of understanding of the true consequences of today's high tax rates. When Republican leaders fail to challenge this claim, they implicitly endorse the assumption that high-income individuals currently bear the entire burden of high tax rates.
Common sense and experience tell us the reverse. Much of the burden of today's high tax rates falls on individuals with middle and low incomes, and, arguably, these rates have contributed to the increased disparity between rich and poor that has occurred under the Clinton administration. 
 Remember the luxury tax, passed by Congress in 1990 and aimed at the rich who could afford expensive jewelry, furs, automobiles and boats? It was repealed three years later because those hurt worst by the tax were thousands of low- and middle-income workers who lost their jobs as the luxury goods and recreational boating industries suffered a severe recession.
The same phenomenon is occurring now with the tobacco industry, which agreed to pay the states $246 billion over the next two decades to settle lawsuits by the states' attorneys general seeking to recover health care costs. The tobacco industry is not paying for this settlement. The cost has been shifted to smokers, who are paying higher prices for their cigarettes so that the industry can protect its profits while paying the states and lawyers. Not everyone may care that smokers are paying more, but the point is that the tobacco companies simply shifted the burden of the settlement to their customers.
Another shift occurred in 1993, when the Clinton administration increased the top personal income tax rate by 20 percent. The administration promised that the new 39.6 percent rate would affect only those with the highest incomes.
But is that really true? After taxes went up, I noticed that the fees my dentist charged also went up about 20 percent. He wrote the check to the I.R.S., but his customers got the bill.
My dentist was not alone. That year, the income of the top 5 percent of households jumped an average of 20 percent, according to data from the Statistical Abstract of the United States. By contrast, the income of the middle 20 percent fell 1 percent that year.
Fortunately, Americans understand that high taxes jeopardize their financial security. For example, polls show that some 60 percent of people support repeal of the inheritance tax, even though it supposedly only affects the richest 2 percent of all Americans. They may not be able to articulate why the death tax is bad, but they instinctively grasp its true cost.
With effective tax rates rising above 80 percent, the death tax discourages savings and investment, encourages the squandering of assets and allows the government to take most of whatever is left. It silently steals from our communities the investment necessary to build wealth and create jobs.
Middle-class Americans also intuitively understand that high tax rates on personal income are a barrier to prosperity. For example, an average two-income couple in the 31 percent tax bracket must also pay 12.4 percent in Social Security taxes and 2.9 percent in Medicare taxes on each of the two incomes. Add in state and local income taxes, and the marginal tax rate could easily exceed 50 percent.
That means a $30,000 college tuition really costs $60,000. And to put away an extra $250,000 toward retirement, a couple would have to earn $500,000. What's fair about that?
Today's high tax rates also hurt those lower on the economic totem pole. Let's say that someone in the highest tax bracket wants to renovate his house, and pay a contractor $20,000. Assuming the contractor is in the 31 percent bracket, he would take home only about $10,000 after income and other taxes are taken out.
But the high-income family has to pay much more than $20,000. The wage earner must earn $40,000 to afford the $20,000, because he must first pay federal income taxes, Medicare taxes and state and local taxes. So high rates suppress economic activity by depressing both what the family can spend and what the contractor can earn.
Talking about tax cuts in terms of their impact on the "rich" versus the "middle class" only supports the misperception that the wealthy pay the brunt of high tax rates. The reality is that the middle class also pays. The political establishment would be well-advised to listen to the wisdom of the people and lead them where they want to go, to a land of zero death taxes and lower overall rates.

Midwest Industry Pace Slows As Raw Materials Prices Rise

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 31

 BODY:
Manufacturing in the Midwest grew in July at the slowest pace in 18 months while more companies paid higher prices for raw materials, an industry survey showed today.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly index of regional manufacturing decreased to 52 in July from 56.8 in June, pushed down by slow growth in orders. It was the lowest reading since 47.7 in January 1999 and below analysts' expectations of 55.8. 
 "Manufacturing is still growing, but much more slowly," said Suzanne Rizzo, chief United States economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez in New York.
Economists look at the report from the industry-rich Midwest for signs of where the nation's manufacturing is headed. The new figures show that manufacturing has expanded for 18 consecutive months, mirroring national growth.
The slower pace of expansion was accompanied by a surge in costs to manufacturers for oil, natural gas and other materials that pushed up the index of prices paid to 70 from 63.6 in June.
The overall index declined as companies reported slower demand. The new-orders index declined to 53.9 in July from 60.5 in June, the lowest reading since the index fell below 50 in January 1999. The production index fell to 57 this month from 61.1 in June, the lowest reading since 53.1 in January.
Index readings above 50 mean that the number of manufacturers that said business improved, or prices were higher, was greater than the number that said business deteriorated or prices fell.
The employment index, a measure of hiring plans and labor market conditions, fell to 44.8 in July, the fourth consecutive month with a reading below 50. "One reason for declining payrolls is the continued attempt by manufacturers to increase efficiencies and reduce costs, particularly as energy and other raw material costs have risen," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Banc of America Securities in New York.
A national picture will emerge on Tuesday when the National Association of Purchasing Management issues its nationwide factory index for July. Analysts expect a reading of 52.5, close to a June reading of 51.8, which was the lowest in 17 months.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Gain Modestly, Awaiting July Employment Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices moved higher yesterday, led upward by bellwether technology issues, which took a beating for most of last week.
"The technology and telecommunications market was oversold," said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 103.99 points, or 2.8 percent, to 3,766.99, with Intel, Cisco Systems and Oracle increasing. The gain, the first in four sessions, reversed a bit of last week's 11 percent slide in the Nasdaq index. For the month, the Nasdaq fell 5 percent. So far this year, it is down 7.4 percent.
Strong performances from financial stocks like Citigroup, meanwhile, pulled the Dow Jones industrial average up by 10.81 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,521.98. Consumer stocks like Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble fell, limiting the rise in the Dow.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.94 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,430.83.
Despite the gains, analysts and traders said major market averages were likely to remain with a small range for most of this week, and possibly the balance of the summer.
Specifically, they said that economic reports due out Friday, especially employment data for July, will be crucial determinants of how stocks perform between now and Labor Day.
"Everything up to Friday is pretty much noise," said Bob Gasser, head of United States equity trading at J. P. Morgan & Company.
"But Friday is critical. That data released then has the ability to swing consensus about what the Federal Reserve Board will do at the end of the month in one direction, or the other."
Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet on Aug. 22 to determine if short-term interest rates need to be pushed higher. Last month Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told lawmakers that economic data to be released over the next few weeks would determine the course selected by the central bank.
"It's hard to have conviction in a market like this," said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.
Among individual stocks, Cisco Systems, which fell nearly 8 percent last week, gained 2 5/8 yesterday, to 65 7/16. Intel, which had a decline of 6.6 percent last week, rose 2 3/16 yesterday, to 66 3/4. The price reflects a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective yesterday.

Treasury Prices Steady
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices were little changed in a quiet session yesterday with most investors on the sidelines awaiting details of coming government borrowing needs and important economic data, both expected later in the week.
Traders said Treasuries, which have been hemmed in a narrow range since early June, largely ignored reports on regional manufacturing conditions in Chicago and New York. An outright purchase of Treasury securities dated Aug. 15, 2005, to May 15, 2016 kept a floor under the market, they added.
The 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 103 12/32. The note's yield remained at 6.03 percent.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 106 20/32. The bond's yield remained at 5.78 percent.

HEADLINE: Chavez Fails to Get Mandate for Absolute Power in Venezuela

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, July 31

 BODY:
With final results of the "mega-election" here on Sunday tabulated today, President Hugo Chavez has won an overwhelming personal victory, but his coattails were apparently not quite long enough to pull into Congress the followers needed to guarantee him absolute powers.
Mr. Chavez won 59 percent of the vote. But in the races for the National Assembly, pro-Chavez parties won 99 of 165 seats, which although impressive fell just short of the two-thirds majority that would have turned the new single-chamber legislature into a rubber stamp. 
 The two-thirds watershed was crucial to Mr. Chavez's plans to carry out the "peaceful social revolution" he has promised supporters. With it he would have avoided any opposition resistance to decisions to discharge Supreme Court judges and members of Congress; decree certain laws; and appoint prosecutors, members of the Central Bank board and other officials.
"What we need from here on in is to find the path to national unity," said Henrique Salas Feo, the opposition governor of the state of Carabobo, in what was seen as a veiled message to Mr. Chavez to be more conciliatory. "The divisions must end, and we must all have the conviction that we are members of the same community."
But Mr. Chavez's majority in the National Assembly is still large enough to assure passage of an "enabling law" that would allow him to decree at least some of the sweeping measures unpopular with the opposition. It was the granting of those special powers last year that allowed Mr. Chavez to dissolve the opposition-dominated Congress and take over the judicial system.
Also working in his favor is the fact that his adversaries remain fragmented and demoralized. His main rival, Francisco Arias Cardenas, showed few gifts as a campaigner or orator, and the right-of-center political party that divided power for 40 years, called Copei, has all but vanished as an electoral force, winning only five seats in the new legislature.
The traditional left-of-center party here, known as Democratic Action, did much better, and will be the second-largest political grouping in this nation of 23 million people, which in recent years has been the main source of oil imported by the United States. The party holds 32 seats in the National Assembly and won four or five governorships, depending on the outcome of one especially tight race.
At the state level, Mr. Chavez did even better than expected. His Patriotic Pole coalition appears to have won at least 12 of 23 governorships, including the re-election of his father in his home state of Barinas, and also appears to have won a majority of the country's 336 mayoral races. Many political experts had predicted exactly the opposite outcome.
The election Sunday to "relegitimize" Mr. Chavez's rule was required by a new Constitution whose formulation and approval by voters has been the main focus of his first 18 months in office. The Constitution significantly expands the powers of the federal government, especially the executive branch, while eliminating a ban on presidents immediately seeking re-election and extending their term of office to six years from five.
Mr. Chavez quickly made it clear that he intends to take full advantage of all the new features and powers of the charter. In his victory speech early today, for instance, he indicated that he already plans to run for a second term, in hopes of being the nation's chief executive when Venezuela marks the bicentennial of its independence in 2011.
In the speech, delivered from the balcony of the presidential palace here, Mr. Chavez mocked Mr. Arias Cardenas and other political rivals, but took an unusually conciliatory tone toward business leaders who have frequently been objects of his wrath.
"We are all sailing in the same boat," he said, adding that he needed them to "help save the Venezuelan economy," which contracted by 7.2 percent last year despite record high oil prices.
Business leaders responded optimistically to that olive branch. "If he is holding out a hand, now is the time to shake it," said Antonio Herrera, vice president of the Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce.
Nevertheless, differences persist over how to make the economy grow. In the victory speech, Mr. Chavez made a point of saluting his minister of planning and development, Jorge Giordani, and of finance, Jose Rojas, who have taken most of the criticism for his economic policies.
To Robert Bottome, publisher of Veneconomia, the country's leading business newsletter, the declaration of support did not bode well. "Nothing makes me think this president is willing to change his policies," he said. "If you don't change Giordani and Rojas, you don't change anything."
Whatever course he takes, Mr. Chavez will be under pressure to deliver results soon. When Edelmira de Gil, a Chavez supporter, was asked Sunday at a polling place here how long she would be willing to wait before seeing an improvement, she quickly replied, "three or four months." If Mr. Chavez "doesn't keep his word," she warned, "he won't get re-elected."

HEADLINE: Energy's New Grid;
In Deregulation, Electricity Buyers Find It Harder To Connect the Dots

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Last summer, an accident at a local utility curtailed power to Owens Corning's plant in Kansas City, Kan., sending it scrambling to find alternative energy. It was a costly, nerve-racking experience.
Since then the company has signed a 10-year contract with Enron Energy Services to buy electricity for its 20 largest United States plants, and has hired a sales manager from a Belgian utility to handle its electricity purchases in Europe. 
 The Enron unit will negotiate the contracts and pay all the bills. But Owens Corning, a fiberglass maker with an annual electricity tab that tops $200 million, has also hired three energy specialists to help manage risk, reduce consumption and keep abreast of technologies.
"Enron may be driving the car, but we're still in the front seat," said Charles E. Dana, vice president for global sourcing operations.
There was a time, not so long ago, when buying electricity was a simple matter. The local utility was the only game in town, the state set the rates, there was little to do but sign on the dotted line.
These days, not only are there myriad utilities and upstart energy companies to choose from, but countless permutations of ways to contract for electricity, including buying it on the Web.
Different suppliers produce the electricity, transmit it and deliver it. Futures contracts, derivatives and negotiated rate caps all offer ways to hedge against wild swings in use, fuel costs -- a particularly germane consideration nowadays -- or other reasons for rates that soar and dip and soar again.
Today's energy buyers must know how to predict weather and economic fluctuations as well as how to drive hard bargains. They must know how to find suppliers who will give them a cheaper rate if they switch some of their use from peak to night or other off-peak times -- and then, how to skew energy use so that it can make more use of that cheaper energy.
"It's no longer the buying of the commodity that's important," said Carol H. Guthrie, group manager for Chevron U.S.A.'s electricity supply group. "It's gathering all the information that allows you to buy it."
Thus, from metal smelters to property managers, from manufacturers to telecommunications companies, all kinds of companies are rethinking not only how they buy that critical electricity, but who is doing that buying, how much they are paid, even whom they report to.
"I'm not saying energy knowledge is a requirement for all jobs these days," said Robert H. Welsh, a senior partner at the executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles International, "but if a candidate for chief technology officer also has energy experience, the client nods happily."
Indeed, many companies are pulling chief financial officers and chief technology officers into energy buying. Others are retraining and promoting engineers, accountants or particularly talented buyers. Still others are scouring the regulatory community, the utilities, even Wall Street for energy-knowledgeable people. And many are letting consultants seek out suppliers, negotiate contracts, even survey the company for ways to cut use.
"Buying and selling energy has become a real financial play, and it needs someone with sophisticated knowledge of finance and energy both," said Bruce W. Peterson, a managing director at the executive recruiting firm Korn/Ferry International, who is searching for just such a person for a client.
Such people do not come cheap. Doron Cohen, an energy specialist at the research firm Gartner, knows a vice president at a metals company who quit in a rage when he discovered that younger, newly hired energy buyers made more than he did.
"The person who'll work for $60,000 doesn't have the knowledge you need, and you can't attract commodities traders unless bonuses and such give them a shot at making $1 million a year," Mr. Cohen said.
The competition and the inflated pay rates promise to worsen. Utilities, now that they are increasingly allowed to sell electricity in areas with wildly fluctuating climates and consumptions, are hiring traders to help lock in margins between the price of natural gas they buy and the possible prices of power they might sell.
Companies like Enron Energy Services, which handle purchases for many clients and thus can more easily justify paying top dollar, have bid the price for the most experienced traders and energy specialists through the roof, offering packages of salary, bonus and equity that can hit $1.5 million a year.
"Buying energy these days is all about managing risk and income statements," said Harold G. Buchanan, a managing director at Enron. "We're more like an investment bank than a utility."
The result, for corporations, is sticker shock. "The biggest challenge was to create that cultural shift in the client's mind, away from a $60,000 procurement guy to a $200,000 Wall Street professional who can hedge and contain costs and minimize risk," said Richard J. Preng, managing director of the global energy practice at the recruiting firm Spencer Stuart. He recently placed an energy supply chief at a metals company, for a pay package "north of $300,000."
Not surprisingly, the answer for many companies is to pay consultants, not staff members. Corning, the optical cable supplier, used to have four energy buyers; it now has one, whose main job is to be a liaison with a subsidiary of Amerada Hess, which has taken over the company's energy programs.
"Outsourcing lets us focus on the high-level management of energy," said Ernest J. Williams, Corning's director of procurement operations.
The Rockefeller Group International, which owns several office buildings and industrial parks, saved $500,000 on electricity bills for two New York City skyscrapers when it hired John Flood, an energy consultant, to evaluate energy bids. Similarly, Rockefeller Group's Cushman & Wakefield subsidiary now lets a consultant negotiate its electricity contracts at the dozens of buildings it manages. Frank A. Freda, a Cushman senior managing director, estimated that it had shaved $2.6 million off its energy tab in New York City; he is now using the company in other states.
The ubiquitous Web has given rise to yet another form of third-party energy buyer: the auctioneer. The Public Service Enterprise Group's Energy Technologies unit in Edison, N.J., just teamed up with Enermetrix.com, a Web start-up, to run Internet auctions in which Public Service clients post total energy requirements, and energy suppliers bid to fill them.
Still, corporate clients keep a close watch on the results. "The energy buyers are looking at the bids, and I imagine that higher-level people are giving the final O.K. on the offers," said Frederick W. Lark, a vice president of Public Service.
Indeed, energy is increasingly becoming an executive suite topic. KeySpan Energy's KeySpan Business Solutions unit, which designs and builds energy systems, counts among its clients a large shopping mall developer.
"They used to let local construction managers write contracts with local utilities," said Anthony Sartor, KeySpan's president. "Now they have an energy engineer who works with their C.F.O. to evaluate bids and finance the energy systems."
For commercial companies, reducing energy costs is a nicety. For manufacturers, whose energy tabs go into the multimillions, it is a necessity. Increasingly, such companies are recognizing that scrimping on energy expertise is penny-wise and pound-foolish.
Hoffman-LaRoche, the drug giant in Nutley, N.J., that is part of Roche Holding in Switzerland, recently piggybacked onto an energy contract the New Jersey Chemical Industry Council had negotiated for its members with Allegheny Energy, an independent supplier. But Hoffman, unlike many companies on the contract, generates some of its own power. So John Parodi, a former utility executive who became Hoffman's senior energy manager three years ago, negotiated extra clauses.
"I needed the provider to supply energy beyond what we generated ourselves, but also to cover us if our generators go down," Mr. Parodi said. He is now scouting out energy suppliers for Hoffman-LaRoche plants in other states.
Even companies that have had energy experts for years are taking a fresh look at them.
Since joining Chevron U.S.A. in 1994, Ms. Guthrie has reported first to the vice president in charge of refining operations, then to the vice president of a natural gas unit -- "there was a perceived synergy in deregulatory processes," she explained -- and then again to a refining executive.
In January, her group's name was changed from energy services to electricity supply, and Ms. Guthrie and her four subordinates report to the head of procurement. One goal is to whittle the number of suppliers.
"Chevron has more than 130 electricity suppliers, and we want to look at procurement strategies that can span regions and products," Ms. Guthrie explained. Last week, Chevron announced that it had started Chevron Energy Services, a unit aimed at helping clients control their total energy costs as well.
At Honeywell International, which spends upwards of $300 million a year on electricity, buyers are broadening their definition of energy. Honeywell's five specialists -- four of them added to the staff in the last four years -- have worked out contracts with suppliers of industrial gases in which the suppliers set up shop at a Honeywell plant and use some of its waste heat, steam and other sources of energy that might have been vented to the atmosphere.
"Hydrogen and oxygen are really water and a lot of electricity," said William L. Ramsey, Honeywell's vice president for the supply chain. "So it makes sense to work with industrial gas suppliers as though they were power generators."
As deregulation continues its slow creep from state to state, corporate energy czars are rising to prominence at companies that do not have energy-intensive manufacturing.
Five years ago Bell Atlantic -- which merged with GTE in June, and is now Verizon Communications -- hired Jeremy Metz, a lawyer specializing in energy and environment, to head its energy procurement.
Mr. Metz, using his regulatory expertise, has already saved the company millions by getting it included in every pilot program for deregulating energy in New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. And last year he hired another full-time buyer, someone with 20 years of experience buying generation equipment. "I've got the legal and regulatory experience," Mr. Metz said. "He understands the nuts and bolts of the energy world."
The company has pulled in operating people, too. Last year it formed Team Energy -- 12 people pulled from various operating groups and charged with looking for ways to economize on energy use. It has hired outside auditors to look for even more efficiencies. And it has put a link on its Web site that plant managers can use to monitor their electric bills.
"A big part of my job was convincing the people who run our data centers or network operations that some newfangled power supplier is going to be reliable," Mr. Metz said. "Now they're convinced, and they're ready to look for other opportunities to improve the way we use energy."

HEADLINE: 2 African Nations Said to Break U.N. Diamond Embargo

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 31

 BODY:
American and British officials accused the presidents of Liberia and Burkina Faso today of taking personal roles in trading arms for diamonds in violation of a United Nations embargo. The officials also said the two leaders had helped Sierra Leone rebels to continue fighting their civil war.
The American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, compared President Charles Taylor of Liberia to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who has been indicted for war crimes. 
 "Taylor is Milosevic in Africa with diamonds," Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview, contending that outsiders have been much too passive in identifying African leaders who foment war for personal gain.
"Taylor is fueling the conflict in Sierra Leone for his own benefit," Mr. Holbrooke said. "He is threatening to destabilize western Africa, and there is deep division in the region about how to deal with him."
A British diplomat said today at a United Nations hearing on the role of diamonds in the Sierra Leone war that Mr. Taylor had personally taken command of rebel forces fighting there against United Nations peacekeepers and that he has in recent weeks sent arms to the rebels and taken smuggled diamonds in payment.
"In effect, President Taylor has been directing strategy meetings of the rebels," said the diplomat, Stephen Pattison.
Mr. Pattison also made unusually specific allegations against President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, saying that in return for diamonds Captain Compaore has sent mercenaries from Burkina Faso to fight with rebels in Sierra Leone against United Nations peacekeepers. Captain Compaore has repeatedly allowed airports in Burkina Faso to be used for supplying the rebels with arms bought in Ukraine, Mr. Pattison added.
Diplomats from Liberia and Burkina Faso denied the allegations, demanding that hard evidence be presented.
Foreign Minister Monie R. Captan of Liberia categorically denied that Mr. Taylor had been trading arms for diamonds this year, although he acknowledged that the president had "in the past" dealt with the rebels.
Mr. Captan said Mr. Taylor was working for peace in Sierra Leone. In an interview, he accused Mr. Holbrooke of making accusations against Mr. Taylor to advance his campaign to become secretary of state if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency.
Mr. Taylor, a former warlord who terrorized voters into electing him in 1998, has played a singularly influential role in the making and the unmaking of a crisis this year in Sierra Leone. Before rebels there seized 500 United Nations troops in May and held them hostage, Mr. Taylor was their principal ally in letting them smuggle diamonds and buy arms. After the troops had been detained, Mr. Taylor's intervention secured their release. The Liberian government, Mr. Captan said today, had expected to receive international credit for its role in defusing the crisis.
But in mid-July, Thomas R. Pickering, under secretary of state for political affairs, had a combative meeting with Mr. Taylor in Monrovia. Mr. Pickering warned Mr. Taylor that unless his government quickly halted its support for the Sierra Leone rebels, the United States will invoke unilateral sanctions, including denying American visas for Mr. Taylor and other Liberian officials and seizing their assets in the United States, an American official said.
At the meeting, Mr. Taylor acted defensively, denying the allegations and demanding to be shown proof, the American official said.
That proof was not supplied. But an American official said today that evidence included photographs of trucks that were carrying arms and supplies to Sierra Leone and electronic surveillance that showed Mr. Taylor as he met commanders of the rebels, the Revolutionary United Front.
In his testimony today, Mr. Pattison said Mr. Taylor had recently ordered an increase of diamond production in rebel-held areas of Sierra Leone. "Taylor has assured the R.U.F. of his support and of increased military aid," he said. "This has included supplies of arms, ammunition, fuel, food and medicine. These are regularly transported across the Liberian border in trucks and occasionally in helicopters."
After the peacekeepers were taken hostage in May, the Security Council banned trading in Sierra Leone diamonds until a certification procedure could be established. The diamond industry -- led by De Beers, the world's largest trader -- has moved to tighten trading and toward branding diamonds to make provenance clear.
Human rights groups have said, however, that there is no way of knowing whether the industry can police itself. In March, a scathing United Nations report condemned the central diamond clearinghouse in Antwerp, Belgium, for "extremely lax controls" in handling banned diamonds sold by rebels in Angola.
Mr. Holbrooke said the Clinton administration now supported the creation of a system for global certificates of origin. It is not clear how such a system would work.
The United Nations embargo on Sierra Leone diamonds does not ban the sale of diamonds exported from Liberia. Industry experts said most of Liberia's exports originated in Sierra Leone. An American official said that Liberia itself had the capacity to mine $10 million of diamonds a year, but that last year it exported $300 million worth of the stones.
Mr. Pattison said Burkina Faso had become a major player in exporting smuggled diamonds from Sierra Leone. He said the best recent estimate is that in return for arms and other supplies 60 percent of rebel-mined diamonds were moving from Liberia and 40 percent from Burkina Faso.
Mr. Holbrooke said Washington hoped to persuade American consumers to demand certificates of origin that could prove that they are not taking home "blood diamonds" from Africa. "I hope," Mr. Holbrooke said, "that people buying a beautiful stone will start asking questions and be sure not to buy unless they see a certificate of origin."
American consumers have shown little interest in the provenance of the stones, industry experts and shop owners said. Sales of diamond jewelry jumped 11 percent last year, and De Beers had record worldwide sales of more than $5 billion.
President Compaore of Burkina Faso was also singled out in March for violating a United Nations embargo in 1998 to stop Angola rebels from using diamonds to pay for their war. That report said Captain Compaore had sent fuel to the rebels and received "substantial contributions" for his political campaigns. A representative of Captain Compaore's government dismissed the charges.
Anticipating that some African countries will respond to his accusations as neocolonialism, Mr. Holbrooke emphasized that he was not making a universal condemnation of African leadership.
"We should have been saying these things a year ago," he said. "We need to move past perceptions based on race. This is not about race. This is very difficult for the Africans, because it means there has to be a candid admission that some of the African leadership has failed its people."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Paper Profits That Failed To Materialize

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IT was hailed by President Clinton as a model for the nation. State and city politicians enthusiastically offered praise and money. There were ready customers for its product. Allen Hershkowitz's dream of building a mill in the Bronx for recycled newsprint was nothing if not appealing.
It evoked a certain admiration even from his professional enemies, a group I joined in 1996 by writing an article for The New York Times Magazine titled "Recycling Is Garbage." Dr. Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, responded with a line-by-line rebuttal in an 86-page report, "Too Good to Throw Away: Recycling's Proven Record." For a while we were condemned to a television road show of vitriolic debates. 
 But we also managed, during the commercial breaks, to have civil conversations about the scheme for the Bronx that he had been promoting since 1992. It was a refreshing change of pace for environmentalism. Instead of preaching about the morality of recycling, Dr. Hershkowitz was looking at the market for it.
He was proposing to help capitalists turn New York City's waste paper into newsprint. He wanted, as he liked to say, to build "the sustainable economy of the future."
"We have spent years stopping projects and we are still not saving the forests," he told a reporter in 1997. "So we decided to do something more pro-active to improve the way we use resources. And we also think if you can find a project that does something positive and produces a good financial return, industry will jump all over it."
The economics seemed plausible, or at least not inherently impractical, even if you knew how much money had been lost in other recycling efforts. Paper tended to be more valuable for recycling than most other materials collected in curbside programs, and New York seemed to have some special comparative advantages in this business.
The city's office buildings made it the "Saudi Arabia of wastepaper," as Dr. Hershkowitz said, a place with more cellular fiber per acre than the Amazon. And the city was willing to provide a reliable stream of that raw material at favorable prices.
Its citizens were required by law to sort out this raw material from their garbage, providing the mill with what might be described as free labor. There was also a reliable market for the finished product, in part because local newspapers had signed a pledge (under pressure from politicians and environmentalists) to buy more recyled newsprint.
Using more than $2 million of his organization's money, Dr. Hershkowitz helped plan the mill, secure environmental permits and gather political support. Local newspapers agreed to buy its products; the city and state promised a variety of tax breaks and subsidies, and paid for a two-mile-long rail line to the industrial yard where it would share space with other companies.
 PAPER companies and developers seemed close to building at several points, but ultimately no one was willing to put up the money. After eight years, the project was formally abandoned last month. Private investors decided the returns from the mill would not be high enough.
They realized that, contrary to some expectations of paper shortages, the supply of newsprint has been high enough in recent years to keep the price down. That makes it especially hard to justify a new mill in New York, where the high costs of construction and labor make it difficult to manufacture anything economically.
"It's a lot cheaper to build a paper mill out in the sticks than in New York," said Jerry Powell, the editor of Resource Recycling, a trade magazine. "And this is not a great time to be building any kind of new mill. The original idea for the Bronx mill looked great, but since then the industry has become much more efficient, and there's too much capacity."
Dr. Hershkowitz said he was not discouraged. "We environmentalists are regularly criticized for not taking the market seriously," he said. "We tried working with business and got extraordinarily close to achieving our vision. Now we have a more refined understanding of the obstacles in front of us. This is just the beginning."
That's one way to look at the results. Here's another: even after extraordinary subsidies and interventions by environmentalists and public officials, recycling has failed an important test in New York. These results, along with other recent developments, raise questions about the entire recycling program. More on that next week.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE GOVERNOR;
Bush Rides the Character Issue as He Heads Toward Philadelphia

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 31

 BODY:
He rarely mentions President Clinton in his stump speeches these days, and his aides are constantly pointing out that the Republican convention will not be devoted to bashing the Democrats. But as Gov. George W. Bush marches toward his coronation in Philadelphia, it is clear that the president is not far from his mind.
Even as he hits the high notes about family and faith, Mr. Bush's pointed subtext in his five-day, six-state "Renewing America's Purpose" tour is President Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky. Today, as he does at the end of almost every speech, he raised his hand high and made his ritual pledge. 
 "I want to conclude by telling you," he said, "that when I put my hand on on the Bible that day in January of 2001, I will swear not only to uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to uphold the honor and integrity of the office to which I have been elected."
As usual, the statement proved his biggest applause getter at a rally this morning at the University of Dayton and again at the Statehouse here this afternoon.
Republicans have been running against Mr. Clinton's character for years often to see their efforts boomerang. But Mr. Bush does it more subtly than some Republicans. And polls show that while Americans are content with the economy, they are concerned about values and the moral state of the nation, and the Bush campaign hopes to capitalize on that discontent.
"He talks about restoring the honor and integrity to the White House," said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman. "I think that's something that the American people talk with him about at almost every stop and he does talk about the need for that and I think that's something people are looking for in this election."
Ms. Hughes took umbrage at the idea that the governor's words amounted to shots at Mr. Clinton. And she disavowed the warmup speakers at Mr. Bush's rally in Cincinnati on Sunday who struck the same anti-Clinton themes less subtly than Mr. Bush. A radio talk show host spoke about the "filth and degradation of Clinton-Gore" while the mayor of Blue Ash, Ohio, Jim Sumner, asked, "Are you ready to have your daughter serve as an intern?"
Ms. Hughes said, "Governor Bush hopes that the Republicans across the country will join with him in helping to raise our political discourse to a higher level."
In his speech to the convention on Thursday night, she said, Mr. Bush "will needle his opponents a little but he will treat them with respect. He will not engage in the kind of trash and burn, attack-style politics that we have become so sick of out of Washington."
Her words illustrated a basic point and counterpoint of the campaign. While Democrats have gone on the attack against Dick Cheney and his record of votes in Congress, the Bush campaign responds with attacks against attacks, clearly hoping to reinforce the perception of Vice President Al Gore as running a negative campaign.
The Gore campaign says the Republicans are counterattacking because they are "wrong on the issues." Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore said, "An informed voter is their worst nightmare."
Ms. Hughes countered: "Let's point out a vote where Dick Cheney voted to increase funding for Head Start by 16 percent. Al Gore voted no. Now, should we run an ad claiming Al Gore's against Head Start?"

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Excerpts From Platform Approved by Republican National Convention

 BODY:

Following are excerts from the platform approved yesterday by the Republican National Convention.

PREAMBLE
We meet at a remarkable time in the life of our country. Our powerful economy gives America a unique chance to confront persistent challenges. Our country, after an era of drift, must now set itself to important tasks and higher goals. The Republican Party has the vision and leadership to address these issues. 
 Our platform is uplifting and visionary. It reflects the views of countless Americans all across this country who believe in prosperity with a purpose -- who believe in Renewing America's Purpose. Together.
This platform makes clear that we are the party of ideas. We are the party that follows its bold words with bold deeds. . . .
These principles form the foundation of both an agenda for America in the year 2000 and this platform for our party. They point us toward reforms in government, a restoration of timeless values, and a renewal of our national purpose.
The twenty-fifth man to receive our party's nomination is equal to the challenges facing our country. After a period of bitter division in national politics, our nominee is a leader who brings people together. In a time of fierce partisanship, he calls all citizens to common goals. To longstanding problems, he brings a fresh outlook and innovative ideas -- and a record of results.
Under his leadership, the Republican Party commits itself to bold reforms in education -- to make every school a place of learning and achievement for every child. We will preserve local control of public schools, while demanding high standards and accountability for results.
We commit ourselves to saving and strengthening Social Security. After years of neglect and delay, we will keep this fundamental commitment to the senior citizens of today and tomorrow.
We commit ourselves to rebuilding the American military and returning to a foreign policy of strength and purpose and a renewed commitment to our allies. We will deploy defenses against ballistic missiles and develop the weapons and strategies needed to win battles in this new technological era.
We commit ourselves to tax reforms that will sustain our nation's prosperity and reflect its decency. We will reduce the burden on all Americans, especially those who struggle most.
We commit ourselves to aiding and encouraging the work of charitable and faith-based organizations, which today are making great strides in overcoming poverty and other social problems, bringing new hope into millions of lives. For every American there must be a ladder of opportunity, and for those most in need, a safety net of care. . . .

EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY
Leave No American Behind
. . . It's long past time to debate what works in education. The verdict is in, and our Republican governors provided the key testimony: strong parental involvement, excellent teachers, safe and orderly classrooms, high academic standards, and a commitment to teaching the basics - from an early start in phonics to mastery of computer technology. Federal programs that fail to support these fundamental principles are sadly out of date and, under the next president, out of time. For dramatic and swift improvement, we endorse the principles of Governor Bush's education reforms, which will:
*Raise academic standards through increased local control and accountability to parents, shrinking a multitude of federal programs into five flexible grants in exchange for real, measured progress in student achievement.
*Assist states in closing the achievement gap and empower needy families to escape persistently failing schools by allowing federal dollars to follow their children to the school of their choice.
*Expand parental choice and encourage competition by providing parents with information on their child's school, increasing the number of charter schools, and expanding education savings accounts for use from kindergarten through college.
*Help states ensure school safety by letting children in dangerous schools transfer to schools that are safe for learning and by forcefully prosecuting youths who carry or use guns and the adults who provide them.
*Ensure that all children learn to read by reforming Head Start and by facilitating state reading initiatives that focus on scientifically based reading research . . .

 Higher Education
 . . . We renew our call for replacing "family planning" programs for teens with increased funding for abstinence education, which teaches abstinence until marriage as the responsible and expected standard of behavior. Abstinence from sexual activity is the only protection that is 100 percent effective against out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, including H.I.V./AIDS, when transmitted sexually. We oppose school-based clinics that provide referrals, counseling, and related services for contraception and abortion. We urge the states to enforce laws against statutory rape, which accounts for an enormous portion of teen pregnancy. We support the establishment of Second Chance Maternity Homes, like the ones Governor Bush has proposed, to give young unwed mothers the opportunity to develop parenting skills, finish school, and enter the work force. Because many youngsters fall into poverty as a result of divorce, we also encourage states to review their divorce laws and to support projects that strengthen marriage, promote successful parenting, bolster the stability of the home, and protect the economic rights of the innocent spouse and children. Finally, because so many social ills plaguing America are fueled by the absence of fathers, we support initiatives that strengthen marriage rates and promote committed fatherhood. . . .

Renewing Family and Community
Individual rights -- and the responsibilities that go with them -- are the foundation of a free society. In protecting those rights, and in asserting those responsibilities, we affirm the common good, and common goals, that should unite all Americans.
We are the party of the open door, determined to strengthen the social, cultural, and political ties that bind us together and make our country the greatest force for good in the world. Steadfast in our commitment to our ideals, we recognize that members of our party can have deeply held and sometimes differing views. This diversity is a source of strength, not a sign of weakness, and so we welcome into our ranks all who may hold differing positions. We commit to resolve our differences with civility, trust, and mutual respect.

Family Matters
 The Supreme Court's recent decision, prohibiting states from banning partial-birth abortions -- a procedure denounced by a committee of the American Medical Association and rightly branded as four-fifths infanticide -- shocks the conscience of the nation. As a country, we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence. That is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions. We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it. We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.
Our goal is to ensure that women with problem pregnancies have the kind of support, material and otherwise, they need for themselves and for their babies, not to be punitive towards those for whose difficult situation we have only compassion. We oppose abortion, but our pro-life agenda does not include punitive action against women who have an abortion. We salute those who provide alternatives to abortion and offer adoption services, and we commend congressional Republicans for expanding assistance to adopting families and for removing racial barriers to adoption. The impact of those measures and of our Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 has been spectacular. Adoptions out of foster care have jumped forty percent and the incidence of child abuse and neglect has actually declined. We second Governor Bush's call to make permanent the adoption tax credit and expand it to $7,500. . . .
We defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms, and we affirm the individual responsibility to safely use and store firearms. Because self-defense is a basic human right, we will promote training in their safe usage, especially in federal programs for women and the elderly. A Republican administration will vigorously enforce current gun laws, neglected by the Democrats, especially by prosecuting dangerous offenders identified as felons in instant background checks. Although we support background checks to ensure that guns do not fall into the hands of criminals, we oppose federal licensing of law-abiding gun owners and national gun registration as a violation of the Second Amendment and an invasion of privacy of honest citizens. Through programs like Project Exile, we will hold criminals individually accountable for their actions by strong enforcement of federal and state firearm laws, especially when guns are used in violent or drug-related crimes. With a special emphasis upon school safety, we propose the crackdown on youth violence explained elsewhere in this platform. . . .

JUSTICE AND SAFETY
What Is at Stake
 The rule of law, the very foundation for a free society, has been under assault, not only by criminals from the ground up, but also from the top down. An administration that lives by evasion, cover-up, stonewalling, and duplicity has given us a totally discredited Department of Justice. The credibility of those who now manage the nation's top law enforcement agency is tragically eroded. We are fortunate to have its dedicated career work force, especially its criminal prosecutors, who have faced the unprecedented politicization of decisions regarding both personnel and investigations.
In the federal courts, scores of judges with activist backgrounds in the hard-left now have lifetime tenure. Our agenda for judicial reform is laid out elsewhere in this platform, but this is the heart of the matter: Whom do the American people trust to restore the rule of law, not just in our streets and playgrounds, not just in boardrooms and on Wall Street, but in our courts and in the Justice Department itself? The answer is clear. Governor Bush is determined to name only judges who have demonstrated respect for the Constitution and the processes of our republic.

RETIREMENT SECURITY AND QUALITY HEALTH CARE
Our Pledge to America
. . . The current administration has treated Social Security as a slogan rather than a priority, demanding billions for new government programs instead of attending to the stability of our most important domestic program. Even worse, their proposal to let the government buy stocks on behalf of the Social Security trust fund was an unprecedented power grab over the entire American economy. Doing nothing is no longer an option, for it leads to three bitter choices in the near future: crippling levels of payroll taxation, significantly reduced benefits for Social Security recipients, or a crushing burden of public debt for generations to come.
We reject each of those outcomes and accept the mandate which others have abandoned: To keep faith with both the past and the future by saving Social Security. For starters, congressional Republicans stopped the annual raids on the Social Security trust funds by balancing the federal budget without that program's surplus. In addition, government agencies have and should continue efforts to improve the accuracy of economic indicators. Now a Republican president will forge a national consensus on these principles to protect this national priority:
Anyone currently receiving Social Security, or close to being eligible for it, will not be impacted by any changes. . . .
Choice is the key. Any new options for retirement security should be voluntary, so workers can choose to remain in the current system or opt for something different.
This is a challenge that demands the kind of presidential leadership the country has not seen in almost a decade. Governor Bush has shown his commitment by proposing a bold alternative to the collapse of Social Security. Along with Americans everywhere, we pledge to join him in this endeavor of a lifetime.

Security for Older Americans
We call for full repeal of the death tax, as proposed in Governor Bush's program, Prosperity with a Purpose, and as recently passed by congressional Republicans. Hard-working Americans should not live with the fear that the fruits of their lifetime of labor will fall into the hands of government instead of their children. . . .
A major reason why health insurance is so expensive is that many state legislatures now require all insurance policies to provide benefits and treatments which many families do not want and do not need. It is as if automakers were required by law to sell only fully equipped cars, even to buyers who didn't want or need all the extras. These mandates, extending far beyond minimum standards, increase costs for everyone, price low-income families out of the insurance market, and advance the interests of specific providers. They have no place in a health care system based on consumer rights and patient choice. . . .

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE
Protecting Patients' Rights
 The tremendous growth of managed health care was driven by a market response to the fractured system of health care delivery that preceded it. One result of that growth has been a welcomed slowing of the rapid increases in health costs that were a regular occurrence of the 1970s and 1980s. However, this has come at the cost of patient dissatisfaction with the at times impersonal or insufficient health care delivery mechanism. Simply put, patients deserve more protections if we are to achieve a patient-centered system that offers high-quality, affordable care. . . .
The traditional patient-doctor relationship must be preserved. Medical decision-making should be in the hands of physicians and their patients. In cases when a health plan denies treatment, a rapid appeals process geared toward ensuring that patients receive the right treatment without delays that might threaten a patient's health - as opposed to a lengthy trial - must be readily accessible to everyone in all health plans. We believe a quick and fair resolution to treatment disputes without going to court is the best result. However, as a last resort, we also support a patient's right to adjudicate claims in court to receive necessary medical care. In the interest of fairness to the thousands of businesses that purchase health benefits for their employees and for physicians who care for patients, employers and physicians should not be liable for the actions of the health plan and should be shielded from frivolous and unnecessary lawsuits. . . .

AMERICAN PARTNERS IN CONSERVATION
Stewardship of Our Natural Resources
 . . . We will use Superfund resources to actually clean up places where people live and labor, rather than waste it on costly litigation. The old approach of mandate, regulate, and litigate has sent potential developers away from brownfield neighborhoods. The result: no new businesses, no new jobs - only dirty and dangerous sites. Governor Bush has pledged to transform this failure into an environmental win for those communities, just as he did in Texas, and we heartily endorse his agenda for doing so.
Wherever it is environmentally responsible to do so, we will promote market-based programs that are voluntary, flexible, comprehensive, and cost-effective. The Endangered Species Act (E.S.A.), for example, is sometimes counter-productive toward its truly important goal of protecting rare species, 75 percent of which are located on private land. Its punitive approach actually encourages landowners to remove habitat to avoid federal intervention. This serves as a disincentive for private landowners to do more to restore habitat and become private stewards of wildlife. The legislation needs incentive-based cooperation among federal, state, local, and tribal governments, and private citizens. The result will be a more effective E.S.A. that better protects wildlife diversity. . . .

GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE
. . . Like Congress, the Executive Branch must adapt to the challenges of the new century. There are too many departments and agencies with competing programs that waste resources and fail to deliver the goods: 342 economic development programs, 788 education programs in 40 different agencies at a cost of over $100 billion a year, 163 job training programs in 15 different agencies. Twelve agencies administer over 35 food safety laws. One agency regulates pizzas with meat; another regulates vegetarian pizzas. (Still another regulates the people who deliver them. Enough said.)
We intend to downsize this mess and make government actually do what it is supposed to, simply by ensuring that all agencies adhere to the Government Performance and Results Act, which has been neglected or ignored by the current administration. By applying its procedures to all federal programs, we can stop the loss of millions of Medicare dollars for services rendered after patients have died. We can put the brakes on an Education Department that pays out $3.3 billion on defaulted student loans, and an Energy Department that spends $10 billion on projects that are never completed. Because of its history of needless partisan litigation, we call for the Legal Services Corporation to return to its original purpose of providing legal aid to the indigent, rather than pursuing political causes and agendas. We will, as an urgent priority, restore the integrity of the nation's space program by imposing sound management and strong oversight on NASA. . . .

A Military for the 21st Century
. . . A Republican president and a Republican Congress will transform America's defense capabilities for the information age, ensuring that U.S. armed forces remain paramount against emerging dangers. They will restore the health of a defense industry weakened by a combination of neglect and misguided policies. To do all this, the United States must align its military power with the strengths of American society: our skilled people, our advanced technology, and our proficiency at integrating fast-paced systems into potent networks. While we are on the crest of a new age in military technology, we will not forget that the strength of our military lies with the combat soldier, sailor, airman, and marine.
Americans are justly proud of their armed forces. But today, only nine years after the tremendous victory in the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. military faces growing problems in readiness, morale, and its ability to prepare for the threats of the future. The administration has cut defense spending to its lowest percentage of gross domestic product since before Pearl Harbor. At the same time, the current administration has casually sent American armed forces on dozens of missions without clear goals, realizable objectives, favorable rules of engagement, or defined exit strategies. . . .
Ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction threaten the world's future. America is currently without defense against these threats. The administration's failure to guard America's nuclear secrets is allowing China to modernize its ballistic missile force, thereby increasing the threat to our country and to our allies. The theft of vital nuclear secrets by China represents one of the greatest security defeats in the history of the United States. The next Republican president will protect our nuclear secrets and aggressively implement a sweeping reorganization of our nuclear weapons program.
Over two dozen countries have ballistic missiles today. A number of them, including North Korea, will be capable of striking the United States within a few years, and with little warning. America is now unable to counter the rampant proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their missile delivery systems around the world. . . .
We will seek a negotiated change in the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty that will allow the United States to use all technologies and experiments required to deploy robust missile defenses. Republicans believe that the administration should not negotiate inadequate modifications to the ABM Treaty that would leave us with a flawed agreement that ties the hands of the next president and prevents America from defending itself. The United States must be able to select the systems that will work best, not those that answer political expediency, and we must aggressively reinvigorate the ballistic missile defense technology base necessary to ensure that these systems succeed. There are today more positive, practical ways to reassure Russia that missile defenses are a search for common security, not for unilateral advantage. If Russia refuses to make the necessary changes, a Republican president will give prompt notice that the United States will exercise the right guaranteed to us in the treaty to withdraw after six months.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Tale of Bad Timing at AMF: Silk Stockings and Bowling Shows

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
When Goldman, Sachs led a buyout of AMF Bowling in 1996, some analysts wondered why a silk-stocking investment bank would risk sullying its image in such a pedestrian pursuit. But, after four years under Goldman's control, it is AMF's image that has suffered as the company has racked up losses and its stock price has sunk to 75 cents a share.
Having traded for less than $1 a share for more than 30 consecutive days, AMF -- arguably the biggest name in bowling -- is in danger of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and investors are wondering if the company will have to sort out its financial troubles in bankruptcy court. People close to the company, which is based in Richmond, Va., said that AMF's board discussed a range of revamping options, including a prepackaged bankruptcy filing, last week in New York. 
 AMF is saddled with about $1.2 billion in debt. Its bonds have been trading for 20 percent to 30 percent of their face value.
When the company releases its second-quarter earnings within the next two weeks, those investors who still are paying attention will focus less on what happened in the traditionally slower spring season than on what the company has to say about its future plans. After all, the earnings cannot surprise analysts because nobody on Wall Street follows AMF's stock any more.
Ronald Baron, chief executive of Baron Capital, once was one of AMF's biggest boosters, predicting that the stock price would soar to $100 by 2003. Now, with his company and its mutual funds holding more than 11 million shares of AMF, Mr. Baron will not discuss AMF. Through a spokesman, he denied that his funds, the biggest investor in the company after Goldman, were among the sellers when AMF shares dropped to a record low of 18.75 cents on June 30.
Stephen E. Hare, AMF's chief financial officer, said in an interview that "the capital structure needs to be fixed" but the company has not settled on a solution. He declined to discuss the possibility of a voluntary bankruptcy filing and said that the company had not started negotiating with its creditors. But it is clear that changes must be made before AMF has to start making much bigger payments to bondholders in about a year.
"The meter is running," Mr. Hare said "It's fair for the markets to say, 'Show us the plan.' When we have a plan that we're comfortable with, you'll see us announce it."
In the meantime, Mr. Hare acknowledged, the company, its industry and its employees are all suffering. "Just the fact that the stock has not been successful in the last year, I don't think speaks well for the industry," he said, "We feel a certain obligation to be successful for the industry at large."
Goldman officials declined to comment.
Mr. Hare said that company officials have talked to representatives of the New York Stock Exchange about how to get back into compliance with the exchange's listing standards. AMF has less than 30 days to come up with a plan. One possibility: a reverse stock split that would reduce the number of shares outstanding to push up their price and buy management more time to realign the company.
How AMF, under Goldman's control, got into such a bind is a complicated story that involves Asian economics, American social trends and the ways of Wall Street.
In 1996, Goldman led a leveraged buyout of AMF. A year later, the firm took the company public again, raising $263 million by selling shares for $19.50 each.
The pitch for the 1997 initial offering was that AMF would buy bowling alleys around the United States and would capitalize on a growing craze for bowling in China and other parts of Asia. AMF would make money two ways: by operating a chain of bowling centers and by selling the equipment to outfit new ones overseas.
But while AMF was gobbling up alleys and trying to run them more efficiently, league bowling -- the lifeblood of the bowling business -- was dying. Leagues, which represent a predictable stream of revenue from September through March, once accounted for as much as 80 percent of a bowling center's business, said Sandy Hansell, a bowling consultant in Southfield, Mich. That share has dropped to about 50 percent, he said.
Then in the summer of 1998, an economic crisis swept across Asia, wiping out demand for capital-intensive leisure activities like bowling.
Suddenly, Goldman was the majority owner of a heavily indebted company in a slow-growth business. The bowling products business, which had generated about $70 million in cash flow in 1997, produced less than $10 million in cash flow last year, Mr. Hare said. He said demand for bowling is still growing in some countries, including England, but "what we don't see right now are any markets that have that boom potential."
AMF's board -- which has Richard A. Friedman, who runs Goldman's merchant-banking operations, as chairman -- removed the company's management. Last year, the directors hired Roland Smith, who formerly ran the Arby's fast-food chain, as chief executive.
Mr. Smith is slowing the pace of acquisitions while the company devises a strategy for marketing its 417 United States bowling centers as a national chain, Mr. Hare said. The company is spending about $10 million to gear all of its centers for what it calls Xtreme bowling, a nighttime activity aimed at teenagers and other recreational bowlers, and is considering an extensive ad campaign, he said.
Without a big increase in revenue, the bowling centers are quite profitable on an operating basis, Mr. Hansell, the consultant, said. And, despite its slower growth, the bowling business is healthy, with most lane operators making more money than they ever have, he said.
The tough question for AMF and Goldman is how they can relieve the company of some of its debt burden before it snuffs the life out of bowling-center operations. It is a rare problem for Mr. Friedman and Goldman's other merchant bankers, who have rolled their share of strikes, most recently in having a big stake in VoiceStream Wireless when Deutsche Telekom agreed to buy that company for a huge premium.
In May 1996, Goldman and its merchant-banking funds put up $260 million for a majority stake in the buyout of AMF. Two other investment banks, Blackstone Group and Kelso & Company, bought smaller stakes, and the company borrowed about $1 billion through bank loans and bond sales.
Along the way, Goldman received about $50 million in fees for advising the company and underwriting securities, including its initial public offering of stock. Now its 45 million shares are worth less than that, about $34 million. Goldman officials will not say how much the firm has lost on its AMF investment, but a person close to the matter said the firm is feeling "a lot of pain."
No matter what happens to AMF, Mr. Hansell said, the bowling business will survive.
"If AMF went belly up, would it be a problem?" he said. "It would hurt, but it wouldn't be cataclysmic. The other 5,000 bowling centers in this country would roll along."

HEADLINE: President Opens Attack On the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By CARL H. LAVIN 

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla., July 31

 BODY:
President Clinton took on the Republicans and their platform today in a series of Florida appearances that raised more than $1.2 million for his party and rallied support for his plan to expand Medicare to provide prescription drug insurance.
Speaking to Medicare beneficiaries at a community center in Tampa, the president continued his attack on the host of tax cuts being passed by the Republican-controlled Congress. 
 "You may hear, if you turn on the television, the Republicans, when they meet in Philadelphia in convention, talking about all their tax-cut bills and how wonderful they'd be for you," Mr. Clinton said. "But what they don't say is that if you take all their tax-cut proposals in total, it spends the entire projected surplus of the country for the next 10 years."
He compared tax-cut legislation being sent to him by Congress to the choices a diner faces at a well-stocked restaurant: "When I go to a cafeteria, everything I see looks good. But if I eat it all, I'll get sick."
Accompanied by Bill Nelson, the Florida insurance commissioner, who is running for the Senate, Mr. Clinton also told Democratic donors in Tampa and later in Palm Beach that the Republican goal was to blur the differences between the parties on health care, the economy, gun control, the environment and other issues that matter to voters.
"Their strategy is to talk about compassion," and "it's a brilliant strategy," Mr. Clinton said. "It's a pretty package, and they're hoping if they wrap it tight enough, nobody will open it before Christmas."
At a fund-raising reception here for Mr. Nelson, the president emphasized that the Democratic strategy should be to stay positive -- "you don't have to say a bad word about our opponents," he said -- but to explain to voters how the parties differ.

HEADLINE: Image and Reality on Education

 BODY:
The first of four theme nights at the Republican Party's meticulously planned national convention focused on what has become George W. Bush's signature issue -- education, particularly education for young, poor children. In terms of giving this convention a softer and more inclusive feel, this was a wise choice. Yet it also illuminated the central paradox of a conclave marking Mr. Bush's emergence as the party's trend-setter. On the one hand, the vast convention hall was positively awash in soaring language and inspiring individual success stories designed to highlight Mr. Bush's signature promise that no child, no matter how disadvantaged, would be left behind. On the other hand, the same delegates who cheered this vision in prime time had earlier ratified a platform that defines a narrower, less generous world in which the federal government has virtually no role to play in shaping the country's educational future.
This paradox revolves around a fundamental question about Mr. Bush's candidacy, a question he can go a long way toward answering in his acceptance speech Thursday night. Does his noble rhetoric about compassionate conservatism spring from a genuine determination to lead his party toward a more activist role in education, or is it just empty salesmanship? Based on the numbers, the rank-and-file seems willing to be led. In a New York Times survey of delegates to this convention, 26 percent ranked education the No. 1 issue in their states, whereas four years ago the economy was No. 1 for the same number and education received a measly 2 percent. Yet it was not clear whether they were prepared to spend more money on the problem than their leaders in Congress, who for the last eight years have often tried to cut education spending. 
 True to Mr. Bush's desire to convey optimism on even the most difficult issues, last night's menu of speeches and visuals was relentlessly upbeat and demographically inclusive -- a fourth-grade teacher from North Carolina discussing math and science, a video from a largely Hispanic school in El Paso, brief testimonials to the virtues of parental involvement and after-school enrichment, and a speech by his wife, Laura, about her experience as a teacher and their joint commitment to education. The evening was topped off by an inspirational testimonial to racial fairness and educational opportunity from probably the most popular Republican in America, Gen. Colin Powell.
The reality of the platform was quite different. At Governor Bush's insistence, the committee dropped a harsh and longstanding provision calling for the abolition of the Department of Education. The document also quoted lofty pledges that under a Bush presidency no American child would be "segregated by low expectations, imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and the darkness of self-doubt." Yet when the document turned to substance, it pointed in a direction opposite to that proclaimed in Mr. Bush's oratory. The platform insisted that "the role of the federal government must be progressively limited as we return control to parents, teachers and local school boards." The platform then goes on to extol remedies like those celebrated in last night's displays -- charter schools, parental involvement and the like -- while writing off Title I, the main federal program aimed at disadvantaged children, as a $120 billion failure.
Governor Bush is the only person in Philadelphia who can fix this disconnect. This is a nation in which a lot of children are in trouble -- 11 million with no health insurance and nearly 13 million, one in five, living in poverty, untouched by the present prosperity. Head Start could handle a million more eligible children with more generous financing. It may be too much to expect Mr. Bush to redesign his proposed $1.3 trillion in tax cuts in order to pay for these and similarly worthy ventures. But even those who no longer doubt the sincerity of his belief that no child should be left behind have a perfect right to ask him how he means to balance the scales.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Excerpts From General Powell's Address to Republicans

 BODY:

Following are excerpts from Retired Gen. Colin Powell's speech at the Republican National Convention yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
During the almost seven years since I retired from the Army I've traveled all across America. I've seen people hard at work providing for their families, giving of themselves, taking care of each other. I've seen them creating wealth for the nation, I've seen an economy transforming itself to seize the promise of the information revolution. . . . 
 I've been moved yet again to stand in awe of the American dream, which was given birth in this city over 200 years ago. A dream that I have been privileged to live. I've met so many young people who believe in the dream. They're on a road to success. . . .
There is so much that is so good and right in America tonight my friends that we ought to be very, very proud of this wonderful country of ours. And yet I cannot ignore and we cannot ignore other things I've seen in my travels. I've seen poverty. I've seen failing communities. I've seen people who've lost hope. Tragically, I've seen too many young Americans who were overwhelmed by the daily struggle just to survive. I've seen kids destroying themselves with drugs. Kids who see violence and crime as the answer to their hopelessness. Kids who no longer believe in themselves and who don't see a reason to believe in America. I've seen kids in utter despair. I've visited kids in jail doing adult time for the crimes they've committed. They are part of a growing population of over two million Americans behind bars. . . . Most of them are men and the majority of those men are minorities.
The issue of race still casts a shadow over our society. Despite the impressive progress we have made over the last 40 years to overcome this legacy of our troubled past, it is still with us.
So with all the success we have enjoyed and with all the wealth we have created we have much more work to do and a long way to go to bring the promise of America to every single American.
And with all we have to do in our national agenda, I am convinced that to deliver on that promise we must begin with our children. So many of the problems we worry about go back to how we raised our children. The problem is as simple and as direct as this: we either get back to the task of building our children the way we know how or we're going to keep building jails in America. And it's time to stop building jails in America and get back to the task of building our children.
Listen. Listen. And listen, listen, listen very carefully. Our children are not the problem. They are our future. They are America's promise. The problem is us if we've failed to give them what they need to be successful in life. The burden is on us, not on our children.
That mission of providing for our children has become the passion of my life. Because what I've seen over the last several years convinces me of the following truths:
That if you want to solve our drug problem, you won't do it by trying to cut off supply and arresting pushers on the street corners alone. It will only be solved when we place into the heart of every child growing up in America the moral strength never to fall for the destructive lure of drugs, the strength -- only -- we will only solve and cure this plague of drugs is when we have given to each and every one of our children the strength to just say, and you've heard it before, just say no, not me, I won't do it, I've got too much to live for, I'll never do drugs. . . .
Tonight we focus on education, the keystone to it all. Governor Bush has rightly made children and education the centerpiece of his campaign for president. . . . Every child deserves and must receive a quality education. Because when you give a quality education to a child who believes in himself or herself then even with the bleakest beginning in life that child can make it. And once that child makes it and gets out into the work place and is earning a decent living, you have broken the cycle of poverty and failure for that family forever. Education is the key to breaking that cycle of poverty and failure.
So many, many of our public schools are doing a fine job preparing our youngsters. . . . But I've also seen too many schools that are failing. They are trapped in fossilized bureaucracies. Bureaucracies that have low expectations for children and consequently set low standards for them. These schools are failing our children and they must be fixed and they must be fixed now.
Governor Bush has shown in Texas in just a few short years what can be done for education. As governor, he ended social promotions for kids, he increased state funding by $8 billion, he put new text books in every school in the state of Texas, he strengthened standardized testing in all Texas public schools, he insisted on teacher competency and he expanded the charter school movement. Seventeen thousand Texas kids are now in charter school. Seventy-eight percent of those kids are minorities. Their parents had a choice and they decided what was best for their children. And the results, the results in Texas have been dramatic. . . .
He hasn't stopped there. To ensure a diverse college population with the loss of affirmative action, Governor Bush has guaranteed acceptance at public universities for the top 10 percent of every high school graduating class in the state. . . .
Governor Bush now offers the leadership that he has demonstrated in Texas to the nation. In pursuing educational reform as well as in all other parts of his agenda for Texas, Governor Bush as reached out to all Texans -- white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American. He has been successful in bringing more and more minorities into the tent by responding to their deepest needs. Some call it compassionate conservatism, to me it's just caring about people.
I believe he can do the same thing as president. I am convinced he will bring to the White House that same passion for inclusion. I know that he can help bridge our racial divides. I know that.
Recently, Governor Bush addressed the annual meeting of the N.A.A.C.P. He spoke to the delegates about his plans for housing and health and educational programs to help all Americans. He also spoke the truth to the delegates when he said that the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln. I talked with him again today and I know that with all his heart, Governor Bush welcomes the challenge. He wants the Republican party to wear that mantle again.
But he knows and I know and all of you must know that it's going to take hard work. He knows that that mantle will not simply be handed over. That it will have to be earned. The party must follow the governor's lead in reaching out to minority communities. And particularly the African-American community. And not just during an election year campaign. My friends, if we're serious about this, it has to be a sustained effort. It must be every day and it must be for real. The party must listen to and speak with all leaders of the black community regardless of political affiliation or philosophy.
We must understand, my friends, we must understand that there is a problem for us out there. We must understand the cynicism that exists in the black community. The kind of cynicism that is created when, for example, some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an education. But you hardly hear a whimper when it's affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax code with preferences for special interests. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. You can't make that case.
Overcoming the cynicism and mistrust that exists and raising up that mantle of Lincoln is about more, it's much more about than just winning votes. It is about giving all minorities a competitive choice. They deserve that choice. And if we give them that choice it will be good for our party but above all it will be good for America. And we need to work to give them that choice.
Good for America, that must be the measure for all that we do. I believe that's the measure that Governor Bush will use to guide his actions as president. Whether it's economic policy or military strategy or seeing what we can do to make our American family more inclusive, he will always try to do that which is good and right for America.

U.S. Is Investigating New York Job Data

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The federal government is investigating New York State's robust 1999 job growth numbers after complaints that the statistics might have been inflated.
In March, the state revised its 1999 job growth rate to 2.9 percent from 1.8 percent, an increase that "looked a little bit unusual," Patricia Getz, division chief for monthly industrial employment statistics at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said yesterday. "We're just trying to make sure there are not any errors or any problems." 
 The federal Labor Department relies on monthly and yearly job-growth data from states for nationwide reports. The inquiry into the statistics was first reported on Sunday by The Buffalo News.
The state has acknowledged that some jobs were counted twice, saying that the mistakes came in the first quarter of 1999 when the method of processing unemployment insurance forms was changed.
Thomas Rodick, director of research and statistics for the State Department of Labor, described the problems as minimal. The department may be off by about 9,000 jobs, or about "one-tenth of 1 percent" of the statewide total, he said.
In March, Gov. George A. Pataki said that just under 200,000 jobs were created in New York last year, the most in 15 years. A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, Michael McKeon, said yesterday that the governor was "confident with our numbers." Mr. McKeon said the federal investigation could be a move by the Clinton administration to aid Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign, and called it "just an outrage."

Bond Sale to Aid Hospital

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried 

 BODY:
Seeking to ensure the salvation of a Suffolk County hospital that was nearly shut down early this year, the New York State Dormitory Authority plans to sell up to $118.5 million in tax exempt bonds whose proceeds would be used to put the St. Catherine of Siena Medical Center on a sound, long-term financial footing.
The center, in Smithtown, includes a 311-bed hospital that was previously St. John's Episcopal Hospital. Its former owner, Episcopal Health Services, declared bankruptcy last fall and said it would sell the hospital to Catholic Health Services of Long Island for nearly $100 million. 
 But a labor dispute with the hospital's nurses in January nearly doomed the sale and brought the hospital to the brink of closing. The dispute was resolved, and the sale was completed in February. Officials said then that the hospital employed 1,700 people and that about 400 doctors regularly practiced there.
Also sold was a 240-bed nursing home in the medical complex and a subsidized housing development next to the complex whose 298 apartments are largely occupied by the elderly. Most of the bond proceeds would be used to replace bank financing, which was used in making the purchases, with 30-year fixed-rate bonds whose tax exempt status would permit a lower interest rate. The rest of the bond money would be used for renovations and other costs.
The authority hopes to sell the bonds late next month, a spokeswoman, Claudia Hutton, said yesterday. A hearing on the proposed sale is to be held on Aug. 15 at the agency's Manhattan offices at 1 Pennsylvania Plaza. Joseph P. Fried

HEADLINE: Canadian TV Makes a Move Into Papers

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: MONTREAL, July 31

 BODY:
Making a bold bet on the future braiding of television, newspapers and the Internet, Canada's second-largest private television network said today that it would buy about half of the country's larger daily newspapers from Conrad Black, the international press magnate.
In the largest media deal in Canadian history, CanWest Global Communications, a company that started 20 years ago with a North Dakota television station, is to pay $2.36 billion for dominant dailies in 8 of Canada's 10 provinces. Mr. Black is to gain a seat on the CanWest board and is to become the second-largest shareholder, after the family of the company founder, Israel H. Asper. 
 "The borders are gone, we have to grow," Mr. Asper, Global's chairman, told a news conference in Toronto today, comparing his acquisition to Tribune Media's recent purchase of The Los Angeles Times. "We don't intend to be one of the corpses lying beside the information highway."
Mr. Black said in a statement that his company, Hollinger International, "believes this intimate association with a highly successful telecaster built by an entrepreneurial spirit compatible with Hollinger is the best possible assurance of the strength of the newspaper franchises."
In the political realm, the newspaper ownership change could affect Canada's growing conservative movement. Mr. Black has placed his free-market stamp on some of the nation's most influential editorial pages. During the recent leadership race of the new conservative party, the Canadian Alliance, his National Post newspaper seemed, to some readers, to be the movement's official newspaper.
In contrast, Mr. Asper, who runs his national television network from his hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba, has long been seen as a low-profile social democrat, running the provincial branch of the Liberal Party for five years in the 1970's. Canada does not have laws barring the ownership of newspapers and television stations in the same media market, and the Liberal government of Jean Chretien is not expected to place regulatory barriers in the way of this merger.
"It looks as if the unapologetic conservative, Conrad Black, has surrendered the reins," Chris Dornan, director of Carleton University's journalism school, said today from Ottawa.
Mr. Black's sale seemed to be motivated at least in part by his large debt load, $1.6 billion. Under the deal, CanWest will assume responsibility for about $460 million in Hollinger debt.
In the first half of this year, Canada's print media suffered a psychological body blow as most of the nation's newspapers were put up for sale, either by Mr. Black or by Kenneth R. Thomson. Mr. Thomson, chairman of the Thomson Corporation, clearly said that he wanted to invest deeper in electronic information services. Two weeks ago, Mr. Thomson completed the sale of his 49 American newspapers, for $2.44 billion. Mr. Thomson is trying to sell five of his Canadian newspapers and has said he will retain ownership of The Globe and Mail of Toronto.
Mr. Black has sent mixed signals about newspapers. In April, he said he wanted to sell his Canadian weeklies and smaller dailies. But with today's announcement, he is selling newspapers that dominate some of Canada's most important markets, including The Ottawa Citizen, The Gazette of Montreal, The Calgary Herald, The Edmonton Sun and The Vancouver Province.
If the sale goes through as expected in late September, Mr. Black, 55, will have tailored his press fief to ownership of newspapers in prestige cities that he cares about: The Daily Telegraph in London, The Jerusalem Post and The Chicago Sun-Times. As for his pet Canadian project, The National Post, a Toronto-based newspaper that in less than two years of existence has added a muscular conservative voice to Canada's intellectual debate, Mr. Black is to become the newspaper's chairman for five years and Hollinger is to retain management control. CanWest will own 50 percent of this newspaper.
Mr. Black was on vacation in Europe and did not return telephone calls left at his Toronto and New York offices. But in his press statement, he seemed to expect criticism.
"There continues to be an audible body of opinion that holds that the newspaper industry has entered a period of stagnation or even decline," said Mr. Black, who is Hollinger's chairman. "We strenuously disagree with this and look forward to demonstrating both the fallacy of this view and the enduring vitality of quality newspaper assets intelligently managed and imaginatively linked with other media."
Don Babick, The Post publisher, declined in an interview to predict how the marriage of electronic and print media would happen, saying only, "We are blending ourselves with a first-class national telecaster."
The deal would strengthen the news-gathering capacity of CanWest, making it "far and away the leading Canadian media operation," said Mr. Dornan, a former television journalist. "These guys are going to have the most robust news rooms in every single market in the country."
CanWest estimated that the combined strengths of the merged operations could save the company up to $100 million a year.
Little known in the United States, CanWest Global emerged in recent years as Canada's third-largest television network, after CBC, the government-owned network, and CTV, a privately owned network. BCE, a major telecommications holding company, wants to buy CTV, largely with the idea of piping TV and Internet programs over Bell lines.
From the small station imported 20 years ago from North Dakota, CanWest grew by calling its collection of separately licensed stations a "system" rather than a "network." Under Canadian laws at the time, networks had to show a higher percentage of Canadian-made programs than systems. American programs can be bought for one-tenth the cost of producing Canadian programs.
"Global has been as studiously nonpolitical as possible, producing as little Canadian content as possible and making as much money as possible," said Vincent A. Carlin, chairman of the journalism school of Ryerson Polytechnic University, in Toronto. "They were always failing the government guidelines, and always getting a break."
After succeeding in Canada, Mr. Asper methodically expanded in the industrialized English-speaking world, buying television stations in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
"He has taken some of the economics of a big-box retailer and applied them to small-market media, where you buy American programming in bulk and pass the savings along," said Paul W. Taylor, who worked for Mr. Asper's first television station before studying the company for a doctorate in communications. He said CanWest Global was one of the largest buyers of American television programming.
Dr. Taylor predicted that with the merger, the newspapers would strengthen TV news programs, the newspapers would promote the TV entertainment shows and advertisers would get larger audiences. "If you are a national advertiser, with a single buy," he said, "you will be able to reach the eyeballs you want to move your goods."
A few years ago, CanWest Global became a full network. Now, Mr. Asper and his son, Leonard, the president of CanWest, may have decided that Canadian news is the Canadian content that Canadians most want to see. By this reasoning, Californians want to see California news, but not necessarily California movies. Mr. Dornan said, "News about ourselves, journalism, current affairs programming, documentaries -- that's what Canadians want to see."
At first glance, the deal today suggested that Mr. Black might eventually play a bigger role in Global. He has repeatedly entered companies by holding a minority position, then ended up wresting control. He is to get 15 percent of the equity of CanWest, making him the largest shareholder after the Asper family.
But this time, Mr. Black may have to settle for what the deal offers: a seat on the CanWest board for himself and for another Hollinger representative.
"The Asper family's control of the corporation is beyond his reach," Richard Siklos, author of "Shades of Black: Conrad Black and the World's Fastest Growing Press Empire" (McClelland & Stewart, 1995 ), said today. "It's an exit strategy for Black and these newspapers. I wouldn't expect it to be a lasting partnership."

HEADLINE: Laser Eye Surgery's Turf War

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG 

 BODY:
Harriet Bass lay on a table at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, her right eye propped open by a metal ring, staring up at a red dot of light.
"You're going to feel a little pressure," Dr. John A. Seedor told Ms. Bass, a 49-year-old casting director, as he was about to slice into her cornea. Using a motorized blade known as a keratome, Dr. Seedor cut a circular flap around the cornea, about one-third of an inch wide and one-150th of an inch thick, and peeled it back. 
 Switching to a computer-controlled laser, Dr. Seedor trained an invisible beam of cool ultraviolet light on the exposed soft underlayers. The lenses within Ms. Bass's nearsighted eyes bent light too sharply, making her vision fuzzy. The laser vaporized bits of cornea in a way that flattened the curvature at the front of Ms. Bass's eye to bring images at the back of the eye, on the retina, into focus.
"All right, Harriet. It looks beautiful," Dr. Seedor said. He placed the flap back down, caressing it with a brush back into place. "Ready for the other eye?"
Dr. Seedor repeated the procedure. The operation took about 15 minutes.
Although the Food and Drug Administration approved the procedure only last year, Lasik, short for laser in-situ keratomileusis, has quickly grown into a $3 billion-a-year industry, with 750,000 Americans expected to choose the surgery this year. Intended to correct nearsightedness, the procedure can now treat farsightedness as well.
With 1.2 million American customers expected next year, Lasik is becoming the issue in a financial turf war between ophthalmologists and optometrists, between top-dollar surgeons and low-cost, high-volume centers.
Ophthalmologists are the eye surgeons with medical degrees who perform the surgery. Optometrists are specialists in measuring vision who prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses, and, increasingly, handle the care before and after Lasik surgery.
Lasik's popularity is easily explained: for the vast majority of patients, it is safe, effective and, increasingly, affordable.
"It's a simple procedure," said Dr. Richard S. Koplin, medical director of LaserOne in Manhattan. "It's not brain surgery."
With so many people willing to pay out of pocket -- most insurance companies do not pay for the procedure, because they regard it as "cosmetic" -- to be rid of contacts or glasses, Lasik surgeons have turned to the familiar marketing tools: celebrity testimonials, billboards, radio and television advertisements, telemarketing.
For would-be patients, the choices -- LaserOne, Lasik Vision, the Laser Center, Insight Laser Center, Infinity Laser Center, among others -- can bewilder.
Three general business models have evolved. Dr. Seedor is in the mode of a traditional practice: a patient pays for the attention and experience of the surgeon, $2,650 an eye in Ms. Bass's case.
Centers like Lasik Vision and LaserOne are decidedly corporate and mass market; Carmine Asparro of Bellmore, taking advantage of the grand opening special at Lasik Vision in Garden City, N.Y., paid just $500 for Lasik on his right eye. (His left already had 20/20 vision.)
The third is an increasingly popular arrangement known as "co-management" in which a patient's optometrist handles the initial evaluation and postoperative care in exchange for part of the fee. The Laser Center in Manhattan, for example, works with about 75 optometrists who send a stream of patients. The optometrists make money from a procedure that eliminates the need for their services.
At the Laser Center, Evan Mason of Irvington paid more than Ms. Bass: $5,500 for two eyes. Yet she never met her surgeon, Dr. Mark G. Speaker, before the surgery and has not seen him since. No studies have showed which approach yields better results, and all three have their critics and defenders.
Marketing materials from the traditional Lasik surgeons often darkly hint that their cheaper competitors might be skimping to make a profit.
Dr. Joseph Dello Russo of the New Jersey Eye Institute in Bergenfield charges $2,800 per eye. "I know what I'm worth," he said. "You're not going to get an experienced surgeon for $1,000 an eye."
Michael R. Henderson, president and chief executive of Lasik Vision Corporation, which runs centers in North America, is similarly emphatic. "If you pay $5,000," he said, "you're simply being gouged."
But Dr. Susan Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Garden City Lasik Vision, says higher-cost surgeons can coexist with the high-volume centers. In addition to her work at Lasik Vision, Dr. Fromer also performs the surgery in her private practice in Manhattan, charging $3,600 for two eyes.
In her practice, Dr. Fromer handles the evaluation and postoperation visits herself. At Lasik Vision -- which now charges $999 an eye after 1,000 people quickly signed up for the introductory special -- an optometrist on the staff handles those duties, although Dr. Fromer says she reviews the optometrists' data.
"I believe in both models," Dr. Fromer said. "It's an issue of handholding. The level of care is the same."
In the co-management debates, some ophthalmologists are concerned about the appearance of optometrists' steering patients their way.
Others fear that optometrists may be slow to recognize complications after operations. The Laser Center is "an economic model," said Dr. Joseph Evitar, a surgeon at Chelsea Eye Associates in Manhattan. "You can't know what is really going on. You're relying on someone else's judgment."
Dr. Speaker, on the other hand, says he carefully chooses his co-managing optometrists. "It wouldn't reflect well on me if I were associated with someone who wasn't knowledgeable," he said. The payment, 20 percent, is simply for the visits before and after. "They are entitled to be paid for their services," he said, "just like any other profession."
Ms. Mason said she was not aware that $1,000 of the $5,000 she paid Dr. Speaker was going to her optometrist, Arkady Selenow, but that did not bother her. "I trust Dr. Selenow," she said.
Optometrists say they know their patients better and that results in better care.
"It's not just a prescription," said Mr. Selenow, who practices in Manhattan and Queens and co-manages about 1,000 Lasik cases a year. "It's knowing their complete lifestyle. You know if they're going to be happy. It's not just a science. There's an art to it, too."
For example, he said, a person who spends lots of time reading or staring at a computer screen might be dissatisfied with 20/20 vision, because up-close viewing might be uncomfortable. Leaving the vision slightly nearsighted might be a better option.
With Ms. Mason, 44, Mr. Selenow steered her toward monovision, where her right eye was corrected to 20/20 vision, while her left eye was intentionally left a slightly nearsighted 20/40. That creates a sort of bifocal vision, with the right eye to focus on distant objects and the left eye for close-up reading.
The sparring over co-management has escalated to the professional societies of ophthalmologists and optometrists.
This year, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery released a paper declaring that co-management should be "an exceptional, rather than a routine, occurrence," applicable, say, to someone who lives far from the surgeon.
"If the co-management of patients is done on a routine basis for predominantly financial reasons," the two organizations said, "it represents unethical behavior and may be illegal."
The American Optometric Association countered, "This conclusion is not grounded in law, regulation, or the American Academy of Ophthalmology's own Code of Ethics."
Two weeks ago, the International Society of Refractive Surgeons, which includes ophthalmologists and optometrists, also said that co-management was acceptable and that it was developing guidelines for it.
"Properly structured, legal co-management arrangements should not be cast under a pall just because they're co-management," said Dr. Jeffrey B. Robin, the society's executive vice president.
While no study offers a comprehensive picture, anecdotes point to potential pitfalls.
Dr. Marc Odrich, director of refractive surgery at Columbia and medical director of VISX, a laser manufacturer, tells of one co-managed Lasik patient referred to him.
The woman's eyesight was worsening, and an exam quickly showed why: cataracts were clouding her lenses. Her optometrist had not spotted the problem. The ophthalmologist did not check and, relying on the optometrist, performed the operation. It went smoothly, but the cataracts render it useless.
"I don't fault the optometrist," Dr. Odrich said. "I fault the doctor who is operating on someone else's exam. You've got to do the exam. This doesn't absolve you from being a doctor."
Most Lasik patients encounter no problems at all, although 1 percent to 10 percent require a second Lasik operation to fine-tune their prescriptions.
Still, complications do occasionally occur, some serious.
During surgery, the flap-cutting keratome might jam or create a wrinkle in the cornea, in perhaps 1 in 500 eyes, said Dr. Jonathan Carr, director of medical services for the Lasik Vision chain.
After surgery, a range of problems can arise, although most can be easily treated if caught promptly. And, about 1 in 500 will experience an inflammation under the eye, Dr. Carr said. The odds of an infection are about 1 in 10,000. And, there is one reported case of a 35-year-old man who had one eye removed after a Lasik-induced infection.
The operation also cuts down on production of tears, leading to eyes that need drops. Almost always, the condition improves after a few months.
For some, particularly those with large pupils, Lasik can result in nighttime glare and blurry halos around street lamps. Only rarely does bothersome glare persist longer than a few months, Dr. Carr said.
Other surgical alternatives exist, including corrective lenses implanted in the cornea. That procedure costs about the same and is reversible.
And, in June the F.D.A. approved a new procedure called laser thermal keratoplasty for treatment of mild to moderate farsightedness in people over 40. The condition affects an estimated 60 million Americans. The procedure takes less than three seconds: the thermal laser fires 16 bursts in two concentric rings, causing cornea tissue to shrink and steepening the edges.
Improvements with Lasik are expected to help extremely nearsighted people and those with oddly shaped corneas. For most, Lasik already produces the results as promised.
"I'm seeing perfect," Evan Mason said a couple of weeks after her surgery. "It was perfect that night." Monovision, which she tested with contact lenses before her surgery, was also no problem. "I adapted immediately."
Mr. Asparro, who took advantage of the special offered by Lasik Vision, is also a satisfied patient. "I'm so happy I did it," he said. "Love it. Would recommend it to anyone."
A couple of months after her surgery, Ms. Bass's vision is 20/50, not the intended 20/25. She has bought reading glasses.
She has a second operation scheduled -- an "enhancement" in industry parlance and included in the original cost.
"They think they have to do me again at the beginning of August," she said. "It's not as easy as I thought it would be. I am not a disgruntled patient by any means. I'm still satisfied with the work because it's greatly improved over what I used to see."

Lasik surgery, or laser in-situ keratomileusis, can correct a number of common problems that cause blurry vision.
 
COMMON FOCUSING PROBLEMS
 
NEARSIGHTEDNESS
If the eyeball is too long or the cornea too curved, light does not focus on the retina, but in front of it.
 
FARSIGHTEDNESS
If the eyeball is too short or the cornea too flat, light from nearby objects focuses on a point beyond the retina.
 
ASTIGMATISM
An irregularly shaped cornea results in light rays focusing on more than one point on the
retina, causing distortion. viewed.
 
How Lasik Works
After a protective flap is lifted, a laser reshapes the cornea, the transparent layer of tissue in the front of the eye.
 
CUTTING THE CORNEA
 
1. Opening
The eye is held open and anesthetic is administered. The surgeon marks the cornea with soluble ink to guide how the flap will be repositioned at the end of the surgery.
 
2. Cutting
A suction ring is used to increase pressure in the eye so that it is firm enough to be cut cleanly. Next a motorized blade, guided along a threaded track, slices the cornea.
 
3. Exposing
The surgeon lifts the flap carefully, exposing the layers of the cornea that will be vaporized by the laser.
 
RESHAPING THE CORNEA
 
4. Correcting
 
NEARSIGHTEDNESS is corrected by vaporizing the center of the internal cornea to flatten it.
 
FARSIGHTEDNESS is fixed by removing a ring of tissue around the center, making the cornea steeper.
 
ASTIGMATISM -- An irregularly shaped cornea is corrected by vaporizing more tissue on one side.
 
Pulses of ultraviolet light break the molecular bonds between cells, vaporizing tissue.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
No Decisions, No Drama

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 31

 BODY:
Ronald Reagan used to preach what he called the 11th commandment: Speak no evil of other Republicans.
But now his party, and the other one, too, have gone him one better, appropriating the physician's Hippocratic oath as the unspoken guiding principle for their quadrennial gatherings: First, do no harm. 
 It is that thought, more than anything, that has drained all of the drama and much of the meaning from modern political conventions. No surprises are wanted these days. No sore losers. No floor fights. So long, eccentricity. Farewell, spontaneity; hello, choreography. No more smoke-filled rooms -- unless you count the convention hall, which is to be filled with artificial, politically correct smoke as part of the entertainment here.
The Republicans, who began their national convention this morning, and the Democrats, who meet in Los Angeles next month, have been reading the polls and reflecting on the past. Partisans all, they are confronted with the uncomfortable finding that Americans, a few of whom may actually be watching on television, hate partisanship and discord.
Perhaps it is the times. Perhaps it is because most people are happy with their lot, with the economy and with the course of the ship of state. If that is the reason for voters' aversion to conflict, feel-good conventions could be a passing phase. Hard times pose hard questions, and those questions get thrashed out not only in campaigns but also in the conventions preceding them.
This year, though, it is pablum for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The original raison d'etre of conventions -- nominating candidates -- vanished a quarter-century ago. Not since the Republican gathering in Kansas City in 1976, when Gerald R. Ford barely held off Ronald Reagan, has there been a genuine contest for the presidential nomination at a convention of a major party. It was well past midnight when West Virginia finally gave Mr. Ford the votes he needed to go over the top.
Not since 1940 has an outsider captured the nomination. At the Republican convention that year, Wendell L. Willkie finished third on the first ballot; it took his handlers many hours to put together the deals that gave him the nomination on the sixth.
There will probably never again be a spectacle even remotely resembling the epic struggle between rural and urban interests at the 1924 Democratic convention in the first Madison Square Garden. John W. Davis of New York was chosen by exhausted delegates on the 103rd ballot, but the party had next to nothing left for the fall campaign, and Davis was trounced by Calvin Coolidge.
The new reality is the consequence of the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, which was so rowdy, with spiteful oral combat inside the hall and a police riot outside, that the parties tore up their old rule books.
Today almost all the delegates are chosen by voters in primaries and caucuses, not, as of old, by the political bosses. The delegates know months before they come to town whom they will vote for. They are bit players now, with no power.
George W. Bush, the man they have come here to nominate, told The National Journal the other day that conventions have become an anachronism. But that, he insisted, does not -- should not -- mean they are on the way out.
"The convention provides a system of rewards for hardworking, grass-roots people who end up being delegates," Mr. Bush said. "I view it as an opportunity for these people to go back home, energized to help me get elected."
Fair enough. It also provides an excuse for a lot of parties, mostly paid for by big corporations, and yet another setting to raise money.
Mr. Bush also said that the convention has become "a place to showcase ideas more than in the past." Not exactly. To be precise, it has become a place to talk in muted terms about ideas that the nominee wishes to be heard. If there are abortion rights supporters at the podium this week, for example, they will talk about something else, thanks to what Mr. Bush calls his "iron-fist" control of the proceedings. But there will be no oratorical fire on the other side of the issue, either, and few attacks on the Democrats.
That was the lesson that politicians drew from the contrasting conventions of 1992. The Republicans, nominating George Bush the elder, permitted the clergyman who delivered the opening-night invocation to compare abortion to the Holocaust and allowed Patrick J. Buchanan to issue a shrill call to arms for the "religious war going on in our country for the soul of America."
Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania said this week, "I felt absolutely terrible that night." Just like a lot of other people in the hall and out across the country.
The Democrats, on the other hand, staged a pageant of unity behind Bill Clinton, denying Robert J. Casey, then the governor of Pennsylvania, a chance to state his anti-abortion position from the podium. Mr. Clinton won, of course, and a new bit of conventional political wisdom was born: Trouble in August means trouble in November.
So there will be no echoes here of Barry Goldwater's belligerence in accepting the Republican presidential nomination in 1964.
Quoting Cicero, Mr. Goldwater, senator from Arizona, told the delegates that "extremism in defense of liberty is no vice," and that "moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue." He lost, as did William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska in 1896 after perhaps the most spellbinding of convention speeches. Siding with the Western populists against Eastern bankers, Bryan cried out, "You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!"
Nor will there be a surprise vice-presidential nominee. In 1956, Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois left the choice to the delegates at the Democratic convention, and a youngster named John F. Kennedy, then a senator from Massachusetts, though narrowly defeated by Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, set himself up for 1960. Kennedy, in turn, stunned the country by choosing Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas as a running mate. And George Bush chose Dan Quayle, a senator from Indiana.
Now a new tradition is emerging: choose the running mate before the convention, so as to eliminate that, too, as a potential disruption.
Sometimes the drama of conventions has lain in credentials disputes. At Chicago in 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower's managers mounted a campaign of dubious legitimacy under the slogan "Fair Play" and succeeded in stripping Robert A. Taft of enough delegates to assure the general's nomination.
Sometimes the drama has lain in the rules. At Miami Beach in 1972, the brain trust of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota deftly manipulated the rules to guarantee his victory.
And sometimes -- often, in fact -- the drama has lain in the platform debate, where conflicting ideas on major issues were thrashed out.
Here in Philadelphia 52 years ago this summer, Hubert H. Humphrey led a passionate campaign for civil rights. He told the delegates, assembled to nominate Harry S. Truman: "There are those who say we are rushing this issue of civil rights. I say we are 172 years too late."
The Dixiecrats walked out, nominated Strom Thurmond for president and carried five states. But Truman won -- a reminder that it has by no means always been politically suicidal to stage a contentious and divisive convention.
This year, neither convention is likely to tackle such important issues as drugs, campaign finance and the gulf between the rich and the poor. The Republicans, deeply divided on the issue of abortion, will display no prime time dissent; abortion-rights forces, who had enough votes in the platform committee to take a minority plank to the floor, decided to pass up that chance in the name of unity.
"It's all propaganda," the chairman of the Republican National Committee in the 1996 convention, Haley Barbour, said. "It's all a TV show. It's not news, but it's hugely important information for the American people."
Yet the question remains whether these carefully packaged four-day Republican and Democratic infomercials will influence the unaligned, uncommitted voters whom both parties say they want to reach. With dissent muffled, with debate defunct, will they be stirred? The low turnouts in recent presidential elections suggest that all the staging in the world will not do the trick.

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA;
A Ranch in the Rockies for Famed Artists and Novices

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Heilman Brooke 

DATELINE: SNOWMASS VILLAGE, Colo.

 BODY:
Sheep dung once was up to the windows of what artists now call the seminar room. The seminar room's floor is far from level, and its walls are chinked spruce and fir logs, remnants of a late-19th-century forest fire. But this summer William Christenberry, a photographer, used this former sheep shed to show slides for his course called Interaction of Media: Photography, Painting and Sculpture.
Cattle barns and sheep sheds that until 1966 were the heart of an active ranch here now draw acclaimed and aspiring artists from around the world. The Anderson Ranch Arts Center, a four-and-a-half-acre campus eight miles west of Aspen, is a bucolic center for potters, photographers, painters, printmakers, woodworkers, sculptors, art historians and critics. From early June through late September the studios have more than a thousand professional and novice artists in workshops of one to two weeks on topics as basic as Making Stuff in Clay and as lofty as The Meaning of Mountains. 
 Internationally renowned artists come to learn from one another and from experts in technologically new fields yet to be fully explored.
New York has Chautauqua, New Hampshire has the MacDowell Colony, and North Carolina has the Penland School of Crafts. With its Rocky Mountain backdrop, its heady 8,200-foot altitude and its proximity to Aspen, Anderson Ranch has in three decades acquired a reputation for corralling curious artists in search of creative synergy.
The ranch's course catalog is available in January, and half its courses were full by mid-March. Most workshops are limited to about a dozen participants, but because of the extensive pottery equipment, which include a kiln yard with five gas kilns, a wood kiln, a Japanese Anagama kiln and several electric kilns, ceramics workshops can enroll as many as 16.
For 15 years Doug Casebeer, a former ceramics consultant to the United Nations, has directed the ceramics program at the ranch. Mr. Casebeer said that artists generally recognize that their profession can require a selfish self-absorption, but that Anderson Ranch is an "arena where we can all come together, leave the egos at the door, appreciate that everybody has something to say."
This summer Paul Soldner, the center's first artistic director, and a fellow ceramic artist, Peter Voulkos, will again teach A Lifetime of Clay, a workshop that encourages "mentorship and an exchange of ideas." Late in July, Ah Leon, a Taiwanese ceramic artist specializing in Yixing-style teapots and sculpture, will lead The Language of Tea: Dissecting the Teapot, which the catalog calls "a total immersion in the tea experience."
Most workshops meet from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, with a break for lunch. Studios are open 24 hours a day. Tuition ranges from $250 for a one-week course called Art and Mud: A Course for Teachers, to $550 for a two-week sculpture class taught by the sculptor Laura Thorne, to $1,295 for two weeks of John Sexton's lab intensive photography course.
At the cafe these days, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner al fresco and cappuccino and biscotti late into the night, the Texas sculptor James Surls can often be found sitting beside a 60-year-old lawyer, accountant or business executive who has come to try a first studio art course.
Seven years ago at age 67, Lloyd Schermer, then chairman of Lee Enterprises, a media company, decided to take his first drawing course. "Taking a course in art, for Pete's sake. I was terrified," Mr. Schermer said. Since then he has taken classes in watercolor, figure drawing, oil, acrylic, collage and monotype (single print) and has become an enthusiastic monotype artist.
Relying sometimes on wood type he salvaged from one of his newspapers in Missoula, Mont., Mr. Schermer has painted and sculptured and sold more than 100 of his works, which are in the collections of the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution, the Aspen Institute, the Tribune Company and the Hearst Corporation.
Mr. Schermer and his wife, Betty, have been donors to the ranch and served on its board; the meeting hall dedicated in 1999 was named for them.
In August performers from Jazz Aspen will fill the ranch with music. In past years B. B. King stopped by for an impromptu performance. Larry Rivers, the painter, once picked up his saxophone and surprised students with an unexpected riff.
Artists come from as far away as Nepal, Jamaica and Japan. There are children's workshops for ages 6 through 15.
Artists can apply for short or long residencies. Past visiting artists have included the Japanese ceramist Takashi Nakazato, the performance artist Laurie Anderson and the painters Red Grooms and Jim Dine.
The ranch, with an annual budget of $2.8 million, has 55,000 square feet of studios and housing and offers as many as 150 scholarships a year. Full-time art students and art teachers are offered a 50 percent discount on tuition for courses in which space is available.
Mr. Surls, the sculptor, who has been an invited artist in residence for two years, said that the ranch center had given him "a midcareer jump, a new lease on life, a second wind."
"We are not in the same West of Remington and Russell," he said. "Today there is an incredibly complex set of references. I think everybody conjures from his environment. The landscape here is beautiful. The weather is great. My work has totally opened up. This terrain change has created a head change."
James Baker, a photographer and 14-year veteran of the ranch who has been its executive director for five years, said it offered the "gift of time and space, an opportunity to blend idealism with pragmatism."
Mr. Baker added: "At a time when our economy is so strong, we've got everything we want except what we really need. You can see that yearning. Society needs this type of fulfillment. To be human is to create, and people need opportunities to create."

HEADLINE: To Appreciate Cheney, Come to Wyoming

BYLINE: By Alan K. Simpson; Alan K. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican, served in the Senate from 1979 to 1997.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Since he became the Republican vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney has been depicted as some kind of right-wing kook. His detractors have scoured his record in Congress and plucked out a few votes with no reference to their context. They toss out conclusions about him that have no relation to his splendid reputation among his former colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike. But if his detractors continue to focus on only a few of his thousands of votes, let's at least be upfront with the facts.
South Africa sanctions. Dick Cheney opposed sanctions against South Africa under apartheid and voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela. But the issues then were not so simple. 
 In the 1980's, there was a consensus to end apartheid. The debate was whether sanctions should be imposed or whether we should follow President Ronald Reagan's policy of free trade and open dialogue. Mr. Reagan believed the American companies could best help black South Africans by giving them jobs. Sanctions, the thinking went, would only hurt black South Africans, because these companies would have to pull out.
Moreover, the resolution to free Mr. Mandela contained language requiring official recognition of the African National Congress as the legitimate representative of the black majority. But the South African government was then our ally in stemming communism in Africa, particularly in Angola, and the leaders of the A.N.C. included admitted communists.
When Dick Cheney cast his votes, neither he nor anyone else knew when the cold war would end. Nor could we know that sanctions would ultimately help create a free South Africa. Members of the House are issued voting cards, not crystal balls.
Equal rights amendment. It is not easy being a minority member of the House. The majority party can use procedures that deprive the minority of offering amendments. That's what happened when Democrats brought the equal rights amendment to the House for consideration under "Suspension of the Rules," which doesn't allow debate or amendments -- even though this legislation would have amended the Constitution.
Mr. Cheney has always supported the equal rights amendment. He voted no because he believed that a proposed amendment to the Constitution should be subject to full debate. But this vote was not about equal rights for women. This was about the Democrats' hardball efforts to create an issue during a campaign year.
Head Start. If Dick Cheney were voting today on whether to expand this program, or any other social program, he would first ask whether it was worthwhile. If the answer was yes, the next question would be, "Can we afford it?" The answer today, with the surpluses piling up, is likely yes. But Mr. Cheney served in Congress during the days of huge deficits. It's never easy for politicians to say no to worthwhile programs, but if we hadn't had members of Congress like him to cast these tough votes, we might not have the luxury of surpluses we wallow in today.
Gun control. In Wyoming, gun control means holding your rifle steady. We have a different lifestyle; we learn to use firearms for hunting or target practice responsibly at an early age. The way for a guy to be "outside the mainstream" -- or out of office -- is to vote for gun control. The last time I checked, members of Congress are encouraged to represent their constituency. But things change, and the Columbine shootings and other tragedies have haunted us all. I personally know that Dick Cheney would almost surely support tough laws to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles and criminals. He would also support child safety locks and raising the age of handgun possession to 21.
The environment. Mr. Cheney is an avid outdoorsman, committed to conservation and a clean environment. I remember his steady efforts on behalf of an act that set aside thousands of acres of Wyoming for special protection. No one fought harder for it than he did, despite the powerful economic interests and many Republicans fighting against the designation.
To evaluate his record fairly, one must look at the 1980's, with its deficits and cold war antagonisms. And one must remember that he represented a very conservative state, and ask whether these votes are relevant to judging his qualifications. As vice president, he would take a broader view than his role of congressman from Wyoming required. After all, we know that as defense secretary during the gulf war, Mr. Cheney was calm and cool under pressure -- thoughtful, competent and trustworthy. What he is not is an extremist. Those who know him will tell you this, including honest Democrats.

HEADLINE: Mixed Signals In 3 Reports On Economy

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The first drop in orders in 19 months restrained manufacturing in July but consumer spending rebounded in June, two reports showed today.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said that its factory index was unchanged last month at 51.8, the lowest level since January 1999. The index for new orders fell below 50 -- meaning that more companies reported a drop than reported an increase -- for the first time since December 1998, when recessions in many Asian countries held down demand for American products. 
 A separate report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in June after rising 0.3 percent in May. While that was the largest gain in three months, higher energy costs accounted for most of the rise, analysts said. Incomes rose 0.4 percent after an increase of 0.3 percent in May.
In another Commerce Department report, spending on construction of houses and apartments in June registered the largest drop in five years.
The statistics add to evidence that six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve since June 1999 have begun to cool demand for expensive items like cars and homes. The overnight bank lending rate, at 6.5 percent, is the highest it has been in nine years and has pushed up the cost of consumer borrowing.
The purchasing association's index of prices paid -- which measures whether manufacturers are paying more or less for raw materials -- rose to 61.9 in July from 61.2 in June. The index peaked at 79.8 in March, and last month's reading was the second lowest since August 1999.
A reading of 50 or higher in the factory index suggests expansion, while a lower reading suggests contraction. July's overall factory index showed the 18th consecutive month of growth.
Two indexes dropped into negative territory last month. The new-orders index fell to 49.9 from 50.6 in June, and the import index declined to 49.8 from 56 -- the first reading below 50 since January 1999.
Should consumer spending continue to slow and result in further increases in inventories, that may suggest "slower production growth ahead," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Banc of America Securities in New York.
A slowdown in home building is one reason consumer spending could slow, as people buy less furniture and fewer appliances, he said. Spending on residential construction fell 1.39 percent in June, the biggest drop since May 1995. Over all, construction spending fell 1.7 percent in June after declines of 0.2 percent in May and 1.7 percent in April.

THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: PLEA TO END DRUG CERTIFICATION -- President-elect Vicente Fox will propose ending Washington's certification of Latin American countries' anti-drug efforts when he meets with President Clinton on Aug 24, said Aguilar Zinser, a foreign relations adviser to Mr. Fox. The certification program has been criticized as a symbol of American domination, and countries that refuse to take part risk losing economic benefits. Mr. Zinser argued that the United States should instead help set up a regional anti-narcotics group made up of countries fighting the drug trade. (AP)
 
VENEZUELA: ELECTION UNREST -- President Hugo Chavez sent troops to quell disturbances over disputed regional election results as several opposition candidates refused to accept defeat in general elections last Sunday. Tensions were particularly high in the state of Merida, where the latest results showed a pro-Chavez candidate, Florencio Porras, edging out the incumbent, Gov. William Davila, by less than 1 percent. (Reuters) 

EUROPE
 
YUGOSLAVIA: ABDUCTION ACCUSATION -- The police said they had arrested eight people suspected of abducting Stevan Todorovic, a former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the United Nations for war crimes, from inside Serbia and handing him over to NATO troops in 1998. On Monday, Yugoslav authorities said they had detained four Dutch citizens who were trying to kidnap and possibly kill Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, who was indicted last year on charges of ordering war crimes in Kosovo. (Reuters)
 
BRITAIN: GAS PRICE STRIKE -- Motorists enraged by gasoline prices exceeding $4.80 a gallon staged a rare protest by refusing to fill their gas tanks. Organizers said they hoped to stage regular protests to urge the government to lower taxes, which account for three-quarters of the pump price of gasoline. Alan Cowell (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: ALERT IN CHECHNYA -- Russian troops sealed off Chechnya's second-largest city, Gudermes, in anticipation of a possible surge in rebel attacks in coming days to mark the first anniversary of the conflict in the separatist republic. An armed incursion by Islamic militants a year ago into the neighboring republic of Dagestan led to the current Russian military crackdown in Chechnya. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ASIA
 
PHILIPPINES: TRASH SURVIVORS SUE -- Survivors of the collapse of a mountain of garbage in the capital, Manila, filed a class-action suit against local officials and private waste contractors, accusing them of negligence. At least 218 people -- and possibly hundreds more -- died when a rain-soaked wall of garbage buried their shanties on July 10. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
INDONESIA: BOMB KILLS 3 -- A powerful bomb at the residence of the Philippine ambassador in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, killed 3 people and injured at least 21, including the ambassador. Muslim separatists in the Philippines denied responsibility. A number of bombs linked to the separatists have exploded recently in the Philippines. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
INDIA: ATTEMPTS TO FREE ACTOR -- A 10-year manhunt against the nation's most feared bandit was suspended as authorities tried to negotiate the release of a kidnapped movie icon, Rajkumar, taken prisoner by Veerappan, a notorious murderer, poacher and smuggler who operates in the forests of southern India. S. M. Krishna, chief minister of the state of Karnataka, said the police do not want to do anything that might further endanger Mr. Rajkumar. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
LAOS: NEW TERROR SCARE -- Residents reported that a bomb was found and defused at the Vietnamese embassy in the Laotian capital, Vientiane. The report was the latest in a series about bombings or attempted bombings. The discovery of the bomb came on Sunday, the same day that an explosive device was removed from the Vientiane airport and one day before a bomb killed several people at the central post office. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
KUWAIT: NO CLOSER TO IRAQ -- Kuwait's Foreign Minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, ruled out a resumption of ties with its former occupier, Iraq, in the near future and said his country intends to renew defense pacts with Western countries. He spoke in an interview published 10 years after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait. (Reuters)
 
IRAN: WOMEN ALLOWED TO LEAD PRAYERS -- Muslim authorities have lifted the prohibition on women leading congregational prayers by members of their own sex, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The religious decree solves a longstanding problem in all-girl schools, where women had not been allowed to lead prayers. Muslims are required by their faith to pray five times a day and, if possible, to pray with a group of other Muslims. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
NIGERIA: 5TH STATE ADOPTS ISLAMIC LAW -- The northern state of Katsina began enforcing strict Islamic law, becoming the fifth state to bring in the code since Nigeria returned to civilian rule last year. Secular area courts were replaced with Islamic Shariah courts. Christians in the state are opposed, saying it is a violation of the 1999 Constitution. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ZIMBABWE: STRIKE PLANNED -- The country's main labor movement called for a one-day strike today, to demand an end to what it terms intimidation and violence against government critics. The strike has been backed by labor, some businesses, farmers and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, making it the most broadly based challenge to President Robert Mugabe since the country's independence from Britain in 1980.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Prices End Mixed, as Investors Migrate From Tech Shares

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday as investors switched out of technology companies on fears that their earnings growth might slow and moved into more traditional and cheaper sectors, like consumer products.
Concerns that more than a year of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve will hurt profitability, particularly in the technology sector, continued to dog Wall Street, analysts said. Expectations of strong earnings growth are priced into many semiconductor and Internet-related equipment stocks, leaving little room for disappointment. 
 "Slowing growth means -- unless you have phenomenal productivity -- slowing profits growth, and these stocks aren't priced for any slowdown in growth," said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at Pan-Agora Asset Management in Boston.
Old-economy manufacturing companies, like General Motors and Coca-Cola, gained as investors breathed a sigh of relief over benign economic data and took refuge in companies they saw as less vulnerable to market volatility.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 84.97 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,606.95.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, however, dropped 81.47 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,685.52.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure of the market, finished up 7.27 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,438.10.
"It's really a continuation of the selling that we saw last week," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Holdings. "Sentiment was negative going into yesterday, so a lot of people are using the strength in yesterday's prices to cut losses."
Among the larger technology issues to drop was Intel, which lost 2 1/8, to 64 5/8. Indeed, semiconductor shares led the high-technology sector's descent. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index fell 3.83 percent.
The most heavily traded stock on the Nasdaq for the second consecutive day was Cisco Systems, which slipped 2 1/4, to 63 3/16, after the company, a data networking giant, said it would buy a wireless communications software maker, IPmobile for $425 million in stock.
Procter & Gamble advanced 2 3/16, to 59 1/16, after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share, which met analysts' estimates.
Coca-Cola gained 113 9/16, to 62 7/8, and General Motors added 1 7/8, to 58 13/16, while Walt Disney rose 17 15/16, to 40.
The pharmaceuticals company Merck rose 27 3/32, to 73 3/4, amid a broad rally in drug and biotechnology stocks.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasuries Rise on Data
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasuries rose as reports suggested that the economy was not growing fast enough to prompt more increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Slower-than-expected manufacturing growth last month, coupled with a decline in construction spending in June and slower growth in personal income, bolstered confidence among investors who had bet that the economy was cooling enough for the Fed to hold steady on rates.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 1 2/32, to a price of 103 24/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.98 percent from 6.03 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2 8/32, to 1071 6/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.72 percent from 5.78 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: A Parade That's a Tradition

BYLINE: By Jonathan Chait; Jonathan Chait is an associate editor of The New Republic.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
You might mistake the Republican convention for an ethnic festival or a forum on women's rights," The New York Times said in a news story that seems to capture the scene in Philadelphia this week. Except this dispatch, reported by Maureen Dowd, didn't come from the convention that is nominating George W. Bush, but the one that nominated his father 12 years ago.
The image of diverse Republican speakers is so at odds with the usual portrayal of the party that some people have concluded that something radical and significant must be going on. Last week, a Times story said the convention would "showcase women and people from minority groups, faces that are not usually highlighted at Republican conventions." Actually, the last convention, in 1996, gave prominent roles to Susan Molinari, Colin Powell and Elizabeth Dole. And G.O.P. conventions have been showcasing women and minorities since at least the time of Ronald Reagan. 
 The Republicans held their 1980 convention in Detroit, a city with a majority of black residents. In Dallas in 1984, women received the two longest speakers' slots. Trying to close the gender gap in 1988, Republicans gave over their podium to a parade of women and members of minority groups. Even the 1992 convention, now often characterized as a right-wing hate fest, featured an event called "Black America Salutes the First Family" and forced white male luminaries like Alfonse D'Amato and Howard Baker to surrender their credentials to make room for more female delegates.
A convention is a television commercial, and the decision to feature black or female faces has barely any deeper philosophical import than the decision to feature balloons or confetti. In February, when Mr. Bush needed the support of conservative whites in South Carolina, he visited Bob Jones University and refused to denounce the Confederate flag. This doesn't mean that Mr. Bush is a secret racist; it simply reflected expediency in the choice of racial symbolism at that moment. Now the moment and the symbolism have changed.
The best evidence that Mr. Bush has not fundamentally altered the direction of his party is the acquiescence of the G.O.P.'s right wing. Conservatives are so vigilant against creeping moderation that they have denounced Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott for ideological deviation. Not only is this group not barking out any complaints now, but it is nuzzled lovingly in Mr. Bush's lap. And no wonder. His positions on economics and judicial appointments hew firmly to the conservative line.
Party diehards understand that it doesn't much matter if a blind mountain climber speaks in prime time while Mr. Lott is shunted to 11 a.m. Come next year, Mr. Lott, not the mountain climber, will be helping to set the G.O.P. legislative agenda.

HEADLINE: Car Sales Rise, Except at G.M. And Chrysler

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 1

 BODY:
General Motors and DaimlerChrysler said today that their sales fell in July, leaving both automakers unable to reduce their bloated inventories of unsold minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But Ford and foreign automakers announced strong sales last month and balanced inventories.
Overall industry sales were very strong. While they did not quite match the torrid pace early this year, they were still brisk enough to suggest that consumer spending remained a powerful force in the American economy during July. 
 "There are some signs of moderation, although the industry is running at a healthy pace," said Bill Lovejoy, G.M.'s group vice president for North American vehicle sales, service and marketing.
Mark M. Cornelius, an auto statistician in West Olive, Mich., calculated this evening that sales rose 2.1 percent from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.2 million cars and light trucks. He used estimates for sales of Mazda, the only automaker not reporting today. The auto industry sold 17 million vehicles last year, its best ever.
General Motors posted a 2.6 percent drop in sales for July from its record level a year earlier, as a 22.8 percent jump in sales of small Saturn cars failed to offset weak sales of minivans, small pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles. Paul Ballew, G.M.'s sales analysis director, blamed inadequate factory production for the weaker sales of large sport utilities.
The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler said sales fell 12.2 percent in July, dragged heavily by a 29 percent plunge in sales of minivans, a market segment that Chrysler essentially invented in 1983 and has dominated since. Chrysler will introduce redesigned minivans later this month and in early September, and customers have proved loath to buy the older models, despite increasingly lavish rebates.
Jeep sales dropped 15 percent and sales of Dodge Durango large sport utility trucks fell 3 percent. But Americans continued to snap up Chrysler PT Cruiser small vans as fast as the company could build them.
During most of the year, automakers seek to keep a 60-day inventory of vehicles at dealerships and on the way to dealerships. But at the end of July, when they are phasing out old models, they would prefer somewhat smaller inventories of 55 to 58 days.
G.M. said late this afternoon that its supply of unsold cars and light trucks equaled 68 days of sales; Chrysler said that it had a 78-day supply. Both automakers said that they did not have separate inventory figures today for cars and for light trucks, which encompasses minivans, sport utilities and pickups.
G.M. and Chrysler both had very large inventories of light trucks and small numbers of cars at the end of June. Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that the two companies' sales and production figures in July suggested that this pattern had persisted, particularly at G.M., and that the companies' overall inventory figures masked huge backlogs of minivans, sport utilities and pickups.
"Their car inventory is too low, but you don't make any money on cars, and their light truck inventory is too high, and you make money on light trucks," he said. "You just can't go forever building more than you sell."
Chrysler officials acknowledged that their large inventories reflected an enormous supply of minivans. That situation stems at least partly from the company's determination not to run out of minivans this year as it did in 1995 when it shut its two minivan factories for nearly three months to retool them for a new generation. Chrysler ran short of minivans, posted a huge quarterly loss and watched as many loyal customers deserted to rival brands.
This time, Chrysler built lots of extra minivans in the spring and figured out a way to convert one factory over to the new model in two weeks this summer and the other in seven weeks.
The first factory is now in production and cranking out the new minivans quickly, but the old models are selling slowly. James Holden, Chrysler's chief executive, said last week that discounts would be needed to dispose of the older models.
G.M.'s situation is more complicated. In a telephone conference call with reporters this afternoon, Mr. Ballew, the sales analysis director, dismissed widespread rumors in Detroit that G.M. was about to slow output at some factories because of excessive inventories. The automaker's supply of vehicles looks large only in comparison with last summer, when the company was short of many models, he said. He added that the industry's sales might slow slightly next year with weaker economic growth. Gas prices have had little effect on sales, Mr. Ballew said.
Ford announced today that its sales inched up 0.6 percent from an extremely strong performance a year ago. The company had roughly a 50-day supply of cars and about a 60-day supply of light trucks at the end of July, said George Pipas, a market analyst at Ford.
Some foreign automakers fared better in July. Honda had its best month ever in the American market as sales rose 11.6 percent, led by strong results for the Civic compact car, the Odyssey minivan and the CR-V small sport utility vehicle. Mitsubishi's sales jumped 28.5 percent.
Volkswagen's sales climbed 4.8 percent, while Toyota's sales crept up 1 percent and Nissan's sales edged up 0.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Chavez Says He Will Crush Political Foes In Venezuela

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 1

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez said today that he would use troops to crush street protests and to remove an opposition party governor who has accused the governing party of fraudulently altering the outcome of elections last weekend.
"This is going to be nothing more than a little spat, but we are obliged to guarantee order and prevent these groups from spoiling the beautiful process that we have concluded," Mr. Chavez said this afternoon, referring to the vote held across Venezuela on Sunday. "If they lost, they lost," he added dismissively. 
 Preliminary results from the national and local balloting, in which Mr. Chavez and 165 members of a new National Assembly were also elected, gave victory to the incumbent governor in the western state of Merida, William Davila, a leading opposition figure. But 6,000 ballots, most cast for Mr. Davila, were declared invalid for reasons that are still not clear, and the pro-Chavez candidate was declared the winner today, by a margin of less than 1,800 votes.
"It is clear that there was a fraud, which the people of Merida reject," Mr. Davila said in remarks broadcast on national television today.
Opposition candidates in five other states also made similar accusations about fraud in their races. Preliminary results had given Mr. Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition 12 of the 23 governorships at stake in the election in this oil-rich nation of 23 million people, but this afternoon Mr. Chavez said that his candidates had actually triumphed in 16 states and warned that he would not tolerate "anarchy."
"We are consolidating our victory, and as in any battle, you have to fight for every inch of territory," he said. He minimized the protests as "a mob with a few rocks and sticks" and said that "four or five canisters of tear gas ought to get them out of there," referring to the government offices where Mr. Davila has taken refuge.
On Monday, two international observer groups, one led by former President Jimmy Carter and the other sent by the Organization of American States, had pronounced the balloting here clean and fair. Sustained opposition complaints of fraud in the tabulation of votes began in earnest only today, though, after the observer groups had begun to close down operations here.
Mr. Chavez, a former army colonel who led an unsuccesful coup attempt in 1992, announced the dispatch of troops this afternoon during a three-hour news conference at which he also discussed issues ranging from his government's foreign policy to his plans to reactivate the Venezuelan economy. His most significant comments, though, came in a response to a question about oil prices, which have recently soared to near-record highs.
In recent years, Venezuela has been the leading supplier of the oil imported by the United States, and the country's energy minister, Ali Rodriguez Araque, was designated president of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries, or OPEC, this spring. Mr. Chavez made it clear that he was delighted with the jump in oil prices and reiterated his position that he sees no reason to take any action to bring them down.
"We are just defending our position," Mr. Chavez said. "It's not that prices are high. They are fair and just."
Despite the oil bonanza, Venezuela's economy contracted by more than 7 percent last year, and now that the election is over, Mr. Chavez is under pressure to take steps to end that recession.
He also reiterated his admiration for the Cuban and Chinese revolutions, saying those countries' economies "have good things" and have produced social benefits. But he then added that it is not his intention to "try to import models from abroad," and said that his own revolutionary government welcomes foreign investment, so long as it is "productive, not speculative."
Long a skeptic about American policies in the region, Mr. Chavez expressed concern about the $1.3 billion emergency aid package for neighboring Colombia that President Clinton approved last month. He said that while his government is "willing to cooperate" with Colombia and the United States, he hoped that the military aid would "not be used to Vietnamize the Colombia conflict" or contribute to an increase in the fighting there.
"Let's hope this doesn't happen," he said. "We are paying close attention."
But Mr. Chavez reserved his most critical comments for his domestic opposition, saying that some of his adversaries "refuse to recognize Chavez as president" and warning that he will not hesitate to use his expanded powers to bring them to heel. "If they don't understand that or don't cooperate, we will apply the Constitution to them," he warned.

HEADLINE: Heat Wave Nearly Causes Rolling Blackouts in California

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 1

 BODY:
A lingering heat wave throughout the West drove demand for electric power in California to near-record levels today and brought the state close to a full-scale power emergency. Such an emergency would have prompted rolling blackouts, in order for power administrators to keep the state's giant, overburdened electricity grid from crashing completely.
For the second straight day, the California Independent System Operator, which controls about 75 percent of the state's electric power grid on behalf of private utilities, declared a statewide Stage 2 emergency at midday. In a Stage 2 emergency, power is curtailed to commercial and industrial users that receive power-rate discounts in exchange for agreeing to shut down when asked to do so in times of high demand. 
 Officials warned that a Stage 3 emergency, which has never been declared, was possible because a stubborn high-pressure system stretching from Mexico to Canada had kept temperatures so high that air-conditioning systems were working harder and longer throughout the entire region. In a Stage 3 alert, "rotating blackouts" to small parts of communities are imposed to keep the larger system up and running.
In California, which began deregulating the electric power industry four years ago, and around the nation, a decade of economic growth and under-investment in new power plants has left power reserves at the lowest levels in decades. And because the current heat wave is so widespread, California has been unable to import enough power from other states.
This morning officials warned that overall demand in California today was expected to exceed 46,245 megawatts, breaking a record of 45,884 megawatts, set just last year.
But at 3:30 p.m., the system, handling 43,400 megawatts, had already cut off about 1,800 megawatts to industrial users as a result of the Stage 2 alert. That left the system with about 3 percent more power than the demands on it. A Stage 3 alert is automatically called if reserves fall below 1.5 percent.
If a Stage 3 event worked as planned, "we'd have to impose rotating outages to small portions of communities across all our service area," said Tom Boyd, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, which supplies power over 50,000 square miles in Central and Southern California, including much of suburban Los Angeles.
In Los Angeles itself, the city's municipal utility, the venerable Department of Water and Power, controls its own, independent electric power source and would not be expected to be affected by a Stage 3 alert.
Doug Kline, spokesman for San Diego Gas and Electric, which serves 1.2 million homes and businesses in the San Diego area, a total of about three million people, said the utility would treat any blackout caused by shortages as it treats a natural disaster.
For customers on life support who cannot have their power interrupted, "we encourage them to have some backup generation in the case of something like this," Mr. Kline said.
"But obviously they're in a different category of customers," Mr. Kline said, adding that "we work with those customers when we know where they are."

HEADLINE: For Mrs. Clinton, G.O.P. Theme Is Like Old Times

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: WESTBURY, N.Y., Aug. 1

 BODY:
The day after the Republican National Convention opened with a call to "leave no child behind," Hillary Rodham Clinton marveled at how familiar it all seemed.
"I thought it sounded like the convention theme was 'It Takes a Village,' " Mrs. Clinton said with a smirk, referring to the title of her book, which was ridiculed by conservatives when it was published in 1995. 
 The official theme at the Philadelphia convention on Monday was actually "Opportunity With a Purpose: Leave No Child Behind." The phrase ran through the remarks of many speakers, from experts on adoption and literacy to Gen. Colin L. Powell.
"Many of the issues that were discussed and the way they were discussed were very much in line with what I've written about and talked about for 30 years," Mrs. Clinton said today on the first day of a three-day campaign trip on Long Island. "I'm happy to have even rhetorical support for our mutual obligation to care for children."
The first lady's remarks came on the home turf of her Republican opponent for the United States Senate, Representative Rick A. Lazio. Mrs. Clinton is likely to have a much harder time winning votes on Republican-dominated Long Island, where the congressman was born and raised.
"Underneath all of that soothing rhetoric are very different ideas about what we should do as a country," she told reporters after a lunch meeting of the Nassau County Village Officials Association here.
"I'm glad we've moved the Republican Party rhetorically," Mrs. Clinton said. "But if you look at their Congressional agenda, if you look at their platform, if you look at what their nominee said when he started to run during the primary and the positions he signed onto, there are huge differences. And if the people of New York know the differences, the Democrats will do very well."
Mrs. Clinton was accompanied by her daughter, Chelsea, for the first time since it was announced that Chelsea would take a leave from Stanford University to help her mother's campaign. Small crowds gathered around Ms. Clinton as she greeted well-wishers and posed for pictures with babies and elderly people.
Just as Mrs. Clinton had stressed economic development in struggling upstate towns, she tailored her remarks today to the crowds of largely white, middle-aged and elderly Long Islanders, emphasizing issues like lowering taxes and her support for using the federal surplus to preserve Social Security and introduce prescription drug benefits for Medicare patients. She again mentioned a proposal, first outlined in Albany last month, that would change the formula to determine the state's share of federal Medicaid dollars.
Absent from today's remarks were the issues she has stressed before black audiences over the last couple of days, like the 1986 vote in Congress by Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, against a resolution urging freedom for Nelson Mandela from a South African prison.
While toning down what had been sharp criticism of Mr. Lazio, Mr. Cheney and Gov. George W. Bush, Mrs. Clinton said she had merely been pointing out facts.
"I don't think it's an attack to say Governor Bush went to Bob Jones University, Governor Bush supports the Republican platform and Supreme Court nominees who are dedicated to doing away with a woman's right to choose," she said. "I don't think it's negative or an attack to say here are the facts and let people make their own judgment."
Mrs. Clinton seemed downright earnest, even returning, for the first time in months, to the slogan of her book. "It takes a village to provide parks," she said earlier in the day during a campaign stop at a neighborhood park in Great Neck. "It takes a village to keep the streets safe. It takes a village to provide teachers and resources necessary to educate our children."
"It takes a lot of villages," Mrs. Clinton observed, "to help elect someone to the United States Senate."

HEADLINE: South Korea's Leader Deplores Anti-Americanism

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 1

 BODY:
President Kim Dae Jung issued a warning today against anti-Americanism as displayed by a small group of protesters, reminding South Koreans that the United States remained the country's "biggest supporter."
The warning came as the United States and South Korea prepared for talks Wednesday on revising a defense agreement that critics say infringes on Seoul's sovereignty. 
 Meanwhile, 50 protesters engaged in shoving matches with the police trying to prevent them from rallying near the American Embassy today.
Waving pickets and shouting slogans, the protesters demanded that Washington revise the defense treaty -- called the Status of Forces Agreement -- to allow South Korea greater jurisdiction over American soldiers in criminal cases.
"We must criticize wrong American policies but that should not lead to anti-Americanism," Mr. Kim was quoted by his office as saying during a cabinet meeting. "Cooperative relations with the United States should remain strong. Anti-Americanism does not help our national interests."
His warning was aimed at protesters who have demanded that Washington withdraw 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea as a deterrent against Communist North Korea. The group has stepped up activities since relations between North and South Korea began thawing in June, as a result of a summit meeting.
Despite the improving relations with North Korea, Mr. Kim reconfirmed that South Korea needed the American military presence for its security and for regional stability.
"The United States remains our biggest supporter," he said, "not only in security and international relations but also in economic relations."
Demands to revise the defense treaty increased last month after the United States military apologized for having dumped 20 gallons of formaldehyde into the Han River, a main source of drinking water for Seoul's 12 million people.
Protesters used public criticism of the American forces to demand their withdrawal.
Under the defense agreement, signed in 1966 and revised in 1991, American soldiers stationed in South Korea and involved in crimes remain under the custody of the United States military until all appeals are exhausted.

HEADLINE: College Takes to Street to Drum Up Enrollment

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Call it the big sell.
The Borough of Manhattan Community College is plastering its name all over New York City -- in 350 buses, 1,000 subway cars and 24 movie theaters, to be exact -- to attract students, and is sending current students out on the streets to recruit. Ronald Spalter, the college's vice president for administration and planning, is even planning to send students to Jones Beach to collar prospects for this fall's class right on the sands. 
 Last Friday, on a sultry afternoon that threatened rain, three students positioned themselves between vendors hawking wireless telephones and health insurance at the bustling Fordham Plaza shopping center in the Bronx to sell the virtues of the college. They were looking for high school students, immigrants and other men and women from poor and working-class neighborhoods who may not have thought of college as a possibility.
"Interested in college? B.M.C.C. is where you want to be," Theodore McNeil called as he trotted alongside likely-looking candidates.
"If you can't afford the tuition there," he said, pointing to the nearby Fordham University campus, "you can come to B.M.C.C." (B.M.C.C. tuition is $2,500 a year for state residents; Fordham's tuition is about $20,000.)
The campaign is part of a wider push by the City University of New York to attract more students to its six community colleges after the number of applicants in the late spring fell more than 10 percent below the year before.
Why the numbers slipped is unclear. Some CUNY professors suggest that students feel unwelcome because of the university's new policies limiting remedial classes. CUNY administrators disagree, saying that the changes affect the senior colleges, not the community colleges. They say the cause is the booming economy, which makes work more attractive than school.
Whatever the cause, the university did not want to take a chance that enrollments would remain weak -- even though community college students often wait to enroll until classes begin and there could still be a last-minute surge. A decline in students means a decline in tuition revenues and could force the colleges to cut back.
In June, Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor, leaned on the community colleges to mount recruiting campaigns, putting up about $250,000 to aid the effort. Last month, he took to the airwaves himself to promote CUNY, with 30- and 60-second radio spots advising listeners that "It takes more than a high school diploma to get a good job," and inviting them to call 290-5678 for "on-the-spot admission."
All of CUNY's community colleges now have their own recruiting and publicity programs. But none is as far-reaching as the one at B.M.C.C., which is probably less well known than the other CUNY community colleges, which draw most of their students from their own neighborhoods. B.M.C.C. draws only about a quarter of its students from Manhattan. Many of the rest come from the other boroughs and from Long Island and Westchester. Foreign students account for nearly 10 percent of its enrollment.
Based in a sprawling modern building on Chambers Street near the Hudson River, the college has seen its enrollment slip to fewer than 15,000 from about 17,000 a few years ago.
"We knew we had to correct the slide," said Antonio Perez, B.M.C.C.'s president.
Another reason for the big publicity splash, he said, was that the college needs greater name recognition before it begins a multimillion-dollar fund-raising campaign.
The publicity is costly. B.M.C.C. put the cost of the advertisements at more than $150,000. But Dr. Perez said an increase in students and a successful capital campaign would more than make up for the spending.
At Fordham Plaza last week, Chanel Wray and Antoinette Daniels, members of B.M.C.C.'s women's basketball team (which took third place nationally among community colleges) laid out brochures for more than a dozen B.M.C.C. programs, including science, nursing, accounting and computer programming, as well as a pile of information on student aid.
The students also mounted a large satellite dish with the college's name on it between their two tables.
"It's a decoy, but it draws people's attention," said Ms. Wray, an 18-year-old liberal arts major at the college who is earning $8.46 an hour to recruit students.
Business was brisk.
Six young women decked out in multiple gold chains and earrings crowded around the college's table and chatted about the basketball team. After asking where the college was (on Chambers Street, near the Hudson River) and how they could get there (the 1, 2, 3, 9, A and C subway trains stop close by), two of them filled out short forms requesting more information.
A gum-chewing woman with neon-pink toenails grabbed brochures on the college's nursing and early childhood programs.
The driver of a shiny black Town Car limousine pulled over to the curb and leaned out the window to ask Mr. McNeil about the college. Mr. McNeil handed the driver a form, and he filled it out, passed it back and sped away.
Several mothers stopped to fill out forms requesting more information for their children.
"Parents don't take the time to invest in helping their children," commented Stephanie Fields, a tall woman with an assured manner. She said she just graduated from college herself and was now trying to find a place for her daughter, Arlene, who is a senior in high school.
Some of the most serious candidates appeared to be immigrants hoping to move up to better jobs, a group that accounts for a sizable share of the students at all of CUNY's community colleges.
Lanning Diaz, a medical school graduate from the Dominican Republic, looked carefully through the B.M.C.C. brochures, especially the ones about computer science. A tall man with a grizzled beard, he said that he had been thinking about returning to school to learn about computer applications in health care since his medical license is not valid here.
He said he had already asked for his transcripts to be sent from the Dominican Republic to CUNY, but did not know which college he would attend. "I barely know the names and locations of the colleges," he said.
Sunday Alao, a Bronx resident from Ghana, also looked slowly through the college brochures. He said that although he had studied college-level accounting and management in Ghana, he was working in a kitchen now and wanted to go back to school to enter nursing. What college he chooses, he said, depends on whether he can afford it and whether he can schedule classes around his job.
Not everyone was interested.
Sharon Brown, a chatty woman in a bright turban who described herself as an entrepreneur, stopped briefly. She said she did not have a college degree but did not want one, though she might consider a computer course.
"Do they have Wealth Creation 101?" she asked. "That's what I'm interested in."
Mr. McNeil, who is 33 years old and has three children, was philosophic. "With the Clinton administration and prosperity, a lot of people are focused on putting food on the table now," he said after several people passed by without stopping.
"They don't want to think about what happens down the road. We're trying to get them to think about it."
B.M.C.C. officials are pleased with the response so far. As of mid-July, they say, the number of CUNY applicants requesting B.M.C.C. was nearly 2,800 -- more than 20 percent above last year.
But Mr. McNeil said that whether the number of new students rose or fell, he was convinced that the recruiting effort was worthwhile.
"On the off-chance it doesn't work," said Mr. McNeil, "they can't say CUNY didn't reach out."

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
O.K. Now we're in business.
After an icky evening of Republican kissy-face and blaxploitation ("Affirmative Action, the Musical"), Poppy unleashed Chiang! 
 Unleashing Chiang, in the loopy Bush family patois used in golf and tennis, means giving the ball a good whack.
After a week of President Clinton taunting W., saying that the Republican candidate's message was merely "My Daddy was president," Daddy lost it.
"And if he continues that, then I'm going to tell the nation what I think about him as a human being and a person," the former president threatened on NBC's "Today."
Our summer of torpid politics suddenly came alive with the freaky spectacle of two presidents trash-talking. The race turns out to be what we thought it was all along: President Bush vs. President Clinton.
George Senior is determined to prove once and for all that Bill Clinton is a tacky hick who defiled the presidency. Bill Clinton is determined to prove once and for all that George Senior is an irrelevant aristocrat who thinks the presidency is a family heirloom.
Two intensely competitive chief executives, who had been trying not to meddle too much in the campaigns of their proteges, bolting off the reservation in a bid for vindication.
George Senior is fighting for the second term he feels he was gypped out of by Bill Clinton. And Bill Clinton is fighting for the third term he needs to launder his legacy.
W. and Al are alternately bystanders and stand-ins in the big rematch.
It is as though the tape of the '92 election, on pause all these years, has started rolling again.
The presidential hissy fit is driven by class rage. Edith Wharton would have savored this drama of manners.
The Bushes have been privately steaming that Gore/Clinton have not abided by Marquess of Queensberry rules, allowing the Republicans to enjoy their nomination party without any Democrats throwing a punch.
Bush Pere believes his manners toward his successor have been impeccable, and that he has been discreet out of loyalty to the office.
"Who's been more gracious and charitable to Bill Clinton, even during Lewinsky?" asked the former president's old friend Alan Simpson, the former Wyoming senator.
So the Bushes felt the gentlemanly rules of order were broken over the last week when the Democrats put out an ad attacking Dick Cheney's conservative record and two more attacking W. on health care and the environment, and when Bill Clinton repeatedly mocked W. as a coddled daddy's boy at fund-raisers.
"The country was in the ditch," Mr. Clinton said in Boston last Friday, talking about '92, comparing the Bush White House to a ditzy "Wayne's World."
Nobody gave Mr. Clinton, who never knew his own father and who had to stand up to an abusive, alcoholic stepfather, a solid gold key to success. And he clearly thinks Al Gore, another regent raised to be president by a famous political father, is not up to the challenge of gutting the Bushes on the entitlement issue.
It has to be galling to Mr. Clinton that Americans don't seem inclined to reward his vice president for the purring economy. And he is surely fed up with the Republicans acting as if his two terms were merely Bushus Interruptus.
The remarkable thing is that this class war has caused everyone to reverse roles. In '92, W. was the vindictive one who lashed out when his father was criticized. Now dad has taken junior's role. And while it is usually vice presidents who serve as hatchet men, now Bill Clinton does that for his vice president.
Even though Mr. Simpson says that the Bushes avoided publicly criticizing Mr. Clinton about Monica Lewinsky, that is in fact the subtext of W.'s campaign -- restoring "honor and dignity" to the White House. Mr. Clinton thinks a rejection of Mr. Gore would be a ratification of the Bushes' contention that he sullied the White House. The president can also see that it is hard for Al Gore to attack, because even people who agree with Mr. Gore find him insufferable on the attack. W. and Mr. Gore will probably keep campaigning, but we all know it's not about them anymore. Maybe it never was.

HEADLINE: Columbia Sets Pace In Profiting Off Research

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
When Fredric D. Price, the president of a nutritional-supplements company, sought a partner to create an online information company, NutritionU.com, he approached a Columbia University professor, Dr. Richard J. Deckelbaum.
He hit pay dirt. 
 Some academics might have run the other way, concerned about the motives and standards in the emerging commercial market for cybereducation. But Dr. Deckelbaum, director of Columbia's Institute of Human Nutrition, viewed the Internet as a way to reach a wider population.
Columbia was interested, too. The venture fit its strategy of turning more of its intellectual capital -- its professors' knowledge, research and teaching -- into financial capital. It quickly forged an agreement with Mr. Price for fees and a share of the company.
Columbia's eagerness to join forces with a start-up Internet venture reflects a shift in an academic culture that once saw itself driven only by intellectual curiosity and far removed from commerce. While the change is occurring throughout the academic world, few universities have tried to cash in as aggressively as Columbia, which has a research capacity similar to that of Harvard and Yale but without their endowments.
As Columbia ventures further and faster than its peers -- it is collecting more in patents and royalties than any other university -- it is the focus of concern and envy.
"There's been a paradigm shift," said Cornelius W. Sullivan, vice provost for research at the University of Southern California, who is trying to point his university in a similar direction. "There was a time that this kind of work -- and the idea of making money from your research -- was not acceptable at universities, including ours."
Last year, Columbia earned nearly $100 million of its $1.5 billion budget from patents and royalties. This year it will collect more than $144 million from patents, like one on a technique that allows animal cells to be used to manufacture proteins used as drugs, and one on a discovery that paved the way for eye drops used in treating glaucoma.
The University of California, among the universities that has earned the most patent income in recent years, earned $89 million for the fiscal year that ended in June. Stanford University, another leader in patent income, expects to earn $35 million for the fiscal year that ends this month.
Columbia is reinvesting much of its money in further research to expand scientific discoveries and the money it makes from them.
Generally, the faculty has not raised a fuss. The benefits of collecting more money from research and other academic activities are clear: more money to advance their work and less dependence on the government. But there are concerns.
Dimitris Anastassiou, a professor of electrical engineering at Columbia, said he worried about the perception among some faculty members that the university increasingly "appears to be a for-profit enterprise." He would like it to put more of a wall between decisions about how the campus can make money, and decisions about what research the university should support. Currently, both sets of decisions are vested in the executive vice provost, Michael M. Crow, who receives the university's income from patents and royalties and decides how to spend it.
Sheldon Krimsky, a science policy specialist at Tufts University, said he was concerned about the impact on research when professors or universities have a stake in the outcome of their work. "It is a question not just of how many relationships you have with business, but the nature of those relationships," he said.
Eli M. Noam, a Columbia business professor who said he thought that generating more revenue from intellectual property was legitimate, said he still worried that "long term, it will reduce the credibility of universities and will probably reduce the willingness of society to take care of these institutions."
"Universities have benefited from the perception that they are outside the marketplace and have credibility because they are seen as disinterested parties," Mr. Noam said.
Columbia's provost, Jonathan R. Cole, acknowledges that there is a revolution taking place in what he calls the "means and modes" of producing knowledge, but argues that it will be possible to safeguard the underlying values of the university.
"I think the dominant values are predominantly the same as they used to be," he said. "The income is only a means to continue to pursue our mission."
"Our motivation is to be entrepreneurial," Mr. Cole said. "We've been giving it away for generations. Now we want to get a fair return, always so we can reinvest it."
The change began two decades ago. To spur technological progress, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 encouraged universities to commercialize the research they conducted with support from the federal government. Columbia, like other research universities, set up a technology licensing office.
Spinning academic discoveries into commercial riches, however, turned out to be a slow, uncertain process. Even if a university can find a company willing to license its discoveries, the odds are only one in 20 that the company will make it pay off commercially, said Lita Nelsen, director of the Technology Licensing Office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She said that M.I.T. typically earned $15 million to $20 million a year in patent and royalty fees, and that most university licensing offices did not break even.
But the Internet, which traffics in information, has jolted university officials into action. They see the Internet as a gold mine -- providing a faster, larger payback than traditional research in areas like biology -- if only they can figure out how to package what their professors know.
Internet companies with deep pockets are already buzzing around campuses, eager to enlist professors like Dr. Deckelbaum or Arthur R. Miller, a widely known Harvard law professor who agreed to work with a new online law school while he remained at Harvard.
Mindful of the competition, universities are trying to create their own opportunities that will allow professors to expand their reach and their incomes, and permit the universities to share in the bounty.
Columbia has been well ahead of the pack. The partnership with NutritionU.com is just one of the deals it has announced in recent months. In April, it announced the creation of Fathom.com, a commercial online partnership with other prestigious institutions, including the New York Public Library, the British Library and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History; those institutions and others will offer information and classes on the Web site. In May, the university announced that it was teaming up with Cognitive Arts, a software designer, to offer continuing education on the World Wide Web.
Columbia was the first university to join forces with UNext.com, a start-up backed by Michael Milken, the former junk-bond king, that is offering Internet college courses created by elite universities. Columbia has already collected $2 million.
Dr. Crow, Columbia's executive vice provost, has been directing the university's efforts to cash in on its intellectual property. He has easy access to the provost and the president. And he has a hefty bankroll: more than $40 million this year, money not subject to the normal budget process or any faculty oversight.
One sign of the university's seriousness was its decision seven years ago to give Dr. Crow the income from the university's research royalties as his budget, rather than contribute it to the university's general fund. At the time, the amount was small, about $1 million. Today, it is about $42 million.
Dr. Crow thinks of the money, he said, as venture capital to be spent both on academically promising projects and economically promising ones. In recent years, his office has contributed $800,000 in seed money for a child and family policy center, and $600,000 into the development of an urban extension service.
This year, he said, about $10 million went into various academic initiatives. Another $20 million went into building new institutions, like a campus connected with Biosphere 2 in Arizona, and the rest into various projects, including digital media.
The university has created Columbia Media Enterprises to nurture digital projects. Although modeled on Columbia's technology licensing office, Columbia Innovation Enterprise, there is a key difference: it is a profit-making company, albeit one wholly owned by Columbia. Columbia Media Enterprises started last fall with one employee; today there are 15, including 7 student "sweepers" who comb the university for content to put on the Web.
In anticipation of increased activity over the Internet, Columbia pushed its faculty to consider how their interests should be treated. Professors traditionally own the rights to the books and articles they write, and their royalties represent perhaps 10 to 15 percent of book sales. Universities typically own patents from research, and professors may get a quarter of the revenue. (Each university's policy differs.)
Columbia's Senate approved a new intellectual property policy in June that gives the university rights to Internet projects that are supported by university money or commissioned by the university, or that make "substantial" use of university equipment and labor. In these cases, professors share in the revenue, receiving anywhere from a quarter to a half of the revenue after expenses.
Columbia says it has no plans to compel faculty members to cooperate with its own ventures, but hopes to offer them as an alternative to working with outside companies.
"The faculty are independent spirits, and we can't make them do anything," Dr. Crow said. "Their primary benefit is to create new knowledge. The secondary benefit is to collect licensing income. But it's a wondrous secondary benefit."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE NEW YORK SENATE RACE;
Lazio Drops In on Philadelphia, Saying His Job Is in New York

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Representative Rick A. Lazio stopped by his party's convention for a few brief hours today, seizing the chance to raise money for his Senate campaign and to rally supporters.
Mr. Lazio, Republican of Long Island, also tried to increase his visibility against his high-profile opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, by giving several television interviews. 
 Early, he seemed unrestrained by national Republican efforts to avoid criticism of the Clintons. Instead, Mr. Lazio told New York delegates at a brunch, "We've been here about a day, probably longer than Hillary Clinton has been in New York."
Later, Mr. Lazio was far more guarded, telling a mass of journalists that he was taking the high road, compared with what he considered the negativity of his opponent.
He attracted people curious to see the man in political combat with the first lady, though more than a smattering were unsure who he was.
Mr. Lazio ventured inside the hall, though far from the podium, where some Republicans felt he belonged.
Asked about the Republican Party's platform, which, among other points that differ from Mr. Lazio's positions, opposes abortion, Mr. Lazio said, "I think the platform, frankly, has become largely obsolete." But he cited only the abortion plank as problematic, adding, "I think the party platform is going to be determined by Governor Bush." (Mr. Lazio does oppose public financing for abortions and late-term procedures.)
Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, later explained that Mr. Lazio considered the concept of platforms obsolete, not the content.
Mr. Lazio faced numerous questions about his brief visit, and he restated that he would not be here on Thursday for Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance speech. Some have suggested that the Lazio campaign was irritated that he was not offered a greater role. But Mr. Lazio said: "My job is to get back to New York. That's where the votes are. I'm not running for national office here."
Some of his prominent Republican allies, including Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said they were disappointed in Mr. Lazio's limited role. Mr. Armey hugged Mr. Lazio and called him "one of my one or two best friends in the House."
Organizers "tried to allocate spots to guys who needed the exposure," Mr. Armey said of the schedule. "Rick doesn't really need it."
On Wednesday, Mr. Lazio is scheduled to appear on a WWOR program led by Bob Grant, who has drawn controversy over remarks he has made about blacks.
His opponent's staff regarded Mr. Lazio's convention appearance as a sign of his ties to what they consider the conservative party leadership.
"Which part of the Bush-Cheney ticket does he support?" asked Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman. "Does he support a risky tax scheme that would make a U-turn for our economy?"

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Courting of Voting Bloc Poses Question of Motive

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Tonight, for the second night in a row, one of the principal speakers at the Republican National Convention was a black person. Tonight, it was Condoleezza Rice, the chief national security adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas; on Monday night, it was Colin L. Powell, who may be secretary of state if Mr. Bush is elected president.
Amazing stuff. 
 Obviously, this was no happenstance. In this convention, whose sole mission is to glorify Mr. Bush, happenstance just doesn't happen.
Equally obviously, neither Ms. Rice nor General Powell was on the dais as window-dressing. Both are eminent figures, whose success in the academic and military worlds speaks volumes about the achievements of black Americans in the last couple of decades. But there was window-dressing as well -- black singers, black choirs, black candidates for lesser offices and black children seated at school desks in the backdrop to the speech of the prospective nominee's wife, Laura, a former schoolteacher.
The question occurs, what is all this about? Granting that Mr. Bush has demonstrated in his brief political career a much greater sensitivity to minority concerns than the average Republican, what political purpose lies behind the image-making?
Does he really think he can do better among blacks than his father, who took 12 percent and 10 percent of the black vote in 1988 and 1992, respectively, and better than Bob Dole, who took 12 percent in 1996? Or is it a three-cushion shot, a subtle play for the votes of white suburbanites, a pivotal voting block that includes many voters for whom civil rights remains a high priority?
"He has no chance of getting any significant African-American vote," said David Bositis of the nonpartisan Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. "This is not even about that. It's about the suburbs, and about moderate swing voters all across the country."
At the moment, the cold facts are these: The Democrats are a multiracial party, with large numbers of blacks in leadership positions. The Republicans are largely a mono-racial party. Since World War II, only three African-American Republicans have been elected to Congress.
General Powell said bluntly that there was widespread "cynicism in the black community" toward the Republican party, based in part on its opposition to affirmative action. He challenged the Republicans to reach out to blacks and other minority communities.
"And not just during an election-year campaign," he continued. "It must be a sustained effort."
Mr. Bush acknowledged that "we have a lot of work to do."
But Democrats expressed skepticism that it would ever get done. Speaking at the alternative convention here, the Rev. Jesse Jackson praised General Powell but said that his speech was part of a "sham." Noting that this is a largely white convention -- only 4 percent of the delegates are black, about the same as in 1972 -- Mr. Jackson added, "You got Powell making speeches but you got Trent Lott making policy" -- a reference to the Senate majority leader, a conservative from Mississippi.
According to exit polls conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of television networks and The Associated Press, Mr. Bush took 27 percent of the black vote in his re-election contest in 1998. That may have been an exaggeration of his true strength, because his Democratic opponent, Tony Mauro, was never seen as a viable alternative. Mr. Bush did much less well against Ann Richards in 1994, winning 15 percent of the black vote then.
During this year's campaign, he made a point of appearing before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. But in South Carolina, when Senator John McCain of Arizona was pressing him hard, Mr. Bush was unwilling to condemn the flying of the Confederate battle flag on the statehouse, and he campaigned at Bob Jones University in Greenville, which banned interracial dating at the time of his speech.
Mr. Bush has also described Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, dyed-in-the-wool conservatives whose very names are anathema to many blacks -- even though Mr. Thomas is himself black -- as model Supreme Court justices.
To many African-Americans, those actions seemed of a piece with Richard M. Nixon's southern strategy, which built a lasting base for the Republicans among Southern white voters. It was not explicitly anti-black, but it was grounded in racial apprehensions. Ever since, the Republican Party has had, to a greater or lesser degree, a white southern core, and its leadership on Capitol Hill has been largely southern.
President Clinton, meanwhile, has emerged as the most popular president among African-Americans since Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the Voting Rights Act, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who espoused their cause during the Depression, when many of them had trouble finding enough to eat.
"Most of my friends see him as a kind of god," said a black Republican delegate here, who asked that his name not be used. "Some of that rubs off on Al Gore, and it makes Bush's job in November terribly difficult."
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, taken between July 20 and 22, suggested how difficult a job Mr. Bush faces in courting black votes. In a two-way race, Mr. Gore won the support of 84 percent of African-Americans to Mr. Bush's 6 percent.
At a first glance, blacks would seem to be ripe for conversion to Republicanism. In nationwide telephone surveys conducted by The Times and CBS News since 1976, between a quarter and a third of black voters have described themselves as conservatives, but only 6 percent to 11 percent have described themselves as Republicans. Even making allowances for those who use the word "conservative" in its social rather than political sense, and apply it to themselves because they are regular churchgoers, for example, the Republicans should have an opportunity.
In recent years, moreover, more and more blacks have reached the middle class, have moved into prosperous suburbs and have joined the professions. According to a new study called Black America 2000, the income levels of black households have tripled in the past 24 years, and the number of black-owned businesses more than doubled in number between 1987 and 1997.
When other groups have undergone such changes, significant numbers among them have migrated to the Republican party. But so far, that pattern has not held for blacks.
In any event, things are going well for Mr. Bush among white suburbanites. The same Times/CBS poll showed him ahead of the Mr. Gore among that group, 52 percent to 34.
If, as Mr. Bositis and a number of Republican tacticians suggested, Mr. Bush's real aim in appealing to blacks is to solidify his support among white moderates, he would not be the first Republican nominee to try that ploy. In 1980, Ronald Reagan made much of his endorsement by the civil rights leaders Ralph David Abernathy and Hosea Williams. His black support barely budged; but that was not the point, a strategist, Richard Wirthlin, later explained. The target, Mr. Wirthlin said, was white suburbanites.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Gooden's Bronx Revival Continues

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
Dwight Gooden's revival continued last night, which meant that one of the most surprising developments of a long season continued for the Yankees. Gooden pitched seven competent innings for one of the best teams in baseball and made it difficult to fathom how he was unemployed before George Steinbrenner offered him one more chance.
Of course, Gooden has devoured the chance, has helped stabilize the Yankees and has made them look shrewd for believing in him again. While Gooden was impeccable last night at Yankee Stadium, the bullpen was not, so Gooden lost his chance for a victory when Mike Stanton frittered away a two-run bulge in the eighth and the Kansas City Royals rallied to tie the score. 
 But Scott Brosius saved Stanton by hammering a homer off Ricky Bottalico to lead off the bottom of the eighth and vault the Yankees to a dramatic 5-4 victory. Since Brosius had stranded six runners in his first three at-bats and had not homered in 14 games, he tossed the bat aside, raised his arms in the air like Rocky Balboa and scampered around the bases.
"It was one of those times where you could walk away with a smile after struggling a bit," Brosius said.
Gooden could definitely smile after continuing to do something that was supposed to be a surprise, and is now looking more and more like a routine. He had a sturdy fastball, precise control and enormous confidence, allowing one earned run and four hits in his longest outing of the season. He gave Manager Joe Torre enough evidence to prove that the 35-year-old Gooden should stay in the rotation.
Torre admitted that he never expected Gooden to be in a pivotal position. But Gooden, who signed a minor league contract in June, is 3-0 with a 1.86 earned run average for the Yankees after adding a changeup and being more aggressive. It will be difficult for Torre to remove him from the rotation, even if David Cone is excellent in his next start.
"You can't top what he did tonight," Torre said about Gooden. "It's fun for me to watch. I know he has to be thrilled about it."
After abominable stints with the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Devil Rays and a near retirement, Gooden thought about what he had accomplished and said, "It might sound crazy, but I'm more relaxed now."
Despite his superb pitching, Gooden knows that Orlando Hernandez, who is recovering from an injury, will return to the rotation and he would like to see Cone do so as well. If Cone is in the five-man rotation, Gooden will not be.
"I think that's their decision," Gooden said. "I still feel we're a better team with me in the bullpen. That would mean that El Duque is healthy and Coney is back on track. I have no problem going to the bullpen."
With the Yankees trailing by 2-1 in the seventh, Chuck Knoblauch walked and stole second, and Royals starter Dan Reichert followed by walking Derek Jeter. After the left-hander Tim Byrdak struck out Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams smashed a two-run double to left. David Justice followed with a double to make it 4-2, a refreshing change for the Yankees, who had stranded two in the fifth and three in the sixth after Brosius whiffed.
Gooden was six outs from his fourth victory with the Yankees and he had thrown only 79 pitches, but Torre turned to Stanton in the eighth. A one-out single, a walk and Johnny Damon's booming double off the fence in right-center field, which was a few feet from being a three-run homer, tied the score, 4-4. The Royals later loaded the bases against Jeff Nelson, but Nelson fanned Joe Randa and pumped his fist as he returned to the dugout. All of the Yankees were celebrating a few moments later when Brosius belted Bottalico's 1-0 fastball over the left-field fence.
The homer climaxed a long day for Brosius. His 8-year-old daughter, Allison, developed the concept for a fund-raiser called Yankees' Kids for Kids, which was introduced yesterday. The Yankees put canisters at more than 50 locations throughout the Stadium for donations to buy toys for local children who are in the hospital. Allison and her father videotaped a message describing the effort that was shown on the scoreboard during the game.
"People definitely got enough of the Brosius family tonight with all that was going on," Brosius said. "From here on out, we'll be less visible."
Even though Gooden did not get the victory, the Yankees were giddy because a reclamation project from the Devil Rays was pitching as well as anyone else on their staff. Gooden was dejected when the Royals took a 2-0 lead in the fifth, a sign of how much he expects of himself now. Gooden's revival continued, but will he stay in the rotation?
"I like tough decisions," Torre said. "There are other clubs struggling to know who they'll start next week. If we have a lot of choices, I like that. It's going to be tough. Right now, I don't know what I'm going to do."

INSIDE PITCH
ORLANDO HERNANDEZ (sprained elbow and back spasms) pitched four shutout innings in a Class A game yesterday and felt no pain. Hernandez struck out five and walked one in a 49-pitch effort, and his fastball reached 92 miles an hour. The Yankees will decide today if he should rejoin the team or make another rehab start. . . . RYAN THOMPSON was relieved that the Yankees did not acquire a left fielder. "You know how they say you have a monkey on your back?" Thompson said. "I had a gorilla. But I still have to show these guys. I have to impress them."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS PROPOSING NEW WAY TO FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Preparing for renewed international negotiations on cutting levels of heat-trapping gases that may be warming the climate, the United States is proposing that countries get just as much credit for using forests and farmers' fields to sop up carbon dioxide, the chief warming gas, as they would for cutting emissions from smokestacks and tail pipes.
Scientists have known for decades that trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide as they grow and some soils do as well. In theory, pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere would allow countries to emit some heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases without adding to the overall problem. 
 Clinton administration officials and some scientists said last night that incentives to plant trees and to farm in ways that lock away carbon were essential for stabilizing the climate. In addition, they said, bringing farmers and foresters into the battle is likely to be crucial if the Senate, which has so far firmly opposed ratifying any international climate treaty, is to change its view.
But the position is being criticized by some private environmental groups, which have pressed to cut the burning of coal and oil, which caused most of the carbon dioxide buildup in the first place. They point to uncertainties about how long plants and soils could continue to absorb carbon.
And the proposal is at odds with the stance of the European Union which, given its relative lack of open land for tree-planting, would be at a disadvantage.
The State Department laid out the United States' approach in documents filed last night with a United Nations office that is overseeing talks aimed at carrying out the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement aimed at averting any dangerous climate warming. Thirty-eight other industrialized countries were scheduled to file their proposals last night, as well.
The Kyoto agreement has been signed by the United States and more than 100 other countries but has not yet been ratified, and many details remain to be ironed out, with two rounds of negotiations coming in September and again in November.
If the agreement is ratified, the United States would commit itself to cutting its emissions of carbon dioxide by 2010 to 7 percent below the emissions in 1990. Given the growth in the economy and fuel use since 1990, administration officials say, the only way to come anywhere near that target is by adopting every possible strategy, including the agricultural approach.
Vice President Al Gore was deeply involved in crafting the Kyoto treaty and any deadlock in talks would be a blow to him. On the other hand, although Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has said he believes global warming is a significant problem, he opposes ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, saying it would unfairly burden the United States.
White House officials said Mr. Gore was being apprised of the proposed strategy.
Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist of Environmental Defense, a private group, said that whatever program finally emerges in the next rounds of talks, it must not allow any country to get too much credit for things it is already doing, like, for example, planting trees on land that was clearcut several years ago.
"Done well, credit for forests and farming could help jumpstart a solution to the global warming problem," Dr. Oppenheimer said. "Done poorly, it could undermine the credibility of the whole Kyoto agreement."
David B. Sandalow, the assistant secretary of state for oceans and environmental affairs, said the United States would not want any final climate plan to permit loopholes allowing clearcutting or other bad land practices to get credit.
But, taking a position at odds with some environmental groups, he added that the country's position would be to try to get credit for most of the carbon dioxide being absorbed by the country's trees and crops -- about 300 million metric tons a year is the projection for that tally by 2010.
That compares to the projected total emissions of more than 2.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a year from industry, cars and other sources if current energy trends continue, he said.
He added that keeping some focus on farming and trees would keep the cost of fighting global warming down. Estimates are that it will be much cheaper for a country to absorb pollution than to reduce the output of these gases.
"We need strong incentives for parties to adopt practices that protect the atmosphere at low cost," Mr. Sandalow said last night.
Canada, Russia, Australia and other countries with lots of forests and farming are all tending to align with the American position. Also, according to several Japanese news services, Japan last night submitted similar plans, anticipating a large role for tree planting. Its focus is probably not so much on current events but on an anticipated round of talks extending actions on global warming to the third world, where Japan and other rich countries could get credit for investing in forest projects.
Some private environmental groups are vigorously opposing this approach.
Jennifer Morgan, the director of the climate change campaign at the World Wildlife Fund, an international group, said that forests and soils are, at best, a temporary storehouse for carbon, and one that can be broken open by later changes in practices or by unforseen forces like wildfire, droughts, or insect infestations -- all of which could abruptly unlock millions of tons of banked carbon.
"Soil can be a great absorber of carbon, but if you plow too deeply two years in a row you can release it all back into the air," she said. "We need to find the most secure way of reaching these goals, and that is to focus on cutting emissions from things like power plants."
Last night, a White House official said that some environmental groups -- historically focused on cleaning pollution -- were being too inflexible on the issue. "Carbon is carbon, right?" said the official.

With pressure mounting to rid New York City's most troubled schools of uncertified teachers by September, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy announced a plan yesterday to lure experienced instructors from private and parochial schools by increasing the starting salaries they can earn if they transfer into the city's poorest schools.
Mr. Levy's announcement came as a state judge temporarily barred him from allowing unlicensed teachers to work in 99 troubled schools in the coming school year, which begins Sept. 7. The judge, Gloria C. Aronin of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, issued the temporary restraining order yesterday after Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, sued the Board of Education. 
 In court papers, Mr. Mills charged that the board had violated a new state law by hiring nearly 600 unlicensed teachers to work in the 99 underperforming schools, mostly in Brooklyn and the Bronx, last year. Also, he argued, the board did not provide any guarantee that those teachers would be replaced this fall, and that any extra vacancies would be filled with certified teachers.
Mr. Levy said he was surprised by the suit but his new effort to recruit parochial and private school teachers would "go a long way toward solving the problem." The plan, which Mr. Levy negotiated this week with the United Federation of Teachers and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, changes a longtime cap on starting salaries for experienced teachers who transfer into the city schools.
Because of the cap, all certified teachers transferring into the system started out earning a salary commensurate with only five years of experience -- about $39,000 -- no matter how much experience they had. But now, teachers with more than seven years of experience who transfer into the 99 underperforming schools will start out with a higher salary, earning $48,000.
"I think there are a significant number of teachers who would long ago have transferred to the public school system if the economic gain was larger," Mr. Levy said. "Teachers at Dalton, Trinity and Regis who want to help children in need will see this higher-pay package as a way to do the work they love without having to make a financial sacrifice."
Richard Blumenthal, the headmaster at the Dalton School, was out of town yesterday and could not be reached for comment. But other private schools leaders said they did not think that the new salary incentive would be enough to draw private-school teachers into the city's failing schools. "The failing schools that the chancellor needs teachers for are such a different world that I don't think they'd be an attractive option for our teachers," said Dorothy A. Hutcheson, head of Nightingale-Bamford, a private school for girls on the Upper East Side.
Ms. Hutcheson said she was more concerned about losing teachers to suburban public schools, which offer not only much higher salaries but also comfortable working conditions.
Nora Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York's education office, responded angrily to Mr. Levy's plan. Teachers at Catholic schools sign contracts in the spring promising to return the following fall, she said, so the plan is effectively urging them to break those contracts.
Told of Ms. Murphy's comments, Mr. Levy said, "The last I looked it was a free market, and people have the ability to decide where they want to work."
Of the 577 uncertified teachers hired last year to work in the 99 underperforming schools, roughly 250 have been reassigned. The Board of Education has urged the remaining teachers to apply to a new alternative certification program that the state approved last month. But to participate, they would have to pass two state certification exams by the start of the school year.
Many of these teachers have repeatedly failed the certification exams, and state education officials say the alternative certification program will not begin to solve the problem. Besides ordering Mr. Levy to replace uncertified teachers who were hired for the 99 troubled schools last year, Mr. Mills is also ordering Mr. Levy to fill any new vacancies in those schools with certified teachers. Board officials said yesterday that they did not know how many vacancies they would have to fill in September. But last year, there were 1,400 vacancies in those schools, out of a total 6,000 teaching positions.
A spokesman for Mr. Mills praised Mr. Levy's incentive plan for parochial and private-school teachers yesterday, but added that Mr. Levy should consider transferring experienced teachers from other city schools into the 99 troubled schools -- even if they did not want to go.
Board officials say the teachers' contract prevents them from forcing transfers. But Chris Carpenter, the spokesman for Mr. Mills, said the commissioner believed that they could find a way to do it.
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the teachers' union, warned that forcing teachers to transfer to troubled schools would "outrage" parents and compel the teachers to abandon New York City schools altogether. She praised Mr. Levy's plan, but said a better solution would be to significantly raise salaries for all 75,000 of the city's teachers.

HEADLINE: War on Diamonds

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Diamonds have become unfashionable as never before among Western powers struggling to snuff out civil wars in Africa. Appalled by pictures of children with limbs hacked off by diamond-smuggling rebels in Sierra Leone and humiliated when those rebels kidnapped international peacekeepers in May, the United States, Britain and several other countries are making control of the diamond trade a foreign policy priority.
The United Nations recently imposed an embargo on diamonds from Sierra Leone, and the United States is threatening sanctions against other West African countries accused of trading guns for gems. And a consensus has emerged for a strict certification regime to keep the stones that have been used to fuel Africa's civil wars out of the world's jewelry shops. 
 What has been conspicuously missing from all this is international support in the form of money, arms or troops -- to force the rebels in Sierra Leone out of their lucrative diamond mining turf.
"The real critical thing is that someone has got to go in there and get the rebels out," said Ralph Hazleton, a Canadian expert on diamonds who testified today at a United Nations hearing on the diamond embargo in Sierra Leone. "No matter what the international community does, the rebels will always find ways to sell their diamonds. There are a lot of not-so-honest people around."
Evidence of the existence of unscrupulous diamond traders can be found by looking south in Africa to Angola, where the Unita rebel movement, despite a United Nations diamond embargo, has made hundreds of millions of dollars a year by selling stones into the international market.
Robert R. Fowler, the Canadian ambassador to the United Nations and chairman of a committee that investigated violations of the embargo in Angola, has said the embargo did little to put Unita out of the diamond business. Rather, he said, it was a military offensive last year by Angolan government forces that chased Unita away from diamond mines and finally crippled its smuggling operation.
In Sierra Leone, though, military analysts say the government cannot hope to push rebels out of diamond mining areas without substantial help from United Nations peacekeepers or a major injection of military aid from the West.
But American and British diplomats made clear in interviews here today that there was neither the political will nor the money to rout the rebels from Sierra Leone's diamond country.
"We are not working to militarily defeat the rebels," said Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador to the United Nations. "It is unrealistic in the short or medium term to expect that either the Sierra Leone government or the United Nations peacekeepers will be capable of taking over the whole of the country."
Britain, the former colonial power in Sierra Leone, is spending $40 million to train security forces in the country and has plans to supply them with some weapons, Mr. Greenstock said. But he added that British help was not intended to make the government able to go on the offensive.
What the British, the Americans and the United Nations hope to do, then, is to make rebels in Sierra Leone say uncle by applying an economic and political squeeze.
Diplomats said they expect that strict enforcement of the embargo, which has won broad public support from diamond traders, will make smuggling much less easy and profitable than it has been in the past. In recent years the rebels have been making $30 million to $50 million a year from smuggled diamonds, an American official said.
Cracking down on the diamond trade is particularly difficult.
Millions of dollars worth of the stones can be smuggled in a sock, and it is often impossible for experts to determine the country of origin for small parcels of diamonds.
In Sierra Leone the problem is compounded by a long open border with Liberia. American and British diplomats say the Liberian president, Charles Taylor, is a principal player in diamond smuggling. Officials accused Mr. Taylor of formulating military strategy for the Sierra Leone rebels and personally profiting from the sale of illicit stones.
The United States sent an envoy last month to Monrovia, the Liberian capital, to warn Mr. Taylor that unless he immediately halted the trade, he would be subject to American and international sanctions.
But Liberia may have little to lose from sanctions. Its economy is already in ruins from a savage civil war prosecuted by Mr. Taylor. Although it was once the largest per capita recipient of American aid in Africa, Liberia now receives little money from the United States and the World Bank.
Diamonds, in fact, may be more valuable in Liberia than international good will.
An American official said the tiny country exported about $290 million in smuggled diamonds last year, a huge windfall for a near-bankrupt state.
"We have seen no diminution yet between the almost daily contracts between senior leaders in Monrovia and senior leader of the R.U.F.," said Mr. Greenstock, using the acronym for the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone.
Echoing views of American diplomats, Mr. Greenstock predicted that strict enforcement of the diamond embargo would, over time, impoverish the rebels and make them willing to discuss a political settlement.
"You are lowering the price of diamonds going out and therefore de-motivating the R.U.F.," Mr. Greenstock said, adding that there was evidence that the price of smuggled diamonds had fallen 30 percent since the United Nations imposed an embargo on stones from Sierra Leone six weeks ago.
The British ambassador dismissed a comparison to the largely ineffectual diamond embargo in Angola. He said other nations and the world diamond trade were now much more motivated and united in their desire to halt violence in Africa.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 21, 2000, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article on Aug. 2 about diamond smuggling in Africa that finances guerrilla wars included an outdated account of the views of Robert R. Fowler, Canadian ambassador to the United Nations. It was in an interview last February that Ambassador Fowler, chairman of a committee investigating sanctions violations in Angola, said that a diamond embargo against the Unita rebel movement there was having little effect. At that time, he said it was a government military offensive that was crippling the rebel smuggling operation. But in a statement to The Times last week, the Ambassador said the international sanctions had since begun to have a significant effect.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Anarchists of the World, Unite in Your Literary Roots!

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman 

 BODY:
The appearance of some self-proclaimed anarchists among the protesters at the Republican convention is tantalizing but perplexing. With radical effusions so out of style, what are we to make of these figures from beyond the fringe? They summon us back to a time and place when anarchists were taken seriously, Russia in the 19th century, and to the great novelists who grappled with the phenomenon.
As the eruptions on the streets of Seattle and Washington demonstrated a few months ago, any organization that calls itself the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund is a natural target for a radical's abiding animosity toward rich and powerful institutions that impose their will on entire societies. But since the anarchist by definition opposes every sort of system, the word has become identified more with wishful dreams of destroying what exists than with workable schemes to achieve what ought to exist. 
 In his 1964 history, "The Anarchists," (Atlantic, Little Brown), James Joll concluded that while anarchist doctrine draws on political ideas of the Enlightenment, anarchist actions, which are often meant to startle, can be explained "only in terms of the psychology of religious belief." The confrontations, slogans, costumes (black garb enlivened by red bandanas) of today's American-style street anarchists invite a novelist's scrutiny of a temperament that had its most spectacular heyday in 19th-century Russia yet pops up periodically even on these relatively placid shores.
In their literary incarnations anarchists range from murderers to flower children. Dostoyevsky, the pre-eminent psychologist of Russian radicalism, found inspiration for his novel "The Possessed," (renamed "Demons" by its latest translators, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky) in the 1869 murder of a student by a group led by a 22-year-old nihilist, Sergei G. Nechayev. (My dictionary reports that the anarchist believes that all political institutions and existing social arrangements should be abolished; the nihilist, a word that has gone out of fashion, calls for their destruction by terrorism.) The Nechayev trial in 1871, the first public political trial in Russia, supplied Dostoyevsky with many of the characters and elements of his novel, published the following year.
Be they anarchists or nihilists, the radicals do not come off very well in "Demons." Shigalyov, the movement's theoretician in the book, is candid about the dead end of anarchism: "Starting from unlimited freedom, I conclude with unlimited despotism." The Nechayev-like character, Pyotr Verkhovensky, represents the transformation of the ideal of unlimited freedom into anarchic destruction.
The translators sum up Dostoyevsky's take on his characters' radicalism: "Everything is inverted here: freedom ends in despotism, adoration turns to hatred, lucidity increases blindness, the first real act of the liberator of mankind -- Nechayev or Verkhovensky -- is the murder of his human brother. Seeking the greatest good, we do the greatest evil."
Although Dostoyevsky and his foremost competitor, Turgenev, had little in common politically, they shared a mistrust and distaste for the anarchic atrocities and fancies of their time.
Turgenev provided an enduring specimen of what might be called Anarchy Light in Bazarov, who came to personify nihilism, which had a vogue in mid-19th-century Russia. Although Bazarov willingly accepts being labeled a nihilist, he is far too disdainful of any hope for improvement of any sort to become part of any movement.
As he puts it in a running quarrel with Pavel Petrovich, the older-generation liberal, "At the present time the most useful thing is negation." When pressed on what is to be done after the destruction of "everything," he says: "That already goes beyond our task. The first thing is to clear the field."
Call it anarchy or nihilism or just desperation, that is the terrorism of the mind; the payoff is all internal. The politics of Bazarov, by far the most dynamic character in "Fathers and Sons" (or "Fathers and Children," as a newer translation has it), grows out of his sense of his own intellectual superiority. Or, as some psychologist would surely deduce, it is a shield for his insecurity.
Bazarov wins all the arguments with the elderly liberal, but they are essentially rhetorical victories. He patronizes his loving parents, mocks the ignorant peasantry and scorns almost everyone he meets until, in a contrived ending for an otherwise glowingly honest novel, Turgenev has him morally redeemed by love and death.
Still, when it comes to probing the radicalism of his time, Bazarov remains the enduring figure of the self-absorbed radical whose bark is fierce but who has no bite, a specimen not absent among radicals today. It is temperament, not ideology, that holds him back from true anarchy. Although he is politically useless, his heart, to borrow this campaign season's favorite organ, is good. At least you would never find him donning a mask or breaking a window in a demonstration.
There seems to be something about the greatest novelists that is put off by anarchism, whatever its form. In part it may be their own politically conservative inclinations. More important perhaps, for all their differences, writers like Dostoyevsky, Turgenev and Conrad, who inspected the psyche of a bomb thrower in "The Secret Agent," share a need for intellectual organization, which is threatened by ideological chaos. Moreover, they mistrust movements that would force art and politics into utopian abstractions in the name of an illusory freedom. They have history on their side and might make for rewarding reading by today's theatrically inclined protesters.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Use of Steel

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Ford Said to Plan Improved Mileage in Sport Utilities" (front page, July 27), you report that "lighter auto parts are usually more expensive, because they need to be made from aluminum instead of steel."
Over the last six years, the global steel industry has demonstrated the untapped potential of steel to reduce the weight of auto components at no cost premium through its series of "ultralight steel auto body" initiatives. Ford and other vehicle makers have been increasing their use of advanced high-strength steels and processing technologies to save weight, improve performance and safety, and reduce cost. 
 We support the Ford Motor Company in its effort, as we have been supporting Ford and the other vehicle manufacturers in their work to improve fuel economy and lower tailpipe emissions of their cars and trucks.

HEADLINE: On Avenue C, Renewal and Regret

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND 

 BODY:
WHEN the Scottish movie "Trainspotting," about young heroin addicts, hit theaters in 1996, some critics called it an advertisement for drug use. But for the residents of 713 East Ninth Street, just east of Avenue C, the film was an opportunity.
The residents, calling themselves Dos Blockos, were a close-knit group of squatters inhabiting an abandoned six-story tenement that had been stripped of wires, pipes, anything neighborhood addicts could convert to quick cash. When a glossy magazine wanted an appropriately derelict backdrop for a "Trainspotting" photo shoot, the squatters volunteered their homes -- for a location fee of $500 a day. "We used that money to put plumbing in the building," said Dan, who had lived in the squat at the time, and declined to give his last name. 
 It was a funny transaction, the squatters marketing their picturesque squalor in order to inch their building closer to gentility. But such was life on Avenue C in 1996: a push and pull between urban entropy and bootstrap self-improvement, with money conspicuous primarily for its scarcity. While other parts of the East Village were becoming playgrounds for gentrification, Avenue C was still a frontier. "Avenue C was pretty crazy," said Dan, who is no longer a squatter. "But it was also beautiful. People were living outside the rules of society."
Four years since "Trainspotting," that frontier has been redrawn. On a drizzly evening last week, Mark Edio returned to his home at 713 East Ninth Street, the former site of the Dos Blockos squat. But Mr. Edio, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology, was returning to a different sort of home: new sheetrock walls, videophone security and key-card entry to the front door. The floors glistened and the common hallways smelled faintly of renovation. The squatters were gone.
"It's the perfect apartment," Mr. Edio said. As he saw it, the new place was big, it was cheap and it was in a great neighborhood.
He was speaking the new language of Avenue C. Decoded: For roughly 1,000 square feet, on a site until recently deemed not worth maintaining, Mr. Edio and three roommates have just signed a lease for $3,000 a month. It is, they feel, a find.
The story of the Dos Blockos squat and the new, high-priced rentals that are replacing it mirrors the story of Avenue C, a prosaic stretch that once seemed impervious to change. After decades of disregard, the avenue is in a state of rapid, some say rabid, churn. As crime rates have fallen and fortunes risen citywide, the tide of gentrification has pushed eastward, into the shoe-box tenements and worn street life that long resisted its seep. The newcomers are lured not by fixer-upper lofts or brownstones but by the night life and a social swank, and by the diversity they threaten to upset. "Here you've got students, you've got professional people, you've got bums," said Mr. Edio, who moved from Brooklyn's Park Slope. "It's more real."
In storefronts that once housed drug dens, a handful of entrepreneurs are opening smart bistros, bars and cafes. Neat row house co-ops have risen in place of crumbling squats and community gardens. Gone, too, are the cinder blocks that sealed abandoned buildings; behind the new, double-pane windows are tiny one-bedroom apartments renting for $2,000 a month, surprising even real estate agents.
"We started to see people get $500-plus per square foot about a year ago" for co-ops, said Stephen Kliegerman of the Halstead Property Company, or nearly triple what co-ops sold for in the mid-1990's. "This isn't a fringe neighborhood anymore, it's a mainstream neighborhood," he said.
Blocks that long vibrated with the colors and flavors of working-class Latino families are increasingly drawing dot-comers and students, many of whom, like Mr. Edio, rely on family money to pay the new rents, which have doubled in the last five years.
"I have my parents for now," said Meegan Thompson, 22, who moved into a newly renovated building on East Fifth Street between Avenue B and Avenue C in early July. Ms. Thompson, who graduated from Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore., in May, is looking for a job in publishing. "I've worked out the math," she said. To make her half of the $2,050 rent, she figured, she needs to find a job paying $26,000 a year.
Here is another sign of the times: the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center, which provides clean needles and services to drug users, wants to leave the area. "We're looking for a place where our participants won't have to walk past haute couture clothing stores on their way to us," said Drew Kramer, the center's executive director.
Like many long-term residents, Richard Hell, a musician and novelist, has watched with resignation and sadness as more affluent waves of newcomers have moved east. He came to the neighborhood in the early 1970's, attracted by its cheap rents and invitation to creative dishabille. As a member of the bands Television and the Voidoids, he helped draw punk rockers to the East Village, bringing along a swell of anti-gentrification resentment.
"I'm sorry to see my neighborhood turned into a Coney Island boardwalk, Bleecker Street tourist trap, but it is kind of the cycle," said Mr. Hell, whose real surname is Myers. "The kids come in, then the young artists, and they displace the poor. Then they get displaced. To me it's just like the weather by now."
The neighborhood has a history of resisting gentrification, sometimes violently. Twelve years ago this month, locals clashed with police in riot gear over a proposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park. Thirteen police officers and 40 civilians were injured over two days of conflict. Since then, protesters have skirmished with police over the eviction of squatters or the bulldozing of gardens to make room for mixed-income co-ops, some distributed by lottery. The unofficial greeting remains "Yuppie Go Home"
But as the new gentry have pushed east to Avenue C, known locally as Loisaida Avenue, the voices of protest have been uncharacteristically quiet. "A lot of people just accepted that this is like trying to stop a Mack truck," said Lesley Heathcote, a gardener and painter who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years. Ms. Heathcote added, "A lot of people who have come in aren't part of this latest wave but want a more middle-class lifestyle, so aren't going to fight the gentrification in the same way."
Still, locals say the economic gap between new and old residents has never been greater.
Last week, Maizie Torres, 33, reflected on the sweep of transformation along the avenue. Ms. Torres has lived in the neighborhood all her life, and now works for the tenant advocacy group Good Old Lower East Side, or Goles. When she was a teenager, her parents would not let her leave the apartment by herself, she said, because the neighborhood was too dangerous and drug-infested. Now, as a single mother of four, Ms. Torres is relieved that she can let her children go to the store alone.
Though she cannot afford the new cafes, she welcomes her new neighbors. The co-op owners she has met, she said, have adopted the local ethos of community self-improvement.
But Ms. Torres is at best ambivalent about the broader changes in the neighborhood. Her apartment, on East Tenth Street between Avenue B and Avenue C, has for the last 20 years been subsidized under a federal Housing and Urban Development Department program that allows low-income tenants to keep their rents at 30 percent of their incomes; HUD picks up the rest. Ms. Torres currently pays $203 a month.
DURING lean times, when the neighborhood was racked by drugs and neglect, such subsidies were profitable for landlords. But as rents around Avenue C began climbing, they lost their luster.
This year, along with 150 of her neighbors, Ms. Torres received a chilling notice: at the end of October, her landlord, the Center Development Corporation, has the option to drop out of the HUD program. This change would allow it to bring rents up to market rate -- or way beyond the reach of most tenants.
William Hubbard, a general partner at the corporation, says it will probably stay with the HUD program, negotiating higher, so-called mark-up-to-market subsidies from the government. But this possibility offers small comfort to Ms. Torres.
"I don't mind the new people in the neighborhood," she said. "I just have a problem that our landlord made money off this contract for 20 years, and now he thinks it's time for us to get out. Now that the community's cleaned up, we should be able to live in a neighborhood that's cleaned up."
Even where subsidies are not an issue, some landlords are eager to evict low-income tenants in order to raise the rent, said Margaret Hughes, the executive director of Goles. Five to ten families come to the organization daily, "at the precipice" of losing their apartments, she said. The organization can no longer help out families who want to move into low-income housing; it can barely see all the people who are about to lose their apartments.
"There's a lot of animosity toward the new people coming in," Ms. Torres said. "I try to explain that it's not the new people. You can't blame them because they can afford it. We direct animosity more toward the landlords and politicians and the developers."
The changes on the avenue become most striking after dark. A few years back, come evening, the strip was deserted save for the drug traffic and the Latino social clubs. Now, the same sidewalks bustle with well-dressed young people promenading among a handful of new bars and restaurants: C-Note, 9C, Baraza, Esperanto, Alphabet Lounge. Though not the Saturnalian theme park that Avenue B or Ludlow Street have become, the strip of the avenue between Seventh Street and Eleventh Street is evolving into a night life destination.
"I like the ambience over here," said Monica Bhambhani, a New York University graduate student, who was finishing a Pan-Latin dinner at Esperanto. Ms. Bhambhani, who lives near Union Square, found the restaurant through Citysearch.com and thought it might make a good spot for her coming birthday party. "The people here are more eclectic" than uptown, she said. On a Saturday night out with a woman friend, Ms. Bhambhani said, she felt safer on Avenue C than in Midtown.
Dimitri Vlahakis, 34, and Stephan Gerville-Reache, 33, the owners of Esperanto and Baraza, are among the avenue's agents of change. Mr. Vlahakis grew up and still lives in Bensonhurst; Mr. Gerville-Reache grew up in the banlieues of Paris,the blocks of housing projects, built for immigrant laborers, that ring the city.
They were drawn to Avenue C three years ago by the cheap rents and limited competition, but also by the character of the neighborhood: the gardens reclaimed from sites of devastation, the mix of artists, working Latino families and squatters. "It's a real neighborhood, with families and old people," Mr. Gerville-Reache said. "Not like a fake neighborhood like SoHo, where everyone is between 20 and 40."
When they first opened Baraza, they found a sign at a flea market that read, "No Cocaine Peddling." It seemed perfect for the bar. The location, as they understood it, had once been a base for coke dealers. In their first weeks, squatters scrawled anti-yuppie graffiti on the bar's gate. But soon after, the two men noticed the same people coming in to drink, listening as Mr. Gerville-Reache spun salsa music on the turntables. The squatters "were testing us," he said.
The current night life pickings on the strip are just a small sample of what's to come. By fall, at least five bars or restaurants are planning to open, including a spinoff of the popular First Avenue bar D.B.A., which specializes in single-malt whiskeys, and a combination cafe and furniture design studio, which will showcase high-end pieces beyond the means even of the new local swells.
On a recent afternoon, Sylvester Schneider set to work on a mission that seems idiosyncratic even for this neighborhood: Zum Schneider, a traditional Bavarian beer garden, complete with plaster trees. If this is gentrification, it is from within as much as from without. Most of the new entrepreneurs, like Mr. Schneider, live in the area, and struggle under budgets as taut as those of the neighboring households. Ray Deter, a co-owner of D.B.A., lives with his wife and two kids in a one-bedroom apartment off Avenue B and sends the children to the local public school. He said he cannot afford a bigger apartment in the neighborhood. "I'm stupid," Mr. Deter said. "I should have taken a place on Avenue C a couple years ago," before the rents took helium.
The gentrification, though, may be reaching its natural limits. Janet Abu-Lughod, a professor emerita at the New School for Social Research and the author of "From Urban Village to East Village: The Battle for New York's Lower East Side" (Blackwell), has studied the slum properties of the area and feels that the conditions for gentrification -- undervalued properties in a desirable location -- have been overtaken by all the new arrivals. The bargains are now in Harlem, she said.
Even the current veneer of snazz runs shallow, a thing of Sheetrock rather than bedrock, warned Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, a longtime housing advocate in the neighborhood. Business on Avenue C has a rocky track record. Ms. Lopez ticked off the names of several establishments that came and went in the last year. "Turnover continues to create an environment of instability and speculation," she said. "Developers and speculators are getting rich, that's it. It's not the residents, not the small business community."
As for the Dos Blockos squatters, after several losing court battles, they awoke on the morning of April 27, 1999, to a police helicopter and officers in riot helmets coming to remove them from their homes. The encounter was noisy but nonviolent. Dan and several other squatters ultimately ended up in Bushwick, Brooklyn, renovating a loft in another poor, long-neglected neighborhood.
More recently, he decided to leave Bushwick for Harlem, where another wave of pioneers, black and white, are riding another neighborhood through transition.
For Dan, Harlem offers a fresh renewal, but also the start of a familiar cycle -- like Avenue C before it. "I have some contradictions," he said. "I see that my person, my culture, my lifestyle facilitates gentrification. It's like I'm a tool of the system. I don't know what to do. I just live my life the way I live it."
Under his nest of sandy brown dreadlocks, Dan now tends bar at Baraza and Esperanto, where the new gentry of the neighborhood come to make merry. He has become a student of the neighborhood's change. The new apartments at 713 East Ninth, he pointed out, are smaller than those of the squat.
On Avenue C, the cultural mix continues its rock and its roll, listing toward an equilibrium it never quite finds. Mr. Edio and his roommates represent one element, trying to make a home amid the swirl.
The other night, one of the roommates watched someone stealing a bicycle on the street below, but this hardly shook Mr. Edio's regard for his new home. He is planning a trip to Ikea, soon.

HEADLINE: Once-Towering Figure Is Focus of Irish Inquiry

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, July 26

 BODY:
Each weekday morning, he is chauffeured in a pale blue Mercedes to the doors of Dublin Castle. It would seem a fitting mode of travel for a former prime minister of Ireland, a man of regal bearing whose very face, with those hooded eyelids and that dramatic sweep of silvery hair, is as identifiable in this country as the castle itself.
But Charles J. Haughey comes to discuss the state of his financial affairs rather than affairs of state -- from the witness stand, at a tribunal that is exploring the relationship between this once-dominant political figure and various businessmen who, over the years, handed him and his subordinates hundreds of thousands of dollars in checks and cash. 
 The tribunal has estimated that Mr. Haughey (pronounced HAW-hee) received as much as $10 million in contributions to cover his huge debts and expensive tastes, and it is poring over his personal banking records to determine whether he used his public office to benefit his benefactors. Mr. Haughey and his lawyers have not yet addressed the central thrust of the inquiry, but they are expected to maintain that he did nothing untoward for the money, which they will argue totaled no more than $7.5 million.
The seamiest allegations center on a fund that Mr. Haughey established in 1989 to send his political ally and close friend, Brian Lenihan, who has since died, to the United States for a liver transplant. About $100,000 from the fund covered the transplant and related costs, but the whereabouts of at least another $125,000 is unclear -- although there is evidence that some was spent on Mr. Haughey's personal expenses.
The tribunal will ultimately present a report to Parliament that probably will join other efforts to tighten relatively new public ethics laws. Michael Moran, a government spokesman, said that revelations regarding Mr. Haughey and other politicians have already contributed to legislation seeking further reform.
In the meantime, the daily proceedings of the tribunal which began a summer recess on July 28 and will reconvene in September feed a growing list of allegations of public corruption. There are 9 sitting tribunals and 11 other inquiries, investigating everything from the contamination of blood products to decades-old allegations of child abuse in public institutions.
But the most prominent investigation centers on offshore bank accounts, cozy public-private relationships and blurred lines between political donations and personal gifts -- all of which lead inexorably back to this 74-year-old man twirling his gold-rimmed glasses as he ponders embarrassing questions posed in public.
"He is a Nixon figure in Irish public life," said Dermot Keogh, an author and professor of Irish history at National University of Ireland in Cork. "He is a flawed talent."
An accountant from Dublin and the son-in-law of former Prime Minister Sean Lemass, Mr. Haughey rose quickly within the dominant political party, Fianna Fail (FEE-na FALL) to serve in various ministerial capacities in the 1960's. He is credited with several progressive measures, from ensuring that widows and children were included in estate matters to providing free electricity and public transportation to the elderly.
He spent several years in political isolation -- charged with, and then acquitted of, conspiring to import guns to be used in Northern Ireland. But in 1979 he returned, gaining control of Fianna Fail and emerging as prime minister, a position he held, on and off, for nine years. He was both blamed and praised for economic ebbs and flows and is generally credited with jump-starting the Northern Ireland peace efforts.
He seemed larger than life, with a stiletto-sharp intellect, a ruthless political instinct and an imperious nature. While visiting Galway one day in the early 1980's, he tried to scrape a campaign sticker from his shoe. When he failed, one of his ranking cabinet ministers bent down low to remove the annoyance.
"He has this Napoleonic thing; he fancies himself as quite a bit of an emperor," said Ryle Dwyer, a historian who has written several books about Mr. Haughey. "But I would argue that he had this real charisma in the true sense of the word, used for politicians who seem capable of superhuman feats. In Haughey's case, he kept escaping."
Throughout, the matter of his wealth vexed and amused the nation. Mr. Haughey earned a modest salary as a member of the Parliament, yet lived on a Dublin estate, owned a small island off the southern coast, and relaxed on a yacht called the "Celtic Mist."
By 1992, various controversies had become too much for even Mr. Haughey's allies to countenance, and he was forced to step down as prime minister. With characteristic flourish, he said farewell to public life with a quote from "Othello": "I have done the state some service, they know't; no more of that."
But just as Mr. Haughey was settling into his role as elder statesman, the Dunne family, owners of the country's largest department-store chain, became concerned with the spending habits of the company's chief executive, Ben Dunne. Inquiries led to the discovery that over the years Mr. Dunne had given Mr. Haughey a sum now estimated at $2.5 million.
At first Mr. Haughey told an investigating tribunal in 1997 that he knew nothing of the matter and that a close adviser had handled his financial affairs to free him "to devote my time and ability to public life." But the accumulated evidence forced Mr. Haughey to concede that he had misled the tribunal.
Mr. Dunne's testimony of an incident in 1991 was particularly damaging. He said he visited the prime minister and found him looking depressed. To cheer the leader up, he said, he handed him checks totaling $260,000. His recollection of Mr. Haughey's response has since entered national lore: "Thank you, big fella."
Although the tribunal found no evidence that Mr. Haughey had assisted Mr. Dunne in exchange for the gifts, it expressed great doubt about the former leader's testimony. "It is quite unacceptable," the tribunal said in its final report, for an elected official -- particularly a prime minister -- to be "supported in his personal lifestyle by gifts made to him personally."
A criminal charge of obstruction was lodged against Mr. Haughey, and he was forced to pay more than $1 million in back taxes and penalties.
Now another panel is digging deeper into his murky finances to determine whether the showers of money influenced the performance of his public duties.
And so, for the last 18 months, some of Ireland's best-known public figures -- from multimillionaire businessmen to Bertie Ahern, a former Haughey lieutenant and current prime minister -- have made their way up the cobblestone path to Dublin Castle to share their tantalizing pieces of the puzzle.
Even the Haughey faithful have found the revelations unsettling. Testimony has shown that when he was elected prime minister in late 1979, Mr. Haughey and his aides spread the word that he needed money, fast: he owed more than $1.3 million to Allied Irish Bank. Within weeks, he was able to give more than $930,000 to the bank, which charged off most of what was still owed.
A property developer, in typical testimony, testified that he contributed $475,000 to the cause after being summoned by the prime minister to his estate. Another developer testified that in 1989 he handed Mr. Haughey four checks for about $31,000 each -- one for the Lenihan transplant fund and the three others for Fianna Fail. But according to the tribunal, the party received only a portion of the money, and none of it was deposited in the transplant fund.
In fact, testimony has shown that contributions to the Lenihan fund went into a so-called leader's account that Mr. Haughey used for such personal needs as tailor-made shirts from Paris and dinners at an exclusive French restaurant in Dublin. Evidence that Mr. Lenihan's medical costs were fully covered has not created a groundswell of support for Mr. Haughey, no more than have reports that he has prostate cancer.
Professor Keogh, who has written several books on modern Ireland, said the revelations of the tribunal demonstrate the extent to which Mr. Haughey and his allies corrupted the values of a government founded a generation earlier by people who believed in a "communitarian democracy." The country needed to be modernized, he said, "but he did it in a way that weakened and undermined the state of governance, and the citizens' confidence in the government."
Professor Dwyer said, though, that Mr. Haughey is not the first leader to believe that he should focus on public affairs while others tend to his finances. Mr. Dwyer also said that, given the many other cases of political scandal, Mr. Haughey's indiscretions are more symptomatic than causal -- and that Irish politicians have long had the power to enact reform.
"If he has done wrong he should be nailed and, I rightly feel, jailed," Mr. Dwyer said. "I just don't like the hypocrisy."
As others contemplate his legacy, Mr. Haughey comes daily to Dublin Castle and tries when possible to contain the harm already done. At times he has claimed to be overwhelmed by all the paperwork. At other times he demonstrates the acumen for which he was once famous, quibbling with the nuances of certain words -- even the nuances of punctuation -- that appear in old bank memoranda portraying him as an unrepentant debtor who was not above mentioning his station in national politics.
Then, when two hours have elapsed -- a time limit established in deference to his age and illness -- Mr. Haughey is excused. A few minutes later, the blue Mercedes carrying a small man in the passenger seat pulls away from Dublin Castle, whose refurbishment he oversaw when once in power.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell in June; Other Economic Signs Mixed

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell in June to the lowest level in two and a half years as a rise in borrowing costs engineered by the Federal Reserve made it more expensive for people to buy, government figures showed today.
Single-family home sales -- which declined in all regions except the western United States -- fell 3.7 percent in June, to an annual rate of 829,000 units, after falling to 861,000 units in May, the Commerce Department said. 
 In a separate report, the Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators -- a gauge of economic performance over the next six to nine months -- was unchanged in June, the third consecutive month without an increase. The index fell 0.1 percent in May and was unchanged in April.
In the housing sector, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in June was 8.23 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, which buys mortgages. While down from the recent peak of 8.64 percent in mid-May, rates are still above the average 7.55 percent of June 1999. One-year adjustable rates breached 7 percent in June and reached 7.32 percent in mid-July, the highest since 1991.
The June pace of new-home sales was the slowest since an annual rate of 793,000 units in December 1997, the data showed.
Slow sales pushed the median price of a new home down 1.4 percent, to $159,000 in June, from $161,200 in May. The June price was the lowest since $154,900 last August. The supply of new homes for sale rose to 4.9 months, the highest since December 1996, when it was 5 months.
Even with three months of declines, new-home sales are on track to finish the year at 885,000 units, close to the 886,000 sold in 1998, the second-best year on record. The highest was last year's 907,000.
Consumer confidence in July was close to the record reached in May and January. The unemployment rate in June was 4 percent, close to a 30-year low, and a Commerce Department report on Tuesday showed June incomes grew 0.4 percent.
Fed policy makers have raised the overnight bank lending rate six times since June 1999 in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation from rising. They will next meet on Aug. 22 and with housing and manufacturing showing signs of slowing, policy makers could opt to leave rates alone.

HEADLINE: Jorge Flores, 88; Influenced a Coup in Brazil

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Jorge Oscar de Mello Flores, a businessman who worked behind the scenes to influence important political events in Brazil, died on Monday in Rio de Janeiro. He was 88.
Mr. Flores was known for getting business interests to support the military coup that deposed President Joao Goulart in 1964. He later formed close ties with Humberto Castelo Branco, the army general who took control of Brazil's central government. 
 Through a lobby called the Brazilian Institute of Democratic Action, which he formed, Mr. Flores continued after the coup to organize the support of private companies and wealthy individuals for authoritarian rule. The institute is believed to have collected millions of dollars against Communism.
"He was unapologetic in his belief that Communism was a threat to the economic well-being of Brazil," said Maria Celina D'Araujo, a political scientist at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas, an economics institute in Rio de Janeiro. "He took a certain pride in being one of the coup's top conspirators."
Mr. Flores stayed close to General Castelo Branco but fell out with his successor, Gen. Artur da Costa e Silva, in the middle to late 60's. But though Mr. Flores's political influence waned, his economic power did not.
In 1969 he became president of Chase Manhattan's banking operations in Brazil, a position he held until 1992, six years after civilian rule was re-established. He then became president of the Fundacao Getulio Vargas.
Wielding political influence came naturally to Mr. Flores. He was born into an upper-class family in Rio, then Brazil's capital, in 1912. Part of his family descended from Portuguese nobility who arrived in Brazil in 1808.
As a civil servant in Rio in the 1930's, Mr. Flores wove a formidable network of connections, which he later used as a director of the Sul America insurance group. He eventually invested in industrial manufacturing and financial services businesses.
In 1959 he founded Consultec, an economic consulting company, together with Roberto Campos, a leading diplomat and right-wing politician. Mario Henrique Simonsen, perhaps Brazil's most influential economist, became a partner of Consultec at Mr. Flores's urging.
In some ways Mr. Flores was a precursor to the bankers and economists who today shuttle between high-level jobs in Brazil's private and public sectors, said Guilherme Fiuza, an editor of No., an online political and cultural newspaper in Rio.
He was one of the eminences grises who are central to deciphering the workings of Brazilian politics.
For example in the 1970's Mr. Flores, having strengthened his ties with the military government, smoothed Mr. Simonsen's path to the Finance Ministry. He described a 1974 discussion with Gen. Golbery do Couto e Silva, chief political strategist to President Ernesto Geisel: "We discussed the matter and we both decided it would be a great solution for the country," Mr. Flores said of Mr. Simonsen's appointment.
Mr. Flores is survived by his wife, Wanda Dias Flores, a daughter and a grandson.

The 30-year bond received a reprieve yesterday, and its fate is now probably in the hands of the next administration.
In its announcement of the details of its quarterly auction of Treasury notes and bonds, the government did not put the 30-year bond, the onetime benchmark for Treasury interest rates, on the endangered species list, a development that surprised some investors. 
 But some longtime bond market analysts, who have been reluctant to believe that a president and Congress could keep government surpluses running long enough to pay down most of the government's $3 trillion of publicly held debt, now think that the demise of the 30-year bond is nigh.
It is now possible, said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, to say that the public debt will shrink so much in the next few years that the only bonds that might be left will be those hoarded by investors unwilling to sell them back to the Treasury.
The reason for this is the sheer size of the government surplus, which is now forecast to be $211 billion in the 2000 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, and $228 billion in the 2001 fiscal year.
About a month ago, President Clinton announced that the projected surplus for the 2001 through 2010 fiscal years would be slightly less than $4.2 trillion. Of that, $2.3 trillion is expected to come from the Social Security system and the rest, almost $1.9 trillion, from general tax receipts. Both Democrats and Republicans consider the Social Security surplus off limits for tax cuts or spending programs. So that leaves $1.9 trillion to finance the tax cuts and spending increases that the two parties will fight over.
What makes the demise of the 30-year bonds more plausible is that it is not practical to sell them when the publicly held debt could be eliminated in just more than a decade.
So the pressure on the 30-year bond has been growing since last August, when the Treasury first announced it was considering buying back some of its longer-term debt and would reduce the amount of 30-year bonds it issued.
The actual buybacks began early this year, and so far the Treasury has repurchased $17.5 billion of bonds with remaining maturities of 15 to 25 years. By the end of this year, the total should approach $30 billion, with two buybacks of $1 billion to $3 billion each month.
And some investors apparently thought that the Clinton Treasury, in an effort to highlight its success in wiping out government deficits and starting to pay off the public debt, would have announced the next step for the 30-year bond yesterday. When they were disappointed, the price of the 30-year bond dropped a full point as its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 5.79 percent, from 5.72 percent on Tuesday. The bond rallied late in the day and finished down 18/32, to 106 30/32, with the yield at 5.76 percent. The 10-year note rose 2/32, to 103 26/32; its yield fell to 5.97 percent from 5.98 percent on Tuesday.
The announcement these investors were waiting for was that the Treasury would actively consider no longer issuing 30-year bonds, similar to the announcement it made in May about one-year bills.
Gary Gensler, the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, said there was no need for any significant change either in the Treasury's reduced pace of issuing new Treasury bills, notes and bonds, or in its plan for buying back existing debt. He said the reason was the large amount of government debt that the Treasury had paid off so far -- $360 billion over three years -- and the fact that the amount of maturing Treasury debt was still high next year, $464 billion, and the year after, $382 billion.
One small change announced was that the Treasury would now include callable Treasury securities in its buyback program. A callable security can be repurchased on demand by the Treasury at a certain date before its maturity. The Treasury also said it would buy back securities with remaining maturities of 10 years or more.
With the 30-year bond down to new issuance of just $15 billion a year -- $5 billion of that next week -- a decision on its fate cannot be far.
Mr. Gensler, however, said yesterday that it was Treasury policy "to give the market ample notice should we decide to eliminate or curtail a particular issue."
We will continue to follow that practice," he said.
So it is likely that the next administration will decide the fate of the 30-year bond. The current one has one more chance, at the next quarterly news conference announcing Treasury intentions, on Nov. 1, the Wednesday before Election Day.

Standard Chartered, Short of Forecasts, Will Cut Staff by 20%

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Standard Chartered P.L.C., a London-based bank with most of its operations in Asia, announced a severe global cutback today that will eliminate 5,000 positions, or about 20 percent of the staff, to help lower costs.
Such cuts, which tend to increase a company's stock price, have been made by other big banks worldwide. But Standard Chartered's cutback was coupled with an announcement that its earnings in the first half of the year had been lower than expected, and the bank's shares fell here today by more than 10 percent, losing 98 pence to close at 8.52, or $12.71. 
 Standard Chartered said the cost-cutting, to include a streamlining of its data-processing centers, would itself cost $715 million in severance and other expenses. It is projected to produce savings around $105 million next year and $255 million annually from 2003 onward.
The bank said 6,000 jobs would be eliminated and 1,000 others created. Of the special expenses, about $150 million will be used to integrate Grindlays Bank, which Standard Chartered bought for $1.3 billion in April as part of a planned Asian expansion. The company said the purchase made it the leading international bank in southern Asia.
Though it does relatively little business in Britain, Standard Chartered has operations in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, India and other parts of Asia, where recovery from the financial crisis of 1997-98 has benefited banks there, such as the rival HSBC, by making it easier for individuals and companies to repay loans.
But while HSBC reported a better-than-expected increase of 31 percent in its first-half profit this week, Standard Chartered's profit increase seemed less robust. Investors compare the two banks because of their similar emphasis on emerging markets -- shielding them somewhat from the rough-and-tumble competition of retail banking in Britain.
Standard Chartered said the Asian recovery had allowed it to set aside less money for potential bad debts -- equivalent to $246 million compared with $360 million in the period last year. This saving increased first- half profit 25 percent above the level of a year earlier, to the equivalent of $346 million. Analysts, though, had forecast a 31 percent increase.
Rana Talwar, the bank's chief executive, maintained that the job cuts had been under consideration for 18 months and would affect personnel throughout the bank's operations. The reductions matched job cuts by banks in the United States, Britain and Germany, reflecting competitive pressure that make traditional banking operations less profitable.
In the United States, the Bank of America has said that it will reduce its work force by 9,000 to 10,000, and Dresdner Bank of Germany is eliminating 5,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force. Barclays Bank recently stirred protests from British customers and politicians with plans to close scores of small branches.

CROATIA: MISSION TO WASHINGTON
The new, democratic leaders of Croatia have been granted the official visit to Washington that the late president, Franjo Tudjman, was never allowed. President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivica Racan, opposition leaders elected this year, arrive on Monday for meetings with President Clinton and other administration officials. They have moved Croatia away from Mr. Tudjman's strident nationalism and closer to Western aims in the Balkans, but face huge fiscal problems and unemployment. Steven Erlanger (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: GOOD NEWS FOR PETS
Fifteen rabies-free islands -- including Australia, Japan and Hawaii -- will be added to the "pet passport" program that allows cats and dogs to enter Britain without being quarantined for six months. The program got under way in February, beginning with 22 rabies-free European countries. Each passport certifies the pet has a microchip implant verifying its identity and that it has been vaccinated and tested. Other regions will be considered for inclusion in the program in the near future, including the continental United States. (AP) 

POLAND: WALESA UNDER SCRUTINY
Lech Walesa, founder of the Solidarity movement that toppled Polish Communism, was in court for the second time in a week fighting allegations by a political opponent that he lied about past ties with the secret police. Mr. Walesa is among a dozen contenders in presidential elections who, under a new law, must file statements disclosing whether they collaborated with the Communist-era police. Anyone caught lying can be barred from running. Mr. Walesa has repeatedly denied the allegations. (AP)
 
FRANCE: CONCORDE INQUIRY
Transport Minister Claude Gayssot called a meeting for today to update all parties involved in examining last week's Concorde crash on progress of the investigation and to look at new safety measures that might enable Air France Concorde flights to resume. French Concordes have been grounded since the July 25 crash, which killed 113 people, but British flights have continued. (Agence France-Presse)

VENEZUELA: PROTESTS EASE
Disturbances over disputed regional election results died down despite continued vote-rigging allegations by candidates opposed to President Hugo Chavez. Mr. Chavez, who won re-election in Sunday's vote, sent troops to quell protests after his alliance won governorship races in most of the country's states. But there was no sign of a repetition of the violent clashes between pro- and anti-Chavez groups that left one person dead and nine injured on Tuesday. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: REBEL CLASHES
Two Iranian soldiers were killed in clashes with the outlawed opposition People's Mujahedeen, which also left several rebels dead and wounded, the official IRNA news agency said. It said the Iraq-based rebels mounted a mortar attack along the region of Dehloran bordering Iraq and tried to send fighters into Iranian territory. (Agence France-Presse)

CHINA: U.S. PORT CALL
A United States Navy cruiser arrived in Qingdao for the first port call by an American warship in China since NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia last year. The visit by the cruiser Chancellorsville is part of a gradual revival of military ties, which has included a visit to Beijing last month by William S. Cohen, the U.S. defense secretary. (AP)
 
HONG KONG: MIGRANT PROTEST
Angry migrants from mainland China set a fire inside Hong Kong's immigration headquarters after being refused papers that would have allowed them to remain in the former British colony. Forty-six people were injured in the blaze, which erupted after the migrants doused the 13th floor with a flammable liquid. The right of mainland Chinese to live in Hong Kong has been a volatile issue since Beijing overturned a local court ruling that granted residency to some migrants. Mark Landler (NYT)

NIGERIA: HOSTAGE DEAL
Royal Dutch/Shell officials said that armed youths agreed to free the 165 hostages they had been holding on two oil rigs since Monday. The oil company said it would meet with representatives of the youths on Aug. 15 to discuss their demands, which included jobs. (Reuters)
 
NIGERIA: ISLAMIC LAW WIDENS
A sixth northern state, Jigawa, has decided to introduce strict Islamic law later this year. The move to extend Shariah has divided the mostly Muslim north from the strongly Christian areas in central Nigeria, and created political problems for President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian. (Agence France-Presse)
 
BURUNDI: CAMPS SHUT
Authorities have finished dismantling 30 "regroupment camps" into which 350,000 civilians were moved last year, according to the governor of Bujumbura Rural Province. Older camps in other parts of the country housing more than half a million people displaced by Burundi's seven-year-old civil war were not included in the operation. The government justified the camps by saying they would allow the military to better deal with the rebels, but international aid agencies said their aim was to cut off villagers from the rebels.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
A Doctor Says He Can Cure His Party's Ills

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
THE doctor will see you now. So will the only undisputed homegrown Democratic candidate for United States senator from New York.
Gosh, they're the same chipmunk-cheeked guy, and neither one oozes schmooze. They're operating out of the same Park Avenue war room, a minimal space with an ominous screen for viewing X-rays, a manila folder for keeping track of campaign promises and, in the tradition of doctors' offices everywhere, the sound of toilets being flushed as you cower in the visitor's chair awaiting news about that orthopedic surgery. 
 But no need now for Dr. Mark S. McMahon, 38, to drum up his bedside manner -- possibly a good thing, as rumor has it that this is not a strong suit with him, except when he's home tending to his three children. Two of whom -- honest! -- attend P.S. 6, one of the city's A-list public schools.
Our topic is the doctor's obsession: politics, apparently a moth-to-flame thing with him ever since he was elected homeroom president back in elementary school. And even if Hillary Rodham Clinton, wearing the party's halo, treats Dr. McMahon like a nebbish -- ignoring his debate invitations and pretending he's polling-place toast -- he's got news for her.
He's officially on the ballot and sticking around until the Sept. 12 primary; maybe longer. Sure, he thinks it's fishy that there are suddenly four other insurgents on the ballot, none of whom scraped up the required 15,000 signatures, all of whom could undermine his effort to monopolize the anti-Hillary vote.
But his mother, Eva, a retired nurse, and his father, Tom, a semi-retired dentist, didn't scavenge the malls and Home Depots of Long Island helping him collect those 44,107 signatures for nothing. So regardless of the decision on his court challenge to the validity of the other party-crashers, he's forging ahead with his no-frills, no-television-commercials, $200,000 (more or less) campaign to heal what ails the Senate by sending it a physician, not another lawyer.
He doesn't drink, smoke, curse, golf, or philander. (Does this fellow really meet the qualifications to be a Senator from New York?) He's never been arrested, and the closest he's come to the fast track is skipping the 8th and 11th grades at Fordham Prep in the Bronx.
"Maybe that's my problem a little," he says about being on the cusp of nerddom. "I may be just sort of, ah, insipid in that sense. I don't know. I just felt I owed it to my parents to lead sort of an exemplary life."
Meet candidate McMahon, the Harvard-educated doctor, vanity-published medical-thriller author and self-confessed goody-two-shoes who insists that not only is candidate Clinton not the people's choice ("I'm shocked at the level of anti-Hillary sentiment that exists") but that she's absolutely the wrong candidate to combat Rick Lazio ("My biggest gripe with Hillary is that because of her, this seat may end up in Republican hands. Giuliani is replaced by an understudy candidate of limited distinction, and now he's seven points ahead of the other candidate, the most famous woman on the planet, quote, unquote," he sputters.)
HIS handshake is a limp one, but don't hold that against him. Maybe he's saving strength to wield his scalpel -- he's already done six operations today and, like a savvy politician who blueprints names and faces, he demonstrates total, if a tad disinterested, recall. One carpal tunnel release, two tumor removals (benign), three knees scoped. The usual stuff. Frankly, after seven years in private practice, he'd rather be in the Senate making policy than renovating bone matter. He would, he says, be a leader in health care reform, but not a one-issue automaton, not with that 1985 degree from the London School of Economics.
The McMahon mission in a nutshell: expanded Medicare and services for the elderly; increased research on AIDS and cancer; gun control; capital punishment; rent control; higher minimum wage and teachers' salaries; the sovereignty of Israel's borders. He opposes prayer in public schools, school vouchers, late-term abortion, gay marriage, eliminating affirmative action.
He did not take a cram course on the issues: this is stuff he thinks about all the time.
So far his patients haven't rebelled at his alternate career: "But I could imagine somebody saying 'I want to go to someone who all he thinks about is scoping knees, not this guy who's running for Senate, too.' "
Dr. McMahon refuses to attack Mrs. Clinton's political platform (he's waiting for the debate that he says she owes the state's 4.9 million Democrats) and slyly says they even have something in common: "Neither one of us has held office." But he makes short work of Mr. Lazio: "He's the un-Hillary. What does he stand for? What's his rationale? For example, about Israel, where's he been on that? My sense of him is that there's no there there."
Enough air time for Rick Lazio. Let's talk about Mark McMahon. What do you do for fun? "Spend time with the kids," he says. "I can't understand parents who all they want to do is get away from their kids." His are 6, 5 and almost 1 and unaware that daddy is running for Senate. He is, he adds, opposed to "using them as campaign props." And his wife, Lynne, a radiologist at Bellevue Hospital Center, is "apolitical," so he expects no stumping from that quadrant, either.
"She'll probably vote for Hillary," he says. It's his first, and last, joke of the day.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Next Speech

 BODY:
When Gov. George W. Bush addresses the Republican Convention tonight, in the most important speech of his career, he will face an oddly difficult challenge of his own making. For four days Philadelphia has echoed with uplifting talk about diversity, inclusion, family values and "compassion." Last night the vice-presidential nominee, Richard B. Cheney, added a strong dose of partisan combativeness by turning Vice President Al Gore's 1992 attack line -- "It's time for them to go" -- back on the Democrats. But what is still missing is any discussion of the specific policies and programs that Mr. Bush intends to present to the country. Even Republican policies that the delegates hold dear -- tax cuts, distrust of government, privatizing Social Security -- have scarcely received mention from the podium. Mr. Bush's task tonight is to go beyond broad themes and begin to add some substance to this campaign.
To be sure, passionate generalities about leaving no child behind and restoring American military strength are part of an honorable tradition of political oratory, and it is heartening to hear a leading Republican emphasize government that cares. But after four days, one has a right to expect something more nutritious. One of the few speakers to make a clear policy point in Philadelphia this week was Gen. Colin Powell, who supported affirmative action for minorities -- a policy the platform rejects. Republican opposition to abortion, gun control, campaign finance reform and the rights of patients to sue health maintenance organizations are core items on the party's agenda. They have hardly been mentioned from the podium in Philadelphia. 
In shunting aside the party's traditional wedge issues in favor of pleasing banalities, Governor Bush's political strategists are no doubt confident in their political judgment. Even the seasoned movement conservatives who support Mr. Bush are withholding their criticism, apparently certain that hiding their positions in a fog of generalities is the right way to go this year.
But it should give Republicans some pause that the convention's television ratings have slipped sharply, perhaps because viewers have not encountered much in the way of ideas and policies. Mr. Cheney, for his part, did raise the energy level by showing how the Bush-Cheney ticket will use the attack-by-comparison to tie Mr. Gore to President Clinton and attempt to discredit both. Wheeling out what will probably be key words of the fall campaign, Mr. Cheney called Mr. Bush "a man of principle, a man of honor" who will "restore decency and integrity to the Oval Office." He also placed the lightly experienced Texas governor in a G.O.P. leadership pantheon of Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.
The Cheney performance cut against Mr. Bush's assertions that he does not like attack politics, although he is likely to salt his own speech tonight with language designed to remind voters of the Clinton administration's ethical problems. But it is also time for Mr. Bush to begin leveling with Americans on what he plans to do. He could start by laying out exactly why the economy needs the proposed 10-year, $1.9 trillion tax cut that would start in 2002 and eat up the federal surplus. It may sound odd to say it, but the time has come for Republicans to stand up for what they believe.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Build Plant in Suburb Of Buffalo, Saving 600 Jobs

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
General Motors will build a $500 million high-tech engine manufacturing plant at its complex in the Buffalo suburb of Tonawanda, saving 600 well-paying jobs through the largest private-sector investment in western New York State in many years, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday.
Had the company chosen to build the plant in another state or in Canada or Mexico, something state officials said G.M. had been considering, it would have been a major blow to the Buffalo area because the 600 blue-collar jobs would have been phased out from the Tonawanda complex's 3,800 existing jobs. 
 As it is, the Buffalo metropolitan area's unemployment rate was 5 percent in June compared with a 4.3 percent rate statewide. And as the economy has been booming, the Buffalo area has been adding jobs at a much slower rate than the state has over all. In the 12-month period ending in June, the number of jobs in the area increased by 2,300, or 0.4 percent, the lowest job growth rate in any metropolitan area in the state. The job increase rate statewide was 2.1 percent.
"The threat was very strong to move the 600 jobs," Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said in an interview. Among the other options, officials said, were the 10 other engine plants the company has in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
State and General Motors officials said the Tonawanda site was selected for the plant partly because of what Mr. Gargano called the state's incentive package, which included a commitment to spend $9 million to upgrade streets around the site and water and sewage facilities. They also cited an agreement permitting more flexible work rules that G.M. reached with the union.
The Tonawanda complex produces four-, six- and eight-cylinder engines, and Mr. Gargano said that G.M. planned to phase out some of the old production lines there. The plant to be added at the site is intended to produce a six-cylinder, all aluminum, inline engine that will be used in a wide variety of G.M. cars and light trucks.
Construction of the new plant is to begin later this year, and the plant is scheduled to begin operation in early 2003. Mr. Gargano said the construction alone would provide 600 jobs in the building trades.
The Tonawanda supervisor, Ronald H. Moline, said that the G.M. engine complex had been a "vital part of our industrial base for more than 50 years," in which thousands of area residents had been employed at well-paying jobs. "This expansion," he said, "will add stability to our industrial base and to the lives of thousands of families."

HEADLINE: 10th Anniversary of Iraqi Invasion Is Marked Quietly in Kuwait

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, Aug. 2

 BODY:
It took Iraqi tanks just a few hours to invade this small, oil-producing country 10 years ago. Since then, determination by Kuwait and its neighbors never again to be so vulnerable has changed the Persian Gulf's political landscape.
Shortly after a United States-led coalition liberated Kuwait in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the country signed a 10-year defense pact with Washington. Similar agreements followed with Britain, France and Russia as well as a defense agreement with other gulf states. 
 "I feel that Kuwait is one of the safest countries in the world," said Abdul-Mohsen Jamal, a member of Parliament, a decade after the day Kuwaitis call "Black Thursday" -- Aug. 2, 1990.
The day passed quietly with no official functions to mark the anniversary. Kuwait also does not mark the anniversary of its liberation on Feb. 26, 1991, out of respect for the families of the hundreds of people still missing since the days of Iraq's occupation.
Thanks to billions of dollars that Kuwait had stashed away from oil earnings, physical scars of the invasion have been removed. Blazes in oil wells that were set afire by retreating Iraqis were extinguished. Equipment looted from government offices, the university and hospitals has been replaced.
However, Kuwait's 2.3 million people, most of them guest workers, are still shocked that one Arab country would take over another overnight.
"Our wounds have not healed," said the editorial of a special issue of the daily Al-Anba to mark the anniversary.
Kuwait and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar -- established a nucleus of a common army in a mutual defense pact. But it is clear they believe their real defense lies in their relationship with the United States.
Iraq's aggression led neighboring Saudi Arabia to allow in some 500,000 foreign troops, most of them American. The legacy of that decision is still felt politically and economically in the kingdom.
Western pressure helped edge Saudi Arabia's King Fahd to decree some limited political reforms, the $60 billion bill helped drain the Saudi kingdom's reserves, and the presence of foreign troops gave birth to a fundamentalist Islamic opposition.
In Kuwait, Abdullah al-Shayeji, a political scientist, said his government is spending 25 percent of its annual budget on security, in addition to some $12 billion earmarked for defense after Kuwait's liberation.
Muslam al-Barrak, a lawmaker and former union leader, counted additional costs: He expected his country to remain under American pressure to support the Middle East peace effort.
As for Iraq, Kuwaitis say enmity between neighbors cannot go on forever. Some predict a day when the two countries will reconcile and perhaps join economic forces.
Yet, Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, remains in power, and Iraq has not accounted for 605 Kuwaitis and citizens of other countries who disappeared during the occupation.
Baghdad says it has released all war prisoners, and in recent years has accused Kuwait of withholding information on the fate of 1,150 Iraqis who disappeared during the crisis. Kuwait says it cannot be held responsible for them at the time when Iraqi authorities ran the country.

California Short of Power In an Age of Deregulation
Four years after it led the nation into a deregulation of the electric industry, California is at the brink of a breakdown in its power supply. The nation's most populous state nearly ran out of power for the third consecutive day.
What disturbs California utility executives and regulators is that this week's crisis has come even though none of the state's power plants or transmission lines has failed, at a time when temperatures around the state have been hot but hardly extraordinary. The state's power supply simply can no longer keep up with peak demand, they warn. Page A1.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA ON EDGE OF FAILING TO MEET ELECTRICITY NEEDS

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Four years after it led the nation into a sweeping deregulation of the electric industry, California is at the brink of a breakdown in its power supply.
Yesterday, as a heat wave caused electric demand to soar across the West, the nation's most populous state nearly ran out of power for the third straight day. To reduce the strain on California's electric grid, regulators ordered utilities to curtail supplies to big commercial users that have agreed to cut their electric consumption in times of shortage. 
 Still, the state was on the verge of imposing rolling blackouts of homes and businesses. That step has been taken only eight times around the country in the last 17 years, usually because of extreme weather or power plant failures, says the North American Electric Reliability Council, which supervises the Canadian and American power grid.
What disturbs California utility executives and regulators is that this week's crisis has come even though none of the state's power plants or transmission lines have failed and temperatures around the state have been high but hardly extraordinary.
In the last decade, demand for power surged along with the California economy. But utilities, fearing they would be unable to recover their costs as the state moved away from regulations that guaranteed them profits, stopped building power plants, leaving the state's power supply simply no longer able to keep up with peak demand.
California's electric industry has reached the "ragged edge" of failure, said Robert D. Glynn Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the PG&E Corporation, whose Pacific Gas & Electric unit delivers electricity to more than 13 million people in Northern California. "There's just barely enough supply to go around."
So far this summer, the California Independent System Operator, a non-profit state-chartered agency that manages the electric grid, has scrounged enough power each day to meet demand. So the lights have stayed on, except for a blackout in San Francisco in June related more to local transmission problems than the statewide shortage.
But with supplies exceptionally tight, the wholesale price of power has soared in the state. That has caused electric bills in San Diego, where the retail price of power now fluctuates directly with the wholesale market, to more than double, stirring consumer anger and calls for the industry to be reregulated.
The supply of electricity is also tight in New York State and New England, which have had spot shortages this year. Nationally, power reserves have steadily decreased since 1992, with the electric industry in the midst of a transition from a network of local monopolies with fixed prices and guaranteed profits to a competitive marketplace with prices set by supply and demand.
But a surge in plant construction -- in response to soaring market prices and projections of growing demand -- seems likely to ensure that supplies and reserves will begin to increase next year in most of the nation.
"The system is tight around the country, but there's been an enormous supply response," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, president of Enron, the Houston company that is the world's leading trader of electricity and natural gas. "In the next year or two, in most parts of the country, there will be surplus capacity."
Mr. Skilling said he believed the market would provide the reliable power supply once assured by regulatory fiat, with higher prices encouraging both construction of plants and conservation by users.
In the early 1990's, with deregulation looming and Southern California stuck in a recession, utilities stopped building new plants; none have been built in the state for more than a decade.
California's economy has surged in the last five years, a boom led by Internet and high-technology companies, which are voracious power users. And growth is even more vigorous in the Pacific Northwest, Arizona and Nevada, making it harder for California to import the power on which it has relied.
The California Energy Commission, a state agency that licenses new power plants and predicts the state's energy demand, says California has a 10 percent reserve margin for this summer's expected peak electric demand, assuming all plants and transmission lines are working perfectly.
But plants and transmission lines often run at less than their theoretical capacity. As a result, the state's reserve power margin has already fallen below 5 percent a half-dozen times on hot days this summer, prompting the Independent System Operator to declare a Stage 2 alert and begin cutting power to big customers like the state's big aerospace companies, that agree in advance in exchange for lower rates. On Tuesday, the tightest day this summer, the reserve margin fell to 3 percent at 3:30 p.m.
The state's reserve has remained above the critical 1.5 percent margin that would trigger a Stage 3 alert, in which the Independent System Operator orders utilities to begin rotating blackouts. How long the blackouts last would depend on how much demand needed to be curtailed, said Ron Low, a spokesman for PG&E.
Mr. Low said the utility would try to keep blackouts to less than two hours. As a general rule, utilities try to avoid cutting power to essential public services like hospitals and police departments, and attempt to give warnings of any blackouts to people with medical needs that could be affected by a loss of electricity.
In the control room of the Independent System Operator, in a heavily secured building in Folsom, about 30 miles northeast of Sacramento, the atmosphere was businesslike yesterday as two dozen operators tapped at their workstations, regulating the flow of power around the state. Above giant computer screens on the walls of the room, a digital readout displayed the total megawatts being consumed on the grid from moment to moment. It hovered above 42,000 megawatts, just below yesterday's peak of 43,500.
But the apparent calm was misleading, said Terry Winter, the agency's president and chief executive. Mr. Winter said the state's supply crisis has caused generators to defer needed maintenance, increasing the chances that a plant would fail -- which could plunge the grid into chaos.
California's supply crisis will not ease anytime soon, says the California Energy Commission, the state agency that licenses new plants. Four new plants are under construction in the state, with two expected to be online by the end of next summer. Several more plants are in development. But with peak electric demand predicted to rise at least 2 percent next year, the energy commission is predicting the situation will worsen before it improves.
"The squeaking gets tighter in 2001," said Daniel Nix, deputy director for energy information. If next summer is even slightly hotter than normal, he added, "there is a good chance we would have inadequate resources."
Already, wholesale power prices have shot up in California this summer. At the California Power Exchange, a nonprofit, state chartered company where utilities and power producers trade most of the state's electricity, prices this summer have regularly spiked above 40 cents per kilowatt-hour, more than 10 times normal.
Most power customers remain insulated from the price roller coaster. With retail rates fixed by regulators, the state's two biggest utilities, PG&E and Southern California Edison, which serves 11 million people in the Los Angeles area, have absorbed the summer price spikes, expecting to make up the difference when the wholesale price drops this fall.
But in just two years, California plans to deregulate retail prices for PG&E and Edison customers. And in San Diego, where retail prices have already been freed to match market rates, a doubling of electric bills this summer has prompted some politicians and consumer groups to call for price caps or reregulation of the industry.
John Bryson, chairman of Edison's parent company, Edison International, said that consumers and small businesses might never be ready for fully deregulated power prices. Electricity is such a vital part of modern life that most customers "are not going to order their lives and shouldn't be asked to order their lives looking at the meters all the time," Mr. Bryson said.
State Senator Steve Peace, an architect of deregulation who is calling for new controls on the industry, said tight price caps were necessary in the short run because generators of electricity had too much leverage to set prices. Producers "shouldn't be able to extort whatever price they can get at any moment," said Mr. Peace, a San Diego Democrat.
On Tuesday, the Independent System Operator, under pressure from Senator Peace and Gov. Gray Davis, voted to cut in half, to $250 per megawatt, the maximum price it can charge utilities for power purchased from the agency's pool.
But some experts warn that fiddling with a partly deregulated market can have unintended consequences. Because the agency's market has price caps, utilities in the state have leaned on it to meet demand, trimming their purchases from the much larger pool run by the Power Exchange, which has no price caps.
As a result, the agency's engineers have had to make a daily scramble for thousands of megawatts -- increasing the chance of a system collapse, said Camden Collins, who quit the agency's board last month to protest the caps.
"Manipulating the wholesale market, in my opinion, threatens the reliability of the entire western region," Ms. Collins wrote in a memorandum that accompanied her resignation.
Yesterday, Governor Davis asked the state's attorney general to investigate whether the wholesale market was being manipulated.
Other experts warn that price caps will discourage power generators from building the plants that California needs.
"We've started down this path of creating markets for this electricity, and if we stop, we'll be in the worst of all possible worlds," said Eric Hirst, a utility consultant in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Meanwhile, with the threat of blackouts rising along with the temperature, there are shorter term fixes in the works.
In San Francisco, PG&E has asked regulators for permission to place a floating power station in San Francisco Bay with enough generating capacity to power 95,000 homes. Some environmental groups have posed objections to the plan; a decision by regulators is expected by the time the barge arrives in the bay next week.
If the station is rejected, PG&E has a Plan B for preventing power failures, the company's chief executive, Mr. Glynn, said, "Everyone will pray that the weather doesn't become extreme."

HEADLINE: Two Charged in '99 Stabbing Death of Student in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By SHAILA K. DEWAN and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
In a murder case that drew national attention but seemed to be growing colder by the month, the police have charged two men with the fatal stabbing of Amy Watkins, a 26-year-old graduate student, on a Brooklyn street a year and a half ago.
The man who police say did the stabbing, David Jamison, 27, admitted his role in the killing in a videotaped statement and was charged with first-degree murder, a senior law enforcement official said. 
 The other man, Felix Rodriguez, 20, was charged with second-degree murder because he helped Mr. Jamison rob Ms. Watkins and the robbery led to her murder, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman. Both men were also charged with first-degree robbery and weapons possession.
Mr. Jamison has a record of more than half a dozen arrests, mostly for petty crimes and drugs and once for robbery, the police said. He was arrested yesterday about 11 a.m. at his home, 126 Sterling Place in Park Slope, mere blocks from where the stabbing took place.
A third man, Pierre Antoinne, 26, an unemployed house painter, was being questioned by the police, his relatives said yesterday. In his statement, Mr. Jamison said that the two men were present during the robbery and killing, law enforcement officials said.
After the stabbing, on Park Place in Prospect Heights on March 9, 1999, the police were left with a highly publicized crime and few clues. There were no known witnesses, and because the killer had apparently concealed the large carving knife in a white plastic bag during the attack, no fingerprints were left behind.
More than six months after the robbery and killing of Ms. Watkins, who had moved to New York from Kansas to attend the Hunter College Graduate School of Social Work, investigators reported that despite thousands of hours of work, their leads had dwindled to zero. Their only hope was that the killer would turn himself in, commit another crime in front of witnesses or tell someone about the stabbing. A $10,000 reward went unclaimed.
The police said that hundreds of people had been questioned, but that Mr. Jamison's name had never come up. At various times, the police theorized that the crime could have been committed by a homeless man or someone who knew her, according to a senior investigator.
Finally, detectives got a break, an investigator said yesterday: in recent days, Mr. Jamison talked about the case, and word got back to detectives through an informant in another part of the city and a tip to the police Crime Stoppers hot line.
News of Mr. Jamison's arrest came as a surprise to Ms. Watkins's friends and family, many of whom said they had given up hope that the killer would be found.
"I think we'll have feelings of reawakened grief," said Lawrence Watkins, her father, a history teacher at the Dominican Academy on East 68th Street in Manhattan.
Adam Green, Ms. Watkins's boyfriend at the time of her death, said he had moved out of the neighborhood where she was killed. He said he had thought the police would never find a suspect. "A good part of me hoped it would stay that way," he said. "I was not in need of a name and a face, because that wasn't going to change anything for me."
In its brutality and apparent randomness, the killing of Ms. Watkins was the kind of homicide that had become increasingly startling with the declines in reported crime in New York City. That was one reason it drew national attention and tabloid headlines. Ms. Watkins's dedication to helping others, particularly women who were victims of violence, and the shock that the killing sent through the newly gentrified area near Prospect Park made the story even more compelling.
On that cold March night, Ms. Watkins, described by a classmate as "a soldier of social work," was on her way home from the Bronx Community Center where she worked with battered women. As she walked down her quiet street, neighbors heard two screams, and found her less than two blocks from her apartment with a knife in her back, surrounded by fallen groceries. Her purse was later found near Washington Avenue.
The police said their initial suspicion, that the motive was robbery, was borne out yesterday.
Detectives John Barber and Robert Rivera were able to draw the confession out of Mr. Jamison, an investigator said.
According to his statement, investigators said, he and the two other men were sitting in a luncheonette on the southeast corner of Flatbush Avenue and Park Place when they saw Ms. Watkins walk by laden with shopping bags and decided she would be "an easy mark."
Mr. Jamison approached Ms. Watkins from behind while, investigators believe, the two other men were in front of her. After Mr. Jamison stabbed her, the three fled in different directions.
Mr. Jamison apparently claimed to police that the stabbing was unintentional. "He's got some story that she moved backwards onto the knife," a senior investigator said, "which is inconsistent with the wounds."
Three relatives of the men who were waiting in the lobby of the 77th Precinct station house last night said the men had nothing to do with the murder.
Veronica Corea, 25, Mr. Jamison's sister-in-law and Mr. Rodriguez's sister, acknowledged that Mr. Jamison had been in trouble with the law -- he has prior arrests for robbery, petty larceny and drug-dealing -- but she said that he was not violent.
"Everyone makes a lot of mistakes, but he would never take it to that level," she said. "Just because a brother hangs out in the street and smokes a little weed, he's a killer? Come on."
Ms. West, a cashier at the Yankee Stadium box office, said that her brother was not capable of murder.
"He's an idiot and a moron, but he wouldn't be able to do that," she said. "If you knew my brother, he's a real coward. He doesn't have the heart to do that."
The police had said that Mr. Rodriguez, a warehouse worker who lives on Prospect Place not far from the murder site, was talking to investigators last night, but that Mr. Antoinne was not. Mr. Antoinne, a Haitian national, began serving a state prison term for an attempted drug sale in 1995. On Jan. 25, 1996, state records indicate, he was paroled to the United States immigration service. A police investigator said that Mr. Antoinne might have been deported to Haiti under a special program and then might have returned, on his own and illegally, to the United States.
When the stabbing occurred, it drew focus to a rapidly changing neighborhood. Some said that professionals who had recently moved to Prospect Heights had chosen to overlook the rougher areas of the neighborhood at their peril.
But old residents as well as new mourned the loss of Ms. Watkins.
Janet Abdelmegeed, 47, a waitress who has lived for 13 years in the building where Mr. Jamison was arrested, said yesterday that she was shocked to learn that a neighbor was a suspect in the killing. She said she had attended a candlelight vigil for Ms. Watkins. "I remember when that little girl died," she said. "Who couldn't cry over that?"

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: IN CONTEXT;
Promises of Changes, But Unspoken Details

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 2

 BODY:
It is all so murky, the rhetoric here, that you might think yourself back in the presidential campaign of 1952, when Dwight D. Eisenhower promised, "I shall go to Korea," but supplied no details about what he would do to end the war once he got there.
Or maybe 1968 or 1972, in the heyday of Richard M. Nixon, another campaigner often short on specifics. Confident that he was well ahead of Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, he told the nation he would end the war in Vietnam, but he never bothered to say what he had in mind. Four years later, more confident, he stayed off the stump, running the first Rose Garden campaign. 
 This year, en route to nomination for president, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has hammered the Clinton administration's foreign policy, suggesting that it has been inept, ill-focused and lacking in priorities.
In a speech in Washington on May 23, he said that "the world has changed faster than United States policy" and called for a fresh approach to nuclear weapons and a more comprehensive missile defense system. At other times he has hinted he would spend less energy on humanitarian missions and more on dealing with great powers like China and Russia and on shoring up America's alliances.
But the first three nights of a Republican convention that Mr. Bush had promised would lay new ideas before the American people, including a night designated as an occasion to discuss national security, produced few details of what a Bush administration might do overseas. The speeches have been vague even by the lax standards of convention oratory, an art form that was tailor-made for bloviation.
Most of what has been said dealt with Mr. Bush's personal qualities, not with policy -- grist for People magazine, not Foreign Affairs.
"No specifics, no nuance," said the historian Michael Beschloss. "I think the lack of content may be unprecedented. They argue that Bill Clinton paid less attention to foreign policy than any president since Herbert Hoover, which may be fair. But they have given no example here of how they would lead or where they would go."
It may be that Mr. Bush himself will fill in the gaps when he appears before the convention on Thursday night. But if so, he will change the pattern that has emerged this week.
On Monday, Colin L. Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff during the war in the Persian Gulf, talked almost exclusively about domestic affairs, including the ills afflicting urban areas, the need to pay more attention to the education of the nation's children and the problems of minorities. Only at the end did he look overseas, assuring the delegates that Mr. Bush "will not repeat the mistakes of the past and let our insurance policy, our armed forces, fall into disrepair."
Tuesday's speeches consisted mostly of similar generalizations.
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded American troops in the Middle East during the war, said that American military strength had withered since then. But he gave no prescription for rebuilding it, except to voice a wish for "another commander in chief named George Bush with Dick Cheney on his team." Mr. Cheney, nominated tonight as Mr. Bush's running mate, served as defense secretary during the war.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, whom Mr. Bush defeated for the nomination, said that Mr. Bush "knows well that there is no safe alternative to American leadership, and he will not squander this unique moment in history by allowing America to retreat behind empty threats, false promises and uncertain diplomacy" -- an indirect indictment of Mr. Clinton, presumably, but one unaccompanied by even shadowy proposals for policy initiatives.
Mr. Bush's main foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was only slightly more forthcoming. She said that Mr. Bush would not regard the American military as "a global police force" without a clue as to where and under what circumstances troops should be used; she promised that Mr. Bush would move at the earliest possible date to institute "the deployment of effective missile defenses," without saying when that might be, and asserted that Mr. Bush "recognizes the challenge the Chinese government poses to our interests and values," without outlining how that challenge might be met.
Much of what she said sounded like cheerleading, as when she praised Mr. Bush -- "the George W. Bush that I know" -- as a man of "uncommonly good judgment" who is "focused and consistent" and knows "that we Americans are at our best when we exercise power without fanfare and arrogance."
Tonight, Mr. Cheney joined in the chorus, praising Mr. Bush in his advance text as "a man who has the courage and the vision and the goodness to be a great president." Big changes, he said, are coming to Washington, following eight years of "squandered opportunities." He did not name them.
Aside from promising, like almost everyone, to devote more resources to the military, Mr. Cheney concentrated on life at home. He talked about education and Social Security and working with Democrats to end the air "of bitterness and ill will and partisan strife" in Washington, but not about Europe or Asia.
Like Mr. Clinton eight years ago, Mr. Bush began the campaign with an inconvenient dearth of foreign policy experience. Like Mr. Clinton, and unlike Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic rival, he has no service in Vietnam to dwell upon with pride.
Early on, Mr. Bush surrounded himself with an impressive array of national security experts, most of them veterans of past Republican administrations, including Ms. Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Robert Zoellick and Richard Perle. (The notable exception is James A. Baker, one of his father's secretaries of state, whose performance in his father's unsuccessful 1992 campaign the younger Mr. Bush has often faulted).
In a "coming-out" speech at the Ronald Reagan Library near Los Angeles on Nov. 19, George W. Bush won good marks for what most experts considered a polished performance. His choice of Mr. Cheney lent the ticket further heft on foreign policy.
But there remains a long list of issues on which the delegates, and those across the country following the convention in the news media, have so far heard little. Among them are strategies for dealing with the intractable problems of Russia and China, the issue of expanding NATO farther into Eastern Europe, the manifold complications of expanding free world trade and the doubts that surround the present requirement that the Pentagon be prepared to fight simultaneous wars in two different theaters of war.
There are divisions within the Republican party on issues like Kosovo that have yet to be resolved.
If Mr. Bush leaves too much unspoken for too long, he may hand Mr. Gore a significant opening. Mr. Gore, after all, has had broad experience in foreign policy matters, first on Capitol Hill, then in the White House. And while the Clinton administration has had its flops overseas, in places like Africa and Haiti, it has also recorded significant achievements, particularly in peace efforts in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
But then, Mr. Bush may have decided that too much talk about foreign policy is bad business. He has talked often to friends and acquaintances about his father's loss to Bill Clinton eight years ago, when the elder Bush focused on foreign affairs and the Arkansas neophyte emphasized the economy.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Bulldozer and Cash for Canadian Press Baron, but Hold the Sunset

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: MONTREAL, Aug. 2

 BODY:
So what is Conrad Black going to do with his bags of money now that he has sold most of the crown jewels of Canada's newspapers in one fell swoop?
"Do you remember that cartoon character, Scrooge McDuck?" Mr. Black said, answering a question with a question. "Do you remember how he used to get into his little bulldozer every morning and plow back and forth over his gold coins? Well, maybe I will just sit and look at it for a while." 
 Looking back to 1969 when he bought a tiny English-language paper in Quebec, Mr. Black, now 55, said, "I started in this business 30 years ago with an investment of $500."
Returning to the present, he said of the deal announced this week: "It was time in the history of my country, and time in my own history, to make things shipshape, to get rid of the debt, to get a bit of a cash box to work from, to enjoy life a little more."
Few pundits in newspapers today predicted an easy-chair life for Mr. Black, a Napoleon buff who has run his newspaper empire from a chair once owned by his military hero. As Mr. Black trims his sails in North America -- a sale of his community papers in the Chicago area is believed to be imminent -- Canadians believe he will turn his energies to Europe.
A holder of dual British and Canadian citizenship and owner of The Daily Telegraph of London, Mr. Black could seek out new European investments for the company that on Monday bought most of his Canadian newspapers, the CanWest Global Communications Corporation, now Canada's largest media company.
Commenting extensively about the deal for the first time since it was announced, Mr. Black said in a telephone interview Tuesday night that the sale to CanWest would leave his company, Hollinger Inc., on a solid financial footing. "We will go from $1.7 billion in debt to zero plus $500 million in cash, perhaps a bit better than that," he said.
Noting that Hollinger stock had bounced back from depressed levels in recent months, he said he was selling his newspapers "fairly close to the top of the economic cycle."
Mr. Black also justified his heavy sell-off here, saying he was "overexposed in Canada." In a separate interview with The National Post, his Toronto-based newspaper, Mr. Black added, "The reputation of Canada is not particularly great among American investors."
Although Americans have poured billions into the Toronto Stock Exchange this year, helping it to rise faster than the New York exchanges, Mr. Black said his pool of buyers was artificially limited by Canadian laws that discourage foreigners from buying Canadian newspapers. Noting that Canada is essentially off limits to American newspaper chains, he complained, "With these ridiculous foreign-ownership rules in Canada, you can't get much equity."
Israel Asper, the chairman of CanWest, has predicted that the editorial line of his newspapers will be "balanced," a word rarely found in the lexicon of Mr. Black, a crusty, conservative press baron who has been described by detractors as a thesaurus that walks like a man.
In response, Mr. Black snorted at newspaper characterizations of Mr. Asper as a "social democrat," saying that he and his new business partner see eye to eye on economic issues and recalling that he first met Mr. Asper 25 years ago when he was writing a personal tax column for The Winnipeg Free Press. Questioned further, he acknowledged having had "a bit of wrestling match with Izzy" over The National Post, which in less than two years has established an intellectual beachhead for conservative, free-market changes in Canada.
After the wrestling was over, ownership of The National Post was split 50-50 between the two business groups. Mr. Black, who is to be chairman of the newspaper for five years, says it sells 330,000 copies daily.
"Under our arrangement, he has no ability to change it," Mr. Black said of Mr. Asper and the editorial line of The Post, which has become a cheerleader for the Canadian Alliance, the nation's new tax-cutting party. Asked if the editorial line would change, he stressed: "Zero, nothing, not one millimeter."
But leaders of Canada's ruling Liberal Party, frequent target of criticism from the editorial pages of Mr. Black's newspapers, were elated at news of the purchase by Mr. Asper, a longtime centrist Liberal.
Calling the sale "the best news they had had in a long time," Lawrence Martin, a Southam News political analyst, wrote from Ottawa of the Liberals: "Even a measured neutrality will be viewed by the prime minister as a major plus over the treatment he felt he was receiving before the newspaper sale."
The government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien has not given the slightest hint that it will move to block the sale.
Toronto is home to one of the toughest newspaper wars in the English-speaking world, a three-way battle among The National Post, The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star. On Tuesday, The Globe and Mail printed on the top of its front page a large full-color cartoon of Mr. Asper grinning and preparing to dine on a prostrate Mr. Black, who was depicted stuffed and spiced, with a sprig of parsley in each ear. The headlines read: "Asper: Mogul and a half" and "Black: Only half a mogul."
Despite its gloating, The Globe and Mail now stands alone, virtually the only major English-language Canadian newspaper that does not have ties to CanWest, which has a Canadian network of television stations broadcasting coast to coast.
After a day of reflection, The Globe and Mail came out today with an editorial salted with crocodile tears and headlined: "Black to fade."
"Since Canada does not have so many larger-than-life characters that it can afford to lose any of them cheerfully, the notion of a vanishing Conrad Black is rather affecting," the editorial said. In a service to readers, it warned that some Canadians "will experience the disorientation that follows the abrupt end of a toothache."

HEADLINE: General Motors Raises Stakes in Fuel Economy War with Ford

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: PONTIAC, Mich., Aug. 2

 BODY:
General Motors challenged Ford today to a battle over which company can deliver bigger improvements in fuel economy, particularly for sport utility vehicles, the least efficient vehicles of all.
Ford committed itself last week to improve the average mileage of its sport utility vehicles by almost five miles a gallon over the next five years. General Motors announced today that no matter how much Ford improved the energy efficiency of its sport utilities by 2005, G.M.'s sport utilities would average even more miles to the gallon by then. 
 The announcements affect half of all the sport utilities sold in the country -- about 800,000 by each automaker.
G.M. also upped the ante, saying that the overall fuel economy for all its light trucks -- a category including minivans and pickups as well as sport utilities -- would be better than Ford's in 2005.
"G.M. will still be the leader in five years, and in 15 years for that matter," said Harry Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman, at a news conference today in this Detroit suburb.
Ford vowed last week to raise its sport utilities' mileage by 25 percent, from a little over 18 miles a gallon now. Ford also said that it would improve the fuel economy of its minivans and pickups, and planned future announcements to give more precise figures, after performing additional engineering studies. Mr. Pearce's comments today effectively pre-empted Ford's next move, by committing G.M. to exceed in average light truck fuel economy whatever Ford does. The world's two largest automakers make nearly half the nation's minivans and pickup trucks.
Automakers have been trumpeting the occasional fuel-economy improvement in various models for years, but have typically offset these gains by making other vehicles more powerful and less efficient. The G.M. and Ford announcements are the first instances of big domestic automakers committing themselves voluntarily to significant increases in the average fuel economy of large classes of vehicles.
Why, after merely two decades of no significant improvement in the fuel economy of light trucks, are G.M. and Ford reversing course? Both companies said their market research had found growing interest in better fuel economy. Foreign automakers are stepping up their sales of sport utilities and showing that they do not have to be gas guzzlers, partly because the foreign brands are often based on lightweight car underbodies instead of cheap but heavy pickup truck underbodies. G.M. and Ford also worry that the government might require higher fuel economy; the automakers helped narrowly defeat such a plan in Congress two months ago.
But another big reason for G.M.'s declaration seemed to be a nervousness that last week's news conference by Ford had burnished Ford's reputation for environmental responsibility, which might help Ford sell more vehicles. "What annoys me is the perception that seems to come from that press conference that Ford is somehow the environmental leader," Mr. Pearce said.
Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said last week that the planned improvement in fuel economy would save the typical sport utility customer about 1,700 gallons of gasoline, or 80 trips to the gas station, over the first 10 years of vehicle ownership. The effect on the nation's overall oil imports and emissions of global warming gases, while small at first, would grow as the more efficient models gradually replace the behemoths now on the road.
DaimlerChrysler and Asian automakers declined to join Ford and G.M. in promising fuel-economy gains, saying that they already had better gas mileage, partly because they did not sell models as big as the Ford Excursion and the G.M. Chevrolet Suburban. "We'll let them do the tit for tat," said Michael Aberlich, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman.
Michael Love, Toyota's national regulatory affairs manager, said the Japanese automaker would focus on the gas mileage of individual models. "We'll try to have class-leading fuel economy in every segment we're in," he said.
Environmentalists hailed G.M.'s position. "That's huge -- Ford placed its bet and G.M. anted up and we've got a real race here," said Jason Mark, the transportation co-director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Like Ford last week, G.M. said today that it would improve fuel economy without resorting to the auto industry's favorite loopholes in the 1990's: building vehicles so heavy that they are exempt from federal fuel-economy rules, and claiming gas mileage credits for vehicles that have the capability to burn either gasoline or nearly pure ethanol, even though ethanol is not available in most of the country. G.M. also said that, like Ford, it would achieve almost all of its improvement through changes in conventional gasoline-powered engines, rather than by switching to potentially dirty diesel engines or introducing partly electric engines for which consumer demand is unclear.
G.M. provided more technical details than Ford, saying it planned to change all of its big V-8 engines over the next several years to use a technology tried in desperation and abandoned during the depths of the oil crisis that followed the Iranian revolution in 1979. The technology involves turning off four of the engine's eight cylinders except when maximum power is needed for acceleration or towing.
This approach was discredited when G.M. tried it in the early 1980's because the engine controls then were slow to sense changes in the driver's need for power, so there was a long lag when drivers tried to accelerate. The latest microprocessors adjust the number of cylinders in use faster than a human being can appreciate the change, said Stephen G. Poulos, a G.M. engineer.
G.M. also said it would introduce in some of its light trucks a technology known as a continuously variable transmission. This replaces a conventional four-speed automatic transmission, and is in use on a few very small cars, mainly overseas. But the technology, which allows gear changes that are undetectable to drivers, has been improving lately for use on larger vehicles.
Mr. Pearce also displayed a large pickup truck and a city bus that were each powered by a hybrid system of a gasoline engine and an electric motor. The hybrid pickup truck will be 15 percent more fuel efficient than current models and the hybrid bus will be 50 percent more efficient. Many electric vehicle enthusiasts say that even bigger efficiency gains will be possible, and that hybrid systems could someday reduce considerably the nation's energy needs.
But G.M. is concerned that customers may take a while to accept hybrids as household vehicles, and is not counting on hybrids to play more than a very small part in its overall improvement in light truck fuel economy by 2005, said Jeffrey Kuhlman, a G.M. spokesman.
Mr. Pearce said G.M.'s current sport utilities go 6 percent farther than Ford's on a gallon of gasoline, on average. He did not promise that G.M. would beat Ford by a similar percentage in 2005, raising the possibility that G.M. could keep the lead but improve its fuel economy by a little less than Ford's 25 percent.
Ford officials said they were unsure whether G.M.'s current sport utilities were ahead in fuel economy. In midmodel year reports to regulators on the 2000 model year, G.M. and Ford have both reported that their light truck fleets are averaging 20.9 miles a gallon.
But Ford welcomed G.M.'s overall willingness to compete on fuel economy. "It's good for the ecology; it's good for the customer," said Ken Zino, a Ford spokesman.
Mr. Pearce, who has overseen public policy and technology issues at G.M. for four years, mentioned repeatedly today his irritation at the attention that Ford had received for its commitment to greater fuel economy at a news conference in Washington last week. He chided Mr. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, for having flown to Washington to make his announcement at the National Press Club. "We've got them beat in S.U.V.'s and they know it, and maybe that's why they felt compelled to be in the Press Club," he said, speaking at G.M.'s Truck Design Center here.

HEADLINE: Chairman of Con Ed Blames Power Producers for Rise in Electric Bills

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
For customers in New York City and Westchester County, trying to get a candid explanation for a sharp increase in electricity rates has been a complicated game of who's to blame, with the parties involved pointing fingers at one another. The explanation was no less elusive yesterday as state legislators questioned regulators, power producers and Consolidated Edison.
One thing, however, was clear from yesterday's hearings: regardless of who is at fault, customers have made it clear in a flurry of complaints that they are fed up. 
 All told, the average electricity bill for New York City and Westchester County residents this summer is expected to be 30 percent more than last summer's average, officials said. The average June bill jumped 43 percent compared with last year, city officials said.
But Eugene R. McGrath, the chairman and chief executive of Consolidated Edison, pleaded with legislators to stop looking to his company for answers. Since deregulation began in New York State, Mr. McGrath noted, Con Edison has been forced to sell most of its power plants and no longer controls the cost of producing power, the part that he said has caused customers' bills to increase.
Blaming the new Con Edison, he said, was akin to getting upset with the delivery man when a farmer decides to double the price of milk.
"Our rates are going down," Mr. McGrath said, noting that Con Edison's part of the bill, which covers distribution of the electricity, has decreased 17 percent since 1980. "On the supply side, rates are going up, and I think we need to better understand what is going on in the market."
Legislators said they were concerned that businesses would soon be passing on the cost of higher electric rates to their customers. Officials from the National Supermarket Association said that those costs would be likely to show up on grocery bills.
"No one can absorb such a large increase in their electricity costs and not pass it on to consumers," said Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for the National Supermarket Association, a group of independent grocery stores in New York.
Legislators expressed concern that the higher costs could mean the loss of electricity for poor, elderly and disabled people who are unable to pay. Yesterday, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who last month called for the hearing, said in an interview that the "spike threatens the economic and physical health of New Yorkers."
While legislators grilled officials and tried to place the blame on Con Ed and the Pataki administration's oversight of deregulation, conspicuously absent from the hearing was the group that might be able to explain the increase in rates: executives from the companies that produce power. A legislative aide who insisted on anonymity said that the executives were invited only at the last minute, adding that the misstep was a sign of how even legislators were even struggling to grasp how the new system works.
Under deregulation, Con Ed was forced to sell most of its power plants to unregulated companies that could set prices based on market rates. Con Ed now makes money by transmitting power from the plants to customers. The higher costs are on the generation side, which is now virtually unregulated.
Mr. McGrath said that he did not know why power providers, who own the plants, had increased prices. He said it appeared that the higher costs of gasoline and oil, fuels used to run most power plants downstate, explained about half the rise. But it is unclear what is causing the rest of the increase, Mr. McGrath added.
Representatives of the power providers did not explain the increase other than to say that demand was outpacing supply.
Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the State Public Service Commission, defended the Pataki administration's oversight of deregulation. She and Mr. McGrath said that the Legislature must encourage the building of new power plants.
"Just as increased supply reduces the price for milk, oranges or telephone service, the placement of power plants in New York City will reduce upward pressure on prices and increases the reliability of the city's supply," Ms. Helmer said.

To the Editor:
To increase the diversity of the presentations, the organizers of the Republican National Convention selected some speakers largely on the basis of their sex or skin color (front page, Aug. 1). When a university or a company or a government agency does this, Republican leaders call it affirmative action and condemn it. How paradoxical it would be if this hypocrisy won them the election.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE NOMINEE;
BUSH-CHENEY TICKET NOMINATED AND THE ATTACKS ON GORE BEGIN

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Burning to reclaim the White House after eight years on the outside, the Republican Party tonight nominated George Walker Bush for president and sent forth his running mate with the most stinging and unabashedly partisan assault of the convention.
Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush's No. 2, said the election of Al Gore would perpetuate what he called the misguided policies of President Clinton. 
 "We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine," Mr. Cheney said. "But the wheel has turned." Excerpts, Page A28.
Then, appropriating Mr. Gore's 1992 campaign slogan as his own, he said, "It is time for them to go!"
In the ritual roll call, the 22 votes from Mr. Cheney's home state, Wyoming, cast at 10:04 p.m. gave Mr. Bush more than the 1,034 votes needed to grasp the nomination. The hall erupted in a prolonged ovation as jubilant delegates, many of them dancing, were awash in a sea of beach balls, confetti and balloons.
The delegates, who had heard three nights of sunny, even apolitical, speeches, roared in delight as Mr. Cheney directed full-throated taunts at the Democrats. But with Mr. Cheney's mild and even-toned delivery, his punch lines did not carry the same weight on television.
Casting aside the high-minded oratory that had marked this convention, Mr. Cheney portrayed Mr. Gore as mean-spirited by reviving former Senator Bill Bradley's pungent dismissal of him six days before the New Hampshire primary: "A thousand promises. A thousand attacks."
Mr. Cheney, defense secretary under former President George Bush, said he was lured back into public service because of his belief in Governor Bush and his fear that Mr. Gore's election would perpetuate everything that he believed was wrong with Mr. Clinton's stewardship.
Drawing a contrast with Mr. Bush's achievements as governor of Texas, Mr. Cheney contended that the Clinton administration had made no headway on Social Security, taxes or military readiness.
Mr. Cheney's address capped Mr. Bush's night of triumph, which had been honed for weeks, if not months. It was a political and emotional peak for the two-term governor, one-time baseball team owner and son of a former president who did not appear on the public stage until he first won election in 1994.
Just eight years ago, Republicans nominated Mr. Bush's father for a second term, only to have their president ousted by Bill Clinton. But tonight, Mr. Cheney told the 2,066 delegates that the era of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had been one of dashed hopes and squandered opportunities.
Mr. Cheney depicted Mr. Gore as intimately connected to an administration mired in scandal, and he sought to turn Mr. Gore's attacks on Mr. Bush's "risky tax scheme" back against the vice president.
"In this election, they will speak endlessly of risk," Mr. Cheney said. "We will speak of progress. They will make accusations. We will make proposals. They will feed fear and we will appeal to hope. They will offer more lectures and legalisms and carefully worded denials. We offer another way -- a better way -- and a stiff dose of truth."
Mr. Cheney's comments left no doubt that despite his mild-mannered demeanor, the Bush campaign intended to employ him in the somewhat traditional role of running-mate-as-attacker. In his acceptance speech four years ago as Bob Dole's No. 2, Jack F. Kemp was far more restrained; he mentioned Mr. Clinton only once, and his sharpest words were casting Democrats as "elitist."
But Mr. Cheney picked up a mantle that has been carried in the past by Bob Dole and Mr. Gore himself.
The speech by the vice-presidential nominee is typically delivered on the closing night of the convention -- and is usually overshadowed by the one delivered by the head of the ticket. But by giving Mr. Cheney his own night, the campaign was able to showcase Mr. Bush's running mate.
And though Mr. Bush had planned the break with tradition well before Mr. Cheney was chosen, the move offered the public an opportunity to take a measure of a man who has been out of the public eye since leaving the Pentagon eight years ago after playing a crucial role in the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Cheney's speech provided delegates with yet another reason to revel in a quadrennial gathering that has been remarkably devoid of controversy, in public at least.
After his defeat to Mr. Clinton, former President Bush was shunned at many Republican events. But this week, delegates expressed supreme confidence that his son was their best hope to retake the White House.
For the third night in a row, the former president sat through the proceedings, logging more time there than many delegates. At the very end of the night, he smiled and sang along as Lee Greenwood appeared on stage to sing what had been Mr. Bush's campaign anthem, "I'm Proud to Be an American."
The one somber note on what was the most festive night thus far was the health of former President Gerald R. Ford.
Mr. Ford, who had delighted party loyalists on Tuesday night when he appeared on the floor as part of a tribute to past Republican presidents, was admitted to a hospital here today after suffering at least one minor stroke.
At the start of his speech, Mr. Cheney, who had been Mr. Ford's chief of staff at the White House, passed on his wishes for "a quick and speedy recovery." After serving with Mr. Ford, Mr. Cheney was elected as a congressman from Wyoming, rising to the rank of Republican whip.
While acknowledging that Mr. Cheney's speech was the most hard-edged of the convention, Mr. Bush's aides insisted that it did not violate their pledge to keep the discourse from Philadelphia largely high-minded and positive.
"The secretary's speech sets a new tone," said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. "It draws contrasts with Vice President Gore, but far more respectfully than typical politicians."
Mr. Bush had said to expect some barbs aimed at Mr. Gore. Yet some passages in Mr. Cheney's speech veered closely to the personal, especially those that linked Mr. Gore to Mr. Clinton.
"As the man from Hope goes home to New York," Mr. Cheney said, "Mr. Gore will try to separate himself from his leader's shadow, but somehow we will never see one without thinking of the other."
Then he added, "Does anyone, Republican or Democrat, seriously believe that under Mr. Gore the next four years would be any different from the last eight?"
Several delegates welcomed Mr. Cheney's speech as crucial to counter the Democrats. "After putting up with the president and his lies for eight years, this was a breath of fresh air," said John Enriquez, a delegate from California.
Carolyn Shinke, a delegate from Dayton, Ohio, put it this way: "Mr. Cheney had to say the things that had to be said tonight. We all know the details, and it is not easy to listen to. But the record had to be set straight at this convention; this aggressive message had to come out."
In the eight days since Mr. Bush named him as his running mate, Mr. Cheney has found himself largely on the defensive, fighting off attacks by Democrats that his voting record was too conservative for most voters. They concentrated on his opposition to the Head Start preschool education program and his votes against a ban on armor-piercing bullets.
Yet in his speech tonight, Mr. Cheney did not even allude to the controversy -- or his own ideology -- and instead took the opportunity to say glowing things about his former boss, then-President Bush, and about the president's son.
Governor Bush -- who arrived in Philadelphia today after a six-day tour through six states carried by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore in 1992 and 1996 -- took to the sprawling stage at the convention hall this afternoon to run through his acceptance address for Thursday night.
Expressing, perhaps, Mr. Bush's disdain of long-winded addresses -- and perhaps his own self-assuredness -- his aides said that his acceptance speech might well be the shortest in years.
Karen Hughes, the campaign's communications director, told reporters that, allowing for applause, Mr. Bush's speech would last roughly 38 minutes. In contrast, acceptance speeches by President Bush in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996 each ran 57 minutes.
Beyond the effort tonight for Mr. Cheney to extol Mr. Bush's virtues, the program was intended to highlight the Republican Party's signature economic issue: tax cuts.
As throughout the convention, the focus was on portraying the party not as one of plutocrats -- as Democrats have long sought to label it -- but as a party of working people.
To drive home the point, speakers included a Hispanic small-business owner, Hector Barreto, who spoke of how Mr. Bush would help entrepreneurs by cutting the burden of taxation and regulation, and Kim Jennings, a single mother, who discussed how the tax plan would help her edge toward the middle class.
Democratic officials countered that the Republicans were trying to obscure the fact that Mr. Bush's tax-cut proposals would disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
And Mr. Gore's aides pressed their case that the Republican tax cuts passed this year by Congress and those proposed by Mr. Bush would both endanger the nation's newfound fiscal health and the economy's long-term prospects.
The very theme of the Republicans' evening, "prosperity with a purpose," contained a tacit acknowledgment that the economy is hardy, a fact that could ultimately be expected to help Mr. Gore.
When Mr. Bush arrived at the airport here this morning, he received a red-carpet welcome, replete with a fife and drum corps and a replica of the Liberty Bell, which he gonged. Then he was off to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for what was billed as a Hispanic welcome event.
Mr. Bush was introduced by his Hispanic-American nephew, George P. Bush, who asked the crowd, "Are you excited about electing a president who represents the diversity of our society?"
The governor and his wife, Laura, then appeared with Senator John McCain and his wife, Cindy. Mr. Bush praised his once-bitter foe -- who had paid tribute to him at the convention on Tuesday -- as a "living example of duty, honor and country."
He added, "Senator, I can't wait to campaign with you all across our country."

HEADLINE: Grand Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, 92, Is Dead

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

 BODY:
Grand Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, a Holocaust survivor whose gentle charisma nurtured the exuberant postwar rebirth of the Bobov Hasidic sect in Brooklyn and around the world, died at Maimonides Medical Center yesterday after a long illness. He was 92.
A regal-looking man with a great silver beard and horn-rimmed glasses, Rabbi Halberstam was known for his love of dancing with the Torah and for his artful way of sidestepping the internal squabbles that plague other Hasidic sects. 
 But his enduring accomplishment, Judaic scholars say, was rebuilding the Bobov sect, a group of Jews based in southeastern Poland that was nearly exterminated by the Nazis during World War II.
Under about 50 years of his consistently conciliatory leadership, the Bobovers became the leading Hasidic group in Borough Park, which is the most Hasidic section of Brooklyn. It is a neighborhood, city planners say, where the fertility rate is double that of New York as a whole, where families with eight children are not unusual and where Rabbi Halberstam convinced ultra-Orthodox Jews that they could thrive without compromising their way of life.
At his funeral yesterday, about 6,000 mourners crushed into Bobover Yeshiva Bnei Zion at 15th Avenue and 48th Street, with an additional 30,000 or so standing outside in steaming heat listening to loudspeakers. During the ceremony, many mourners wailed and ripped their clothing, signifying that the rabbi was like a father to them.
Rabbi Halberstam's two sons spoke at the service. Rabbi Naftali Halberstam, the eldest and the chosen successor in the Bobov sect, escaped the Nazis with his father and came to New York after the war. He spoke of his grandfather, the Bobover grand rabbi, who was killed by the Nazis. The second son, Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam, said his father had picked up the ashes from the Holocaust and created the community that was now mourning him.
The Bobover Hasidim are part of an ecstatic religious movement of the late 17th century that broke from traditional rabbinical Judaism for reasons that included objections about materialistic excess. The various sects among the Hasidim share similar beliefs, with their differences owing to geographical origin, dress and style of leadership among grand rabbis.
The Bobovers, whose name derives from a village in southeastern Poland, tend to look to their grand rabbi more than most other sects for advice on business, marriage and family matters, according to William B. Helmreich, a professor of sociology and Judaic studies at the City University of New York.
"Bobover Hasidim is known for not emphasizing disputes," said Professor Helmreich, author of "The World of the Yeshiva" (Ktav, 2000). "They are considered very open and tolerant to other groups."
Several Judaic experts said that Rabbi Halberstam enjoyed extraordinary success in recruiting Jews in America to the Bobov sect because he was both nonconfrontational and charismatic.
"There is a market economy in America in religion, and whoever has the charisma attracts the most people," said Samuel Heilman, a professor of Jewish studies and sociology at Queens College. "Rabbi Halberstam was successful, and the numbers show that."
Professor Heilman estimated there are 20,000 followers of the Bobov sect, although some other Jewish leaders said the sect had more than 100,000 members who are concentrated in New York, Montreal, Toronto, Miami and London.
Unlike the Satmar and Lubavitch Hasidic sects, which are also prominent in Brooklyn, the Bobovers have flourished with little public infighting. A leadership squabble dating to the death 21 years ago of a grand rabbi continues to divide the Satmar sect, and the Lubavitch movement remains riven by a dispute over whether their late leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, was the Messiah.
Rabbi Halberstam years ago designated his oldest son as his successor, Professor Heilman said. At the funeral yesterday, he said the congregation enthusiastically welcomed the son as their new leader.
Rabbi Halberstam arrived in New York in the late 1940's, with only his oldest son. The rest of his family had been killed. During this time, according to Professor Heilman, he apparently had a crisis of faith, shaved his beard and lost his desire to be a rabbi. But he soon recovered and, Professor Heilman said, his crisis of faith proved inspirational to many Orthodox Jews reeling in poverty and psychological distress in the wake of the war.
"Many of his followers felt that if the rabbi can forgive God for the Holocaust, then we can, too," Professor Heilman said.
Rabbi Halberstam took great pleasure in dancing and singing. His dancing frames a recent documentary movie about the Hasidim called "A World Apart -- Hasidic Life in America."
Rabbi Halberstam is survived by his two sons and five daughters, along with many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

The obituary of Grand Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam of the Bobover sect yesterday included an incomplete reference from family friends to the members of his family who survived the Holocaust. Although several relatives were killed, his mother, a brother and six sisters -- not just his eldest son -- survived.
An obituary of Grand Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam of the Bobover sect on Thursday misstated the title of a documentary in which he is shown dancing. It is "A Life Apart: Hasidism in America," not "A World Apart: Hasidic Life in America."

HEADLINE: A New Caveat for eBay Users: Seller Beware;
Putting Your Family Heirlooms Up for Bids May Make You a Target for Credit Card Fraud

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
CONNIE BACON, a regular seller on eBay, thought that she had brokered an excellent deal. On behalf of a consignment shop in Charleston, S.C., she had sold a Rolex watch for $13,500 in an online auction, and everything had gone smoothly.
A man who identified himself as Kelvin Johanis had put the money in an escrow account, assuring Ms. Bacon that the payment was good, and the shopkeeper had shipped the package to a house specified by the buyer in Lynwood, Wash. 
 A few hours later, Ms. Bacon got an urgent e-mail message from I-Escrow, the company holding the payment. I-Escrow said the buyer was suspected of using a stolen credit card. Please, the message pleaded, do not ship the watch.
"I was shaking," Ms. Bacon said. "This was a $13,500 watch that wasn't mine."
She had good reason to be concerned. Online sellers are even more vulnerable to fraud than online buyers, experts say. Those who buy faulty or fake goods through online auctions or Web shops have some recourse; insurance programs and credit card companies will often come to their rescue and credit their accounts, at least up to a certain amount.
But individuals who are selling goods in online auctions have little protection. Stolen credit cards, fake money orders and bounced checks are risks they face. For them, the adage is turned on its head: Seller beware.
In Ms. Bacon's case, she was not the only Ebay seller who did business with the person who called himself Mr. Johanis. His real name was Michael Prime, according to court documents, and he turned out to be a 19-year-old unemployed high school graduate in Brier, Wash.
According to I-Escrow's investigators (informally known as the fraud squad), Mr. Prime had opened 25 accounts on the I-Escrow system and had been in contact with at least nine sellers. He had used stolen credit cards to get almost $20,000 worth of merchandise, including laptop computers, other Rolex watches and three remote-controlled scale-model helicopters.
When people worry about fraud in online auctions, they do not usually think about buyers like Mr. Prime. They assume that they are most likely to be deceived by sellers -- particularly by people hawking counterfeit or broken merchandise.
"That is really not true," said Dr. Audri Lanford, a sociologist and editor of an e-mail newsletter, Scambusters.org. "Fraud is a huge issue, but it is from the seller's perspective."
In fact, online sellers are 1O to 18 times as likely as bricks and mortar merchants to lose merchandise to people using stolen credit cards, according to a survey by the Gartner Group, a market research company. The survey, which was released in July and polled 166 retailers, showed that 1.13 percent of all online transactions were conducted with stolen cards.
Once online sellers accept a stolen card, they often find that the credit card company is of no help. Under federal law, the owner of the credit card would not have to pay for those items. The credit card companies do not have to cover the cost either; they are liable for the purchases only if the seller got a signature from the card holder. So the seller bears the cost and will never be paid.
A year ago, that might not have sounded like an issue for consumers to worry about. But now, with auction sites like those offered by eBay, Yahoo and Amazon.com, consumers can be sellers as easily as they can be buyers. Today, millions of people are selling goods online, with no background in running a business and none of the resources used by traditional businesses if things go awry.
Until recently, most individuals selling through online auctions have not been able to accept credit cards and have had to worry only about bounced checks. But this spring, the introduction of credit card services like Billpoint have made it possible for anyone -- even someone selling one item -- to take credit cards online. Now people who have no business savvy, and who may simply be selling miscellaneous items to clean out their basements, are vulnerable to the same credit card fraud that is plaguing online merchants.
Ms. Bacon, an antique-glassware trader who can often be spotted on eBay under the name GrayHorse, was an experienced online auctioneer when she decided to help a consignment shop sell the Rolex last summer. She had already run into a few problems, mainly with buyers who retracted their bids. But she was still not prepared when she heard that the sellers she was acting for had been defrauded by Mr. Prime. "I felt very violated," she said. "It made me very angry."
Mr. Prime, it turned out, was doing more than simply using stolen credit cards. Those involved with the case say that he is a whiz with computers, though he has little education beyond high school. His lawyer, Tim Tesh, described his client as "one of these self-taught kids who can just pick it up."
According to I-Escrow, Mr. Prime first registered for accounts using stolen cards in July 1999. But I-Escrow detected that the accounts were based on stolen cards and quickly canceled them.
So Mr. Prime tried to get around the system. According to I-Escrow, he told sellers that he wanted to use I-Escrow and would start the process of setting up accounts. But instead of completing the transaction through the escrow service, officials said, Mr. Prime would close the deal by pretending to be an escrow agent and sending messages from "I_Escrow@Hotmail.com," an e-mail address that looked a lot like I-Escrow's official messages, which end with "IEscrow.com." Using that disguise, he told sellers that the money had been deposited and that they should go ahead and ship their items.
The first person to be deceived, I-Escrow said, was a Bellingham, Wash., man who was selling a Macintosh Powerbook G3 in July 1999. According to I-Escrow's records, Mr. Prime purchased two remote-controlled helicopters and two Rolex watches a week later using fake e-mail messages.
But one other case involving a remote-controlled helicopter worked a little differently. The seller, Bobby DeRosa, was a Web designer in San Diego, and Mr. Prime did not try to use a fake e-mail address. Instead, I-Escrow said, he used a credit card that had not yet been listed by banks as stolen and then asked Mr. DeRosa to direct the shipment to an address that was different from the one on the card.
By the end of July, I-Escrow had been tipped off by the seller of the Apple computer, who had checked the company's Web site to view his account's status and had been baffled to find that the transaction was listed as "still pending." He forwarded to I-Escrow the fake message that included the real shipping address: 14501 Highway 99 in Lynwood, Wash.
I-Escrow officials called the sheriff's office there, in Snohomish County. A detective, Matt Trafford, drove to the address on Highway 99, a four-lane commercial road, and found what looked like an abandoned house that had been "sitting there rotting for years," he said.
Inside the house, Detective Trafford said, he found credit card receipts and registration papers for a nearby storage business.
Detective Trafford wanted to be waiting when the next shipment was delivered to the house. He asked I-Escrow if its records showed another shipment. Yes, it looked as though another Rolex watch was about to be purchased, from an eBay seller in South Carolina: Ms. Bacon.
This was the same week that Ms. Bacon received that urgent e-mail message telling her not to ship the watch. The minute she saw that message, Ms. Bacon had called the consignment shop but had discovered, to her dismay, that the watch had already been packed and delivered to the post office. "I called the post office," she said, and found to her relief that the package was still there. "I said: 'Oh thank you, Jesus. Please do not send that watch out.' "
Ms. Bacon then agreed to help I-Escrow and the sheriff's office. She found an old chipped soap dish that weighed about as much as the watch, wrapped it up and sent it to her buyer. Across the country in Lynwood, Wash., Detective Trafford was waiting, watching the abandoned house through the windows of a nearby store.
But the soap dish never made its way to the abandoned house. Mr. Prime picked it up at the Federal Express office instead and threw it into a gasoline station's trash can after he opened it. Detective Trafford, however, was still able to find Mr. Prime. By talking to witnesses at the Federal Express office, the detective learned that Mr. Prime rode a blue-and-white motorcycle and used a nearby storage business. On a visit to the site, the detective spotted the motorcycle and noted its license plate number. The number led him to find snapshots of Mr. Prime that were on file from a previous arrest. (Mr. Prime had pleaded guilty a few days earlier to stealing a computer.)
Soon, with help from I-Escrow and eBay, the detective had enough information to make an arrest. Mr. Prime was picked up at his mother's house, and the police said they had found a Rolex watch and two stolen credit cards there. Mr. Prime said he had taken the cards after finding them in automated teller machines. He was charged with theft and two counts of possession of stolen property. He denied the charges at first, posted bail and a few months later moved from his mother's house.
That move led to another visit from the authorities, this time from a probation officer who had been assigned to Mr. Prime after he pleaded guilty to the previous theft, in King County. The officer came to do a routine check of Mr. Prime's new residence. During a search of the apartment, he found a tin can in a cabinet. As soon as the officer opened the can, a firecracker rocket inside ignited, according to Mr. Prime's affidavit. The flame from the rocket was apparently intended to destroy the contents, but detectives were still able to identify them: another stolen credit card, a stolen debit card and fake identification cards.
Mr. Prime eventually pleaded guilty to five felony counts (the three earlier charges plus a count for possessing an incendiary device and a count of forgery), and he was sentenced to 22 months at the Airway Heights Correctional Center in eastern Washington. In the interview this week, he said he had learned his lesson and was hoping to take a computer-related job someday. "I was emotionally depressed and doing stupid things," he said. "I made a bad choice."
The case of Mr. Prime may sound more complex than most cases of credit card fraud, but officials at companies like I-Escrow and CyberSource, which provides verification services to online merchants, say they have been seeing more incidents like this recently. "The con artists today are getting much more crafty," said Vince Gottman, i-Escrow's senior director for customer support and the leader of the fraud squad.
I-Escrow, for example, recently caught a buyer trying to use a check stolen from his employer. CyberSource officials said they had seen an increasing number of international cases. A buyer will ask that goods be sent to a location outside the United States but will use a credit card with a billing address inside the United States. In many cases, they say, the credit card being used is a stolen card.
"One bad buyer out there can do a lot of damage," said Tom Arnold, chief technology officer at CyberSource.
Most businesses already know this. "You have to build that into the cost of business," said Janet Crane, chief executive of Billpoint, the credit card system used by many people on eBay. Ms. Crane acknowledged, however, that most eBay users did not have the business experience to protect themselves.
Billpoint works like most credit card companies and will not cover a seller's costs when a transaction has gone bad. But this week, the company started offering a new feature to give sellers more protection. The service, called Electronic Check, will let sellers receive money directly from a buyer's checking account, instead of through a credit card. But the service has a three-day waiting period so Billpoint can make sure that the check clears. If a fraudulent check goes through, the service will reimburse the seller up to $200.
A few services offer guarantees if a card is used and later determined to be stolen. I-Escrow, for example, gave refunds to the sellers who were defrauded by Mr. Prime. The company now asks its users to ensure that messages are legitimate by comparing the information they get in e-mail messages that appear to be from I-Escrow with what I-Escrow shows in their Web-based accounts. If sellers do everything that is asked of them and are still defrauded, I-Escrow says, it will cover the cost of any lost items.
Ecount, a service that enables people to use credit cards on the Web, also says that it will cover the cost of bad transactions and cover payments that are owed to a seller even if a credit card turns out to be stolen. PayPal, another payment service, also offers a guarantee, but only if users have completed a three-step verification process when setting up accounts. About 10 percent of PayPal's customers do so, said Elon Musk, chief executive of X.com, the company behind PayPal.
For the most part, experts say, sellers should not panic. Kevin Pursglove, eBay's spokesman, added that "99.997 percent of transactions have satisfactory buyers and sellers." Yahoo Auctions and other auction sites also stress that most sales are completed without a hitch.
In fact, Ms. Bacon said she had not been dissuaded from selling her glassware on eBay, and she is still using I-Escrow for high-priced items. And she probably would not have been held financially responsible for the loss of the watch because she was selling it for another shop.
But she has become more wary, and she warns sellers to review the procedures on auction and escrow services before using them. "Fully understand what the process should be," she said, "so you can't get fooled like I did."
 
Protecting Yourself
 
Sellers may be 10 times as likely to run into credit card fraud over the Internet as in the physical world. Here are some things online sellers should watch:
 
SHIPPING -- Ship the item only to the address listed on the credit card. People using stolen cards, of course, want purchases to come to them, not to card holders.
 
TIMING -- Don't sell to a buyer who appears anxious to purchase an item and offers a premium to buy it before the auction ends. A holder of a stolen card is usually in a hurry to use it before the theft is reported.
 
SHIPPING -- Be wary of any buyer who requests expensive overnight shipping and offers to cover the costs.
 
E-MAIL -- Be wary of buyers using free e-mail services like Hotmail or Juno.com. Many honest people use free e-mail, but these accounts allow senders to be anonymous.
 
PAYMENTS -- Don't let the buyer split up the payment for an item by making, say, 10 payments of $500 instead of one $5,000 payment. The buyer may be trying to stay under the radar of credit card companies, who pay extra attention to large purchases.

HEADLINE: Salomon to Buy U.S. Treasury Interest

 BODY:
Salomon Smith Barney offered yesterday to buy $94.5 billion worth of the interest portion of Treasury securities, known as strips, from institutional and retail owners.
Salomon said it wanted to combine the interest portions with bond principal to create whole bonds that would be eligible for sale back to the Treasury as part of the government's buyback program. 
 This year, the Treasury is expected to buy back as much as $30 billion of Treasury bonds with maturities of 10 years to 25 years remaining. The government is reducing borrowing amid growing budget surpluses.
Wall Street firms often break up the interest and the principal portions of a bond and sell them separately as zero-coupon bonds.
Salomon has an oversupply of the principal portions of existing bonds but a shortage of the interest-rate portion. And if the firm wants to take advantage of the premium prices the Treasury is paying to buy back existing bonds, it needs to reconstitute the two portions into whole bonds.
"This offer will allow us to continue to be actively involved in the Treasury buyback program," said Charles Parkhurst, co-head of the United States government bond department at Salomon.
The $94.5 billion is the face value of the interest portion of the bonds. But the bonds would be purchased at a discount to the price so that the total cost would be less than $94.5 billion. Salomon is offering investors cash for the interest portions of the bond, or would swap them for a principal portion.

HEADLINE: 2 Reports Show a Slower Pace of Growth

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Factory orders for goods other than aircraft were little changed in June and the pace of business outside of manufacturing slowed in July, government and industry reports showed today.
Manufacturer orders, excluding a record increase for aircraft and other transportation equipment, rose 0.3 percent in June after a 4.4 percent increase in May, the Commerce Department said. 
 A separate report showed business outside of manufacturing expanded in July at the slowest pace since January as new orders cooled. The National Association of Purchasing Management's nonmanufacturing business index fell to 55.5 in July from a reading of 64 in June.
"The decline helps to confirm a generalized slowdown in U.S. demand, perhaps even extending into the service sector," said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Banc of America Securities in New York.
In a third report, the number of workers filing new applications for state unemployment benefits increased last week. Initial jobless claims rose 2,000, to a seasonally adjusted 276,000 in the week ended July 29, after a decrease of 39,000, to a revised 274,000, the previous week, according to the Labor Department.
In addition, the four-week moving average for claims, considered a less volatile gauge of labor market conditions, fell to 295,750 last week -- the lowest level in almost two months -- from 300,000 the previous week.
The Commerce Department's report showed that total orders to manufacturers rose 5.5 percent in June after increasing 4.7 percent in May. June's gain was the biggest since a 7.3 percent increase in July 1991, when the United States was emerging from its last recession.
Orders for transportation equipment surged 42.2 percent in June, mainly because of a jump in demand for aircraft, the Commerce Department said.
Boeing, the world's largest maker of aircraft, reported 139 orders for June, including a contract to sell at least 94 jetliners valued at $4.5 billion to Southwest Airlines. That compares with 57 orders received for May. Boeing's year-to-date orders are above those for all of 1999.
June shipments of goods from the nation's factories rose 1 percent, while inventories increased 0.5 percent. The inventories-to-shipments ratio, a measure of the time goods sit at factories, fell to a record low of 1.25 months in June from 1.26 months in May.
Unfilled orders surged 4.3 percent in June, a sign manufacturers are having trouble keeping pace with demand.
The value of orders for nondurable goods, which includes clothing and food as well as petroleum, oil and paper, fell 0.1 percent.
Orders for chemicals, paper and tobacco products also declined during the month.
In May, orders for nondurable goods increased 1.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Taiwan's Leader Considers Purchase of Updated Jet Fighters

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, said today that the island should begin considering new fighter aircraft purchases, warning that in five years China could threaten Taiwan's ability to control the skies over the Taiwan Strait, a key factor in repelling a mainland invasion.
That Mr. Chen, who spoke during an inspection of Taiwan's air force headquarters in Taipei, would make the politically charged suggestion during the Republican Party's convention suggested to some analysts that he hoped to interject the issue into the American presidential campaign. The United States is the most likely supplier of any advanced fighter jets to Taiwan. But such a sale would be hotly contested by Beijing, which regards the island as a province separated from the mainland by civil war. 
 "Chen may be trying to smoke out the United States and have some sort of bidding war on reassurances from both candidates," said Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corporation in California.
Support for Taiwan is always an emotional issue in the United States, but this year it became particularly so with Mr. Chen's election, which drew threats of war from Beijing. China distrusts Mr. Chen because of his past support for Taiwan's formal independence from the mainland.
In the midst of the 1992 presidential campaign, President Bush decided to sell Taiwan 150 advanced F-16 fighter aircraft after it became clear that China had bought advanced Sukhoi-27 fighters from Russia. The F-16 sale, the last major American arms sale to Taiwan, infuriated Beijing and complicated already difficult relations between the United States and China.
Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the United States is obligated to help Taiwan maintain its defenses. But in a 1982 joint communique with Beijing, Washington pledged not to increase the quantity or quality of arms sold to Taiwan.
More recently, though, China has ordered as many as 40 advanced Sukhoi-30 fighters from Russia as part of a steadily growing arms procurement program intended to give China an edge over Taiwan.
One military official here said this week that air force personnel have been told to expect the first of the planes to arrive in China later this year. The Sukhoi-30 is capable of carrying air-to-surface guided anti-ship missiles and has a longer range than the Sukhoi-27.
China has already fielded 48 of the Sukhoi-27 fighters at bases around the country and first deployed them over the Taiwan Strait during war games last year. It has plans to assemble as many as 200 more with help from Russia.
Bates Gill, a military expert at the Brookings Institution, said it is natural that the reports of Sukhoi-30 purchases from Russia should inspire Taiwan's air force to look for a next generation aircraft itself.
"Given the aging of the F-16 and the lead times needed to get next-generation aircraft in fighting shape, these decisions need to be made within the next three to five years at the latest," said Mr. Gill.
Other analysts said Mr. Chen may simply be raising the issue generally to put the next American administration on notice that the shopping list will be longer than usual when the island makes its annual arms purchase requests in the spring.
For the time being, Taiwan enjoys clear air superiority over the 100-mile-wide body of water separating the island from the mainland, thanks to its F-16's and 60 French-made Mirage 2000-5 fighters.
While China has the largest air force in the world with about 6,000 planes, nearly half of those date from the 1950's and only a few dozen of the rest are viable machines for modern warfare. Even with its Russian purchases, military analysts say China is a long way from dominating the skies over Taiwan because few of its pilots have received aggressive training in the advanced fighter aircraft. China is believed to have lost several Sukhoi-27 jets in training exercises already and Beijing is reluctant to push harder training for fear of losing more of the expensive planes.
The country also lacks the sophisticated battlefield command technology necessary to deploy its jets effectively. It had hoped to meet that need with help from Israel, which agreed to sell China a Phalcon advanced-warning and air-control system mounted atop a Russian jet. Israel canceled that sale last month in response to American pressure.
But Mr. Chen warned that Taiwan must not be complacent and should start planning for the next generation of fighters. He said Taiwan should look into fighters for 2010 to 2020 and upgrade its weapons systems. China's modernization drive will "dramatically boost the Communist Chinese Air Force's overall air combat capability, seriously affecting the military balance" after 2005, Mr. Chen said today.
The Pentagon evidently concurs. It told Congress in its annual report on the Chinese military this June that "if projected trends continue, the balance of air power across the Taiwan Strait could begin to shift in China's favor" after 2005, unless Taiwan enhances its air power.

Treasury Issues Bolstered By Federal Reserve Move

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices rose yesterday but ended well off their highs of the day after technology stocks recovered from an earlier slide and investors reversed a flight to quality into government securities.
While sliding stock prices early in the session were the main catalyst in lifting Treasury prices, the Federal Reserve also bolstered prices by staging a coupon pass, in which the Fed buys Treasury securities and adds permanent reserves to the banking system. Yesterday the Fed bought maturities ranging from Aug. 15, 2020, through Nov. 15, 2028. 
 The price of the 30-year bond, the onetime benchmark for Treasury rates, rose 11/32, to 107 9/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.74 percent from 5.76 percent on Wednesday. The closely followed 10-year note gained 5/32, to 103 31/32. Its yield dropped to 5.95 percent from 5.97 percent.
The government reported yesterday that factory orders surged 5.5 percent in June, the largest increase since 7.3 percent in July 1991. The report helped to cap Treasury gains. But, excluding a record increase for aircraft and other transportation equipment, orders rose 0.3 percent. The government also revised the gain in June durable goods orders down slightly, to 9.7 percent from the staggering 10 percent reported two weeks ago.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its July nonmanufacturing business index sank to 55.5 in July from 64 in June, while the Labor Department said jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 276,000 in the week ended July 29, slightly less than forecast.
Expectations are that today's July unemployment report will show little job and wage growth, providing the central bank with more information as the Federal Open Market Committee heads toward its next meeting on interest rates on Aug. 22.
"The Federal Reserve is carefully perusing the continual flow of economic statistics in order to determine the best course of action at the upcoming F.O.M.C. meeting," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management. "Using real G.D.P. as a yardstick, the year-over-year trend rate of economic growth now stands at a prodigious 6 percent, so obviously the expectation of a slowdown in the economy's pace is not a particularly heroic assumption."
"What really matters," he continued, "is the extent, timing and sustainability of the slowdown, and most importantly, whether or not an impending slackening of economic growth will be enough to definitively forestall inflationary pressures in the eyes of the Fed."
In this regard, today's July labor market data will play a crucial role. Mr. Fine said that if the numbers were weak, the market would conclude that the Fed was finished raising rates, but if they were strong, the future course would be uncertain.

Shares End Broadly Higher To Recover From Early Skid

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks pulled out of an early skid and rallied to finish broadly higher yesterday, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index posting a hefty 2.8 percent gain after being down as much as 3.8 percent in the first half hour.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and Dow Jones industrial average traced similar but less pronounced patterns. 
 Analysts attributed the sharp reversal to a combination of bargain-hunting, Motorola's denial of a report that it had cut its estimate of cellular telephone production and a surge of confidence that the government's monthly report on jobs and pay, to be released this morning, would make the Federal Reserve less likely to raise short-term interest rates when it meets on Aug. 22.
"Money is still searching for technological investment," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at State Street Advisors in Boston. He cautioned, however, that the Federal Reserve will sooner or later succeed in curbing economic growth and that when it does, high-technology businesses will be hurt as well as traditional, more cyclical, companies.
Semiconductor stocks were under particular selling pressure yesterday morning after Kulicke & Soffa, a top maker of equipment for assembling chips, warned of deferred orders. Its shares slumped to 13 9/16 and recovered only to 16 5/8, down 5 1/2. Credence Systems was among other industry losers, falling 9 49/64, to 39.
But other technology stocks regained all their lost ground and then some, with Cisco Systems, the most highly valued company after General Electric, slipping to 58 1/2 before rallying to close at 64 3/8, up 3 7/16. Cisco is to report its quarterly results on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq composite index ended the day with a gain of 101.42 points, at 3,759.88. This shrank its loss so far this year to 7.6 percent.
The S.& P. 500 advanced 13.86 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 1,452.56, paced by Cisco, Oracle, Intel, Sun Microsystems, EMC and Nortel Networks.
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, many of whose components have been recent havens for investors fleeing technology, rose 19.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,706.58. The Dow is down 6.9 percent so far this year.
Banks and brokerage firm stocks joined technology among the day's biggest winning sectors. J. P. Morgan, up 3, to 135, was the best-performing Dow stock, accounting for 17 points of the 19-point rise in the blue-chip average.
Clorox reported a big profit gain but cautioned about prospects and its stock slipped 3 11/16, to 39 11/16.
Gap's profits disappointed Wall Street and the shares fell 7 11/16, to 30 1/4.
But Viacom beat expectations and rose 2 3/16, to 71 9/16, while Disney, reporting after the 4 p.m. close of the market, gained 2 points in late trading. The UnitedHealth Group also gained after reporting results. It closed regular trading at 84 15/16, up 15/16.
Motorola, which changed hands for as little as 33 1/2, ended at 36 1/8, down 11/16, while AT&T touched a 52-week low before finishing at 30 9/16, down 1/2.
Hilton Hotels eased 1/2, to 9 9/16, after announcing higher second-quarter profits.
Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Gruntal, was among analysts saying the Federal Reserve can still refrain from raising rates at this month's meeting despite mixed evidence that the economy's blistering pace has appreciably slackened. He predicted it would decide that the series of six increases since mid-1999 "is all we have to do for now."
Joe Sundeman, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research, said that the market had rallied sharply on recent job reports that suggested inflation remained largely in check.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose yesterday to 1.1 billion shares from 994.6 million as 74 issues made new highs, compared with 57 new lows. But declines outnumbered advancing issues by 1,545 to 1,338, roughly reversing Wednesday's performance.
Nasdaq turnover was 1.83 billion shares.

HEADLINE: Citrus Canker War Fought Yard by Yard

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 3

 BODY:
For 40 years, more than half her life, Kitty Field nurtured her trees. There was one orange, one lime, one grapefruit, and the blossoms and fruit filled the yard with fragrance and color. It just looked like Florida somehow, and she and her husband, Ernest, grew old under their leaves.
"The leaves are green," Mrs. Field said. "The fruit is perfect." 
 What could be more harmless, she wonders, than her tiny grove?
But recently, state inspectors searching for the dreaded citrus canker disease came into the Fields' yard in North Miami Beach and painted a red "X" on all three trees, marking them for destruction.
"These trees are like our children," Mrs. Field said. "We have watched them grow."
Hundreds of thousands of citrus trees, mostly in commercial groves, in South Florida have already been chopped down to stop the spread of canker, a disease that threatens Florida's citrus industry, which is second only to tourism in the money it takes in. But it is the house-by-house eradication of the canker that seems to be causing the most pain.
Most people, like Catalina Leal, 86, of Miami and Elvia Perez, 69, of Hialeah, only wept in their yards as Florida Department of Agriculture workers chopped down old citrus trees. But others are more determined. Five times this year, South Floridians met state inspectors with guns or threats of guns.
The most recent was on Tuesday. The police said Carl E. Lawson, 62, fired his shotgun after two state inspectors approached his home. No one was hurt, but Mr. Lawson was charged with two counts of attempted murder.
The saddest case came in March, in the city of Tamarac in Broward County. State inspectors had already chopped down three of 95-year-old Nelson Edwards's grapefruit trees.
When they came for the last one, Mr. Edwards, who can barely see and does not hear well, came to his door with a rifle. It was not loaded, but he worked the rifle's bolt, once, anyway, to try and scare them off.
"I'm just an old man," said Mr. Edwards, when he was asked why he did that.
It did not save his tree.
"It's history," he said. "It's gone."
Such cases are an extreme. Most people here fire off letters, instead. "We have written our political representatives," Mrs. Field said. "We will do what is necessary to keep our trees."
But yard by yard through South Florida, where citrus trees had stood for decades, there are just stumps now. "They gave me shade," Mrs. Perez said of her trees. "They gave me happiness. Every morning, I would throw the leftover coffee grounds around the trees. Now, I just throw it in the garbage."
There have been three outbreaks of canker in Florida since 1913, and the most recent was detected in 1995. "That one tree has spread to 700,000," said Richard Miranda, public information director for the state's Citrus Canker Eradication Program.
When state inspectors find a tree with canker, they condemn all trees within 1,900 feet. Trees that show no signs of the disease still must be destroyed.
The state offers $100 to compensate the owners of the trees, to help offset the costs of planting new trees.
But what good will it do, some of the elderly homeowners ask, to plant a new twig in the ground this late in their lives? It will be years before the trees bear fruit, and decades before they grow tall and full enough to provide shade.
For people in their 70's and 80's, what good is that?
"For them to plant a new tree now won't help them much," Mr. Miranda conceded. But, he said, "if it actually gets into the groves, it can be crippling to the economy of the state."
Canker manifests itself on the fruit in raised, brown, corky lesions, surrounded by yellow rings. It attacks the immune system of a tree the same way that H.I.V. affects humans and eventually kills the tree.
While those whose trees have signs of the disease hate to see them chopped down, those whose apparently healthy trees are within the 1,900-foot kill zone are livid.
"The ones that were sick were next door, not mine," Mrs. Perez said. "My daughter tells me, 'Mami, get over it, it's just plants,' but I can't."
Mrs. Leal planted her trees, oranges and other citrus, 23 years ago. She pruned them with a machete, and used boards studded with nails to keep cats off them.
There was nothing she could do to keep the inspectors away, though she let them know how it hurt her.
"I cried in front of them, because I felt very bad," Mrs. Leal said. "But they went ahead and cut them down anyway. I figured I'd have to let them because they're the government."
She cannot get used to the sight of the stumps. Her trees were so giving, she said, of fruit, of shade. "I grew to love them."
The thing that some here will miss most is the simple act of reaching up and plucking a fresh orange or grapefruit or lime, and the taste -- as different from a store-bought fruit as a made-from-scratch meal is from a microwave dinner.
"In the mornings, we put on a pair of slippers and go out to pick oranges, and have them for breakfast," said Gil Muratori, 61, a pharmaceutical sales manager in Miami whose trees are under the state's death sentence.
It is part of being in Florida, of being Floridian. Chopping them up, to many people here, is as wrong as setting fire to a flamingo.

HEADLINE: Russians Join U.S. to Seek New Sanctions On Taliban

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
The United States and Russia have agreed to work together to draft and win support for expanded sanctions against Afghanistan, officials said today. The cooperation aims to force the ruling Taliban to end support of Islamic terrorists, the officials said.
The pledge to expand United Nations sanctions against the Taliban, who control about 85 percent of Afghanistan, was among several measures endorsed in principle by a senior working group of American and Russian officials after two days of talks in Washington. 
 According to a statement issued by the State Department, the talks focused not only on stemming the threat of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan and the Taliban's promotion of the production and trafficking of drugs but also on ways of creating "conditions for Afghans to establish a broad-based government for their country."
While the statement did not provide details of the "further measures" that Moscow and Washington have endorsed, one American official said that diplomats of both countries favored what he called "smart" sanctions. That is a term for actions that could be directed against leaders and their entourages rather than against Afghanistan's beleaguered civilians.
The official said that these were likely to include a ban on most international trade outside areas like food and medicines, air traffic to Afghanistan and perhaps an arms embargo.
Last October, the United Nations Security Council, led by Russia and the United States, passed a resolution demanding that the Taliban stop providing refuge to terrorists and that they expel Osama bin Laden so that he could stand trial on terrorism charges stemming from his alleged planning of the bomb attacks that destroyed two American embassies in Africa in 1998.
The resolution's sanctions, which took effect last November, curtailed international flights by the national airline, Ariana, and froze Taliban assets abroad until Mr. bin Laden and one of his chief aides were turned over.
The Taliban have refused to expel Mr. bin Laden, who supported their successful effort to expel Soviet forces in the 1980's. But Taliban officials in New York and Islamabad say that he is being closely monitored, is not permitted to give interviews and no longer poses a threat.
American diplomats said that Russian support of expanded sanctions is important to their winning acceptance within the Security Council, which is increasingly reluctant to impose sanctions that punish civilians for the misdeeds of their rulers.
While Moscow and Washington disagree on the administration's endorsement of a missile-defense scheme for America and many other issues, they have found common ground in the need to curb terrorism fomented by militant Islamic groups in South Asia. While the administration is trying to stop Mr. bin Laden from planning and financing terror aimed at Americans, both in the United States and abroad, Russia wants to stop the Taliban from supporting Muslim militants fighting Russian forces in Chechnya and from destabilizing neighboring states in Central Asia.
The talks this week grew out of a summit meeting in Moscow in June between President Clinton and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. This week's meeting was led by Thomas R. Pickering, under secretary of state for political affairs, and Vyacheslav Trubnikov, Russia's first deputy foreign minister.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley's Primal Spirit Lives On, in a Part of Beijing

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
Anyone searching for the soul of China's Silicon Valley can find it here, up four flights of concrete stairs, past walls with peeling paint and ledges strewn with beer bottles, down a darkened hallway and inside what was once the student activity room at Qinghua University Dormitory No. 20.
It is here that a visitor will find the makeshift research and development offices of the fledgling company called Beijing East Doctors Information Technology ("doctors" as in Ph.D.'s, not medical doctors). 
 With the blessing of the administrators at Qinghua, China's leading technical university, six graduate students are sharing their pursuit of a legend borrowed from the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean, in the original Silicon Valley -- the birthplace of companies like Hewlett-Packard and Yahoo, whose roots lie deep in the student life of Stanford University.
As Yang Diange, a 27-year-old computer science student who is the chief executive of Beijing East, put it: "That is our dream -- to be just like a Cisco or a Sun Microsystems."
Like many of the best and brightest technology companies in Silicon Valley, Hewlett-Packard, Sun and Cisco were founded by students, faculty and staff members at Stanford.
Today, Beijing East, which is developing a Web site that will match technology experts with Internet users, is one of perhaps 500 or 600 recent home-grown Internet start-ups in Zhongguancun, a chaotic Beijing neighborhood that is both the site of some of the nation's best universities and the Chinese government's designated high-technology industrial zone.
Zhongguancun, in the Haidian district in northwest Beijing, is home to a fledgling Internet industry as well as better-known Chinese computer and telecommunications companies like Legend Computer Systems, Founder Computer Systems and Huawei Technology.
Although the Internet arrived in China only in 1997, Beijing students, when their experience is measured in "Internet years," have already weathered a boom-and-bust cycle. Many tiny start-ups here have gone out of business since the April decline of the Nasdaq stock market.
For the young founders of Beijing East, however, Zhongguancun is the perfect incubator. Next year the company plans to move off campus and commercialize its Internet computer support Web site.
And though they work half a world away from the world's better-known high-technology mecca, this group of graduate students is in many ways closer to the authentic entrepreneurial spirit that drives Silicon Valley than many of the ersatz Silicon Deserts, Mountains, Glens and Forests, which are most frequently the public relations products of overzealous economic development agencies.
"It has been remarkable to me how similar the entrepreneurial high-tech Chinese are to their American counterparts," said Kai-Fu Lee, an American-educated computer scientist who is director of a research laboratory that Microsoft has established in Zhongguancun.
Despite the oppressive humidity that visits Beijing each summer, the Qinghua students spend 15 to 18 hours a day packed into their dormitory room with six personal computers hooked to their campus network.
So far, the students have drawn no salaries and have raised about $36,000 from friends and family that was spent mostly on computers and the wages paid to some undergraduate students for programming help.
They are now adding the finishing touches to their Web site, which is intended to take advantage of the latest Internet trend, a peer-to-peer service and support network. In their case, it is meant to bring together China's best technology experts with what they hope will be tens of thousands of Internet and PC novices hungry for online help in everything from surfing the Web to questions about both the Windows and Linux operating systems.
Ultimately, Mr. Yang expects the company to need as much as $500,000 to start its business. Despite some concerns about a recent cooling in venture capital investment in China, he foresees no difficulties in raising the funds. Indeed, he feels the group needs to be picky even in choosing its investors.
"It is not very difficult for us to find an investor for our next stage," he said. "But we don't want to cooperate with common investors. We will grow faster with the help of famous investors such as International Data Group, Softbank, CMGI, etc."
Mr. Yang's confidence is echoed by other Zhongguancun start-ups.
"We have venture capitalists coming to our door every week," said Jia En Chen, general manager of eefind .com, a Chinese-language search-engine technology development company in an office park just south of the Qinghua campus.
Like Beijing East, eefind is a clear example of why the Chinese start-ups should be taken seriously.
Both companies have access to sophisticated software technology and bright programmers, and they are operating on a shoestring compared with their Silicon Valley counterparts.
Although eefind's extremely cramped two-room office on the top floor of the 10-story Qinghua Pioneer Park building makes even the most crowded Silicon Valley office or garage look spacious, the company has spent only about $130,000 so far in developing its search engine.
Moreover, eefind.com exemplifies a second significant aspect of the Chinese technology boom. Many entrepreneurs who are founding companies are technologists who are moving here because they see the Internet boom here as real. A sense seems to prevail that in the 21st century the Internet will increasingly be dominated by the Chinese.
Eefind's founder, Ming-Jer Lee, is a computer science graduate student from Taiwan who moved to Beijing to found the company.
"This is where the Internet market will be," he said.
Indeed, the recent growth of the Chinese Internet suggests that he may even be understating the future. July survey statistics reported by the China Internet Network Information Center show that the number of Chinese Internet users has almost doubled, to 16.9 million from 8.9 million, in just seven months. By one estimate, the annual value of e-commerce could pass $1 billion by 2002.
That the Internet is catching hold in urban China can be seen by even a casual visitor to Beijing. Many billboards that bracket the city's freeways now come equipped with Internet addresses.
One of the first American companies to realize that the spirit of the Zhongguancun Internet boom was a resource to be exploited was Microsoft. Nearly two years ago, it set up a research laboratory here and tapped as its director Kai-Fu Lee, who had previously served as a vice president at both Apple Computer and Silicon Graphics, where he worked on voice recognition and 3-D software.
The Microsoft laboratory, now well established, is beginning to contribute to Microsoft products under development. Mr. Lee has recruited a number of American-trained computer experts to lead the laboratory's research teams and has hired leading Chinese scientists, programmers and mathematicians.
Many of his research group leaders are ethnic Chinese who agreed to return from the West, or to move from Taiwan, to build the lab.
In summer, the laboratory, which occupies a single floor of a new office building in the Zhongguancun zone, plays host to 180 student interns who are developing software programs for Microsoft. The laboratory is scheduled to expand to a second floor of the building in August.
Yet, despite his optimism about the potential Chinese technologists, Mr. Lee is still cautious about the possibility that Zhongguancun could rival Silicon Valley for sheer entrepreneurial innovation. In a recent article in People's Daily, he asserted that cultural differences remain.
"I believe the 'real' differences between Silicon Valley and Zhongguancun are: culture, different types of talent, different definitions of innovation, different types of venture capital and different involvement of academic institutions," he wrote.
Silicon Valley has evolved a culture that is tuned to market-driven innovation, Mr. Lee noted, while in China, innovation is still largely driven by technology.
He also wrote that venture capital is not playing the same role in China that it plays in Silicon Valley, where investors are frequently an integral part of a company's day-to-day operations. Things are changing in China, but until recently investors had been used only as a source of financing.
There may be another crucial difference as well. Despite an intensifying housing shortage, highway traffic problems and declining quality of life in Silicon Valley, it still seems like an earthly paradise compared with the rapidly industrializing Beijing, with its chronic pollution.
At a recent lunchtime meeting at the Microsoft lab here, a visitor asked seven of the American-trained computer experts recruited by Mr. Lee what they missed most about the United States. In unison the group answered, "Fresh air!"

HEADLINE: Bessemer Trust to Add Key Businesses of Rival

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
One of the oldest firms in the business of managing money for wealthy families, the Bessemer Trust Company, will announce today that it is buying the private-client and institutional-equity groups of a rival, Brundage, Story & Rose, executives of the firms said yesterday.
Neither of the firms, which are privately held, would disclose the terms of the deal. But executives of the firms said the deal would add $4.5 billion in assets under management and about 800 clients to Bessemer, which has $33 billion under management and 1,300 clients. 
 Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said yesterday that it was buying the other of Brundage, Story's three units, its institutional fixed-income division with $3.3 billion in assets under management. The terms of that deal were also not disclosed.
With the transactions, the Brundage name will disappear from Wall Street 68 years after the firm was founded.
"This transaction is significant in that it allows Bessemer to gain size and scale," said Henry McVey, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst.
"The reality," he said, "is that many of the large commercial and investment banks are now pushing into this market, and the independent players need to bulk up."
In January, Charles Schwab & Company said it would buy the U.S. Trust Company, and just last month Alliance Capital Management, which is controlled by the French financial services holding company AXA Group, bought Sanford C. Bernstein.
Guy Moszkowski, a financial analyst at Salomon Smith Barney said, "This is another manifestation of the need to be at a certain minimum scale to maximize your economics in an environment where more technology investment is needed every day."
Francis S. Branin, the chief executive of Brundage, Story, acknowledged that size was an issue. "We felt that longer term, it was probably going to be more and more difficult for medium-size firms like ours to compete across a broad range of services," he said.
Besides investing its clients' money in blue-chip stocks like General Electric, Intel and Home Depot, Bessemer also offers investments in leveraged buyouts, venture capital and real estate limited partnership funds. It also provides estate- and tax-planning services.
"Wealthy individuals want the services Bessemer has," said Mr. Branin, who will join the larger firm along with seven partners. Apart from managing the affairs of his former clients, Mr. Branin said, his position, and those of his old partners, in Bessemer have not been determined.
For Bessemer, the transaction was "an opportunity for us to add some very talented private-client services and investment professionals," said Donald J. Herrema, the chief executive of the larger firm.
Business has been booming at Bessemer, and it needed more employees quickly. Its assets under management have more than tripled over the last five years.
Bessemer was founded in 1907 as the family office of Henry Phipps, a partner of Andrew Carnegie in the Carnegie Steel Company. Its purpose was to invest the $50 million Mr. Phipps received in the sale of the steel business to J. P. Morgan. In 1974, the family decided to take on outside clients.
Bessemer added Miami to its New York and Palm Beach offices in 1981 and now does business in eight cities. It opened an Atlanta office last year and expects to open one in Silicon Valley in the next few months.
The minimum investment with Bessemer is $5 million. The average client's portfolio is worth $22 million, executives said, and there are several dozen with investments of more than $100 million. Brundage, Story's minimum was $1 million and the average portfolio was worth $5 million to $10 million.

HEADLINE: Study Backs Freight-Train Tunnel in New York Harbor

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
A proposed rail-freight tunnel under New York Harbor that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has adopted as a favored project would cost up to $2.3 billion but would pay for itself through increased business along a revitalized Brooklyn waterfront, according to a city study.
The two-year study by the New York City Economic Development Corporation recommends that a tunnel be built connecting Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and either Staten Island or Jersey City, linking New York to the existing rail-freight network in the rest of the country. 
 The report also says that a harbor tunnel could reduce the number of large commercial trucks that enter New York City -- mainly over the George Washington and Verrazano-Narrows Bridges -- by almost a million a year.
Since such a huge project would take at least a decade to complete, the report suggests that barges be used to carry freight across the harbor to and from Brooklyn in the interim.
The report was completed in May, but it has been released only to technical advisers and elected officials.
Mayor Giuliani has been urging the construction of a tunnel under the harbor for years, and the idea has been around since the 1920's. Critics say the tunnel is too expensive and faces huge hurdles because of its cost and the layers of review by the federal and state agencies responsible for New York Harbor.
But the report by the Economic Development Corporation supports the project. "This two-year study confirms that a new, direct rail-freight link would have dramatic positive impacts," it concludes.
The proposal faces difficult political hurdles not directly addressed by the report. Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls how federal aid for transportation projects is parceled out around the state, said in January that he would not join Mayor Giuliani in pushing for a harbor tunnel until seeing the results of the city study.
Yesterday, Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. Pataki was "still reviewing the findings" and would not comment.
Supporters of the project say it would also hinge on the support of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which controls the shipping terminals in the harbor and the bridges that carry most truck traffic into the city. One recommendation in the report on financing a tunnel is for the Port Authority to impose a 35 percent surcharge on the tolls now charged commercial trucks coming into the city.
"Until we finish reviewing the whole report, we can't offer any conclusions," said Steven Coleman, a Port Authority spokesman.
Despite its detailed analysis of projected benefits, the city's report did not alter skepticism from some experts in transportation and economic development, who said a rail tunnel might be outmoded by the time it was built. They pointed to the heavy demand by freight carriers for existing railroad tracks in New Jersey and elsewhere, which may not leave enough room to divert much of the cargo now trucked to and from the city.
"You are making a very large bet on what the freight market will be like 10 to 15 years down the road, and if you guess wrong, you blow the money," said Hugh O'Neill, an economic consultant and co-author of a New York University report in December that argued against Mayor Giuliani's proposal for the tunnel.
Aides to the mayor, who has not discussed the report publicly and was attending the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia yesterday, said that the report remained under review at City Hall.
"We are reviewing it with an eye toward what would be best for the city," said Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, whose president, Michael Carey, declined to be interviewed.
But the report, paid for by a $3 million federal grant and $2 million from the city, seemed likely to encourage the elected officials, urban planners and others who staunchly back the tunnel project.
"This gives real substance and real empirical evidence" to the benefits of the project, said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, who has long been a proponent of a harbor tunnel as a means of reducing truck traffic and providing rail access to the Brooklyn waterfront.
He envisions the tunnel as a link to a re-energized port terminal in Sunset Park, with the deep water off the Brooklyn waterfront enabling the terminal to be used by a new generation of deep-draft cargo vessels that cannot navigate the shallower channels leading to ports on Staten Island and in New Jersey.
The two-year study, which the city said incorporated detailed analyses by several engineering firms, focused on two paths for the proposed tunnel, each linked to the little-used 65th Street freight yard in Bay Ridge. From there, the tunnel would be dug under the harbor to freight-rail links on Staten Island or in Jersey City. In either case, a tunnel would provide connections to the national freight-rail network.
Cost estimates in the study are provided for tunnels wide enough to accommodate one track or two. They range from $1.4 billion to $2.3 billion.
The cost projections include work that would be required to heighten overpasses and upgrade idle rail tracks in the city, enabling trains to travel from Bay Ridge to the Bronx or to make a connection to Long Island.
The report projected the cost of a new system of freight-carrying barges, which could cross the harbor from several docks in Brooklyn and New Jersey and on Staten Island, at $150 million.
Cargo handling by barge was common in New York Harbor until the early 1960's, but has since all but died away. The report said a new system was necessary as an "essential building block" to foster economic activity until the proposed tunnel was built.
While offering no direct recommendation on financing the project, the study said alternatives in which private investment paid the bulk of the cost should be explored. It said freight carriers would be charged a fee to use the tunnel and that space could be sold for use by electrical utilities, which would lay cables, or by fiber optics companies.

A rail-freight tunnel has been proposed linking Brooklyn with Staten Island or Jersey City, providing New York City with a connection to the nation's existing rail-freight network. In the interim, barges could carry freight from Brooklyn along the Kill Van Kull to the Arlington Yard in Staten Island or across New York Harbor to the Greenville Rail Yard in Jersey City.

HEADLINE: The Man From Midland

 BODY:
It will be 96 days before Republicans know if Gov. George W. Bush was right to bypass standard G.O.P. ideological fare and center this convention on the twin themes of inclusion and personal testimony. But in his well-crafted, highly autobiographical acceptance speech last night, Mr. Bush sought to incite a public appetite for change based on a claim of bringing a new style of leadership to the White House. With flashes of wit and biting ridicule, Mr. Bush derided Vice President Al Gore as the risk-averse partner in an administration that "has coasted through prosperity." Ending his embargo on direct attacks, he said: "They had their chance. They have not led. We will." The underlying invitation was for voters to take a leap of faith on the promise that Mr. Bush will develop into a more effective, resolute and likable leader and role model than Mr. Gore.
This presentation of an admittedly late-blooming candidate as a work in progress carries certain risks. Not since Jimmy Carter has there been a presidential candidate to whom the act of introducing himself to the American people -- of making himself known, trusted and familiar as well as simply famous -- was more important. The speech marked the toughest test the new nominee will face before the debates this fall. 
 The irony of Mr. Bush's situation right now is that, despite the renowned father saluted in the speech, he is actually not very well known even to many supporters. He characterized his six-year stint as governor of Texas as one in which he learned to make tough decisions and work with Democrats. But serving in Austin and having many of his father's advisers around him now will probably have less meaning to the voters than Mr. Bush's attempt to define himself as a man from a different political culture than the one he said was epitomized by Mr. Gore and President Clinton.
In raising two previously unmentionable issues, he affirmed opposition to abortion and support for enforcement of existing gun laws. But in vowing fervently to "tear down that wall" that traps the poor and minorities in prisons and failed schools, he fleshed out more of what he has meant by "compassionate conservatism," implying actual delivery on the "kinder and gentler" Republican policies promised some years ago by his father.
Running a campaign for change is complicated by the fact that Americans are satisfied with the economy, and the polls show them broadly supporting the Democrats' approach on budget issues, as well as education, health care and Social Security. The oratorical doorway for Mr. Bush has been to speak from, and about, his heart as a way of suggesting a more expansive governance without really altering the ideological straitjacket that his party requires its nominees to wear.
The glue that is supposed to hold all this together is his promise of personality suited to the office, yet free of historical baggage. In service of that theme, Mr. Bush invoked the values of Midland and boasted that he would come to Washington without inherited enemies and with "no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years." He asserted that his would be an administration guided by convictions and character rather than polls and focus groups.
A world of difference lies between Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan, the last G.O.P. nominee to stir the kind of hope among Republicans that could be heard last night. But like Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush promised that if given a chance he would rise above expectations, and like Mr. Reagan, he is attempting to create a market for change in the summer convention and then cash in this fall. Also like Mr. Reagan, he promised a regime of homespun values in place of the policy sophistication or taste for legislative maneuvering of Mr. Gore.
In reality, this down-home emphasis is sharply at odds with the privileged educational and financial background of Mr. Bush and many of the delegates here -- a condition that has led some to say this ought to be known as the illusion convention instead of the inclusion convention. But Democrats should make no mistake about the themes laid down here or the stump performance of George W. Bush and even that of his running mate, Richard B. Cheney. They represent a considerable danger for Mr. Gore and his party this fall.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Front and (Very Much) Center

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Close your eyes and Gov. George W. Bush tonight could have been Bill Clinton without the punch -- or Al Gore without the precision.
In fact, in his acceptance speech, the Texas governor and Republican presidential nominee sought to reorient his party to the center with passages that were strikingly similar to Mr. Clinton's speech at the 1992 Democratic convention. 
 His address tonight capped a four-day political production in which Mr. Bush deftly elbowed aside ardent conservatives in an effort to convince America that his party was much like himself -- approachable and open -- and that he is a candidate who can be trusted to safely lead the nation.
It was an ambitious attempt at re-introducing the Republican Party, akin to Richard M. Nixon's drive in 1968 to transform the once solid Democratic South into a Republican stronghold, or Ronald Reagan's "Morning in America" campaign for middle Americans in 1984.
By stressing "idealism and inclusion" and the "forgotten," Mr. Bush sought to give a gracious new twist to the Grand Old Party, moving beyond the battles over impeachment, abortion and culture that had given his party such a harsh face. Rather than invoke Newt Gingrich, Mr. Bush spoke of "a bipartisan approach to governing."
"I don't have enemies to fight," he declared. "And I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect."
Even Democrats conceded that Mr. Bush had mounted an impressive start in setting out a general election campaign that excises the demons that have haunted Republicans by offering a nominee who often sounds very much like his foes.
And already, many Democrats expressed fear that the display here will force Vice President Gore -- whose campaign is entering a crucial phase with the selection of a running mate and then his own convention in Los Angeles -- to aggressively fire back and depict the convention as a masquerade that obscured the party's platform and rigidly rightward voting records.
"Hundreds of jaws are dropping of Democratic members of Congress around the country who are hearing of a Republican commitment to their building of schools, hiring of teachers, commitment to the environment and diversity of government," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey.
Will it work? "It has been skillfully done," Mr. Torricelli said. "The Republicans have succeeded in projecting an image that is not only at total variance with their record but in contradiction of their own platform."
That may be exactly what the Bush campaign wants. The calculation -- or at least the hope -- among Republicans is that they will box Mr. Gore in: The more he tries to portray his opponents as insincere the more the vice president risks appearing mean-spirited and political. That is an important reason that Mr. Gore foundered when he tried to lambasteMr. Bush after the primaries.
And that helps explain why a relentlessly upbeat Mr. Bush managed to topple a popular -- and increasingly defensive -- Gov. Ann Richards in 1994. "The axis upon which a lot of this turns is Bush's experience against Ann Richards," said Richard N. Bond, a former chairman of the Republican Party. "She got shriller and shriller and shriller -- and less believable. That's the experience in which Bush has based his strategy for this campaign and this convention.
In this most formal moment for a determinedly informal man, Mr. Bush allowed as to how he possessed the qualities to reach beyond his own party and unite the nation. He tried to make this most political of speeches appear decidedly apolitical.
"Now is the time," Mr. Bush said, "for Republicans and Democrats to end the politics of fear and save Social Security, together."
Beyond echoing Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush went so far as to laud the president -- even as he was skewering him. "Our current president embodied the potential of a generation," he said. "So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But in the end, to what end?"
As did Mr. Clinton in his acceptance speech eight years ago, Mr. Bush trumpeted themes of compassion and inclusion as he sought to appeal well beyond the Republicans in the hall.
Tonight, Mr. Bush said that when he was growing up in Midland, Tex., "our sense of community was just as strong as that sense of promise." It was from the playbook of Mr. Clinton, who said in 1992, "We can restore our sense of unity and community."
And tonight, Mr. Bush said, "Each of us is responsible to love and guide our children, and help a neighbor in need." It was an echo of Mr. Clinton, who implored his audience eight years ago, "take responsibility for your children."
Beyond that his opponent sounds like a Democrat, there are other complications for Mr. Gore.
Mr. Bush had the enviable luxury of neglecting conservatives -- and reaching out to independents and even Democrats -- because Republicans of all stripes have eagerly embraced his candidacy. But in addition to competing with Mr. Bush for the swing voters, Mr. Gore at his convention will have to tend to restive Democrats who are not altogether content with their candidate.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said Mr. Gore faces a more perilous balancing act than Mr. Bush. "He's got a more difficult line to walk," Mr. Breaux said. "Our job is to make sure the base is comfortable and secure -- but be very aggressive in speaking to the moderate middle."
Mr. Gore also has to contend with the shadow of Bill Clinton.
In an interview on the eve of the convention, Mr. Bush went out of his way to say that there was little need to demonize Mr. Clinton. "The opponent is not President Clinton," he said. "The opponent is Vice President Gore."
Yet Mr. Clinton has been a subtext here all week. It started when Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, voiced the need for people "to respect the president of the United States of America." And tonight, Mr. Bush, by underscoring that "times of plenty" are "tests of American character," the governor left no doubt that he regards Mr. Clinton as a tantalizing villain -- and will truly (albeit subtly) try to make him an issue in this campaign.
To further complicate matters, Mr. Gore also has an interest in seeing Mr. Clinton hover over this campaign. While Mr. Bush's loyalists will try to remind voters of Monica S. Lewinsky, Mr. Gore's will trot out Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary who helped the Clinton-Gore administration preside over the most sustained economic recovery in American history.
While there was a dash of Mr. Clinton in Mr. Bush's address tonight, the Texas governor also capitalized on his opportunity to reach the largest audience that will likely hear him give a speech in this campaign to ply his charm on the public.
Republicans said they were confident that their thoroughly unobjectionable, even warm-hearted, message was carried enough on the news to penetrate the hall, even though most of the proceedings were not even carried by the network.
Mr. Bush's objective tonight was not entirely different from that of Ronald Reagan, who at his convention in Detroit in 1980 sought to convince Americans that beyond his affability, he was up to being commander in chief. Tonight, Mr. Bush remembered "Ronald Reagan's optimism" and -- not to neglect Democrats -- "Harry Truman's integrity."
The thinking of Bush operatives is that if Mr. Bush, like Mr. Reagan, puts to rest worries about his capacity to be president, and reassures moderates that he feels their pain, he can gain the edge by trumping Mr. Gore in the likability category.
"This is all about George Bush being, in essence, not a bad person and a well-meaning person," said William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman. "Therefore he will do what's right and trust me. There's got to be more to it than that."
Mr. Breaux put it this way, "This cannot be a popularity contest."
Republicans do not see it that way. To them, it is all about presenting a likable, inclusive candidate and a likable, inclusive party.
Perhaps they should update Mr. Reagan's wildly successful slogan from 1984, "It's Morning Again in America." Again.

HEADLINE: Taxes as a Part of Life, and Death

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "How Taxes Trickle Down," by Charles W. Kadlec (Op-Ed, Aug. 1): The classic division between Republicans and Democrats rests in the delicate balance between the benefits of social programs and the burden of taxes. In Mr. Kadlec's model, however, tax dollars simply disappear and wealth is equated purely with cash on hand. Any economic model that ignores Social Security, Medicare and education bodes ill for lower- and middle-class Americans.

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS;
Bush Outlines His Goals: 'I Want to Change the Tone of Washington'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of Gov. George W. Bush's speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination last night in Philadelphia, as recorded by The New York Times:
Mr. Chairman delegates, and my fellow citizens, I proudly accept your nomination. 
 Thank you for this honor. Together, we will renew America's purpose.
Our founders first defined that purpose here in Philadelphia.
Ben Franklin was here. Thomas Jefferson. And, of course, George Washington, or, as his friends called him, "George W."
I am proud to have Dick Cheney by my side. He is a man of integrity and sound judgment, who has proven that public service can be noble service. America will be proud to have a leader of such character to succeed Al Gore as vice president of the United States.
I'm grateful for Senator John McCain. I appreciate so very much his speech two nights ago. I appreciate his friendship. I love his spirit for America. And I want to thank the other candidates who sought this office as well. Their convictions have strengthened our party.
I'm especially grateful tonight to my family.
No matter what else I do in my life, asking Laura to marry me was the best decision I ever made.
And to our daughters, Barbara and Jenna, we love you a lot, we're proud of you, and as you head off to college this fall, don't stay out too late. And e-mail your old dad once in a while, will you?
And Mother, everybody loves you and so do I.
Growing up, she gave me love and lots of advice. I gave her white hair.
And I want to thank my dad, the most decent man I have ever known. All my life I have been amazed that a gentle soul could be so strong.
Dad, I am proud to be your son.
My father was the last president of a great generation. A generation of Americans who stormed beaches, liberated concentration camps and delivered us from evil.
Some never came home. Those who did put their medals in drawers, went to work, and built on a heroic scale. Highways and universities, suburbs and factories, great cities and grand alliances -- the strong foundations of an American century.
Now the question comes to the sons and daughters of this achievement: What is asked of us?
This is a remarkable moment in the life of our nation. Never has the promise of prosperity been so vivid. But times of plenty, like times of crises, are tests of American character.
Prosperity can be a tool in our hands, used to build and better our country. Or it can be a drug in our system, dulling our sense of urgency, of empathy, of duty.
Our opportunities are too great, our lives too short to waste this moment. So tonight we vow to our nation: We will seize this moment of American promise. We will use these good times for great goals.
We will confront the hard issues -- threats to our national security, threats to our health and retirement security -- before the challenges of our time become crises for our children.
And we will extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner of this country.
To every man and woman, a chance to succeed. To every child, a chance to learn. And to every family, a chance to live with dignity and hope.
For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has coasted through prosperity. The path of least resistance is always downhill. But America's way is the rising road.
This nation is daring and decent and ready for change.
Our current president embodied the potential of a generation. So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But, in the end, to what end?
So much promise, to no great purpose.
Little more than a decade ago, the cold war thawed and, with the leadership of Presidents Reagan and Bush, that wall came down.
But instead of seizing this moment, the Clinton-Gore administration has squandered it. We have seen a steady erosion of American power and an unsteady exercise of American influence. Our military is low on parts, pay and morale.
If called on by the commander in chief today, two entire divisions of the Army would have to report, "Not ready for duty, sir."
This administration had its moment. They've had their chance. They have not led. We will.
This generation was given the gift of the best education in American history. Yet we do not share that gift with everyone. Seven of 10 fourth graders in our highest poverty schools cannot read a simple children's book.
And still this administration continues on the same old path with the same old programs, while millions are trapped in schools where violence is common and learning is rare.
This administration had its chance. They have not led. We will.
America has a strong economy and a surplus. We have the public resources and the public will, even the bipartisan opportunities, to strengthen Social Security and repair Medicare.
But this administration, during eight years of increasing need, did nothing.
They had their moment. They have not led. We will.
Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values, to show we have grown up before we grow old.
But when the moment for leadership came, this administration did not teach our children, it disillusioned them.
They had their chance. They have not led. We will.
And now they come asking for another chance, another shot.
Our answer?
Not this time.
Not this year.
This is not the time for third chances, it is a time for new beginnings.
The rising generations of this country have our own appointment with greatness. It does not rise or fall with the stock market. It cannot be bought with our wealth.
Greatness is found when American character and American courage overcome American challenges.
When Lewis Morris of New York was about to sign the Declaration of Independence, his brother advised against it, warning he would lose all his property. But Morris, a plainspoken founder, responded: "Damn the consequences, give me the pen." That is the eloquence of American action.
We heard it during World War II, when General Eisenhower told paratroopers on D-Day morning not to worry. And one replied, "We're not worried, General. It's Hitler's turn to worry now."
We heard it in the civil rights movement, when brave men and women did not say "We shall cope," or "We shall see." They said, "We shall overcome."
An American president must call upon that character.
Tonight, in this hall, we resolve to be the party of, not of repose, but of reform.
We will write not footnotes, but chapters in the American story.
We will add the work of our hands to the inheritance of our fathers and mothers and leave this nation greater than we found it.
We know the tests of leadership. The issues are joined.
We will strengthen Social Security and Medicare for the greatest generation, and for generations to come.
Medicare does more than meet the needs of our elderly, it reflects the values of our society.
We will set it on firm financial ground, and make prescription drugs available and affordable for every senior who needs them.
Social Security has been called the "third rail of American politics" -- the one you're not supposed to touch because it might shock you.
But, if you don't touch it, you cannot fix it. And I intend to fix it.
To seniors in this country, you earned your benefits, you made your plans, and President George W. Bush will keep the promise of Social Security. No changes, no reductions, no way.
Our opponents will say otherwise. This is their last, parting ploy, and don't believe a word of it.
Now is the time, now is the time for Republicans and Democrats to end the politics of fear and save Social Security together.
For younger workers, we will give you the option -- your choice -- to put part of your payroll taxes into sound, responsible investments.
This will mean a higher return on your money, and, over 30 or 40 years, a nest egg to help your retirement, or to pass on to your children.
When this money is in your name, in your account, it's just not a program, it's your property. Now is the time to give American workers security and independence that no politician can ever take away.
On education, too many American children are segregated into schools without standards, shuffled from grade to grade because of their age, regardless of their knowledge.
This is discrimination, pure and simple -- the soft bigotry of low expectations.
And our nation should treat it like other forms of discrimination. We should end it.
One size does not fit all when it comes to educating our children, so local people should control local schools.
And those who spend your tax dollars must be held accountable.
When a school district receives federal funds to teach poor children, we expect them to learn. And if they don't, parents should get the money to make a different choice.
Now is the time to make Head Start an early learning program, to teach all our children to read, and renew the promise of America's public schools.
Another test of leadership is tax relief.
The last time taxes were this high as a percentage of our economy, there was a good reason -- we were fighting World War II.
Today, our high taxes fund a surplus. Some say that growing federal surplus means Washington has more money to spend.
But they've got it backwards.
The surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.
I will use this moment of opportunity to bring common sense and fairness to the tax code. And I will act on principle.
On principle every family, every farmer and small-business person, should be free to pass on their life's work to those they love.
So we will abolish the death tax.
On principle no one in America should have to pay a, more than a third of their income to the federal government.
So we will reduce tax rates for everyone, in every bracket.
On principle those in the greatest need should receive the greatest help.
So we will lower the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent and double the child credit.
Now is the time to reform the tax code and share some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills.
The world needs America's strength and leadership, and America's armed forces need better equipment, better training, and better pay.
We will give our military the means to keep the peace, and we will give it one thing more, a commander in chief who respects our men and women in uniform, and a commander in chief who earns their respect.
A generation shaped by Vietnam must remember the lessons of Vietnam.
When America uses force in the world, the cause must be just, the goal must be clear and the victory must be overwhelming.
I will work to reduce nuclear weapons and nuclear tension in the world, to turn these years of influence into decades of peace.
And, at the earliest possible date, my administration will deploy missile defenses to guard against attack and blackmail. Now is the time, not to defend outdated treaties, but to defend the American people.
A time of prosperity is a test of vision. And our nation today needs vision.
That's a fact, or as my opponent might call it, a "risky truth scheme."
Every one of the proposals I've talked about tonight, he's called a "risky scheme," over and over again.
It is the sum of his message -- the politics of the roadblock, the philosophy of the stop sign.
If my opponent had been at the moon launch, it would have been a "risky rocket scheme."
If he'd been there when Edison was testing the light bulb, it would have been a "risky anticandle scheme."
And if he'd been there when the Internet was invented ----
He now leads the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. But the only thing he has to offer is fear itself.
That outlook is typical of many in Washington, always seeing the tunnel at the end of the light.
But I come from a different place, and it has made me a different leader.
In Midland, Tex., where I grew up, the town motto was "the sky's the limit."And we believed it.
There was a restless energy, a basic conviction that with hard work anybody could succeed, and everybody deserved a chance.
Our sense of community was just as strong as that sense of promise.
Neighbors helped each other. There were dry wells and sandstorms to keep you humble, lifelong friends to take your side, and churches to remind us that every soul is equal in value and equal in need.
This background leaves more than an accent, it leaves an outlook: Optimistic, impatient with pretense, confident that people can chart their own course in life.
That background may lack the polish of Washington. Then again, I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington.
I don't have enemies to fight. I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.
The largest lesson I learned in Midland still guides me as governor of Texas: Everyone, from immigrant to entrepreneur, has an equal claim on this country's promise.
So we improved our schools dramatically, for children of every accent, of every background. We moved people from welfare to work. We strengthened our juvenile justice laws.
Our budgets have been balanced, with surpluses, and we cut taxes not only once, but twice.
We accomplished a lot.
I don't deserve all the credit, and I don't attempt to take it. I worked with Republicans and Democrats to get things done.
A bittersweet part of tonight is that someone is missing, the late lieutenant governor of Texas, Bob Bullock. Bob was a Democrat, a crusty veteran of Texas politics, and my great friend.
We worked side by side. He endorsed my re-election, and I know he is with me in spirit in saying to those who would malign our state for political gain: Don't mess with Texas.
As governor, I've made difficult decisions, and stood by them under pressure. I've been where the buck stops, in business and in government.
I've been a chief executive who sets an agenda, sets big goals, and rallies people to believe and achieve them.
I am proud of this record, and I am prepared for the work ahead.
If you give me your trust, I will honor it. Grant me a mandate, I will use it. Give me the opportunity to lead this nation, and I will lead.
And we need a leader to seize the opportunities of this new century -- the new cures of medicine, the amazing technologies that will drive our economy and keep the peace.
But our new economy must never forget the old, unfinished struggle for human dignity.
And here we face a challenge to the very heart and founding premise of our nation.
Couple of years ago, I visited a juvenile jail in Marlin, Tex., and talked with a group of young inmates. They were angry, wary kids. All had committed grown-up crimes.
Yet when I looked in their eyes, I realized some of them were still little boys.
Toward the end of conversation, one young man, about 15 years old, raised his hand and asked a haunting question: "What do you think of me?"
He seemed to be asking, like many Americans who struggle, "Is there hope for me? Do I have a chance?" And, frankly, "Do you, a white man in a suit, really care what happens to me?"
A small voice, but it speaks for so many: single moms struggling to feed the kids and pay the rent; immigrants starting a hard life in a new world; children without fathers in neighborhoods where gangs seem like friendship, where drugs promise peace, and where sex sadly seems like the closest thing to belonging. We are their country, too.
And each of us must share in its promise, or the promise is diminished for all.
If that boy in Marlin believes he's trapped and worthless and hopeless, if he believes his life has no value, then other lives have no value to him, and we are all diminished.
When these problems are not confronted, it builds a wall within our nation.
On one side are wealth, technology, education and ambition.
On the other side of that wall are poverty and prison, addiction and despair.
And, my fellow Americans, we must tear down that wall.
Big government is not the answer. But the alternative to bureaucracy is not indifference.
It is to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity.
This is what I mean by compassionate conservatism. And on this ground we will lead our nation.
We will give low-income Americans tax credits to buy the private health insurance they need and deserve.
We will transform today's housing rental program to help hundreds of thousands of low-income families find stability and dignity in a home of their own.
And, in the next bold step of welfare reform, we will support the heroic work of homeless shelters and hospices, food pantry and crisis pregnancy centers, people reclaiming their communities block by block and heart by heart.
I think of Mary Jo Copeland, whose ministry called "Sharing and Caring Hands" serves 1,000 meals a week in Minneapolis, Minn.
Each day, Mary Jo washes the feet of the homeless, then sends them off with new socks and shoes.
"Look after your feet," she tells them. "They must carry you a long way in this world, and then all the way to God."
Government cannot do this work. It can feed the body, but it cannot reach the soul. Yet government can take the side of these groups, helping the helper, encouraging the inspired.
My administration will give taxpayers new incentives to donate to charity, encourage after-school programs that build character and support mentoring groups that shape and save young lives.
We must give our children a spirit of moral courage, because their character is our destiny.
We must tell them with confidence that drugs and alcohol can destroy you, and bigotry disfigures the heart.
Our schools must support the ideals of parents, elevating character and abstinence from afterthoughts to urgent goals.
We must help protect our children, in our schools and streets, and by finally and strictly enforcing our nation's gun laws.
But most of all, we must teach our children the values that defeat violence.
I will lead our nation toward a culture that values life -- the life of the elderly and sick, the life of the young, and the life of the unborn.
Good people can disagree on this issue, but surely we can agree on ways to value life by promoting adoption, parental notification, and when Congress sends me a bill against partial-birth abortion, I will sign it into law.
Behind every goal I've talked about tonight is a great hope for our country.
A hundred years from now, this must not be remembered as an age rich in possession and poor in ideals.
Instead, we must usher in an era of responsibility.
My generation tested limits and our country, in some ways, is better for it.
Women are now treated more equally. Racial progress has been steady, if still too slow. We are learning to protect the natural world around us.
We will continue this progress, and we will not turn back.
At times, we lost our way. But we're coming home.
So many of us held our first child, and saw a better self reflected in her eyes.
And in that family love, many have found the sign and symbol of an even greater love, and have been touched by faith.
We discovered that who we are is more important than what we have.
And we know we must renew our values to restore our country.
This is the vision of America's founders.
They never saw our nation's greatness in rising wealth or advancing armies, but in small, unnumbered acts of caring and courage and self-denial.
Their highest hope, as Robert Frost described it, was "to occupy the land with character."
And that, 13 generations later, is still our goal: to occupy the land with character.
In a responsibility era, each of us has important tasks, work that only we can do.
Each of us is responsible to love and guide our children, and to help a neighbor in need.
Synagogues, churches and mosques are responsible not only to worship but to serve.
Corporations are responsible to treat their workers fairly, and to leave the air and waters clean.
And our nation's leaders are responsible to confront problems, not pass them on to others.
And to lead this nation to a responsibility era, a president himself must be responsible.
So when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of our land, I will swear to uphold the honor and dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.
I believe the presidency, the final point of decision in the American government, was made for great purposes.
It is the office of Lincoln's conscience, of Teddy Roosevelt's energy, of Harry Truman's integrity and Ronald Reagan's optimism.
For me, gaining this office is not the ambition of a lifetime, but it is the opportunity of a lifetime. And I will make the most of it.
I believe great decisions are made with care, made with conviction, not made with polls.
I do not need to take your pulse before I know my own mind. I do not reinvent myself at every turn. I am not running in borrowed clothes.
When I act, you will know my reasons. And when I speak, you will know my heart.
I believe in tolerance, not in spite of my faith, but because of it.
I believe in a God who calls us not to judge our neighbors but to love them.
I believe in grace, because I've seen it, in peace, because I've felt it, in forgiveness, because I needed it.
I believe true leadership is a process of addition, not an act of division.
I will not attack a part of this country, because I want to lead the whole of it.
And I believe this'll be a tough race, down to the wire.
Their war room is up and running, but we are ready. Their attacks will be relentless, but they will be answered. We are facing something familiar, but they're facing something new.
We are now the party of ideas and innovation, the party of idealism and inclusion. The party of a simple and powerful hope.
My fellow citizens, we can begin again.
After all of the shouting and all of the scandal, after all the bitterness and broken faith, we can begin again.
The wait has been long, but it won't be long now.
A prosperous nation is ready to renew its purpose and unite behind great goals, and it won't be long now.
Our nation must renew the hopes of that boy I talked with in jail, and so many like him, and it won't be long now.
Our country is ready for high standards and new leaders, and it won't be long now.
An era of tarnished ideals is giving way to a responsibility era, and it won't be long now.
I know how serious the task is before me.
I know the presidency is an office that turns pride into prayer.
But I am eager to start on the work ahead. And I believe America is ready for a new beginning.
My friend, the artist Tom Lea of El Paso, Tex., captured the way I feel about our great land, a land I love.
He and his wife, he said, "live on the east side of the mountain. It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side. It is the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone."
Americans live on the sunrise side of mountain.
The night is passing.
And we are ready for the day to come.
God bless. God bless America.

HEADLINE: Will That Be Paper or Pixel?;
Kodak Rushes To Extend It's Brand to All Things Digital

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Kodak name is showing up in a lot more places these days.
It sits above Lexmark International's logo on an inkjet printer, one of the first to print photographs directly from a digital camera. 
 It is on Duralite, Kodak's premium-priced new untearable photographic inkjet paper, and on Kodak Picture Processing, a new retail service that gives customers the option of paying more for prints made on Duralite.
And it is all over the Web. Eastman Kodak has not only beefed up the photo-related services it offers on its own but has also taken stakes in numerous Internet companies that put Kodak's name on their sites. Then there are the partnerships with other dot-coms that trumpet their use of Kodak processing and papers.
Kodak-branded printers, papers, Web services? "They are feeling things out to see which channels will ultimately be the most valuable for extending their brand," said Lia M. Schubert, an analyst at the Boston-based Infotrends Research Group.
Indeed, the unifying theme of the latest products to carry the Kodak brand is that they have nothing to do with capturing images, Kodak's traditional forte, and everything to do with "repurposing" them -- industry parlance for the many high-tech ways that people now view, swap, manipulate, store, print and display images. And they are all part of the company's full-court press to associate its brand as much with the output side of digital photography as it has been with the input side of silver halide film.
It is no small task. While consumers often ask for Kodak film by name, they usually associate the prints they get back with the retail store where they dropped the film off. "No one looks at the back of a photo for the Kodak watermark," said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman & Reid.
Nor is the output process confined to simple prints. Today, with scanners, stand-alone kiosks that let consumers doctor photos and print them, and digitally savvy photo-processing stores, even users of the most basic cameras can opt for electronic prints on a compact disc or delivered by e-mail, or prints uploaded to a Web site.
"Bricks and mortar, clicks and mortar, just clicks -- online photo activity is so embryonic that we want to be a part of all of it," said Robert J. Keegan, president of Kodak's consumer imaging unit.
For Kodak, that means a choppy sail through uncharted, and possibly shark-infested, waters. When Kodak offers photo services on its Web site or invests in photo-services start-ups, it is competing with its retail customers. When its brand is on a dot-com's Web site, it risks being tarnished if the dot-com provides less than stellar quality or service.
Still, Kodak is putting 65 percent of its research budget into various digital technologies, hoping that at least some of its bets are on winners.
"People free-associate Kodak's brand with photography, but we want them to associate it with pictures in all their forms," said Daniel A. Carp, Kodak's chief executive. "Still, we can't know what consumers want because consumers don't yet know what they want."
Kodak had best learn fast. Its sales of film remain strong, but digital cameras are quickly gaining share. And though Kodak's digital cameras sell well, cameras are not where it makes most of its money. Most photography companies get the bulk of their revenue from consumables like chemicals, papers and, most of all, film -- a product that digital cameras make obsolete.
In June, Mr. Carp promised investors that Kodak's revenue, which was $14 billion last year, would hit $24 billion in 2005. But he conceded that the faster that digital technologies sweep through the photography world, the slower Kodak's profits will grow. Shareholders seem wary. Kodak's stock, which closed unchanged yesterday at $57.75, is mired at less than 11 times earnings.
Even so, the digital revolution is not all doom and gloom for Kodak. Study after study shows that people who use digital cameras take more pictures and make more prints. The same studies show that all but the most diehard hobbyists are having prints made in the conventional way.
"The sweet spot in this market isn't the guy with the $4,000 digital camera, but the people who are just learning about e-sharing photos," said Daniel P. Palumbo, Kodak's chief marketing officer for consumer imaging.
Indeed, when Tom Cruise's character in "M:i-2," the "Mission Impossible" sequel, used a Kodak digital camera, it gave a big lift to digital camera sales -- and to conventional photo processing.
"Since that movie opened, more people are asking us to make prints from their new digital cameras," said Mitchell B. Goldstone, who owns 30 Minute Photos Etc. in Irvine, Calif. " 'M:i-2' is doing for digital photography what 'Men in Black' did for Ray-Ban sunglasses."
Still, it is a big leap from the halo effect on digital photography in general to a boost for Kodak specifically. And Kodak is not just battling Fuji or its other old-economy nemeses; in the digital space it is up against Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Panasonic and other electronics experts.
Lesser-known players are often happy to piggyback on the Kodak name. "What better way to build a photo-printer business than to tie up with the best-known name in photos?" asked Gary E. Morin, Lexmark International's chief financial officer.
But the digital world's leading lights are competitors first and partners second, if at all.
Kodak and Hewlett-Packard, for instance, just introduced a jointly branded miniphotography lab that lets photo processors make prints from digital cameras. But Hewlett, which once had a cobranding agreement with Kodak on printer paper, now sells its own branded paper. It is a competitor in digital cameras and inkjet printers. It is also offering numerous photo-related services on its Web site -- including a free service for creating online photo albums -- and is establishing links to its site from other Internet sites.
"We'll work with whoever we think has a world-class product," said Vyomesh Joshi, general manager of HP Inkjet Imaging Systems.
So will Adobe Systems, which makes photo-related software. It has links from its Web page to various photo-related companies. It does not disdain brand names, but it does not seek them out.
"We want to find the most compelling services, whether from established companies like Kodak or from one of those start-ups that pop up like mushrooms after a rain," said Dennis A. Marshall, Adobe's director of consumer digital imaging.
The growing competition has spurred Kodak's marketing mavens to action. In November, they began to set a strategy for disassociating Kodak's brand with emotional but mundane picture-taking and linking it instead to high-tech innovations.
"In the old economy our branding strategy revolved around making familiar things desirable," said Carl E. Gustin, Kodak's chief marketing officer. "In the new economy, we have to make novel things familiar."
Kodak now has 105 people working exclusively on building Kodak.com, the company's interactive Web site; most of them report to Robert L. LaPerle, director of operational excellence for Kodak.com -- a position just created last month.
Kodak's researchers, meanwhile, are looking into ways to let solid- state image sensors, the piece of silicon that works as a digital camera's "film," capture more than just images -- to, say, embed the photographer's name for copyright protection, or include crucial information that makes it easier to retrieve the image from an electronic archive.
The researchers also have combined the company's age-old knowledge of dye chemistry with its growing knowledge of electrons to create an organic light emitting diode, called the Oled (pronounced OH-led), which provides a sharper electronic image than the liquid crystal diodes normally used in cell phone displays, automotive dashboards and the like. The Oled already is the guts of the display on Pioneer Electronic's car audio systems.
Kodak's name is nowhere on those items now. But Kodak has prototype Oleds that can display games, movies and other complex images on cell phones and hand-held digital devices. And when those are ready for market, the company has every intention of fighting to get its technology noted, a la the ubiquitous "Intel Inside" stickers on computers that use Intel chips.
"First we must nurture the technology, prove that it works," said James C. Stoffel, Kodak's chief technology officer. "But down the road, we see this enhancing our brand."
Kodak is nurturing the technologies of numerous Web-based start-ups, too. It has invested in Snapfish .com, which offers online photo processing; ememories.com, an online photo archivist; MyFamily.com, which helps families set up home pages; IFilm, a Web service for filmmakers; and Weave Innovations, which makes a picture frame that displays photographs downloaded from the Web without a computer.
In doing so, Kodak is walking a customer-relations minefield: many of these companies offer free film, developing or other services that Kodak customers sell.
"Kodak is taking equity in companies that give away everything on which our revenue models are based," said an annoyed Gary Tashjian, marketing vice president for PhotoWorks Inc., a photo services company that has long used Kodak papers -- and that itself offers archiving and other online freebies.
Kodak's archrival in conventional photography, Fuji Photofilm USA, has taken a different tack, promoting fujifilm.net, its online page of Web services, more as a service for retailers than for consumers.
"We want retail customers to use our online photo finishing and storage to promote their own brands," said Rod H. King, Fuji's vice president for consumer markets.
Kodak executives insist they feel the same, saying that the company will not sell film online or offer discounts for online printing services ordered on its Web page.
Its much-ballyhooed "You've Got Pictures" agreement with America Online enables Kodak-affiliated photoprocessors to deliver electronic versions of pictures to customers via e-mail. And Kodak designed and runs the photo services section of CVS.com, the drugstore chain's interactive Web site. Kodak would certainly love it if CVS's photo-processing customers registered their names on Kodak's own Web site, but it realizes that it must sometimes remain behind the scenes.
"Retailers aren't fools -- they don't give away customers capriciously," said Philip Gerskovich, chief operating officer for Kodak's digital and applied imaging unit. "We're establishing an infrastructure for handling images on the Web, and for now, we're not going to get hung up on who owns the customer."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICANS: THE MONEY;
Companies Ended Soft Donations But Still Play the Influence Game

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 3

 BODY:
When General Motors became the first corporation to voluntarily stop writing large checks to political parties in 1997, the automaker's executives sent a powerful message that they were disgusted by the political culture of cash and influence.
"It's the principle," G.M.'s vice chairman, Harry J. Pearce, said after announcing the decision in May 1997. 
 Since then, G.M. has stuck to its pledge to forswear soft money, the unrestricted gifts, after donating $750,000 to political parties in 1996.
But outside the convention hall and around town this week, G.M., the nation's largest automaker, demonstrated that it had hardly abandoned the campaign finance arena, finding different ways to curry favor with current -- and possibly future -- Republican leaders.
G.M. provided 400 Cadillacs, sport utility vehicles and minivans for use by the organizers of the Republican National Convention, part of a package of "in-kind contributions" that the host committee here estimated was worth $1 million. The automaker is one of many companies that are providing in-kind donations at this convention, and at the Democratic gathering, as they have in the past.
And today, G.M. sponsored two lunch receptions at different downtown locales -- one honored the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and the other saluted Lawrence B. Lindsey, the chief economic adviser to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
Of the more than 30 corporations that have eschewed soft money, G.M. is not the only company here to play the political influence game without handing out checks.
Time Warner, which stopped making soft money donations last year, was one of the sponsors of a gaudy packed party on Wednesday night at the nightclub Shampoo to honor a group of House lawmakers.
G.M.'s receptions were less flashy but attracted more high-powered political stars.
At the lunch at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, G.M. designers showed off the newest prototypes, called concept cars, for Mr. Hastert, an unabashed automobile buff. The speaker was joined by members of the House Transportation Committee and was given a miniature replica of a vintage G.M. truck, a 1950 Chevrolet Bullnose pickup, that he is restoring at home in Illinois. The menu was seared tuna, red wine and strawberry souffle.
After lunch, Mr. Hastert squeezed into several of the concept cars on display, including a voice-activated Buick.
"You are leading the way and creating the transportation system that is leading the world," Mr. Hastert told G.M. executives. "We salute you and your industry."
Meanwhile, across town, G.M. and G.M.A.C. Financial Services held a brunch honoring Mr. Lindsey, the lead economic adviser to Mr. Bush who is also a consultant to G.M.A.C. and a board member of its subsidiary, Escrow Bank U.S.A. of Salt Lake City.
The brunch allowed G.M. to showcase its relationship with Mr. Lindsey. In his introduction, John Finnegan, the chairman of G.M.A.C., hailed Mr. Lindsey as "one of the best economic minds in the nation."
After speaking to a group of 100 G.M. executives, lobbyists and a few House members, Mr. Lindsey seemed surprised when he was asked if it was appropriate for the automaker to sponsor the brunch.
"I have had a three-year relationship with G.M.," Mr. Lindsey, 46, said. "It's a natural thing to do."
Several G.M.A.C. vice presidents drew a distinction between the corporation's discarded practice of making soft-money donations and their current practice of holding receptions for consultants and lawmakers.
"It's not the game we like to play," a G.M.A.C. senior vice president, Scott Rombach, said of the practice of giving soft money. "But this is different."
Another G.M.A.C. vice president, Jim Farmer, said, "This is just a kind gesture to Larry."
With much fanfare last November, Time Warner announced it would no longer make soft money donations. The company's chairman, Gerald M. Levin, said much of the soft money had been used for misleading and negative advertising that had cheapened political dialogue.
Late on Wednesday night, Time Warner's raucous party was attended by about 1,000 lobbyists, House staff members and journalists. As thousands of free drinks were served and the singers Jon Secada and Celia Cruz performed, the attendees toasted Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida and the House Entertainment Industry Task Force, a loose coalition of House members whose decisions affect the media and entertainment industries.
The party was also sponsored by News Corporation, Seagram's Universal Studios, the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America, Viacom and the Walt Disney Corporation.
Edward Adler, a senior vice president at Time Warner, did not return telephone calls today.
Another party sponsor, Viacom, the parent of CBS, gives virtually no soft money to political parties, but its political action committee contributes sizable sums to candidates.
In recent months, several corporations have stopped giving soft money because their executives have said that they had found better uses for their resources, like lobbying, building political action committees and sponsoring fund-raising events. Some executives have complained that it is harder to justify the expense of large contributions to shareholders because the membership fees of the parties' most elite donor clubs have outpaced the rate of inflation, jumping this year to $250,000 from $100,000 .
Executives at other corporations that sponsored parties and receptions this week said they believed the events were most effective at marketing the corporate brand names to conventiongoers.
Providing 400 vehicles to the host committee is "a great product exposure opportunity for us," said William Noack, a G.M. spokesman attending the convention. "We also do it for the Olympics and events like that."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
International Merger Wave Catches Europe's Law Firms

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Pushed by globalization and a boom in corporate law involving mergers and acquisitions, law firms in Europe are undergoing some mergers and acquisitions of their own.
The changes are also affecting law firms in the United States, as links are forged across the Atlantic. But they are confronting the firms with the challenges of bridging differences in culture, mentality and business practices. 
 This year, at least six mergers have redefined some of the landscape for lawyers in Britain and Germany, most recently on Monday when Herbert Smith of London announced a strategic alliance with Gleiss Lutz Hootz Hirsch, of Stuttgart, Germany. At the same time, two mergers have been struck across the Atlantic. In January, Clifford Chance, a leading London law firm, merged with Rogers & Wells in New York and Punder, Volhard, Weber & Axster in Frankfurt, pooling 3,100 lawyers to form the world's largest firm. In June, Titmuss Sainer Dechert of London announced that it was merging, after a loose six-year alliance, with Dechert Price & Rhoads of Philadelphia.
"More and more transactions are coming along that require capabilities in several jurisdictions," said Anthony Cann, senior partner at Linklaters, a leading London firm. Last month, Linklaters transformed an alliance with Oppenhoff & Radler of Germany into a full merger.
Initially, the Continental law firms feared what looked like a British invasion. Linklaters, for instance, expanded in France in 1998 by hiring the cream of a top Paris law firm, Gide Loyrette Nouel. Last year, Linklaters reaped the rewards, obtaining lucrative work in a hostile-takeover battle among three of France's biggest banks, the acquisition by the Total oil group of Fina of Belgium, and a shopping spree by the big retailer Carrefour.
Developments at Linklaters also reflect the opening of Continental firms to British influence. In 1998, several European firms that had previously allied, including Oppenhoff & Radler, offered Linklaters a place in the alliance in order to gain access to Britain. Linklaters, Mr. Cann said, insisted on a joint integrated partnership, meaning "we brand together, we bill together, we work together." Last week, Linklaters announced the merger with Oppenhoff & Radler. "Germany is clearly a very strategic jurisdiction," he said.
Other partners are not sure what sort of relationship to pursue. Last year, a leading Italian firm, Gianni, Origoni & Partners, joined the Linklaters alliance. But Gian Battista Origoni del Croce, a partner, said his firm was not prepared for a merger.
The alliance has brought benefits, he said, "certainly in terms of culture, in terms of methodology, international know-how." He added, "Certain Anglo-Saxon practices are prevailing, and will prevail, so there's a lot to learn."
In Madrid, Uria & Menendez, a leading firm, was among the original alliance partners, yet it dropped out last year, figuring that it could survive alone. With the Spanish market flourishing, notably in telecommunications and utilities, and big Spanish banks and industrial companies on buying sprees in Latin America, Uria & Menendez is booming.
The consolidation in Europe's legal industry partly reflects changes in several countries. In 1993, for instance, Britain dropped rules preventing British lawyers from practicing with lawyers not admitted in Britain. Three years earlier, Germany eliminated curbs on lawyers' practicing in more than one city.
But the real push came with the wave of mergers and acquisitions encouraged by the single European currency, forcing European governments to sell nationalized industries to meet budgetary requirements and leading to the burgeoning of capital markets to finance increased corporate financial activity. American and British firms were helped by the role of New York and London as financial capitals and their experience in handling the legal work behind corporate finance.
In part, the British offensive on the Continent was a reaction to the success of American law firms, which followed American investment banks into the lucrative new world of European privatization, mergers and acquisitions.
In 1996, for instance, when Germany sold shares worth $13 billion in its phone monopoly, Deutsche Telekom, the transaction was handled by two New York law firms, Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton and Sullivan & Cromwell, Two years later, when Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler, and the Frankfurt stock exchange began seeking a link with its London counterpart, much of the legal work went to Sullivan & Cromwell. In Italy, when an investor group made a hostile bid for Telecom Italia, which helped set the wave of mergers and acquisitions in motion, Sullivan & Cromwell got much of that work.
In the process, British and American work habits are prevailing. Ward Bower, a principal at Altman Weil, legal consultants in Philadelphia, says anecdotal evidence indicates that while typical partners in an American firm put in about 1,800 billable hours a year, their British counterparts put in up to one-third fewer hours, and lawyers on the Continent still fewer. And while British firms pay partners based on seniority, many American law firms follow the principle of "eat what you kill," compensating lawyers for the amount of fresh business they generate.
Moreover, the boom has created a rush for talent throughout Europe, driving up lawyers' starting salaries, which have already been inflated by competition for law school graduates from banks, financial companies and dot-com startups.
Still, American firms believe increasingly that they cannot stay away. "If you are not able to serve clients all over the world, maybe someone else can," said Jason Kravitt, co-chairman of Mayer, Brown & Platt in Chicago, one of many United States firms seeking to expand in Europe.
Others, however, like Mr. Bower of Altman Weil, say that further trans-Atlantic mergers may take a while to come. "I don't see it until the next recession," he said, when law firms are forced to muster their assets and economize. "Right now, they are fat and happy."

A Role for the Concorde, Even With Its High Costs

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The crash of the Air France supersonic Concorde brought down a plane that by common measurements can hardly be profitable, given its high maintenance costs, daunting fuel bills, little passenger space, and no cargo. Yet any decision to permanently ground the Concorde could have deep financial implications for the two airlines that run it.
Airline industry analysts say the Concorde is part of a strategy, particularly by British Airways, to lure high-end corporate travelers, the favored target of airlines, to the Concorde's speedy flights between the financial capitals of London and New York, and to connecting flights on slower aircraft beyond. Its loss, they say, would divert these customers to other airlines, notably in the United States, or to corporate jet travel. 
 "It helps to tie in your very high- end customers," said Damien Horth, an analyst at ABN-Amro in London.
Neither airline has suggested it would quit flying the Concorde because of the crash, the first deadly accident in the plane's 25-year history. But talk that the Concorde has outlived its usefulness has persisted, and no other supersonic jetliners are in development.
In Paris today, Air France employees called on the airline to resume flying the remaining six Concordes, which were grounded by the French transport ministry until experts could clarify the cause of the crash July 25 that killed 113 people.
British Airways resumed its Concorde flights the day after the crash, but the planes have been flying half empty, and mechanical and safety issues have haunted nearly every flight. On Tuesday, for instance, the London-New York flight was delayed 75 minutes because of an engine problem and the passengers had to board a second Concorde, losing most of the time they would have gained from the plane's high speed.
Revenue from the Concorde is estimated to account for only 1 percent to 2 percent of the total at Air France, and slightly more at British Airways. Yet Robin Horne, an analyst at HSBC Securities in London, says neither airline is entirely open about the Concorde's financial performance, and he believes that the planes "don't make much money."
Depreciation -- the decreased value of something because of wear and tear -- has never been a factor in accounting for the operating cost of the Concorde, as it is for other aircraft. The reason is that the planes were in effect given to the airlines by the British and French governments, which footed the bill for their development.
Yet almost alone among commercial jetliners, the Concorde carries a cockpit crew of three instead of two, and it lacks cargo capacity. Crew members work fewer hours than on subsonic planes and their training is almost twice as long as that of other pilots, and hence more costly.
Moreover, the Concorde is more expensive to maintain. British Airways says its seven Concordes get up to 57 hours of maintenance for every hour in the air, far more than what is accorded subsonic aircraft. Fuel consumption, too, makes them expensive to run. The Concorde burns about 4,670 gallons of kerosene for every hour of flight, compared with 2,340 gallons for the Boeing 747-400, Boeing's biggest aircraft. Yet the 747 carries roughly 400 passengers, four times that of the Concorde.
Thus, many analysts believe that a modern Boeing 747 or 777, with several dozen first-class passengers, who pay only about 20 percent less than on the Concorde, easily earns as much as or more than a Concorde.
"I'm not sure how profitable they are," said Matthew Stainer, an analyst at SG Securities. Given its fuel-guzzling habits, he added, the Concorde has felt the brunt of recent increases in airline fuel prices "more than most of the fleet."
And yet, despite its marginal profitability, analysts say the Concorde more than earns its keep, at least for British Airways, by its ability to draw large numbers of first-class and business-class travelers, who pay high premiums. Cutting the Concorde out of the fleet, said Daniel Solon, director of Avmark International, a London airline consulting firm, would expose the airlines to a "double hazard."
Though it is hard to quantify, as economies globalize and New York and London have emerged as the world's principal financial centers, British Airways has capitalized on increased traffic between Wall Street and the City, London's financial district -- effectively using the Concorde to lure what some analysts call the "Goldman Sachs crowd."
Particularly on westbound traffic, analysts said, the Concorde is attractive to corporate executives and investment bankers since it enables them to cheat the clock, arriving in New York at an earlier local hour than they left London or Paris.
A further inducement to the premium traveler has been the Concorde service's preferential treatment of passengers that expedites them through customs, passport control and baggage checking, and offers them a traveling environment closer to that of a corporate jet, yet at supersonic speed.
But both British Airways and Air France have also been able to attract premium travelers from farther afield, enabling customers from, say, Dubai or Moscow, to travel to London or Paris, then take the Concorde on to New York. "Concorde is a fantastic marketing tool for B.A.," said Mr. Horne of HSBC.
Without the Concorde, to be sure, some of these travelers would shift to subsonic flights offered by British Airways or Air France. But experts like Mr. Solon believe many would instead use corporate jets. Others, particularly Americans, would desert British Airways and Air France, preferring to fly their customary United States airline, they said.

Modest Job Growth Helps Major Market Indexes Rise

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher yesterday after the Labor Department reported that private job growth had been slower than expected last month.
The data appears to make an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this month less likely. And the restrained job growth helps confirm the belief of some analysts that the central bank will not need any more rate increases later this year to slow economic growth to a noninflationary pace. 
 "I said one more rate hike," Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company in Rye Brook, N.Y., said. "These numbers make me look wrong."
At the same time, there is some concern about corporate earnings. Second-quarter earnings have been stronger than expected, increasing 21.2 percent so far, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. But a lot of companies have announced that they do not expect to meet earnings forecasts for the rest of the year.
"We are still in a period of trying to rationalize very high earnings expectations," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. "If you think that the economy is going to grow at 3.5 percent instead of 4.5 percent, you are too high. You've got to do something."
In addition, Federal Reserve policy makers have other important July economic data to review before they meet on Aug. 22, including retail sales and the Consumer Price Index. If retail sales are unexpectedly strong, which would signal a rebound in spending, rate-increase fears would presumably revive.
Yesterday, stock prices moved up and down all day. Early on, the Nasdaq composite index was up 87 points, or 2.3 percent. But it reversed and at one time was down 8 points. The Nasdaq finished the day up 27.48 points, or 0.73 percent, at 3,787.36.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.17 points, or 0.57 percent, to 10,767.75. Early in the day, the Dow was off 41 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 10.37 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,462.93. Market breadth was positive.
The performance of Dow industrial stocks showed how the optimistic outlook for interest rates versus the concern about earnings, especially in technology, played out yesterday. The Dow was led higher by financial stocks including J. P. Morgan and American Express, which would be hurt by higher rates. Drags on the Dow included the technology giants Intel and Microsoft, as well as Eastman Kodak, which told investors in July that it was losing market share.
Bond prices and yields also bounced around yesterday as investors tried to understand the import of the new jobs data. By late afternoon, the price of the 10-year Treasury note had climbed 13/32, to 104 12/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.89 percent from 5.95 percent on Thursday, the lowest since April. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.71 percent from 5.74 percent. Next week, the Treasury will sell $25 billion in new securities.
The employment data showed that private-sector jobs rose by 138,000 in July, less than in June and less than the 182,000 average for the first six months of the year. Analysts said the 291,000 increase in the pool of available workers indicated there might be some slack developing in a very tight labor market.
Mr. Barbera of Hoenig said that the most important matter facing investors is not whether there will be one more interest rate increase by the Fed. What is more important, he maintained, is that corporate earnings are probably going to slow more than even worried investors expect.
The strong earnings growth in the first and second quarters, he argued, was the peak. He said investors were focusing more on the positive expectation that the Fed could guide the economy to a soft landing, avoiding recession, than the effect that a slowdown in growth would presumably have on corporate earnings.

HEADLINE: Chips Off the P.& G. Block;
Can a Start-Up Clean Up With Cast-Off Brands?

BYLINE: By KRUTI TRIVEDI 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI

 BODY:
Todd Wichmann and Richard Owen barreled into the Procter & Gamble headquarters last month and were about to head upstairs when the security guard stopped them.
Waiting for permission to enter a place they had worked almost all their adult lives felt "bizarre, weird," Mr. Wichmann (pronounced WICK-man) said as he fiddled with his red visitor's badge. 
 He and Mr. Owen had just quit their jobs at P.& G. to form Redox Brands Inc., a company that specializes in buying once-famous laundry and cleaning brands that giants like their former employer are discarding. Their first -- and so far only -- purchase was Procter & Gamble's Oxydol laundry detergent brand, in a deal that calls for P.& G. to continue to be involved in the product. The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
In some ways, Redox's timing could not be better: behemoths like P.& G., hoping to assuage Wall Street's anxiety over sagging earnings, are becoming more aggressive in dropping brands that are no longer among the market leaders.
But building a strong company out of a collection of jilted labels is tough going. Other companies, notably in the food industry, have tried; few have succeeded.
"Buying an orphaned brand isn't necessarily a challenge," said David A. Goldman, director of equity research at SunTrust Equitable Securities. "Consolidating them into one entity that makes sense, has operational efficiencies, and has critical mass, well, that's another matter."
Besides, many industry experts say, giants like Procter & Gamble do not shed brands unless they have a good reason to do so.
Although P.& G. would not comment on its relationship with Redox or the specifics of the deal, it said in a prepared statement that Oxydol, which represented a minute portion of company sales, "no longer provided a strategic fit."
Oxydol was P.& G.'s oldest brand of laundry detergent, introduced in 1927. While it has a long history -- it sponsored the "Ma Perkins" radio show, the first so-called soap opera, in 1933 -- naysayers doubt that a rich heritage convinces consumers to buy a detergent.
"The question is: Is Oxydol such an ancient brand that it is valueless and not worth it to revive it?" said Clive Chajet of Chajet Consultancy, a branding consultant in New York. "As far as I'm concerned, they're starting from scratch in a category where it's hard to differentiate one brand from another."
Sales of Oxydol have been sinking over the decade and are dwarfed by those of the market leader, P.& G.'s Tide.
Despite all this, Mr. Wichmann, 30, and Mr. Owen, 31, are convinced they will succeed. Their aim is to increase Oxydol's share of the $6 billion market for liquid and powdered detergent to 2 percent in the next five years from its current one-tenth of a percent. (By comparison, Mr. Wichmann said, Tide now has around 35 percent of the market.)
Though they are dealing in an old- economy business, they say, they are helped by some new-economy factors. The expansion of contract sales makes it easier for them to hire a company to sell their products. Internet technology allows them to hold "virtual" meetings with business contacts, slashing travel costs.
And as companies like Proctor & Gamble and Unilever scramble to shed old brands, Mr. Wichmann and Mr. Owen have a steady stream of product offerings from which to choose. In addition to Oxydol, for example, P.& G. recently put Biz, a bleach detergent, up for sale. (The men would not comment on whether Redox was considering acquiring it.)
Mr. Wichmann, the Redox president, and Mr. Owen, the chief operating officer, also say they have two distinct tactical advantages.
First, instead of buying the leader in small markets -- a model exemplified by Aurora Foods Inc., which has bought brands including Duncan Hines, Log Cabin and Van de Kamp's, with some success -- they will buy small brands in large markets. That way, they can focus on competing for customers rather than trying to expand a market.
Second, they can tailor their packaging and pricing to fit the needs of smaller retailers, something that larger, bureaucratized companies cannot do.
"Twenty years ago or even five years ago, there was no way to do what we're doing," Mr. Wichmann said. "We want to be a virtual organization. We don't want any plants. We don't want any money going to fixed assets."
He can make such a bold statement in part because he has P.& G. in his corner.
Under the deal, Procter & Gamble, arguably the American consumer products company with the greatest influence among retailers, will still take care of the ordering, shipping and billing systems used for Oxydol, which will continue to be made at a P.& G. plant. It also has an undisclosed minority stake in the company. Redox, based in the Cincinnati suburb of West Chester, Ohio, will be making the strategic decisions.
Mr. Wichmann and Mr. Owen acknowledge that their former employer influences their decisions. "Our relationship with P.& G. is very important and we do live by their rules," Mr. Wichmann said.
Though bitten by the entrepreneurial bug early on, the men were, after all, trained by the company whose employees are widely known as "Proctoids," distinguished by their efficiency and obedience.
Mr. Owen and Mr. Wichmann met as interns at the company in the summer of 1991, both researching laundry detergents. They cemented their relationship when they returned after graduating the next year. Though both started at P.& G. as chemical engineers, Mr. Wichmann, who worked on Oxydol early on, later went into marketing while Mr. Owen joined the sales and finance side.
They started business school together in 1994, attending Xavier University at night. For their final project, the pair designed the American Detergent Corporation, a hypothetical company that bought Oxydol from Procter & Gamble -- a brand they said they chose somewhat randomly.
Their professor, Sandy Eustis, was impressed by their enthusiasm but did not like their business plan. He voiced concerns that have since been echoed by Redox's critics.
"I said, 'Why would you want to go into a business that's dominated by huge players?' " recalled Dr. Eustis, who is now executive director of the Center for Adaptive Management, a nonprofit research group in Cincinnati. "It's a slow-growth, mature industry dominated by large players who spend huge sums of money on consumer marketing and advertising, and that presents real difficulties for a smaller, entrepreneurial company."
The men were not deterred. When the announcement of the Oxydol sale popped up on the office intranet in March, Mr. Wichmann knew he had to talk to Mr. Owen.
P.& G. had long neglected Oxydol; the detergent did not even have the company's fixture of a brand manager to babysit the product. Though P.& G. did not see much of a future for the brand, the two men did.
While he drove home the night of the announcement, Mr. Wichmann called Mr. Owen from his cell phone. All he needed to say was, "Hey, Rich, American Detergent Corporation might be in business."
As they hatched their plans over the weekend, Mr. Wichmann said, they found themselves in a chicken-and-egg situation.
They had to persuade P. &G. to sell the brand to them instead of to an established company with deep pockets. "We knew we needed to have a big angle for Procter & Gamble to want to do this," Mr. Owen said. "This thing had to be much bigger than just Oxydol."
To do that, they needed to assure P. &G. that they had strong backers. But to get those backers, they had to convince venture capitalists that P.& G. was intent on completing the sale. They also needed to keep their identity a secret so that if the deal did not go through, they would still have their jobs.
"There really was this covert operation going on," Mr. Owen said. Mr. Wichmann decided they needed some outside help, so he called Dr. Eustis, who referred him to Robert Buechner, a childhood basketball buddy and Cincinnati lawyer.
The lawyer was intrigued with their idea. He helped them write an anonymous bid and began introducing them to venture capitalists, bankers and accountants.
During their lunch breaks and before and after work, Mr. Wichmann and Mr. Owen would meet with potential backers. They decided to wear khakis and shirts, the unofficial Procter & Gamble uniform, to those meetings.
"If you wear a suit at Procter and Gamble, that's a sign you're interviewing," Mr. Wichmann said. "I didn't want to tip my hand."
After two months of sub rosa maneuvering they had to reveal that they were the anonymous bidders for Oxydol at P.& G.'s demand. The men made a point of telling their respective bosses on the same day.
"I actually had one of my bosses say, 'Rich, have you thought this through?" Mr. Owen said. " 'What happens if Procter & Gamble considers you a competitor?' I thought, I've got my family and my resume."
P.& G. was impressed by their plan. Company officials even spoke to venture capitalists on their behalf, the pair said, and a group of investors led by the Meriwether Capital Corporation in New York agreed to finance Redox. The deal for Oxydol was completed in a month, and both men were allowed to keep their jobs until it was done.
Lately, Mr. Owen and Mr. Wichmann have been busy preparing Oxydol for the first Redox ship date this September. And in a recent conference call, they discovered some of the difficulties of being so closely tied to Procter & Gamble. For every 600 boxes sold, the men want to give retailers 300 boxes free. P.& G.'s system is not configured to handle free boxes, so they have to find another way to distribute them. They are also working on formulating a liquid detergent, and preparing a radio campaign.
They are trying hard, meantime, to establish their own identity, separate from Procter & Gamble.
Their first trip back to P.& G. went well. Former colleagues kept dropping by, curious how Mr. Owen and Mr. Wichmann were making out in what they call "the real world."
While they were getting ready to leave their meeting, Mr. Owen noticed a small green packet of Oxydol on the shelf. "You guys were supposed to turn over all of the product!" he teased the P.& G. representative. She and the partners shared a laugh.
As he walked toward the elevator, Mr. Owen slipped the Oxydol packet into his back pocket.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plans a Day Trip to Bolster Colombia

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: EDGARTOWN, Mass., Aug. 4

 BODY:
President Clinton will make a one-day trip to Colombia this month to support its struggle against narcotics and spotlight the $1.3 billion aid package that Congress approved last month, the White House said today.
"Colombia's success is profoundly in the interest of the United States," Mr. Clinton said in a statement released here today after he had arrived on Martha's Vineyard with his wife and daughter for several days of vacation and political fund-raising events. "A peaceful, democratic and economically prosperous Colombia will help promote democracy and stability throughout the hemisphere." 
 The package proposed by Mr. Clinton and passed by the House and Senate will equip and train military units assigned to fight cocaine traffickers, who supply an estimated 90 percent of the cocaine that enters the United States.
Along with 18 Blackhawk helicopters and 42 Huey 2 helicopters to ferry anti-drug forces, the package includes money to promote judicial reform, human rights protection and economic development.
The money did not clear Congress without controversy. Opponents complained that much of the money went to the Colombian Army, which has been accused of human rights abuses, and that the United States might be dragged into an internal conflict in which it is sometimes difficult to separate drug traffickers from antigovernment guerrillas.
To highlight the bipartisan nature of the aid, Mr. Clinton will travel with lawmakers of both parties, including House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware.
An administration official said Mr. Clinton's visit on Aug. 30 was meant to show solidarity with President Andres Pastrana, who is fighting economic woes as well as drug traffickers, leftist guerrillas and rightist paramilitary units. The trip will follow a similar mission to Nigeria to support Olusegun Obasanjo, the first democratically elected president there in 16 years.
An administration official involved in the Colombia efforts said that much of the money would go to southern Colombia, the region with the most coca fields. "You're going to have counternarcotics battalions of the army going in and helping to secure these fields," the official said, "and you're going to have police going in and helping to dismantle laboratories and to eradicate the coca production."
Officials said security would be a top priority on the trip. Mr. Clinton will not remain overnight but will fly from Washington and return that evening. In announcing the visit, the White House noted that Colombia has one of the highest homicide and kidnapping rates and is a dangerous working environment for American officials and other citizens.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Slows, Suggesting Fed May Not Raise Interest Rates

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
American companies added fewer jobs in July than economists had expected, reducing the chances that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when it meets later this month, analysts said.
In a sign that economic growth is slowing, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4 percent in July as private-sector payrolls grew by 138,000, about half the number that most analysts had predicted. Over all, employment fell by 108,000 last month because of the large number of temporary government workers who finished collecting census data in June, the Labor Department reported yesterday. 
 "This is an economy that has gone from spectacular growth to steady and solid growth," the labor secretary, Alexis M. Herman, said.
Manufacturing companies and restaurants accounted for more than two-thirds of the job growth last month, and other sectors -- like real estate, construction, and insurance -- hired relatively few new workers. In a possible sign that businesses expect sales to slow, the number of people working for temporary-help and job-placement concerns fell, and overall growth in that sector so far this year is now less than half what it was in 1999.
"The economy is slowly losing altitude," said James E. Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
The employment numbers offered the first broad picture of the economy's performance in July, and economists predicted that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee would decide on Aug. 22 that it did not need to raise interest rates to slow growth. Last week, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told members of Congress that the jobs data, as well as coming reports on inflation and productivity, would have a significant effect upon the action the committee took.
Since June 1999, the Fed has raised its benchmark short-term interest rate six times, to 6.5 percent, from 4.75 percent, in an attempt to ward off inflation.
The one sign of inflationary pressures in yesterday's report was a mild one: hourly wages for production employees, who make up about three-fourths of the work force, rose 6 cents, to $13.76, continuing at a pace that is faster than in late 1999. Since the start of the year, wages have risen at an annual rate of 4 percent, up from 3.2 percent in the second half of last year.
Other labor costs, like those for benefits and bonuses, appear to be growing more quickly, said Ken Matheny, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis. The government will report official figures on compensation next week.
But productivity gains still appear to be strong, allowing companies to increase their workers' pay without raising prices to maintain profits, analysts said. That, combined with the moderate job growth in the private sector, has left both economists and investors confident that the Federal Open Market Committee will not raise interest rates later this month, much as it refrained from doing so at its most recent meeting in June.
"This report was the final nail in the coffin," said William Dudley, the chief domestic economist at Goldman, Sachs. The investment bank told clients yesterday that it was changing its forecast and no longer expects a rate increase in August or in the remainder of the year.
All of the major stock market indexes closed higher yesterday, as investors' confidence about the unlikelihood of an interest-rate increase outweighed tepid profit announcements in the drug and semiconductor industries.
Some economists think a rate increase is still possible, if not in August then at the following meeting of the committee, in October. Factory orders and consumer confidence have both risen recently, and the gross domestic product grew at a surprisingly fast 5.2 percent annual pace in the second quarter. But most analysts agree the odds of action by the Fed has fallen in recent weeks. Outside of gas prices, inflation remains slight, and recent statistics on consumer spending and home sales have also suggested an economy that is slowing as it has entered its 10th year of expansion.
At the end of June, almost 90 percent of economists surveyed by Macroeconomic Advisers thought the Fed would raise interest rates in August or October. By last week, the number had fallen just below 50 percent.
Yesterday's report depicted a job market that has changed little over the last nine months, as employment growth has slowed. Private-sector payrolls did fall significantly in May, but modest increases during the other months of the year have made up for the decline. The unemployment rate has stood between 3.9 percent and 4.1 percent since October, and the portion of Americans over the age of 16 who are working was the same as it had been in July 1999: 64.2 percent. Over all, 134.7 million people hold jobs.
The unemployment rate for black Americans fell two-tenths of a percentage point last month, to 7.7 percent, but remains slightly higher than it was earlier in the year. The rates for whites and Hispanics were roughly unchanged.
Analysts had expected companies to make up for almost all of the drop in employment caused by the end of work for census takers. Instead, job growth in most industries was slight or nonexistent in July. After seasonal adjustments, the number of people working for hotels grew slightly, to 1.93 million, for example. The number of employees at day-care centers (763,000), savings banks (240,000) and coal mines (79,000) all stayed approximately level.
Even the increase in manufacturing jobs -- one of the largest since the early 1990's -- may be less robust than it seems, said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan.
Manufacturing payrolls actually fell by about 100,000 in July. However, because of a mathematical formula that the Labor Department uses to smooth seasonal work force fluctuations, the report said that the number rose by 46,000. In other words, only after statisticians had discounted the usual change between June and July did manufacturing employment appear to increase.
But data from the last few years suggests that manufacturing employment may vary less in the summer than it once did, Mr. O'Sullivan said. If that is the case, the seasonal formula could erase much of the apparent gain in manufacturing in August.

HEADLINE: Chief of Bed-Stuy Economic Group Quits

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
The president of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation resigned abruptly this week after criticism that his organization -- the nation's oldest economic development corporation -- was failing in its mission of reviving central Brooklyn's economy.
The resignation of Roderick B. Mitchell, who is 44 and known as Rocky, ended 12 years at the helm of the corporation. He took over the organization when it was on the verge of bankruptcy and oversaw an expansion that included renovating hundreds of homes, creating thousands of jobs and forming a partnership with Pathmark to bring the neighborhood its first large supermarket in many years. 
 Mr. Mitchell would not say yesterday why he was stepping down. A Restoration spokeswoman, Bev Jafek, said Mr. Mitchell announced Thursday that he was leaving and that yesterday was his last day. "He isn't being fired," she said. "It's sad. We would like him to stay, and he will not."
In a statement issued yesterday by the corporation, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., vice chairman of Restoration, said: "Rocky guided Bedford-Stuyvesant through the most difficult time in history. Bedford-Stuyvesant will miss his inspired leadership and steady hand."
In the early years of Mr. Mitchell's tenure, the corporation, created in 1967 under legislation written by Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Jacob K. Javits and then used as a national model for economic development, was viewed by many as a main player in the neighborhood's revitalization.
But community leaders say Restoration has been stuck in recent years, bogged down by too much bureaucracy, and has not spurred the economic growth or attracted the kind of businesses that have helped renew other neighborhoods, like Harlem. The corporation, which manages about 900 residential housing units and 300,000 square feet of commercial property, has not expanded its real estate stock in recent years, and it has drawn few new businesses to Fulton Street, the area's main thoroughfare.
"The perception in the business community is that Restoration was not as invested in the success of small businesses in the surrounding area as it should have been," said Errol Louis, a community advocate who heads a local merchants association and who founded the Central Brooklyn Federal Credit Union. "There was a list that was longer than most people realized of what Restoration was not doing."
In the last two years, Restoration, which has an $11 million annual budget, has run a deficit -- $990,000 in the past fiscal year and $1.6 million the year before.
Ms. Jafek said Restoration had not yet named a successor for Mr. Mitchell.

Major Market Indexes Rise On Slower Job Growth Data
After an early morning decline, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.17 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,767.75. The Dow is down 6.3 percent so far this year. Other markets also rose with the Nasdaq composite index rising 27.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,787.36 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbing 10.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,462.93. 
 Stocks ended higher after the Department of Labor reported that private job growth had been slower than expected last month. The data appears to make an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this month less likely. Page C3.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Dick Cheney, in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, assured America that four years of a Gore administration would be a continuation of the eight years of the Clinton administration (front page, Aug. 3).
I assume that he meant four more years of low inflation, a booming stock market, decreasing crime rates, fewer teenage pregnancies and decreasing abortion rates. 
 This sounds pretty good to me, although I am somewhat surprised to hear a Republican admit it.

HEADLINE: With Phone Strike Near, A New Offer

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Verizon Communications, the nation's largest wireless and local phone company, moved yesterday to avoid a strike by more than 86,000 telephone workers from Maine to Virginia by submitting a proposal addressing some of its unions' main contract concerns.
Still, the possibility of a walkout may have increased after Verizon skirted other important issues like union organizing attempts among its wireless work force, the contracting out of some labor, and the loss or migration of jobs as a result of mergers in the last several years. 
 Unless the company and the unions agree on issues by 12:01 a.m. Sunday or extend discussions, leaders of 72,000 members of the Communications Workers of America and 14,700 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have promised a walkout at Verizon, the new name of the company formed when Bell Atlantic acquired GTE.
Efforts to win assurances from Verizon that would make it easier to organize employees in the wireless businesses into unions are at the heart of the dispute. Unlike their counterparts in traditional areas of the telecommunications industry, wireless workers are generally not union members.
Only a few dozen of the 32,000 employees in Verizon's wireless division are unionized, compared with nearly 80 percent of the 120,000 employees in the local phone operations. Labor leaders are concerned that the wireless division is growing much faster than the rest of the company.
If the unions do strike, the telephone network would probably not be disrupted, the company says. But about 25 million businesses and households in the East could be inconvenienced by delays in requests to repair or install phone service, make operator-assisted calls and have questions answered about phone bills.
Emergency services like 911 would not be disrupted in the event of a walkout, according to Verizon officials. The company also said it would give priority to communications for hospitals and other health care operations. It said it did not yet know if it would create hot lines or special telephone numbers for customers inconvenienced by any work stoppage.
Seeking to prevent a strike, Verizon made its proposal yesterday morning addressing wages, pensions and job security. Representatives from the two unions and Verizon discussed the proposal at length in Washington.
Under the proposal, Verizon would increase wages by 3 to 4 percent a year for union employees, improve pension plans for active workers and offer some job security, according to Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon. The details about job security, though, were not clear last night.
In addition, the company plans to offer increased funds for day care programs, improved medical benefits for new employees and an adoption reimbursement.
But, according to the communications workers union, the proposal did not address concerns about forced overtime, the movement of work locations as a result of the merger, or the contracting out of some services to nonunion companies in areas including the installation of high-speed Internet lines.
"Because the company would rather farm out work," said Ed McGowan, a Verizon employee who installs digital service lines in Midtown Manhattan, "this means one company installs the line on the outside of the building, which is us, and another on the inside, which is them. This results in a big headache for the customer, who has to be at home for two days instead of one, and a loss of income to a nonunion company."
Neither side appeared optimistic about the chances of reaching an agreement before the strike deadline early Sunday, people close to the talks said. The involvement of senior company and union officials in negotiations, which could change their direction, is expected only on Saturday night.
The results of the talks between the unions and Verizon are likely to have repercussions throughout the wireless communications industry. Verizon Wireless, which Verizon owns in an alliance with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, is the nation's largest wireless company, with 26 million subscribers.
Although the wireless industry is generally not organized into unions, some companies, like SBC Communications and BellSouth, which together operate the nation's second-largest wireless carrier, make organizing efforts easier by allowing employees to join a union if a majority at a given site agree to do so.
"If unions can tap into a key area like wireless," said Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New York, "it means much more than simple wage increases or better pensions. This is about questioning who benefits from wealth creation in the new economy."
Based on figures before the company became Verizon this spring, Bell Atlantic's wireless division outstripped its traditional land-line operations in generating revenue, according to the communications workers union.
For example, each wireless employee generates $325,000 a year in revenue, or 230 percent more than counterparts in regular telephone operations. And the company's wireless operations generate $532 a year in revenue from each customer, compared with $324 a year for each telephone company customer.
A Verizon spokesman said the company was wary of discussing the organization of its wireless work force into a union because Verizon Wireless operates as a separate company from Verizon Communications.

The Republicans Call a Cease-Fire on Cities

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
The Republican Party signaled a shift in attitude toward cities when it chose Philadelphia for this week's national convention. The party in recent years has used big urban centers as metaphors of moral decay and examples of faulty Democratic stewardship. But the choice of Philadelphia revealed the G.O.P.'s intent to abandon an anti-urban rhetoric that had proved alienating to moderate suburban voters.
It also reflects a growing awareness among Republicans like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey that urban centers are crucial to state economies and must be recovered, even if the up-front costs are great. In attempting to rebuild crucial city centers, Mr. Ridge and Mrs. Whitman have both moved beyond the traditional Republican gospel that views local control as sacred and intervention from above as political heresy. 
 The need for strong, state-level intervention has become especially apparent to Governor Ridge, who has been faced with some of the most stubborn redevelopment problems in the country -- not just in Philadelphia, which is rebounding after 40 years of decline, but also in the neighboring city of Chester, an industrial powerhouse in the 1950's and 60's that has gone largely untouched by the recovery and was until recently in danger of becoming a ghost town. I grew up in Chester during the boom years and went back to visit during this week's convention. The city has begun to inch forward, with new roads, housing and infrastructure, but only after heavy, heavy lifting by the state government in Harrisburg.
Chester was the site of William Penn's first landing in the new colony of Pennsylvania in 1682, and became a successful mill town soon afterward. It boomed in the 1940's, when the war-stoked economy spawned steel mills, shipyards, textile mills and a range of heavy industries that made Chester a magnet for the great migration of black people moving into the industrial North from the rural South. Chester's Sun Shipyard employed 40,000 people from around the region, in a city whose population totaled a mere 66,000. But the yard lost roughly 10,000 jobs per decade and then closed in the 1980's, with catastrophic effect on Chester and its surrounding municipalities. Skilled laborers fled as quickly as they could, leaving behind the poor, who turned in great numbers to the drug trade.
The decay was worsened by a corrupt and long-lived Republican machine that brought graft and administrative ineptitude to new lows. The machine's founder was the legendary Republican boss John J. McClure, a natty dresser in a vest and high buttoned shoes whose power in Chester and surrounding Delaware County rivaled Boss Richard Daley's in Chicago. McClure was a Republican kingmaker who helped to choose Pennsylvania governors and to whom even Richard Nixon paid homage as an aspiring president. McClure ruled, through patronage and punishment, from 1930 to his death in 1965.
His successor was Jack Nacrelli, a tough machine politician who led Chester as mayor from 1968 to 1979, when he was convicted of racketeering. He returned from jail to dominate the city into the 1980's. According to a 1991 report from the Pennsylvania State Crime Commission, which investigated organized crime throughout the state, Mr. Nacrelli exercised his most intensive patronage efforts through the school board, which quickly deteriorated.
The Republican machine was impervious to state intervention into the 1990's. But faced with enormous decay, mounting crime and a corrupt school system that has consistently ranked at or near the bottom in the state, Governor Ridge has led state intervention on several fronts. Once Chester was declared in distress, the state took over its fiscal affairs, including economic development, and has overseen everything from rebuilding city sewer systems to housing redevelopment to building new roads to actually buying a building for the Police Department and replacing its rundown cars.
Public housing projects have been torn down and replaced with the first new housing built in the city in decades. Chester has seen the first glimmers of post-industrial business, with one new high-tech park just opened and others on the drawing board.
The hollowed-out school system poses the steepest challenge of all. At the governor's instigation, the legislature has passed a radical new plan that allows the state to dissolve the school system if it wishes, replacing it with a charter system or any other system of its choosing. Results from the new legislation have yet to be seen. But the system is coming under close fiscal scrutiny for the first time in at least 50 years.
The giant cranes over the long-dead shipyard still stand rusting and unmanned, a testament to prosperity gone by. But redevelopment plans are under way for the first time in memory and there are other encouraging signs of revival -- police cars that actually run, sewers that drain the streets, and street signs in vast stretches of the city that had none. The irony of the moment is that the rebuilding effort in this city and others has fallen to Republicans, who have historically shunned this kind of intervention, leaving fallen cities like Chester to the mercy of the market.

North Korea at Center Of U.S. Intelligence Debate
Disagreements abound between the senior United States diplomats and the Pentagon's top intelligence officials over how to interpret the few hard facts available about North Korea, as the debate intensifies over whether to build a system to defend against missile attacks. A4 

China Objects to U.S. Visa
China criticized the United States for giving Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, a visa to stop in Los Angeles on his way to the Caribbean, and it also expressed indignation at Taiwan's annual effort to join the United Nations. Still, Beijing's reaction in both cases was moderate compared with the diatribes that similar actions by Taiwan, considered a renegade province by China, have drawn in the past. A7
 
Clinton to Visit Colombia
The White House said President Clinton would make a one-day trip to Colombia this month to lend support to that country's struggle against illegal narcotics and to spotlight the $1.3 billion aid package that Congress approved last month. A5
 
Concern for Milosevic Plans
Clinton administration officials said the United States was increasingly worried that President Slobodan Milosevic would move militarily against Montenegro, the junior republic in Yugoslavia. The issue was discussed at a White House meeting this week and at NATO headquarters 10 days ago, officials said. A4
 
Findings in Concorde Inquiry
Investigators of the Concorde crash said they had found a 16-inch strip of metal on the runway that did not belong to the plane, and that they had also found a large gash in a piece of tire debris. The statement suggested that investigators might be considering the possibility that a problem that had nothing to do with the plane's mechanics could have caused the crash last week. A3
 
The Queen Mother Turns 100
Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by three generations of the royal family and waving to cheering well-wishers from the Buckingham Palace balcony where she marked the end of World War II and helped lead national rejoicing on other notable occasions. A6

Gore Returns G.O.P. Fire, Citing Years of Prosperity
Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Chicago, accused the Republicans of running a showy but insubstantial convention, and he strongly claimed credit for having helped create the nation's roaring economy. A1
 
Mr. Gore is drafting his own acceptance speech for the Democratic National Convention this month, though supporters close to him want him to involve professional writers. A12
 
Bush Seeks to Build Momentum
Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, campaigned by plane, train and automobile in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, swing states the Democrats carried in the last two presidential elections. A11
 
Mr. Bush got a clear bump upward from his acceptance speech and the Republican convention generally, but its dimensions and duration were uncertain. One overnight poll, conducted for NBC News, indicated that Mr. Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore had gone from 6 percentage points to 11, but some pollsters said attacks on Mr. Gore had played badly among independent voters. A11
 
Protesters' Bail Challenged
Defense and civil liberties lawyers questioned whether high bail for protesters arrested in Philadelphia was a punitive measure intended to discourage the next round of civil disobedience, planned for the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles. A8

Sinatra Statue Plan Draws Fire in Times Square
City Hall is backing a proposal to erect a statue of Frank Sinatra in Times Square, where he caused a sensation performing at the Paramount in the 1940's, but opposition is quietly growing among the local community board, some area developers and theater moguls. A leading objection is that Sinatra is associated far more with Hollywood and Las Vegas than with Broadway. A1

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
Bowing to the Middle, Keeping to the Right

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 4

 BODY:
With his convention speech, Gov. George W. Bush created a synthesis new to Republican politics: conservative policies described in ways that his campaign believes swing voters will love.
So his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut -- more sweeping than Congressional Republicans ever tried to push through -- became an effort to bring "common sense and fairness to the tax code." His plan to divert some Social Security payroll taxes to private investment accounts amounted to giving "American workers security and independence that no politician can ever take away." 
 The language was positively Clintonian, but as many conservatives were quick to note, Mr. Bush had not actually changed any of the Republican Party's core principles -- from its opposition to abortion, to its support for large tax cuts, to its backing of a vast missile defense system, to its search for conservative Supreme Court justices.
"He has packaged the traditional conservative positions with completely new covering," said Marshall Wittmann, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation. "It's not necessarily a new Republicanism in quite the way that Clinton was a new Democrat."
This synthesis is central to Mr. Bush's effort to assemble a winning coalition. The Bush campaign wants to hold its conservative base through its policy proposals, and then pick up the moderate middle through Mr. Bush's conciliatory language and willingness to speak about issues that Democrats long dominated.
The question for the fall campaign is whether Mr. Bush can convincingly keep up his balancing act as the Democrats try to home in on the details of policy proposals and his record back in Texas.
Where Mr. Bush describes a tax cut that helps people at the bottom of the economic ladder, the Democrats see a tax cut that helps the rich. While Mr. Bush promises to strengthen Social Security, the Democrats say he could reduce retirement benefits. For all the time Mr. Bush spent delivering policy addresses this spring, a number of his proposals lack specifics.
And Mr. Bush's record does not always square with his rhetoric. The man who showcased minorities all across his convention is, after all, the same candidate who, when he needed to recover from a defeat in the New Hampshire primaries, began his comeback campaign at a South Carolina university that banned interracial dating.
"An informed voter is their worst nightmare," Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, said of the Bush campaign. The Democrats have already begun a barrage of ads trying to challenge Mr. Bush's commitment on issues like the environment.
With the Democrats running against the high cost of prescription drugs, Mr. Bush's aides say they are already debating, for example, whether the Texas governor needs to draw up a plan to show how he would pay for prescription drug coverage. In his nomination speech, Mr. Bush said he would "make prescription drugs available and affordable for every senior who needs them."
But he has never said how he would do that and has never devoted a major address to the issue. All he has done is speak approvingly of one bipartisan plan floated in Congress that would allow Medicare recipients to choose a plan with a prescription drug benefit. And when House Republicans passed their own prescription drug plan, Mr. Bush avoided taking a position on it.
Or what about Social Security? On Thursday night, Mr. Bush sought credit for his willingness to take a stand on the issue. And he promised that he would strengthen the program "for the greatest generation and generations to come."
But while he has called for some portion of the Social Security payroll tax to be diverted to individual investment accounts for young workers, he has not said what percentage. And he has been silent on a host of related issues, as well.
He has not said whether he would raise the retirement age. Nor has he specified how much he would reduce the basic Social Security benefit to deal with the diminished payroll tax that would come into the system.
One group of experts at the New Century Foundation, in a study disputed by the Bush campaign, has said that a plan like Mr. Bush's could result in future retirement incomes 20 percent lower than the levels projected under the current Social Security law.
Mr. Bush's tax cut can also be portrayed in different ways. As he always does, Mr. Bush focused on how he would help the people at the bottom of the economic ladder. "On principle, those in the greatest need should receive the greatest help," he said Thursday night. "So we will lower the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent and double the child tax credit."
What he did not say, but the Democrats do, is that like all tax cuts that sweeping, Mr. Bush's plan helps people at the top of the economic ladder the most. The Gore campaign, in a statement, calls Mr. Bush "compassionate for the rich and conservative for everyone else."
In one case on Thursday night, Mr. Bush's language was designed to keep conservatives from becoming alarmed over one area of policy where he is directly breaking with his party's past.
"One size does not fit all when it comes to educating our children," Mr. Bush said, "so local people should control local schools." That was a version of one of his biggest applause lines on the campaign trail -- his insistence that he does not want to be the federal superintendent of education.
But, in fact, he has proposed using federal funds as a lever to encourage states to give standardized tests in reading and math to all students in grades three through eight. Any state that refused would lose 5 percent of its education money.
In this period of economic prosperity, the voters may never pay that much attention to the issues and may simply hear Mr. Bush's inclusive rhetoric and make judgments about whether they like the man.
Indeed, Mr. Bush's advisers acknowledge that to some extent he is using issues simply to create the impression that he is a bold leader. The very fact, they say, that he has been willing to take stands that challenge the status quo makes voters think he is up to the job of president.
"The issues form a composite of the candidate that's bigger than the issues themselves," said one senior adviser to Mr. Bush. "We have and want to be seen as confronting the hard issues, not avoiding them, and doing so in ways that are innovative for a Republican to do."
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said that in recent focus groups, "people did not feel that on the level of issues there is a lot at stake in this election." He found -- just as the Republicans are counting on -- that the voters are focusing much more on the character of the candidates and their moral authority.
For now, at least, the Republicans are confident that Mr. Bush has made conservatism attractive. "I don't think that Al Gore can win this election," said Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin. "I think George Bush can lose it."

HEADLINE: Tacoma Journal;
Its Air Cleaned, Its Tech High, a City Rebounds

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 3

 BODY:
When EssentialMarkets.com was looking for a place to establish headquarters a year and a half ago, executives at the Internet start-up thought first of the better-known software capitals of the Pacific Northwest.
"We sat down and the general feeling was, I guess we should look in Seattle, or maybe Bellevue or Redmond," recalled David M. Boitano, chief operating officer of the company, which helps businesses sell their products online. "But the more we talked about Tacoma, the more we thought, Well, why not Tacoma? I mean, we're an Internet company. We can be anywhere." 
 The company's decision to locate here is just one piece in the much larger story of a renaissance for Tacoma, which long suffered from image problems as a gritty mill town living very much in the shadow of Seattle, its more glamorous sister 30 miles to the north. For years the noxious fumes from pulp plants here were so powerful that people in the region spoke of the "Tacoma aroma." The city even seemed a bit of an afterthought in the name of the region's major point of entry, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
But, lured by office rents and housing prices roughly half Seattle's, 100 high-technology companies have started up, relocated or expanded in the downtown area in the last two years, according to the city's Economic Development Department.
Tacoma's revival is evident not just in the new companies coming here. The Tacoma Art Museum is expanding into a new building, and a convention center three times the size of the existing one is rising downtown. The infamous smell is gone, a result of mill closings and cleanups, and the air is much cleaner, yielding spectacular views of Mount Rainier, the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound that rival those in Seattle. And traffic congestion, a major complaint in Seattle and its high-tech suburbs to the east, is not a big problem here in this city of 187,000 people -- not yet, anyway.
"If you're in Tacoma, you can still choose whether you want to live in an urban, suburban or rural area, and it simply doesn't take long to get around," said Eric Cederstrand, a developer here who has built or renovated several downtown buildings that are now home to high-tech companies. "You can be out in the countryside in half an hour. In Seattle these days, it can take you half an hour to drive three blocks."
The revival can be traced in part to municipal officials' decision a few years ago to invest $100 million to stretch fiber-optic lines through much of the city, offering a high-speed data network attractive to technology companies. Tacoma's is one of the largest publicly owned telecommunications infrastructures in the nation, prompting the city to market itself with the theme "America's No. 1 Wired City."
Tacoma also has an impressive stock of turn-of-the-century and Art Deco buildings that were largely in disrepair or even abandoned in recent decades, lending a ghost-town air to parts of downtown. Many of those are being renovated, offering the kind of "fun, creative space," in Mr. Cederstrand's description, that lots of technology companies crave.
One of his clients, Y3K Inc., a sort of Internet mall that helps small businesses sell products over the World Wide Web, is taking a floor and a half in a 1910 building downtown that has exposed brick walls, high ceilings, sandblasted beams and impressive views.
Bill Cox, chief operating officer at Y3K, which will move from another Tacoma location to the renovated building this fall, said he discerned no problems in being a bit outside the Seattle-Redmond orbit that is home to giants like the Microsoft Corporation and Amazon.com, and to many lesser-known high-tech companies.
"I think there are advantages here," Mr. Cox said. "In Seattle, I think, there's a danger that a new company can feel lost in the shuffle. The feeling is, Well, it's just another Internet company. Here, it's a bigger deal. And there's a lot of support from the city."
Robert W. Grenley, chief executive of IDmicro, a 25-employee company based here that designs several kinds of wireless tracking devices, also said he saw advantages to being a "bigger fish in a smaller pond."
Mr. Grenley, who grew up in the area, said he would have "laughed out loud" if he had heard someone predict Tacoma's resurgence 15 years ago.
"Downtown was decayed, empty, bombed-out," he said. "Parts of it looked like Dresden or something. You were scared to be downtown. And it physically smelled bad. Today it's completely different. It's amazing what's happened here."
Mr. Boitano, at EssentialMarkets, which is planning to grow to 250 employees from 105 over the next eight months and is leasing new office space downtown, said attracting people to the area was not a problem.
"You put them in a car and drive them around," he said, "show them the mountains, the water, the quality of housing that's available, the recreation. It's not a hard sell."
And Juli Wilkerson, the city's director of economic development, said there was plenty of talent available locally, noting that 22 percent of the work force from Tacoma and surrounding Pierce County still commuted to jobs in the Seattle area. "They would love to avoid that commute if they could," Ms. Wilkerson said.
Nathan A. Wright, marketing director at IDmicro, moved from Seattle in February with some trepidation, but was pleasantly surprised. "Now I'd say, Why put up with the hassle? Here I've got a seven-minute commute. The views are great, there's a lot going on, but Tacoma's still got a small-town feel to it, too. I'd take this any day of the week."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE-PRESIDENT;
GORE FIRES BACK, HOPING TO DAMPEN CONVENTION SPIRIT

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 4

 BODY:
After suffering days of Republican barbs in silence, Vice President Al Gore returned from vacation today swinging back hard, accusing the Republicans of running a showy, but insubstantial convention and strongly claiming credit for having helped create the nation's roaring economy.
Mr. Gore had spent the week with his family on a North Carolina beach while the newly minted Republican ticket of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney used the stage in Philadelphia to portray the Clinton administration as timid, ineffectual and lacking vision. 
 The Republican nominees left Philadelphia today for a day filled with campaign stops in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. Mr. Bush showed a post-convention lift of his own while speaking to a crowd of hundreds along downtown train tracks in Pittsburgh. "I can't tell you how energized I am," he said.
In Chicago, Mr. Gore answered the Republican criticisms today by slinging arrows of his own. Without mentioning Mr. Bush or Mr. Cheney by name, he accused the Republicans of trying to paper over empty promises and harsh policies with a feel-good, slickly choreographed convention that offered little more than "confetti and klieg lights."
"When it comes to political pageantry, I've got to hand it to the other side," Mr. Gore told more than 3,000 members of the International Association of Fire Fighters. "But you and I both know that a slogan never put out a raging fire. A sound bite never saved a child from a burning building. And political positioning will never heal sick children who don't have health care."
Playing the role he seems most comfortable with, the counterpuncher, Mr. Gore appeared to relish reusing one of his own lines from the 1992 campaign that Mr. Cheney had appropriated in Philadelphia: "It's time for them to go."
"Two nights ago at the convention, we heard their view of what time it is," Mr. Gore told the firefighters. "That was a familiar line wasn't it? I remember that one. Well let me tell you what time it's not. It's not time to give in to the big drug companies. It is not time to give in to big insurance companies."
"And our opponents may not like to hear it, but it is not recession time in America like it was back in 1992," he continued. "It's not deficit time in America like it was in 1992."
Mr. Gore entered a Chicago hotel this morning looking like a gladiator on an adrenaline high, pumping his fists as he led a group of chanting firefighters dressed in yellow T-shirts emblazoned with the words, "Fire Fighters for Gore."
Inside, he spent nearly 10 minutes wending his way through the crowded aisle toward the stage, slapping high-fives, grabbing every outstretched hand, cradling an infant.
"I know we're starting out behind," he said. "I'm here today to serve notice: this is Day 1 of the fight for working families. And with your help, we're going to win it."
Mr. Gore's advisers are hoping to fill the next 10 days with events like the one today, first to dampen any post-convention bounce in the polls that the Republicans are likely to receive, and then to build enthusiasm for Mr. Gore's own triumphal entrance into the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles on Aug. 16.
Later today, Mr. Gore spoke here before more than 8,000 letter carriers, and on Saturday he will address a convention of the National Association of Police Organizations in Washington.
Today's speeches offered a preview of the themes Mr. Gore will emphasize in the coming week and at the convention.
He fired populist attacks against the Republicans, describing their convention as "a masquerade ball for special interests" and repeating the refrain, "They're for the powerful, and we're for the people."
He pledged to oppose tax cuts for the rich, bolster Social Security, improve public schools, provide tax breaks for the middle class, raise the minimum wage by a dollar and make it easier for workers to form unions.
And, as if to answer critics within his own party who contend that he has not done enough to reveal his personal side to voters, he salted his speech with more biography than usual, saying, "I also want the American people to know me for who I am."
He then dwelt heavily on his time in Vietnam as an journalist in the Army, offering an implicit contrast to Mr. Bush, who served in the Texas Air National Guard, never leaving the country.
"When I was in Vietnam, I didn't do the most or run the greatest danger," Mr. Gore said. "But I volunteered and enlisted because I loved my country, and I knew that if I didn't go, I knew that someone else from my home town of Carthage, Tenn., would have to go in my place."
Left out of that explanation are two other possible reasons for his decision to volunteer: his desire to help insulate his father, an antiwar senator from Tennessee, from Republican criticism, and his own interest in broadening his resume for a possible career in politics.
The vice president was accompanied by his wife, Tipper, who was expected to spend significantly more time campaigning for her husband in the coming weeks.
Responding to one of Mr. Bush's harsher attacks -- that the Clinton administration had coasted through eight years of prosperity, choosing "the path of least resistance" -- Mr. Gore said: "What planet have they been on?"
He then claimed partial credit for starting the nation's economic recovery by casting a tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the president's 1993 economic stimulus plan.
And he recalled the efforts of the Republican-controlled Congress, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, to shut down the government in 1995, which polls showed to be highly unpopular with voters.
"I wish there had been less resistance," he said. "I broke the tie when every Republican voted no on the economic change that has brought about this prosperity. I wish there had been less resistance and that they didn't shut down the government twice."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE IMPRESSIONS -- NEW YORK;
A Sharp Student Split On G.O.P. Spectacle

BYLINE: By Jane Gross 

 BODY:
Political science students at New York University recognize obscure de Toqueville quotations and argue the merits of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty vs. the Strategic Defense Initiative. So when the Republican National Convention rolled around, they were an astute audience, eager to analyze what George W. Bush set out to accomplish and how well he succeeded.
The three doctoral candidates and four students from the undergraduate honors program differed on whether the convention was "brilliant marketing," in the words of one, or "insulting propaganda," in the words of another. But all agreed it was a textbook example of "median voter theory" and "triangulation," jargon for capturing swing voters by adopting the popular issues of the opposition and burying the unpopular issues of its own fringe, as Bill Clinton's Democrats did in 1992. 
 "Clearly, the theme of inclusion is a blatant plea to nontraditional Republican voters," said Ramsey J. Green, 20, as he watched a rainbow coalition of speakers cross the podium in Philadelphia. "It seems as though they have finally realized that their reputation as white, wealthy and Christian will not appeal to socially liberal suburban voters and therefore prevent them from enjoying the policies of a Republican president."
Mr. Green, who said he would most likely cast his first presidential vote for Vice President Al Gore, veered between calling the tactic a "sick Republican scheme" and saying that the convention had "gone extremely well" for the party. He argued with himself about whether the Republicans were "trying to pull the wool over my eyes" or "making a serious attempt to change the party's traditional ethnic and financial makeup."
Still, Mr. Green said that the tone of the convention was a healthy development for the party and the nation.
From the other side of the aisle, Costas Panagopolous, a doctoral student who ran unsuccessfully for the Massachusetts Legislature while a Harvard undergraduate, also saw the Republican show of inclusion as a plus.
Mr. Panagopolous, 28, who ran as a Republican but has since re-registered as an independent, said, "I do think it's a strategy -- for now. But if they win the election, they'll know it works, and this will have been a first step. It has to start somewhere. And there comes a point where perception becomes reality."
Mr. Panagopolous, with his experience as a candidate and a resume filled with jobs in marketing, seemed to unnerve other students with his unabashed admiration for the "re-branding" by the Republican party.
"It's no different than re-positioning Hush Puppy shoes," he said.
Sona Nadenicheck, a doctoral candidate devoted to academic research not the hurly-burly of politics, gasped, "But that's not who they really are!"
Ms. Nadenicheck's husband and fellow graduate student, Matt Golder, jumped in.
"The goal is to get elected," Mr. Golder said, soothingly, comparing the Republicans to the Labor Party in his British homeland. "It took the Labor Party 10 years to change their image."
The students, interviewed over the course of the four-day convention, were not equally engaged by the proceedings. Alissa Elliott, a 20-year-old with a bent for international relations, watched hours of C-Span each night, as she cooked dinner, ironed and answered e-mail and took detailed exception to the foreign policy positions of several speakers.
Mr. Panagopolous, also a nightly devotee, dissected the ramifications of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts and lamented the candidate's silence on international trade and domestic economic trends. Mr. Green seemed to have seen virtually every speaker, Republican National Committee video and mariachi or Motown band.
By contrast, Martin Wolf, 19, skipped the first night because a broken fish tank had shorted out his television set, and he considered Mr. Bush's speech, which he grudgingly watched, a "waste of my time." Ms. Nadenichek, 28, said she would have ignored the Bush speech and worked on a conference paper were it not for her husband.
"Matt had the TV on and we have a small one-bedroom apartment," Ms. Nadenichek said. She said the convention was more interesting than it might have been because Mr. Golder brought a fresh eye to this American spectacle.
All of the students noted, admiringly, the Republicans finesse at highlighting the improprieties, sexual and otherwise, of the Clinton White House and tarnishing Mr. Gore in the process. They also thought it deft to call attention to the nation's prosperity, the Democrat's crowning achievement in the past eight years, while characterizing it as an opportunity wasted.
"Bush tried to point out what is morally wrong with the executive administration today while pointing out what is right with the economy," Mr. Green said. "Theoretically, I guess this means all Bush has to do is win the election, move into the White House, do no harm to the economy and remain faithful to his wife. Sounds like a pretty easy job."

HEADLINE: Arabs Strive for New Consensus On an Israeli-Palestinian Treaty

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 4

 BODY:
On the face of it, Arab support for the Palestinian position has never been so unified. One after another, Arab kings and presidents have said they stand behind Yasir Arafat's claim to East Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees.
But behind the uncompromising public statements, more pragmatic approaches to those thorniest of issues are being discussed seriously among Arab leaders for the first time. 
 There have even been signs of subtle shifts in the once monolithic Arab public opinion that Arab Muslims should have exclusive sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
In the 10 days since the Camp David talks broke down, on this and other previously taboo issues, Arab leaders have been absorbed in their most intense consultations ever on how to find a swift, workable deal that would combine both symbol and substance for both sides.
Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has shuttled around the region. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has received a string of Arab leaders at his summer palace in Alexandria, where Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel arrived on Thursday for talks.
And Edward S. Walker Jr., a former American ambassador to Egypt and Israel and now an assistant secretary of state, has gone to Saudi Arabia as part of his tour of Arab nations that rely to some degree on United States money or military backing.
A new Arab consensus on these issues could ultimately make an agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians possible, analysts and diplomats say, if Israel also compromises at least in symbolic ways on viewing Jerusalem as its eternal undivided capital and on Palestinian refugees as a resettlement problem for the rest of the world.
"The Jews and Muslims are in a Catholic marriage with no possibility of divorce," said Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian foreign minister who led the first joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to the Madrid peace conference in 1991. "Everyone realizes that the problem now is how to engineer arrangements to satisfy at least the minimum requirements of both sides to live together."
The concept of making "arrangements" along the way to peace is relatively new in the last 52 years of Arab-Israeli conflict.
For seven years since direct talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians began in earnest, negotiations have focused almost exclusively on step-by-step details that have allowed most Arab leaders to remain on the sidelines, talking of a comprehensive peace settlement in absolute terms.
But with the rush of expectation that came with the 15-day Camp David talks last month, Arab leaders are facing internal and external pressure to play a role in forging a final settlement. One reason is that both of the most contentious issues on the table -- Jerusalem and refugees -- carry implications for leaders other than Mr. Arafat and for peoples other than the Palestinians.
Jordan is home to more Palestinian refugees than any other Arab country. Egypt is a leading American ally in the region and is the only Arab state to have reached a peace agreement with Israel.
And the approval of Saudi Arabia, as the keeper of Islam's two holiest sites, is essential to any shift, no matter how subtle, in the Arab position on Jerusalem, which contains the third-holiest site.
"When Arafat is alone negotiating with the Israelis, he is too weak to make concessions," said Labib Kamhawi, a Palestinian-Jordanian political analyst. "But if a third party is involved, the third party is like a facilitator. So I think, ultimately, an Arab umbrella will be given to Arafat."
Another reason is that most Arab nations, if not impatient for a settlement, have become at least used to the idea that a settlement would bring needed economic benefits.
"There is a growing linkage in the region between having conditions of peace and the possibility of development," said Abdel Moneim Said, director of Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. "In addition, there is no one in the Arab world, except for some fundamentalists, who would deny any more the legitimacy of Israel. So we are all transferring from an existential conflict of 'us or them' to how we are going to be living with them."
Before the Camp David peace negotiations, reflections on how to finesse issues like Jerusalem were never seriously broached in Arab countries. But proposals for dividing administrative and religious control of the city, made at Camp David by Prime Minister Barak and President Clinton, have lifted a curtain.
"There are ways of dealing with it without saying that Israel is sovereign over East Jerusalem," Dr. Said said. "Certain things could happen de facto, if we have an agreement that settles the issue of East Jerusalem and left aside the question of the Old City."
Arab control over the Haram al Sharif, the man-made plateau in the Old City known to Jews as the Temple Mount that is the site of two of the holiest mosques in Islam, remains a fixed demand. It cannot be relinquished, Arab officials have said, without stirring the wrath of Muslim militants in the region and Muslims all over the world.
But a number of Arab officials and commentators, even in the most religiously conservative country of Saudi Arabia, have recently talked of the need to cool tempers over Jerusalem and of making a distinction between political and religious sovereignty.
"Jerusalem has a very important religious value, but its political importance is just as great," a Saudi official said. "Maybe both sides could agree on joint administration according to certain arrangements." Postponing either Jerusalem or further negotiations is not an option, he added.
"We have already wasted 52 years, and we do not need to waste more time," the official said. "We have to take what we can now -- anything that is possible or is the remnant of the possible."
From another quarter, Fahmi Howeidi, an Egyptian commentator with close ties to the Islamic fundamentalist movement, also suggested that Arabs were focusing too much attention on the mosques. Instead, he wrote recently in the Cairo newspaper Al Ahram, they should emphasize the refugee issue.
"The importance of the human being is more important than a place, even if this place is the Haram al Sharif," Mr. Howeidi wrote, adding that God would protect the Jerusalem mosques.
On the issue of the return of refugees, a number of Arab officials have also said an arrangement is possible if Israel accepts the principle that Palestinians have a right to return if they fled or were forced from their homes in 1948.
Until now, Israel has said only that it might accept some 100,000 refugees under a family reunification plan. About 3.2 million Palestinians are registered with the United Nations as refugees who fled or were forced from their homes at the time of Israel's creation in 1948 or are descendants of those who met that fate.
Another 300,000 are considered displaced persons from the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in 1967. Some of the more flexible statements have come from Jordan, where officials and others of Palestinian descent say they doubt that many people will take advantage of a right to return, which would mean accepting Israeli citizenship.
"Say you agree to theoretical language that refugees have the possibility of the right of return," said Marwan Dudin, a Jordanian senator who was born in Beersheba, in what is now Israel, and represented Jordan in multilateral talks with Israel about Palestinian refugees. "It could take two to three generations to implement. But you at least make something that smells like an acknowledgment of the right of return."
Dr. Kamhawi, the Jordanian political analyst, agreed. "At a minimum, Israel should uphold this right and then sit down and see if it's practical or not," he said. "First the principle, then the details."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 8, 2000, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing errors, an article on Saturday about an effort by Arab leaders to find a consensus on outstanding differences between the Palestinians and the Israelis misstated the Arab position on the issue of refugees. The Arab nations have long contended that Palestinian refugees are the responsibility of Israel, not of the rest of the world. The article also misstated the number of peace agreements signed by Israel with Arab countries. It is two -- not just with Egypt but also with Jordan.

HEADLINE: A Year Out of Bankruptcy, Barneys Is Still Looking for Sure Footing

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
When the troubled retailer J. C. Penney announced last week that Allen L. Questrom would be its new chief executive, Wall Street was euphoric.
Penney has been dogged by disappointing sales at its department stores, but its stock rose 16.5 percent that day. And Mr. Questrom's credentials led 4 of the 12 analysts that cover the company to upgrade the stock, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
 "He's got to be a huge improvement at J. C. Penney," said George Strachan at Goldman Sachs, who raised his rating to "market outperform" from "market perform." "He's got a lot of charisma and is very decisive."
Investor enthusiasm stems in large part from the work that Mr. Questrom did while reviving ailing public companies like Federated Department Stores and Macy's, which Federated acquired under his leadership. But in the most recent chapter of his career, as chairman and chief executive of Barneys New York after it emerged from bankruptcy, it is less clear that the turnaround man has spun straw into gold.
Though Barneys has had robust sales growth, its cash flow and earnings have not been nearly as strong as the company predicted in documents filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court. This weakness, combined with a less-forgiving investor environment, has dashed any chance of a quick return to public ownership. In addition, the glitzy retailer has been hemorrhaging employees.
Mr. Questrom, 60, a flawlessly groomed executive, arrived in May 1999 at Barneys, which was famous for dressing men in the finest suits and their social X-ray wives in the newest European designs. The company had come out of bankruptcy in January, and he was not responsible for the plan filed with the court in November 1998. That was done by the retailer's majority owners, two vulture funds, Bar Harbour Management and Whipporwill Associates Inc.
Doug Teitlebaum of Bar Harbour and David A. Strumwasser of Whipporwill Associates say that the numbers in the filing were based on the projections of previous management, under the leadership of the chief executive, Tom Shull. When Mr. Questrom came aboard, the owners and Mr. Questrom formulated a more conservative plan, the owners say, and the company is exceeding its new targets, though they declined to disclose those numbers.
At the time of his arrival, Mr. Questrom was heralded as an executive who could generate dynamic growth -- growth essential for Barneys to pay off its substantial debts.
Jeffrey Tarkenton, a bankruptcy lawyer at Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge & Rice in Washington, said he had not studied the Barneys situation, but added, "Like any company that misses projections significantly, it is a sign that reorganization might be failing."
The idea that his yearlong tenure at Barneys has been anything less than spectacular makes Mr. Questrom's eyes flash. He says what really matters for a retailer just out of bankruptcy is to earn the trust of vendors, and that there he surpassed expectations. When he took the helm, 80 percent of vendors were asking to be paid on delivery of goods, he says, and today less than 8 percent do -- and those are mostly small suppliers who cannot afford to do otherwise.
Barneys stores have experienced double-digit sales growth since he arrived. In fact, much of the luxury market, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, has benefited from a strong economy. Mr. Questrom, though, takes credit for helping Barneys partake in the boom by training the notoriously snooty sales force to be more friendly.
Despite these solid accomplishments, there have been troubling signs at the retailer, most notably executive turnover at Barneys flagship Madison Avenue store since Mr. Questrom arrived. In just the last three months, the company has lost six executives at the level of divisional vice president and above, a creative director, a vice president of communications and the Madison Avenue store manager, or roughly 9 out of 16 senior staff members.
The turnover would not be a concern at a large chain of stores. At a small, high-end operation like Barneys, though, experienced service people and discerning fashion buyers are vital.
A common theme among departing employees was that they did not like the change to Mr. Questrom's more corporate manner from the family-style management dating back to the Pressman clan that owned Barneys before bankruptcy. The executive was repeatedly described as "cold." He earned ill will, employees said, by demanding that employees pass basic retail math tests -- an exercise one former staff member described as "degrading."
Although Mr. Questrom's effort could be defended as needed professionalism for a famously highflying, high-spending operation, staff members said they felt his bottom-line emphasis was not in line with Barneys overall luxury shopping experience. For example, he shifted Barneys away from its traditional emphasis on the most cutting-edge designers.
"He was focused on business volume makers, not on nurturing the young and upcoming designers," said Emilia Fabricant, the former senior vice president responsible for the women's co-op and outlet division, who said she left because she was looking for a new creative environment. "I thought he was maybe losing the future."
Another possible reason for staff departures is that Barneys is in no position to make a public offering of stock anytime soon. Since Barneys emerged from bankruptcy with an estimated value of $240 million, the market valuations of public retailers have collapsed. Most now trade at less than their annual sales. The Neiman Marcus Group, a luxury retailer on solid footing, had 1999 sales of $2.6 billion and has a market cap of roughly 60 percent of that amount. Given sales last year of $365 million and its distressed history, Barneys might have a public value of less than $200 million now.
Even Mr. Questrom's decision to move on may relate to the probability of little short-term benefit in his staying. When he joined, his employment agreement called for him to be paid entirely in stock. The company now says that he will get an undisclosed sum of stock as well as a salary for the year he was the top executive. He will remain chairman after joining Penney.
Barneys' majority owners say they do not pay attention to short-term valuations and that theirs is a long-term investment.
Back in its 1998 filing with the bankruptcy court, the company projected a net loss of $614,000 for the fiscal year ending January 2000 and net income of $5 million for the year ending in January 2001. Instead, the company posted a $5.3 million loss last year and expects just to break even this year.
The shortfall is significant because Barneys has two important pools of debt that will start to come due in 2003. A person with knowledge of the balance sheet says the shortfall already endangers the company's ability to meet these obligations.
Mr. Teitlebaum and Mr. Strumwasser vigorously deny they will have trouble meeting their debts.
Mr. Shull, who saw Barneys through bankruptcy and helped build its cash flow from a loss of $2 million a year to gains of $20 million yearly, and who also knows the company well, says that if it does not start meeting the original recovery plan it will not be able to pay its debts.
"In order for them to make their financial commitments in two years, the company would have to achieve an EBITDA of over $70 million," he said, using the term that refers to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. "At this stage, barring significant additional investment, that would seem to be a difficult challenge."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 23, 2000, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Aug. 5 reported on the performance of Barneys New York since its emergence from bankruptcy in January 1999. Critics of the departing chief executive, Allen L. Questrom, were quoted as saying that he had shifted the company away from its traditional emphasis on the most cutting-edge designers.
In fairness, The Times should have included a response from the company. In a statement, the company has since said, "Barneys today is every bit the fashion incubator that it has ever been."
Because of an editing error, the article also referred imprecisely to the company's prospects for raising money through a stock sale. Concerns about Barneys and the industry's stocks over all rule out a share issue any time soon. They do not rule out "a quick return to public ownership"; Barneys already has stockholders, although its shares are not traded regularly.
The article also misspelled the names of the two firms that own a majority share of the company and misstated the number of senior employees who have resigned in the last three months. The firms are Bay Harbour Management, not Bar Harbour, and Whippoorwill Associates, not Whipporwill. Eight senior employees, not nine, have resigned in the last three months.

HEADLINE: A Taste for Frequent-Flier Miles

BYLINE: By SUSAN SHEEHAN; SUSAN SHEEHAN is a staff writer for The New Yorker.

 BODY:
I AM my mother's daughter: I love the idea of getting something for nothing. In the 1960's, mother went from bank to bank, bringing home a new appliance each time she opened a $25 savings account. By the 70's, we were both collecting the green stamps grocery stores handed us with our purchases and redeeming them for toys for my young girls.
In the 1980's, with the advent of frequent-flier miles, getting something for nothing took a major turn for the better. I earned ample mileage (and subsequent free trips around the country) simply by flying a lot in the course of researching magazine articles and books. Later, with the felicitous appearance of airline credit cards, I charged everything possible to these plastic rectangles and flew to Europe free. 
 Last August, when one card offered double mileage for all purchases for a year, I forsook the others and paid every supermarket and department store bill, as well as all newspaper subscriptions, burglar-alarm maintenance bills and charitable donations with my Delta Optima. A biography of my life appears in monthly installments on the credit card statements.
I am also my mother's daughter in that I have spent most of my life chasing seven pounds up and down the scale. Last spring, while tossing a package of Healthy Choice macaroni and cheese into my shopping cart, I read on the box that I would receive 500 free miles for every 10 Healthy Choice products I bought before the end of the year. By Dec. 31, 1999, I had a collection of 110 proofs-of-purchase from 55 lunches of Colonial Chicken Pie and 55 dinners of Chicken and Vegetables Marsala. I had also lost 10 pounds from eating out of cardboard boxes.
I mailed them to Healthy Choice, received certificates valid for 5,500 miles on a number of participating airlines, and sent them to TWA, where they brought my mileage to just over the 25,000 miles required for a free round-trip economy ticket in the United States.
I paid my way to an assortment of cities this year, saving the California interviews for a new book until last. I knew that TWA flew there from our home in Washington by way of its hub in St. Louis. In June I called TWA and asked to fly to San Francisco on July 6. I was told I could go to Ontario.
"Thanks, not going to Canada," I said to the person at TWA's 800 number.
"Ontario, California," she said. "It's an airport 46 miles from Los Angeles."
I kept telephoning but TWA steadfastly declined to put me on a flight to San Francisco, where I had four interviews in four days. I also had an interview in central Los Angeles on July 11. TWA would let we fly out to Ontario on July 6 and then home on July 12 from Orange County Airport, 36 miles from Los Angeles International Airport. After 57 phone calls, I persuaded a person at TWA's 800 number to let me fly home from LAX, although not at a convenient hour -- I would have a three-hour layover in St. Louis instead of the hour layover available to paying passengers. But the basic arrangement would work.
I bought a United round-trip ticket with a flight from Ontario to San Francisco on July 7 and one from San Francisco to LAX three days later, for just over $100. Flying TWA to Ontario through St. Louis was fine, and a night at the Super 8 Motel in Ontario was more than fine. Some months earlier, I had discovered the charms of Super 8's -- firm beds, free Continental breakfasts and reasonable prices. In small towns like Le Mars, Iowa, there are no upscale hotel chains.
I arrived at Ontario Airport at 9 a.m. on July 7 for my 10 a.m. United flight to San Francisco. An agent could be heard telling another passenger that the 10 a.m. flight had been canceled because of fog in San Francisco. "My boyfriend says there's no fog in San Francisco," a woman waving a cell phone shouted to the agent.
"Well, if there's no fog, then there are high clouds over San Francisco," the agent retorted.
We were to be put on the 12:30 p.m. flight, but upon further questioning were told United would have no flight leaving Ontario for northern California until 4 p.m.
I asked a skycap if any other airline flew to the San Francisco area. Southwest did, he said. I sprinted a quarter-mile with my luggage to the Southwest terminal, bought a $100 one-way ticket to Oakland, and was there by noon. I didn't see any fog or high clouds over either Oakland or San Francisco. I later learned that a slowdown by United pilots had been disrupting flight schedules.
Three-hour layovers are regrettably frequent when planes experience mechanical problems or encounter bad weather. One sits and frets and doesn't dare leave the departure gate, even as projected delays escalate from 3 to 18 hours. This layover was different. I knew I would be in St. Louis from 4 to 7 p.m. on July 12 and decided to make the most or my time. I sent an e-mail message to my friend Pat, a knowledgeable St. Louis resident, with a string of questions.
I started with airport facilities. Any manicurists? (I had recently had my nails done at Reagan National in Washington.) Any interesting stores, like the Body Shop or the Gap? (I had once done my Christmas shopping at Pittsburgh airport.) "No manicure just yet, but by September you'll be able to get a back rub or foot massage," Pat answered. "No particularly interesting stores come to mind."
WELL, then, might the Cardinals be playing a home game on July 12? I would have liked to see Mark McGwire at bat. "No ball teams playing anywhere," Pat wrote. "It's the day after the All-Star Game, part of a three-day break for every team."
I asked her about a few of the city's celebrated attractions -- the St. Louis Art Museum, the zoo, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Scott Joplin House and the Arch. "The last place I would go on a July afternoon would be the Arch, as there are HUGE lines all summer long to go up to the top in the trams," she wrote. "Of course, you could hang out under the Arch without having to stand in line for the tram, but you still would encounter MANY sweaty people."
To anyone who has grown up in Manhattan, huge lines and sweaty people are part of one's heritage. I spent a little over half an hour getting to the Arch on the MetroLink light-rail system and a glorious something-for-nothing hour marveling at Eero Saarinen's Gateway Arch, a stunning memorial to Thomas Jefferson and others who expanded the country westward. I MetroLinked back to the airport, and flew home.
When I returned, my husband reminded me of a long-ago Thanksgiving weekend he and my father had spent assembling a green-stamp made-in-Czechoslovakia bicycle for our older daughter.
Our daughter, the former bicycle rider turned business executive, extolled the merits of taking and paying for nonstop coast-to-coast flights. I spotted a picture of an American Airlines jet on a box of All-Bran on the breakfast table. Kellogg's is now offering 500 free miles on American for mailing in five pictures of the plane on boxes of its cereals. I took out the scissors.

HEADLINE: ONLINE TEACHING;
The Battle in Cyberspace

BYLINE: By Abby Ellin; Abby Ellin writes the Preludes column for the Money & Business section of The New York Times on Sunday.

 BODY:
In the summer of 1997, Dr. Cyndi Wilson Porter, an assistant chemistry professor at Lakeland College in Sheboygan, Wis., was asked to teach a class online. She hesitated at first -- she loved the feel of a classroom, the camaraderie of live communication. She did not want to be an anonymous piece of software somewhere beyond the computer screen.
But she did it, and soon, she said, she fell in love with the interaction. "On the ground, some students respond and others don't; online, everyone does -- they have to," she said. "Online, the only way I know you're alive is if you participate, so we set goals of how many times a week students have to respond. It's very exciting." 
 Three years later, she is the assistant vice president for extended academic programs and the director of Universe Online, a nonprofit virtual arm of the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio. Universe Online is starting up this fall and will offer business classes for undergraduates, as well as courses leading to an M.B.A. The online teachers are faculty members and business owners.
Universe Online is one of the many so-called distance-learning programs hovering in cyberspace. According to reports from the United States Department of Education, at least one-third of the 3,500 colleges and universities in the United States offer distance-learning courses; within the next two years, four out of every five are expected to do so.
But neither faculty members nor administrators are sure about some of the issues raised about intellectual property, like who owns and who should control content that appears online. Does the university or the faculty member who created an online course own it? Who retains copyright to the material? The issue did not arise before cybercourses, because the material and the teacher were intertwined. But now many faculty members fear they will lose control over the courses they teach, that their lessons will be modified or prepackaged into a one-size-fits-all lecture by someone at an online institution.
How much freedom does a faculty member have? Professors typically design traditional courses, and decide which readings to assign and what information to deliver. But what happens with an online course, where the methodologies are different?
David F. Noble, a history professor at York University in Toronto, argues that distance learning contributes to the commercialization of academia and that it forces universities to be concerned only with turning a profit.
"Who owns the material you have placed on the Web site or e-mail?" he wrote in an essay called "Digital Diploma Mills: The Coming Battle Over Online Instruction," part of a series that, ironically, he posted on the Internet, at www.communication.ucsd.edu/dl.
"Without a clear and definitive assertion of copyright claims by faculty, the universities will usurp such rights by default."
Dr. Porter disagrees. Educators, she says, "are hired to impart knowledge, to help students learn. Even as a traditional academic, I have never understood the mindset of 'I own this so I should be able to sell it.' As a chemist, I share my knowledge. I didn't invent chemistry or chemical concepts." She added, "Since I am paid by my school to share my knowledge, they in effect are leasing me."
Some universities, on the other hand, are concerned that professors will rake in substantial sums by teaching classes to millions of people across the globe, and that they will not share the tuition with their institutions. They are also worried that some professors will branch out on their own and teach courses for nontraditional institutions like the Global Education Network, a company founded by Herbert A. Allen, a venture capitalist.
That is what happened with Arthur R. Miller, a Harvard Law School professor who provides video courses for the Concord University School of Law, a virtual school founded by Kaplan Inc., the test-preparation company. Professor Mil- ler, who markets many of his Harvard lectures on videocassettes, contended that he was not violating Harvard's policy of not providing course material to another school while still teaching at Harvard, without permission. Harvard said he was. According to Michael Chmura, a Harvard Law School spokesman, the university issued new guidelines last spring, after the conflict with Professor Miller arose, to make clear that it prohibited such online moonlighting. Professor Miller was out of the country and not immediately available for comment, an assistant said.
SOME universities are signing deals themselves. Unext.com, a virtual university backed by Michael Milken, the former junk bond king, and Lawrence J. Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, has agreements with Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Chicago, the London School of Economics and Stanford University to receive course materials from them for use at an online for-profit virtual university, said Andrew M. Rosenfield, an economist and lawyer who is a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School and the chief executive of Unext.com. The school also contracts with faculty members at other colleges to provide courses unique to Unext.
Western Governors University, a virtual college, will develop programs that provide academic credit for practical experience, and will utilize course work from institutions throughout the United States.
Still, while colleges and universities have long concerned themselves with patentable items -- inventions or medical techniques created in university laboratories -- many are unsure about how to proceed with online materials.
"Schools never cared about literary endeavors," said Dan Burk, professor of law at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who is an expert on intellectual property law and cyberlaw. "There was never enough money expected from one." But now that the economics of ownership of academic materials is changing, he says, "the vast majority of universities don't know what they're doing. We have no guidance."
Because the multimedia arena of distance learning is copyrightable subject matter, some academics foresee a lot of money being generated by online courses. For the past three years, for example, Stanford's engineering school has taught 200 courses to students all over the world -- at 140 percent of the school's normal tuition. Duke University charges $95,000 for what it calls a Global Executive M.B.A., a 19-month-long program that mixes a month on campus and a month studying abroad with online study. That is considerably more expensive than tuition for the traditional two-year M.B.A. program, which is $28,200 per year.
Administrators at Penn State view their online World Campus as the 25th campus in the university system. Since it opened two years ago, there has been a jump from 70 students to 2,895.
At some schools, faculty members have protested the consideration of courses on the Web. Nine hundred faculty members at the University of Washington signed a petition opposing talk of a virtual university. Professors at Cornell have expressed discomfort with e-Cornell, a for-profit subsidiary to develop and market online courses, said Bill Steele, a university spokesman. Details of the program have not yet been completed.
Beyond the focus on ownership, Dr. Burk cites deeper, more complex issues that are at stake -- like career, competition, status and money.
If Harvard's Professor Miller took a sabbatical to teach at another bricks-and-mortar institution, "nobody would have cared," he said. But now, "what they're saying is that 'we don't want you to pull a paycheck from Harvard and also teach online.' Harvard's not happy to have its name affiliated with a nonaccredited school."
Mr. Chmura said that the issue was not the linking of names, but assuring that Harvard faculty members give most of their attention to Harvard students. There are also issues of ego and respect. Both came up when faculty members at the University of Chicago were asked by administrators to develop materials for Unext.com. "It makes them sound like they're working for a big corporation, where their bosses can give them an assignment," said Dr. Burk. "They wonder, 'Are we just cogs? Can my dean or department head tell me to create this course as part of my regular duties here? Can I say yes or no?' The real question now is: What's the role of the bricks-and-mortar university, and how is the relationship between the faculty and the university changing?"
Ultimately, the courses those faculty members develop count toward their required teaching load, but they do not earn any extra pay for creating them, said Larry Arbeiter, a University of Chicago spokesman. There is no consensus about many of the questions raised. Some schools have decided to use revenue from online courses as a way of paying faculty. Others are considering the model of the recording and entertainment industries; faculty members would own the rights to online instructional materials and would be allowed to sell material to online colleges. Some people expect professors to hire agents to broker deals for them.
In May, Duke University's Academic Council approved a policy allowing professors to retain ownership of all courses they create as individuals, but allowing the university to retain ownership of some courses created using university property. The University of Texas has a similar policy, which calls for joint ownership of courses created using the university's funds or personnel.
At the University of Minnesota, faculty members retain ownership of any Web-based courses they create, unless there is a prior agreement to the contrary. Dr. Porter said Universe Online pays a faculty member 5 percent of the tuition it receives for an online course for each of the first five times the course is offered.
She said, "There's no difference between online and on-ground teaching other than the actual method of delivery. Instead of standing up and talking, I now type. When I do an online class, I'm still just sharing my knowledge. When I teach a course on-ground, I get paid as part of my salary. When I teach a class online, I also get paid as part of my salary. But everyone wants a piece of the pie." But the issue of dividing the pie is more pressing when, unlike Dr. Porter, the faculty member whose course is offered online does not participate in teaching it, because then he or she will either be paid for assembling the content or not be paid at all.
The American Association of University Professors has drafted model contracts that give faculty members a financial interest in courses that are adapted to online presentations. Dr. Burk of Minnesota predicts that the debate will quiet down soon.
"Part of what's driving this is that these online courses are multimedia intensive, with video, graphics, music, and text," he said. "They're new and hot, and both the institution and faculty seem to think there will be a bunch of money out there. But the reality is that these blockbuster moneymaking gold-rush scenarios probably won't happen. I am hoping people will realize there's not a gold mine and come to their senses."

HEADLINE: The One-Room Schoolhouse

BYLINE: By Jodi Wilgoren; Jodi Wilgoren is a national education correspondent for The New York Times.

DATELINE: Bloomfield, Mont.

 BODY:
SCHOOL doesn't start until the Mullets arrive. Today, they are late, so we wait.
Kenny Whitmer, age 7, is going 'round and 'round on the rickety pentagon that a local welder built out of $46 worth of pipes half a century ago. Julia Lindquist, a seventh-grade loner, is sitting by herself, contemplating the gaping sky and the wind pushing waves through the grassy field. The boys are shooting hoops, as usual. They let Monica Hostetler, 14, play to even out the teams -- first when there are only three of them, then again when there are five. In between, she hangs at the other end of the makeshift court, lobbing jumpers into the net. 
 It's 10, 12, maybe 15 minutes past 8 a.m. when the forest green 1998 Oldsmobile Regency pulls into the dirt driveway and the Mullets tumble out: Marshall, the eighth grader, Winston, a year younger, Merrilee, 11, and little Sterling, age 9. They live the farthest from the white clapboard schoolhouse, 11 miles down gravel roads across empty plains, so their lateness might be forgivable -- except that it holds up everybody else.
As the Mullets pull backpacks, musical instruments and lunch boxes from the trunk, the boys on the blacktop hurry to land one more basket. Linda Borntrager, the teacher, stands on the steps, one hand on the hip of her faded jeans, the other clasping the old cow bell, ready to ring. It's time to raise the flag, say the Pledge of Allegiance, start another day at Bloomfield School.
"If they're absent, we really have declined enrollment for the day," Mrs. Borntrager, 48, laughed about the Mullets. The family accounts for four of her 13 pupils, and two more are Mullet cousins. Children at Bloomfield "just have to learn how to be flexible," she added. "That's a good skill in life."
Bloomfield, which opened in 1908, is one of nearly 400 remaining public one-room schoolhouses in the nation, at once a nostalgic remnant of the past and a modern outlet for educational experimentation. Even as the number of tiny rural schools has plunged in recent years, the fundamental aspects of teaching inside them -- from multi-age classrooms and peer tutoring to interdisciplinary projects and keeping students with the same teacher for more than one year -- are being copied in large school systems across the country.
Small classes and, especially, small schools, are increasingly seen as crucial to students' success in the early grades, leading many urban educators to create islands within large school buildings that attempt to foster the intimacy and individual attention of places like Bloomfield.
And, with the Internet, long-held concerns about the narrow curriculum available in an isolated one-teacher school are fading. "One-room schools really represent, I think, the best model for training American children for the first through the eighth grades," said Andrew Gulliford, director of the Center for Southwest Studies at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., who is the nation's leading expert on one-room schools.
"In terms of ego development, in terms of character, in terms of personality, in terms of the well-rounded individual fitting in with the group, country schools are very efficient -- they helped train generations of Americans," added Professor Gulliford, author of the definitive book on the subject, "America's Country Schools" (University of Colorado Press). "In a one-room schoolhouse, every child counts -- they've always counted, whether it was 1890 or 1990. How can you say that in most modern educational systems today? It's just not true."
IT is 10:50 a.m. on a Tuesday, a couple of hours after I've arrived here amid the cattle ranches and wheat farms, and Mrs. Borntrager is deep into an eighth-grade math lesson on symmetry, using a mirror and a book of drawings to show how even complex shapes can sometimes be divided exactly in half.
Kenny, meanwhile, is hunched over a first-grade reader. Sterling, the third grader, is copying contractions into his notebook. Brady Boese, 12, and Matthew Kanagy, 14, are suffering through a quiz on probability and percentages, while Brady's twin brother, Kirk, is pondering a work sheet titled "Remembering Details," based on the novel, "Where the Red Fern Grows."
Julia, a seventh grader, has her nose stuck in "The Call of the Wild," legs outstretched, ankles crossed, and Winston, age 13, is methodically computing fractions and decimals. Daniel Whitmer, six years older than Kenny, is tackling problems from a math text, and Keith Hall, 13, is "Drawing Conclusions" -- at least according to the paper on his desk -- from Red Fern. Clayton Unruh has his seventh-grade spelling workbook open to a crossword puzzle. Merrilee, 11, is in the back of the room, using a computer to type sentences she made up from a list of new vocabulary words.
It could be educational chaos, but all is quiet except for the ceiling fans spinning overhead and the teacher's low-voiced prompts to the two students at her half-moon table in the corner. Most of the children have pencils moving, pages turning. Julia or Keith or Daniel occasionally stare blankly out the large windows at the endless brown earth. And, every so often, one of the boys pops up from his desk, carrying a book or a paper over to Mrs. B. with a question.
Eyes searching behind his wire-rims, Brady, 12, wants to know which number should be the numerator as he forms an algebraic equation to answer the question: 18 is 30 percent of what number?
"It's a quiz, Brady, so you're going to have to figure it out on your own," the teacher says. "One thing is to try both and then use your sense."
By 11, it's time for a different math "class" -- Julia and Keith, seventh graders who lag behind, and Merrilee, a fifth grader a bit advanced for her age, stand at the chalkboard adding and subtracting fractions. Four reading groups have already cycled through Mrs. B.'s station this morning. At 11:15, the children race outside for calisthenics, led by little Kenny, as much the school's mascot as he is one of its students. They fold their legs into a pretzel stretch, then run around the wheat field that lies beyond the school's large yard in a haphazard training regimen for the coming track meet with nearby one-room schools. Today, the twins will have to wait until after lunch for math.
"We just do kind of a rotation," Mrs. Borntrager shrugged. "I think my goal is to try to make sure everybody's doing constructive work almost all the time."
Mrs. Borntrager, who is paid $26,000 a year -- twice what she made when she started at Bloomfield 17 years ago -- often has as many as 25 different lessons to prepare each day. This year, her 13 students are in six grades, but she sometimes subdivides the older students according to ability or interest. For example, "The Red Badge of Courage" and "The Call of the Wild" are novels of similar difficulty but appeal to different students.
At Bloomfield, students spend most of the day working by themselves at their desks, old-fashioned wood-topped tables with attached chairs. Mrs. Borntrager relies heavily on textbooks and work sheets she has collected over the years; she rarely lectures to the group, instead running mini-classes in her corner, most lasting no more than 10 minutes. A teacher's aide often helps the younger boys with reading or art projects, or stands by a student's desk, administering a vocabulary test in the most nonthreatening way.
"The kids who come out of Bloomfield have real good study stills," said Cindi Hostetler, Monica's mother, who teaches music and serves as a part-time aide at the school, earning the minimum wage. "They know how to go back to their desks and go to work."
Mrs. Borntrager does not assign homework, but students who fall behind must finish their work after school. At the high school in Richey, Mont., about 20 miles away, Bloomfield graduates often rise to the top of their classes. Last spring, alumni of the school won the top awards for freshmen, sophomores and juniors at the Eastern Montana Math Meet.
Statewide, students from elementary schools with fewer than 40 students tend to outperform their peers on standardized tests in every subject. During the 1997-98 school year, in both fourth and eighth grades, more students from Montana's small schools were rated "advanced" or "proficient" -- and fewer were "novice" or "near proficiency" -- than their counterparts in reading, math, language arts, science and social studies.
"What you're showing there is small class-size ratio and individual teacher contact with kids," said Lance Melton, executive director of the Montana School Boards Association.
ONE of the advantages parents and educators see in one-room schools is the natural tailoring of the curriculum to children's needs.
"Nobody gets left through the cracks," said Mrs. Hostetler, whose husband and two older children also graduated from Bloomfield. "If you're a smart kid, they take you where you can go. If you're struggling, you get the individual attention."
That is what brought Keith Hall to Bloomfield last spring. Growing up in the Portland, Ore., suburbs, Keith, now 13, bounced among nine different schools, including one with 3,000 students. He was learning very little, but getting into plenty of trouble. "They were just shoving him through," said Phyllis Mullet, his grandmother and guardian.
Keith spent the summer of 1999 on Mrs. Mullet's farm here, hunting and fishing and tooling around on the four-wheeler. After another year of fighting at home and at school, he returned to Bloomfield two weeks before school let out in May, upping the school's enrollment by 8 percent.
He reads at about a third-grade level, misspells even basic words like reason (reazer), other (outer) and touch (tuch). But Keith, one of two Bloomfield students who take Ritalin, is a sweet boy who stays after school to help Mrs. B. move furniture, a smart kid who is energized by tactile science projects like identifying bone fragments from owl pellets or building rockets out of soda bottles.
"The other schools were junk," said Keith, whose dark-brown buzz cut is a remnant of his city brashness. "This one, it's different.
"At my old school, it would take them half the year just to know you. There was, like, 32 kids in my class, so it was kind of hard to ask the teachers questions," he said.
"Here, they keep track and stuff. They tell you, 'do you have this reading or this done.' There, they never tell you."
IN 1917, there were 196,000 one-teacher public schools in the United States. At last count, in 1996, there were 380.
Spread throughout 28 states, one-room schools are concentrated in Nebraska, which has 128, and Montana, which has 81. But while schools throughout the rural Midwest and Mountain States have been consolidating, California has seen a 22 percent growth in the number of one-room schools in the past five years, fueled in part by flexible work schedules and telecommuting policies that allow families to pursue frontier living again.
At the same time, Amish and Mennonite communities, among others, have been opening private one-room schools, which total nearly 1,200; about a third of them are in Pennsylvania. Among the public schools, average enrollment in 1996 was 9.4 students, according to a study by researchers at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.
Here in Dawson County, a 2,358 square-mile expanse of empty plains and badlands that was once called the gateway to Montana, there were 138 rural schools in 1919, according to a fading chronicle of their history. A ledger kept by the county superintendent shows that in 1955, the county had 47 teachers. That dwindled to 32 over the next decade, then to 21 in 1969. When Mrs. Borntrager arrived at Bloomfield in 1983, she was one of nine teachers in the county; today there are three.
The attrition is mostly about economics, as fewer and fewer families find they can survive farming the arid land. There are now 53 stops on the 44-mile postal route around Bloomfield; once, there were two routes, with 80 families each.
But Bloomfield, a one-gas-station outpost 247 miles from the Billings airport -- and 27 miles from the nearest McDonald's -- is also losing students to home-schooling, which is increasingly popular among the area's religious Mennonites, and to the schools in Richey, the nearest town, where students can play on basketball and volleyball teams. This fall, Marshall and Monica will start high school and the Boese twins and Clayton Unruh plan to enroll at Richey, leaving Mrs. Borntrager with just eight students. The next kindergartner on the horizon is Elizabeth Nissley, who will not enroll until the fall of 2001.
"That's probably why I'll stop teaching," Mrs. Borntrager sighed one afternoon during the eight-mile drive from school to her modest house, a double-wide trailer with an addition her husband built. "We're going to run out of kids."
Once, Bloomfield was packed with 40 students, and voters approved a special tax to create a second classroom. Now the two rooms are combined into a 35-foot by 60-foot space, filled not with children but with an upright piano, project tables for art and audio, three computers, and a library of 4,000 worn paperbacks running around the perimeter. In the basement, there is enough open space to hold gym class indoors.
The first Bloomfield School burned in 1918. Another fire felled the new one a decade later. This third building got electricity in 1948 (after years of running a wire from a 32-volt battery at the store down the road) and indoor plumbing in 1950, although the outhouse, with separate wood-lidded toilets for boys and girls, still stands out back.
"This, to me, doesn't look like a school," said Jeff Whitmer, 77, Kenny and Daniel's grandfather and the unofficial historian of Bloomfield. "This, to me, is just like a big living room."
Mr. Whitmer, a 1936 Bloomfield graduate, built the merry-go-round in 1954 or 1955, after the ladies of Bloomfield discovered that $46 would not buy them much playground equipment. He rode on the giant stride, a kind of swing made of a metal pole with chains hanging off the top, when it was built in the 1930's. Back then they rode horses to school, or sleds in winter. It would take a while for the coal furnace to warm up, so the water bucket in the hallway would be frozen solid each morning. There were no janitors; the children cleaned the classroom themselves.
"Our classroom had four rows of desks and a big bench at the front for the teacher," Mr. Whitmer said. "The teacher would holler out, 'Fourth Grade Arithmetic!' and you'd march on down. You were told to shut up about twice, and then you were hit upside the head, or hit with a book."
Today's discipline is somewhat softer. Occasionally Mrs. Borntrager will look up from her corner and say "Quiet, please, guys," or "People, there's too much talking in here," but there are not a lot of rules.
Mrs. Borntrager, who was born in Hebron, N.D., rode a horse four miles each way to Farmer's Valley, a one-room schoolhouse, through fifth grade. After attending the state university in Fargo, N.D., she worked as a waitress, then for the telephone company in Denver and in Arizona. After divorcing her first husband, she returned home to get an elementary education degree. When she fell in love with a farmer-rancher from these parts, the teacher's desk at Bloomfield was vacant.
"I don't know if I'd like teaching in a big classroom, with all the other things that go with it," said Mrs. Borntrager, whose three children are among the 28 students who have been graduated from the school since she arrived. "The teachers' lounge. The rigidity as far as the classroom timing.
"I'm probably like the kids in a sense," she added. "I like the ability to have that freedom."
In a community where the drivers of every passing car acknowledge each other with a half-wave, Mrs. Borntrager is surrounded by her successes -- and cannot walk away from students who are struggling.
"I don't have to spend two weeks in the fall figuring out where these kids are, and I can be, in the back of my mind, planning during the summer," she said. "We don't have to spend any time getting to know each other in the fall. We can get right on to it."
KENNY, his blond bangs almost hiding his ice-blue eyes, is paired with Monica, whose metal-filled mouth and experiments with eyeliner betray her entry into adolescence. They are planning their bottle rocket for the end-of-the-year launch.
"What color do you want?" the eighth grader asks.
"You can pick this time," Kenny says generously, then suggests that each name a favorite color to combine in the decorations.
Kenny picks yellow. Monica picks orange.
"Yellow and orange?" Kenny squeals. "Those are my favorite colors!"
Monica gets the construction paper. Kenny names the project The Rocketeer. She draws the lines, he tries the scissors.
"We're going to make it actually shoot up in the air," she tells him confidently, then adds: "I don't know exactly how."
Kenny concentrates, chews a lip.
"I can't cut straight," he says.
"It's a good thing I didn't draw straight, huh?" she responds.
"How'd you know I couldn't cut straight?" Kenny asks.
"I didn't know," Monica says. "That's good. That's what gives it character."
The rocket project is a classic one-room schoolhouse lesson. For Kenny, it is practice with shapes. For Sterling, the third grader, it is real-life application of the concepts of aerodynamics, thrust and lift-off in his science text. The older students have researched the space shuttle on the Internet. There will be fraction work as the students decide how much water to put in the bottles. And, it's all about teamwork.
The challenge of teaching at Bloomfield is finding things that are interesting to a boy of 7 and a girl of 14 -- and everyone in between. The peer tutoring, like pairing Monica and Kenny, often creates the most magical moments of learning. And while it can be lonely to be the only girl of a given age, the small, multi-age setting limits peer pressure; children have little choice but to get along.
Before moving to Bloomfield, "I got picked on a lot," said Julia, whose skull was malformed at birth and has required several surgeries, leaving a prominent scar on the top of her head.
Julia, 13, draws beautiful pictures of horses and is writing her 11th book in a series about mining, but, "for some reason, I kind of get along better with younger kids," she said.
"I like watching cartoons and playing with toys. Merrilee and Sterling and Kenny and I can really have conversations," she added. "Probably when I get into high school, I'll stay by myself a lot."
In gym, Cori Schultz, the teacher's aide, tries to separate brothers and create games where the eighth graders won't mow down the first grader. Instead of traditional kickball, they put a garbage can at home plate, and kickers score points according to what base they reach before the fielders land the ball in the bucket (I played to even out the teams, and triumphed with a home run).
After two days of designing and building the bottle rockets, with their ever-more elaborate noses and fins, it was time for the launch. We placed the homemade launcher around second base, and lined up. The eldest Mullet sat atop the swing set with a video camera, Matthew Kanagy stood ready to release the bottles, and Keith Hall primed the pump. The students scattered to see which rocket would fly highest and farthest, which would twirl and spin, and which would fall flat.
Keith's masterpiece, its two-foot cardboard cylinder festooned with a picture of President Clinton, floundered; too heavy. The Mountain Dewzy, by Winston and Matthew, performed a spectacular loop-the-loop before sputtering out. Monica and Kenny's Rocketeer looked pretty but had an unremarkable ride. The strongest rocket was the unlikely, simple design by Julia and Sterling, who filled their bottle half full and used the maximum amount of air.
Daniel's was the biggest disappointment. Its small orange wings and white cone head could not stand up to the stiff wind. He had planned to fill the bottle 5/8 full of water, but some spilled out. And Daniel only used four air pumps -- in retrospect, clearly not enough.
He moped around the field alone awhile, ignoring the other rockets as they flew overhead. If only he could try again. He would use maximum air, less water. Design a stiff cardboard cone to cut through the wind. Waste less time on the useless paper fins. And, definitely, not go first, before the kinks are worked out of the launching system.
"Did you say we're doing this again next year?" Daniel asked the teacher, hopefully.
"You want to do it next year?" Mrs. Borntrager replied. Well, why not?

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 8-06-00;
Evil Inc.

BYLINE: By Rob Walker; Rob Walker is a contributing writer for Money and Slate.

 BODY:
Over the past decade or so, Americans turned the tobacco industry into the great common foe, a true corporate villain. Sure, there were plenty of people who enjoyed a little tobacco, but Big Tobacco was an all-purpose whipping boy: big profitable companies, run by arrogant fat cats whose products were not just addictive and lethal but also smelly. The industry practically took the place of the Soviet Union: who wanted to be known as soft on cigarettes?
But the most recent in a long series of blows, a Florida jury's $145 billion punitive judgment against the industry, has brought a certain fatigue with this particular villain. These firms have already coughed up billions and been placed under all kinds of restrictions; they've been taxed and taxed again; their products have been banned from restaurants, offices, even parks. The companies will soldier on, but there is nothing left to argue about. Tobacco has been thoroughly bashed, and there is a blank space in the American discourse. The role of Bogeyman Inc. stands open. 
 There are plenty of contenders, but finding a true replacement -- one that can serve different segments of society's different needs in a villain -- is harder than you think. Some people decried second-hand smoke's threat to individual health. Others bemoaned the cost to the health care system. Still others loathed the firms' political clout. Some simply found smoke annoying. That's the sort of broad base that's necessary to build a new Bogeyman Inc. If the obsession with healthier living, for example, were enough, politicians would be railing against the power of Big Mayonnaise.
One early candidate has been the gun business, whose products are linked to actual deaths without a great deal of mental gymnastics. But despite all the lawsuits and diatribes, gunmaker-hating has had little traction. Partly this is because Americans disagree about gun rights. But it is also because those manufacturers are a dispersed group, some of them subsidiaries of foreign companies. It's hard to reduce the plot to the nefarious actions of a handful of men running mammoth corporations with obscene profits. There's a fat-cat gap.
Some efforts were also made to demonize the entertainment industry, but -- as with frequently annoying airlines and the possibly carcinogenic cell phones -- we're all too dependent on its product to sustain a grudge.
What about Microsoft? Or the dot-coms? Admittedly, there's nothing deadly about their creations, but surely we can all get angry together about the obscene fortunes of the tech industry's virtual robber barons, right? Well, no, not at the same time that we're snapping up their wares, totting up the latest changes in their net worth, fantasizing about joining their ranks and generally treating them as philosopher-kings. Besides, we just love tech stocks, which brings us to a final complication.
There was a time when tobacco stocks performed quite nicely for a lot of people. But only since the last presidential election has shareholder culture so decisively moved to the center of American public discourse. We have heard endlessly that half of the country has money in the markets, that Main Street and Wall Street are on the same side. By now we even seem to believe it. Consider Al Gore's efforts to villainize the "price gouging" pharmaceutical industry. Do drug companies not seem like prime targets for demonization? Yes, they make products that save lives, but like tobacco companies, they seem to be able to charge whatever they want, raking in profits and forcing elderly Americans (to borrow from Gore's rap) to eat macaroni and cheese to pay for vital medication.
But it isn't so simple. When Gore picks on the maker of the allergy drug Claritin D for trying to muscle special patent treatment out of Congress, he is picking on Schering-Plough, whose share price has risen from about 12 to 44, adjusted for splits, in the past five years. The No. 1 mutual-fund holder of Schering-Plough is Fidelity Magellan, one of the most popular funds in the United States; the No. 3 holder is the famous Vanguard 500 Index fund. Less than a month before he began tilting at Big Pharma, Gore set out on a "prosperity and progress" tour to remind us of the Clinton-Gore economic boom. Plenty of those whose prosperity progressed during the last eight years are investors in Magellan and the Vanguard 500.
Few fund holders would directly attribute their financial comfort to this or that industry. But the assumption that businesses should be out making profits for shareholders is far more popular now than when the assault on (publicly held) tobacco firms began. And this makes it entirely plausible that we will never have another Bogeyman Inc. -- or at least not until Main Street finds some reason to diverge from Wall Street. Until then, one man's "price gouging" remains another's "killer profit margin," or maybe more to the point, another's "shareholder value."
I am, of course, as opposed to price gouging as the next guy, and I applaud anyone who can force this issue into the open. But I recently noticed that a fund I have money in is a top owner of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer. Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, is up 500 percent in the past five years. So am I part of a nation of consumers, anxious to see corporate power checked? Or part of a nation of shareholders, anxious to finance a luxurious retirement? I suppose you can say that Al Gore has campaigned like a candidate who wants it both ways. But if so, there's no truer reflection of the current electorate.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Rock en Espanol Is Approaching Its Final Border

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER; Larry Rohter is chief of the Rio de Janeiro bureau
of The New York Times.

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
ROCK may have been born as American music, but at middle age it is also the music of the Americas, as quickly becomes apparent during an afternoon spent in a recording studio here with Aterciopelados, Colombia's most popular rock band. The duo is rushing to finish mixing tracks for its new compact disc before heading off for a summer tour of the United States.
Andrea Echeverri and Hector Buitrago, the group's founders, are putting the finishing touches on a song called "El Album," which has just the sort of mixed-salad of a sound that has made the band so successful throughout Latin America. The tune features a twangy rockabilly guitar, a repetitive piano pattern that would sound at home on any salsa record, the scratching of a hip-hop D.J., and a chorus in the accordion-driven Colombian folk style known as vallenato. 
 "We are rockers at heart, but we are Latin American rockers, and that means that our music feeds on a lot of different sources," Ms. Echeverri, who sings and writes for Aterciopelados (pronounced ah-TARE-see-oh-pay-LAH-dos), whose name means "the Velvets," said after the session was over. "We like to mix things from outside with what is indigenous because that is what makes the music so cool and unpredictable."
In studios and on stages all over Latin America these days, similar scenes are unfolding as a new generation of musicians, raised on rock in all its various permutations, topples the traditional stereotypes of what Latin music ought to be. If only for lack of a better name, the movement, which has been developing since the mid 1980's, has come to be known as rock en espanol -- and to be seen by its adherents as a powerful and energizing global force.
"Rock 'n' roll was born out of a cultural clash in the United States between black and white," said Gustavo Santaolalla, an Argentine who is the leading producer of rock en espanol records. "Now a new cultural clash is taking place worldwide between American culture and our indigenous cultures and the result, at a time when so much mainstream pop music sounds like it has been rehashed or recycled, is something that is new and fresh and exciting."
The term rock en espanol is all-purpose and all-inclusive, grouping musicians whose only real points in common are that they grew up admiring Anglo-American rock bands and that they sing in Spanish. Indeed, the movement is so wide-ranging that it comfortably embraces everything from Mexican rappers like Molotov, Control Machete and El Gran Silencio to melodic singer-songwriters like the Argentines Fito Paez, Charly Garcia and Andres Calamaro.
But as record companies have discovered in recent years, rock en espanol is a phenomenon that is as much commercial as aesthetic, which has created an interesting quandary for many Latin American rockers about their future directions as their music moves beyond their borders. Bands like the Mexican power-pop quartet Mana, to take the most prominent example, routinely fill soccer and baseball stadiums, arenas and bull rings with audiences of 25,000 or more and sell millions of records to Spanish-speaking teenagers all over Latin America and, increasingly, the United States.
The movement has been slower to make an impact in New York, whose Spanish-speaking population is predominantly Caribbean and thus more accustomed to tropical rhythms, than in Latin America or in cities like Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago. But over the next three weeks that situation may change, as a result of the Latin Alternative Music Conference, a three-day industry forum scheduled to begin next Sunday, and a series of showcase concerts sandwiched around it.
On Saturday, the Chilean pop quartet La Ley, the dance specialists Los Amigos Invisibles from Venezuela and the Argentine funk band Ilya Kuryaki and the Valderramas will be performing in a free open-air concert at Central Park Summerstage. Then on Aug. 23 the Watcha Tour, a package show that has become Latin rock's equivalent of Lollapalooza, arrives in New York for the first time, with Cafe Tacuba, Aterciopelados, Molotov and Animal playing at the Tunnel.
What is most striking about these and other popular rock en espanol bands is their eclecticism and flexibility. Like Latin American musicians from earlier generations, they have grown up listening to the whole gamut of styles that make up the region's common musical heritage: salsa, tango, merengue, bolero, cumbia, mariachi, samba, ranchera, mambo and so on.
But thanks to improved communications and economic conditions, they have also had more opportunities than their predecessors to become familiar and comfortable with the popular music of the English-speaking world. From Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Bob Dylan to Nirvana, Oasis and Nine Inch Nails, they have heard -- and absorbed -- it all.
"We are amphibious," said Ivan Benavides, leader of the Colombian group Bloque, whose eponymous debut album made the top 10 lists of several New York Times critics in 1998. "We can play the music of the cultures we were born into, but it also feels natural to play the music of the broader cosmopolitan culture. That gives us an advantage over people who are ethnocentric, whether they are Anglo-, Euro- or Latino-centric."
At the time that Latin rockers, most of whom are in their 30's, were growing up, cultural discourse in Latin America was dominated by doctrinaire leftists who argued that rock was a decadent manifestation of American imperialism and that only folk-based indigenous music could be a valid form of expression. Given what they saw as a false dichotomy between Silvio Rodriguez and David Bowie, or Victor Jara and Kiss, the rockers quite deliberately chose both.
"People on the left tend to have very closed opinions and not to be very farsighted," said Flavio Cianciarulo, the bass player and a songwriter for Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Argentina's most innovative band. "Rock is essentially pure rebellion, and always has been, but they couldn't understand that, so we just wrote them off and continued to do our own thing, always with honesty."
In their early days, admittedly, many rock en espanol performers sounded like copies of whatever Anglo-American bands first inspired them to pick up their instruments or sing. Mana drew heavily on the Police, La Ley emerged as a cross between Depeche Mode and Duran Duran, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs seemed like an Argentine version of the Specials and the Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira found herself being compared to Alanis Morissette.
But as bands and singers have gradually gained experience and confidence, that tendency has changed, and Latin American rock today can be just as adventurous and stylistically promiscuous as North American pop. One of the biggest hits in Latin America during the past year, for example, has been Shakira's "Ojos Asi," which fuses a Spanish-language lyric with a Middle Eastern melody and rhythms.
"I grew up in Barranquilla, which is a Caribbean port city where you heard every kind of music you could imagine, from cumbia and vallenato to rhythm-and-blues," recalled Shakira, a member of a Lebanese immigrant family whose full name is Shakira Mebarak. "Some of the first records I remember hearing as a little girl were Donna Summer and the Arab singers that my parents liked," such as the Egyptian singer Oum Kalsoum.
But if one place has been most influential in the development of the movement, it is Mexico. Even in the 1960's, Mexican bands were listening to the "border blasters," high-wattage radio stations broadcasting to the United States from Mexican territory and recording Spanish-language cover versions of American rock 'n' roll hits. By the mid 1980's, Mexican record labels were slowly waking to the commercial possibilities of home-grown rock.
"Rock en tu idioma," or "rock in your language," was the way they marketed the new sound. Based in Mexico City, bands like Cafe Tacuba, Maldita Vecindad, Caifanes, Santa Sabina and La Castaneda found small clubs in bohemian neighborhoods that were willing to let them play, developed followings that soon grew from the local to the national, and signed contracts with the Mexican branches of the main multinational record companies.
"It was important as an affirmation to sing in Spanish," said Ruben Albarran of Cafe Tacuba, the pioneering band whose recent activities have included a tour of the United States with Beck and recordings with the Kronos Quartet. "We had to define ourselves."
At the other end of the continent, in Argentina, a similar process was under way. A flourishing rock 'n' roll scene had emerged in Buenos Aires during the 1960's, but when a right-wing military junta seized power in the mid 1970's, the music was forced to retreat and only began to re-emerge after the collapse of the dictatorship following the Falklands War of 1982.
"It is no accident that we began around 1984," Mr. Cianciarulo said. Once civilian rule was restored, he said, "everything that had gone underground came out into the light of day, and freedom became the order of the day."
Though isolated from the rest of Latin America by language, Brazil saw its pop music evolve along the same lines. The tropicalists who first came to prominence in the late 1960's continue to flourish there, but groups like Paralamas do Suceso, Legiao Urbana, Titas, Skank, Charlie Brown Jr., Jota Quest, Barao Vermelho, Kid Abelha, Planet Hemp and Chico Science have forged an equally catholic, Portuguese-language variant of Latin rock.
Yet each nation's burgeoning rock scene might have continued in insularity were it not for recent advances in technology and more contacts between the local affiliates of multinational record companies. Perhaps the biggest factor in breaking down barriers, artists and managers agree, has been the explosive growth of cable television in Latin America during the last five years.
"MTV Latino and CNN en Espanol have been fundamental" in spreading rock en espanol, said Beto Cuevas, lead singer of the Chilean band La Ley, whose base is in Mexico. "They not only showed us what was happening in the United States at the same time it was happening, but also allowed us to see what was going on in Argentina or Colombia, countries that had their own rock tradition but hadn't been heard elsewhere because of a lack of communication."
But now, because of its very success, the movement, rebaptized Latin Alternative to make it more palatable to North American audiences, may be approaching a crossroads. Stimulated by the recent crossover success of home-grown Hispanic performers like Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez, interest in Latin American rock is growing in the United States, both among audiences hungry for new sounds and record companies eager for new profits.
THERE is now a Grammy award for best Latin Rock/Alternative performance, for instance, and several Latin rock songs have turned up in Hollywood films seeking an edgy tone, "Grosse Pointe Blank" and various Quentin Tarantino movies among them. College radio stations are adding rock en espanol to their playlists, Web sites and publications like Spin have begun to pay attention to the genre, and booking agencies like Creative Artists Agency have signed leading rock en espanol bands and sent them out on tour with established American pop artists.
"I know that I don't get calls from EMI Latino or Sony Discos anymore," said Tomas Cookman, manager of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Aterciopelados and other top groups, referring to the traditional Latin music departments of two big labels. "Now I'm more likely to be dealing with Maverick Records or Atlantic or Warners or Chris Blackwell. This is a wonderful moment, like the beginning of hip-hop, when Russell Simmons was just getting Def Jam together."
As a result, however, many of Latin America's most popular rock bands are facing a dilemma. Do they continue to focus on their loyal Spanish-speaking audience back home or do they shift more of their attention and energy to a potentially futile quest to break into the promising but unknown American market, at the risk of sacrificing what makes them authentic and perhaps alienating their original fans?
A hilariously sly new video by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs that has been in heavy rotation on MTV Latino in recent weeks makes it clear that at least one band recognizes the problem. The clip accompanying "La Vida" features an American image consultant, unable to speak Spanish and completely unattuned to the band's proudly grungy image and sound, trying to repackage them into a slick, dancing ensemble, a la 'N Sync or Ricky Martin.
Some artists, like Shakira, are convinced they can have it both ways. She recently signed a contract with the same management team that long guided Madonna's career and has spent much of the summer in the Bahamas, working on new material and translating some of her older songs for a projected English-language album.
"I want the chance to expand as an artist, and I'm curious," she said. "I want to know what's on the other side, how far I can take this thing. It's a challenge to sing in another language, but it's also an opportunity, and if I can have success in both languages, of course that will also bring credit to Colombia."
Julieta Venegas, in contrast, is a 29-year-old Mexican singer-songwriter who grew up in Tijuana, listening to California radio stations "with more a chance of seeing Iggy Pop or Oingo Boingo in San Diego" than hearing rock in Spanish. Though she speaks perfect English, the only suggestion of an accent being that of a Valley Girl, and recorded her latest disc in Los Angeles with American studio musicians, she insisted "it never occurred to me to write in English."
"I like having access to American music, but writing in Spanish is a big part of what I am and what makes my music interesting, even to someone who might not understand the language," she said. "We've been watching you people all the time, and now you're watching us. It's sort of funny, but it's true, and I think that's the way it's going to stay from now on, with everybody on both sides of the border exposed to a broader, richer range of influences."
 
To Try a New Sound
If the idea of Latin American rock and pop seems utterly foreign, here are a dozen records, chosen to display the diversity of the movement, that offer a good starting point for the beginner:
 
ATERCIOPELADOS -- "Caribe Atomico" (BMG 1998). Tropical punk? Psychedelic folk? It is hard to classify this eclectic collection from Colombia other than to say it never stops swinging, surprising or satisfying.
 
BLOQUE -- "Bloque de Busqueda" (Luaka Bop 1998). The group started as the back-up band for the vallenato star Carlos Vives, then made this record showing the darker side of Colombian pop, with acerbic lyrics and harsh heavy metal guitars over a driving Afro-Caribbean percussion section.
 
LOS FABULOSOS CADILLACS -- "Vasos Vacios" (Sony 1994). This Argentine ensemble has shown jazz leanings on its most recent records, but this early best-of compilation highlights its reggae-ska-dub-punk origins and includes the Brazilian-influenced "Matador," still its signature song.
 
CAIFANES -- "La Historia" (BMG/Ariola 1997). A two-disc set that traces the evolution of one of Mexico's most important groups from a clone of the Cure to a tight and deft ensemble proud of its Latin American origins.
 
CHARLY GARCIA -- "Obras Cumbres" (Sony 2000). A two-volume career retrospective from Latin America's foremost singer-songwriter, a disciple of Bob Dylan and the Beatles who has inspired a generation of younger artists. It includes "No Voy en Tren," perhaps the first rock en espanol anthem.
 
LOS AMIGOS INVISIBLES -- "The New Sound of the Venezuelan Gozadera" (Luaka Bop 1998). Dance music as self-referentially playful and goofy as anything the B-52's have ever recorded.
 
JAGUARES -- "El Equilibrio de los Jaguares" (BMG 1996). If rock en espanol has a guitar virtuoso, Mexico's Saul Hernandez is the man, and this brooding but beautiful collection of songs allows him to show off all his chops.
 
MANA -- "Suenos Liquidos" (WEA Latina 1997). The best-selling rock en espanol record ever, by a Guadalajara-based quartet that has parlayed a melodic, power-pop sound into unparalleled commercial success.
 
MOLOTOV -- "Donde Jugaran Las Ninas?" (Surco/Universal 1998). Bilingual rap from a binational quartet (three Mexicans and one gringo) that is by turns angry, scatological and humorous.
 
SHAKIRA -- "Donde Estan Los Ladrones?" (Sony 1998). At 23, this Colombian singer and songwriter has barely entered adulthood but already shows a striking talent for the polished, well-made pop tune, the most appealing of which here is probably the Arab-influenced "Ojos Asi."
 
CAFE TACUBA -- "Reves/Yo Soy" (WEA Latina 1999). A challenging two-disc collection (one of quirky instrumentals, the other of more conventional but stylistically diverse songs) that may be the crowning achievement of Mexico's most consistently adventurous and experimental rock band.
 
VARIOUS ARTISTS -- "Reconquista! The Latin Rock Invasion" (Rhino 1996). A chronicle of rock en espanol's early, punk-inspired years, with an emphasis on the Mexican pioneers of the movement but also including a pair of key cuts by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. LARRY ROHTER

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/West Islip, Long Island;
Waterside, With a Range of Prices

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
RISING on a high tide of economic good times for Long Island, the generously proportioned, traditionally middle-income hamlet of West Islip on Suffolk County's South Shore has experienced an upward surge in housing prices that surprises veteran real estate professionals.
As surprising, they said, was how quickly homes listed for sale moved in this community of single-family Cape Cods, split-levels, colonials and ranches. 
 "Everything is up, across the board," said Geoffrey S. Matherson, the owner of a real estate agency in West Islip that bears his name. "But anyone who puts a sign on the lawn sells very quickly."
With its wide range in prices -- from more than $1 million for prime waterfront locations on or near Great South Bay to less than $200,000 in well-inland neighborhoods north of Sunrise Highway -- the community caters to a broad range of buyers, including young families priced out of more expensive but in other ways similar South Shore communities a few miles west in Nassau County.
Many new buyers come to West Islip, brokers and residents said, because of highly regarded local public schools. The school district line largely defines unincorporated West Islip, giving shape and form to an area without a downtown or identifiable center.
Lately, West Islip has had attention as the boyhood home of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for United States Senate. Mr. Lazio, who speaks in campaign advertisements of his deep New York roots and lazy schoolboy days clamming on the bay, grew up on a quiet street south of Montauk Highway in a modest Cape, where his mother, Olive, still lives.
Mr. Lazio, a 1976 graduate of West Islip High School, returned there in June to deliver the commencement address to the class of 2000. "He's a hometown boy, and he has always been very concerned about this community," said Nancy Donohue, a West Islip resident for 27 years and the president of the West Islip Symphony Orchestra.
The 50-member orchestra holds three major concerts a year. Tickets are $5.
For others, it is what lies near but not in West Islip that adds much of the hometown feeling. The hamlet has a convenient entrance onto the Robert Moses Causeway, and ocean beaches and fishing are minutes away.
Getting to the city is not quite so simple. Without a railroad station of their own, city-bound West Islip commuters must drive about 10 minutes west to Babylon village, where an assortment of private lots provide parking.
"We have a lot of wives that run their husbands to the train," said Carl W. Riese, president and owner of Segal-Riese Realtors in West Islip.
Major shopping is a 10-minute drive away at the 1.3-million-square-foot Sunrise Mall in East Massapequa and the 846,000-square-foot South Shore Mall in Bay Shore. There are also stores and restaurants locally along Montauk Highway, Union Boulevard and Sunrise Highway.
In an indication of rising real estate prices that some brokers said were just now leveling off, a three-bedroom, one-bath ranch in the Concord Village neighborhood recently sold for $225,000. Houses there frequently sold for less than $200,000 a few years ago.
HOUSE rentals, when they can be found, are also getting more expensive. A three-bedroom, one-bath house recently rented for $1,700 a month. Rents are lower at the 15-unit Keith Garden Apartments, the hamlet's only rental complex, where two-bedroom units are about $900 a month. But there are no vacancies, Mr. Matherson said.
Mr. Matherson said there were also no vacancies at the hamlet's two condominium complexes. They are the 15-unit Sunrise Garden, where a two-bedroom unit sold for $160,000 in March 1999, and the recently completed South Country Estates, with 14 two-bedroom town houses that sold for about $250,000.
People tend to stay, and children come back. Virginia Bonfiglio, whose parents moved to West Islip from Queens in the early 1950's, now lives down the street from them and not far from her grown daughter. "That's three generations in a two-block radius," she said.
So many young families have moved here in recent years that the 5,800-student West Islip Union Free School District will reopen an elementary school in September, bringing the number to six. The high school had 307 graduates in the class of 2000, more than 90 percent of whom are going on to college, but enrollment in the bulging sixth grade exceeds 500.
In March 1999, district residents approved a whopping $52.9 million bond issue for more classrooms and renovations to all schools and the reopening of the Captree elementary school. There are two middle schools for grades six through eight.
Nearly 70 percent of June graduates earned Regents diplomas. Thirty-seven graduates scored more than 1,300 on the College Board examinations. Class averages of 497 in verbal and 507 in math were slightly above the state averages.
The high school offers advanced placement courses and extensive opportunities to use computers and is one of the few schools on Long Island to teach introductory Chinese. There is a specially designed classroom for students with special needs, half of whom are from outside the district. A partnership with Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center, which is in West Islip, teams students with medical professionals. A new global communications center is scheduled to open this fall.
THE center will employ computers, a satellite dish and Internet hookups to allow language students to tap directly into other cultures for audio and visual material -- newscasts, for example, or virtual tours of the Louvre given in French. Students will also be able to converse in real time with students in other countries. The classroom teacher will have computer capability to track students individually and send messages that appear on their monitors. The district said Mr. Lazio obtained the $176,000 federal grant to finance the center.
West Islip is also the home of St. John the Baptist diocesan high school, which draws 1,000 students in grades 9 through 12 from many parts of Long Island. Almost all of the 238 graduates in the Roman Catholic school's class of 2000 plan to go to college. Tuition is $4,375 a year for all students.
The school has a range of programs for its students, including the academically gifted and those with learning disabilities. An advanced placement program allows students to earn 32 college credits through St. John's University and New York Institute of Technology.
Boys' soccer teams have been standouts in the school's full athletic program, winning a national high school championship four years ago and league championships in two of the last three years.
There are five computer labs and all classrooms are linked to a school computer network. Internet use is integrated into course instruction. Students in the communications program produce a 22-minute program each weekday entitled "Good Morning St. John's" that is shown on the school's closed-circuit television system. The school also has an AM and and FM radio station.
THE school strives to create a Catholic community atmosphere. Non-Catholic students, whose numbers have been rising, make up less than 5 percent of the student body.
Students are required to wear blazers, dress shoes, oxford shirts and, for boys, ties. Hair cannot be too long, too short or faddish, and earrings are prohibited for boys, who must also be close-shaved. "If a major corporation does not allow orange hair, a goatee and five earrings, we don't allow it either," said the Rev. Jim Vlaun, the school chaplain.
A Catholic elementary school, Our Lady of Lourdes, has 375 students in prekindergarten through the eighth grade. Tuition for the half-day prekindergarten classes is $85 a month, rising to $200 a month for kindergarten through the eighth grade. Nonparishioners pay $25 a month more.
The Town of Islip's 14.5-acre Casamento Park, the largest outdoor recreation area in West Islip, has ball fields, a picnic spot and courts for tennis, basketball and handball. Season permits for the park's swimming pool complex, which is opened from mid-June to Labor Day, are $125 for a family and $80 for an individual.
There are 134 boat slips, and a two-year waiting list, at the Town of Islip's beach and marina. The docking fee is $34 a foot. There is also a boat ramp.
The original inhabitants of the area, the Secatogue Indians, lived along the bay and on Sumpwams Creek and what is now called Willetts Creek. They sold the land to Thomas and William Willetts in 1692. The area remained a fishing and farming enclave until wealthy estate owners arrived more than a century later.
By the mid-1800's, the railroad had arrived in nearby Babylon, and lumber and charcoal industries were prospering. Ukrainians arrived early in the 20th century, and by 1930 there were 734 residents.
The eastward-rolling suburbanization of Long Island struck in the early 1950's and peaked by the early 1970's, the 20-year period in which most homes were built. The population by 1970 was slightly higher than it is today.
But school enrollment hints that new peaks may lie ahead. "We are experiencing a population boom here," said Nancy M. Lenz, a school district spokeswoman.

Developers Meeting Demand for Warehouse Space

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WAREHOUSE distribution buildings, some as large as city blocks, are sprouting across New Jersey. Hoping to lasso the state's bullish industrial market, developers are constructing such buildings with -- or without -- specific tenants in place.
Two projects illustrate the different approaches developers are taking to meet what they say -- and commercial brokers agree -- is an unmet demand for modern warehouses with high ceilings of 32- to 38-feet, to accommodate racking systems. "Businesses change, and a 1930's warehouse can no longer serve the needs of a year 2000 company," said David T. Houston, the president of Colliers Houston, a commercial real estate brokerage and services firm in Teaneck. 
 The demand, Mr. Houston added, is coming from tenants who are expanding into new buildings or consolidating operations to increase efficiency.
In the Secaucus section of the Meadowlands, Hartz Mountain Industries will start driving piles next month for a 338,850-square-foot industrial building for the Lantis Eyewear Corporation, a designer and distributor of sunglasses, based in Manhattan. Lantis will consolidate its warehouse, distribution and administrative functions, which are now in three different locations in Bergen and Hudson Counties.
The new building on Secaucus Road is expected to be completed next summer. Lantis will lease the building, which will provide the growing company with an additional 100,000 square feet of space, for 15 years. The project's estimated cost, including the value of the lease, is over $40 million.
Hartz, which is one of the largest property owners in the Meadowlands, is also in negotiations with another tenant to build a second 300,000-square-foot building on the same 35-acre Secaucus Road site.
Heller Industrial Parks is taking a different tack in Edison, where it has begun work on a speculative project. Its two buildings, one with 171,411 square feet and the other with 958,446 square feet, will rise on 52 acres in the company's 410-acre industrial park at the end of Mill Road. The $34 million project will include a $1 million 8,937-square-foot children's day-care center, which will replace a smaller center that will be razed to make way for the new buildings.
The 1.3-million-square-foot development follows two earlier speculative projects, with one with one million square feet and the other with 1.25 million, that Heller, which is based in Edison, has built in the last five years at the park. The two new buildings, expected to be finished in the next 12 months, will complete the park, which will eventually contain nearly eight million square feet of space.
The Secaucus and Edison buildings are part of a spate of projects totaling 5.2 million square feet now under construction in the 11-county northern and central New Jersey market. The current pace of construction is consistent with that of the last two years, when 12.5 million square feet was completed, brokers said.
But the focus of the new construction, they added, has increasingly been on speculative projects. Tenants often want warehouses to be ready when they decide to enter or expand in markets, Mr. Houston of Colliers Houston and other commercial brokers said.
MUCH of the new space continues to go up in the central part of the state. Such traditional magnets as Edison and the area around Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike are particular hot spots. The activity is also moving farther south on the turnpike to Exit 7A in Mercer County but is limited in northern New Jersey by the lack of suitably zoned land.
Despite the addition of new space, "the rate of construction has not exceeded demand," Mr. Houston said, adding that large blocks of space of 200,000 to 500,000 square feet are difficult to find. Strong leasing activity and the conversion of older industrial buildings to technology centers has kept the lid on supply, he said.
In the second quarter the industrial vacancy rate in the northern and central parts of the state dropped to 3.2 percent from 4.4 percent in the second quarter of 1999. At the same time, average rental rates have hovered around $5 a square foot a year, according to Grubb & Ellis, the commercial brokerage firm.
Joel M. Orenstein, a senior vice president of Grubb & Ellis, noted that the new buildings were often substantially leased before they were completed. An example is the 300,000 square feet of space that Anixter, a Chicago-based distributor of data communication products and electrical wire and cable, has leased in a 501,400-square-foot building under construction at the 150-acre Cranbury Business Park, three miles from Exit 8A. Mr. Orenstein, who represented Anixter in the transaction, said the company would be expanding from a smaller space elsewhere in the 8A area.
Most brokers said the overall industrial market was expected to remain healthy through the rest of the year. Mr. Orenstein, for example, said that he knew of five prospective tenants who were looking for buildings of one million square feet or more in New Jersey, and four others who needed 200,000 to 400,000 square feet. He would not name them.
Tenants' demands for larger blocks of space is what Heller Industrial Parks is banking on to fill its two new buildings in Edison. Jeffrey J. Milanaik, the company's president, said that despite the risks involved in so large a speculative project, which the company is financing itself, "it enables us to achieve an economy of scale."
The smaller 171,000-square-foot building will be divided in half, and two prospective tenants have expressed interest in the space, Mr. Milanaik said. He said the larger 958,446-square-foot building has been designed for tenants needing 200,000 square feet or more, but the space could be divided into areas as small as 70,000 square feet.
T HE current project, like the earlier ones at the industrial park, has received a five-year tax abatement from the Edison Township Council. "We needed a little help because the cost of constructing on the site is more expensive" -- costs have gone up and the soil is softer than usual, Mr. Milanaik said. But with the abatement, rents can be kept competitive at $5.25 a square foot, he said.
Mr. Milanaik said if the "market holds steady until next year," he expected his company to move into the Interchange 8A market with a 202-acre project in South Brunswick that will have up to four million square feet in five buildings. He said the first 1.25-million-square foot building would be built on speculation.
Commercial brokers said the Meadowlands region continued to draw attention from tenants that want to be near Manhattan. That area, which covers parts of seven communities in Bergen and Hudson Counties, has a vacancy rate of 3.2 percent and average rents of $5.80 a square foot, the highest in the state, according to Grubb & Ellis.
"Until the inventory of existing space was absorbed over the last five years, the cost of constructing new buildings was still greater" than renovating existing ones, said Emanuel Stern, the president of Hartz Mountain Industries, which has enough vacant sites in the Meadowlands to accommodate buildings totaling one and half to two million square feet. "Now we're seeing the demand for space push into our developable land."
Hartz had originally planned to build a 300,000-square-foot outlet mall on the Secaucus Road site where the Lantis Eyewear project will rise. "While the market for outlet malls has not been hot, the industrial market here is hopping," Mr. Stern said, explaining why he dropped the plans for the mall.
While Mr. Stern said his company "toyed with the idea of building a speculative ware-house" on Secaucus Road, the deal with Lantis Eyewear surfaced.
The deal ends a yearlong search for new quarters for Lantis, which has grown to 750 employees in the last decade, 450 of them working in the three New Jersey locations. "We are totally jammed in and hungry for space," said Lon J. Moellentine, the company's president and chief executive.
Mr. Moellentine said his company looked at speculative buildings in "the middle of cornfields as far as 7A on the turnpike," before opting to join with Hartz at the Secaucus site. "We were driven by labor," he said, noting that "while rents are significantly higher in northern New Jersey, that will be offset by the benefit of continuity." He said he expected all of his New Jersey employees to make the move to the Secaucus property, which will "give us room to grow."

HEADLINE: The View From/West Hartford;
Once a Home for Milk Trucks, Now a Theater in the Round

BYLINE: By PATRICIA WEISS

 BODY:
WEST HARTFORD, virtually equidistant between Boston and New York, has long capitalized on its proximity to more live culture than a lifetime supply of yogurt. Now, with construction under way on the Park Road Playhouse, the town is about to gain the first live theater of its 146-year-old history.
"It's long overdue, and I think we have the infrastructure and the demographics to support it," said the town's mayor, Rob Bouvier. "West Hartford has had a longstanding tradition of embracing and supporting the arts." 
 The theater, scheduled to open next winter, has already gained support. More than $375,000 of its $500,000 budget has been raised, including a $200,000 grant from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, $100,000 from the State Office of Policy and Management and $27,000 from the town's community development fund. An additional $50,000 has come from individuals.
"But the support, I think, is even above and beyond dollars and cents," said Barry Feldman, the town manager who is so enthusiastic that he submitted himself to public ridicule last spring at a roast to benefit the project. "That's evidenced on almost a daily basis," Mr. Feldman said, "by hundreds if not thousands of volunteer hours, from people who serve on the board of the theater to interested residents who donate their time to help do some demolition work in the building in which the theater is going to ultimately be housed."
That building is the former A. C. Petersen Farms dairy on Park Road, a terra cotta structure adjoining a 1939 Art Deco ice cream parlor still popular for its sundaes topped with hand-whipped heavy cream. In a garage where 48 milk trucks once revved up for their rounds, the curtain will soon rise on a theater in the round.
Mr. Feldman and other community leaders hope that the playhouse will be a kind of catalyst for development along the avenue, where $5 million has just been spent on improvements such as lighting and paving as well as burying power lines under a completely rebuilt roadway.
"This is something that's going to be very important in the future of West Hartford," said Rob Rowlson, who is in charge of business development for the town. "I think from this other things will grow, such as opportunities for artists in residence who will come here, do work and perform and expose our community to creative efforts we don't normally see otherwise."
"This thing could spiral," said Angelo Faenza, a restaurateur and president of the Park Road Merchants Association, noting that "when I first got involved in it, I had artists from Bridgeport and New Haven call me wondering if there would be studio space available for them in the building." Mr. Faenza said he thought that a busy theater might attract new businesses such as restaurants and boutiques, as well as generate other attractions. "Once you have the staging and the lights set," he said, "and you get a marquee out there, this place could be used every night, whether it be for a comedy show or jazz."
No one is as eager for the playhouse to open as its artistic director. The venture may be a major first for the town, yet for Howard Hirsch it is very much part of a second chance.
Mr. Hirsch, a 63-year-old advertising executive, once aspired to a life in the theater. But that ambition was overridden by the need to feed a growing family. Although he remained active in local theater (as artistic director of the Mark Twain Masquers), his dream of running a theater was relegated to the list of things he hoped to do someday. That changed abruptly five years ago when Mr. Hirsch said he "woke up and realized I'd almost run out of somedays." Mr. Hirsch had entered the hospital for an angioplasty, but there were complications and he was put on a list for a heart transplant. The doctors summoned his family; that's when they got word that a heart suitable for transplant had been found. And Mr. Hirsch said he knew just what to do with his revival.
Virginia Woolf once said a writer needs a room of her own. For a community theater troupe to thrive, Mr. Hirsch said, it too needs a permanent space.
"It's terribly important from an economic standpoint," he explained. "If you have your own theater, the lights, seats, working space and sound equipment are all installed. If you're performing at a school, church or other borrowed facility, you have to rent all those things and pay a crew to install them. That can cause production costs to double."
Having space to call home, he said, is also essential in attracting a faithful audience. "People like to feel comfortable knowing where they're going," he said. "Imagine if you subscribed to a six-show season, and each time you had to find a new place."
When a company has its own stage, the audience arrives with a different attitude. "They walk in expecting more, a higher level of both performance and production," he said. "It allows the company to reach higher. You can choose subject matter and plays that are more thoughtful and far-reaching."
That is what Mr. Hirsch hopes to do on Park Road. "I've worked in community theater now for about 40 years," he said, "and the reason I want to start my own theater company is to stretch further and to do plays that, while entertaining and exciting, can also be thought-provoking and informative."
The first season is expected to include "The Real Thing," by Tom Stoppard, and Arthur Miller's work "The Price." He considers each one ideal for the space, which will have just 168 seats.
Park Road, of course, is way off Broadway. It isn't even Main Street. This will indeed be community theater, although Mr. Hirsch said that doesn't mean acting that is amateurish.
"When I had my ad agency, I used to go into New York to cast commercials. You'd have a cattle call, and who came? People from Albuquerque, Buffalo and Hartford. They'd been in the city for 60 days, signed with an agent and suddenly they were 'New York talent.' It didn't take me long to realize that talent is all over the place. You find it in every walk of life -- doctors, teachers, salespeople, postmen, housewives, plumbers."
The organization's directors, by design, also come from other fields. "This theater had to have a business sense," he said, "as well as an artistic one."
Among the board members he recruited are business owners, community leaders, engineers and academicians.
"When you have theater people on a board," Mr. Hirsch said, "their primary concerns are which plays are you doing that I like, which ones have parts for me, and which have parts for my friends."
One of Mr. Hirsch's most ardent volunteers is Plato Karafelis, the principal of an elementary school, who became involved on the condition that the playhouse have an educational component.
Mr. Karafelis said he would like the theater to offer children's plays performed by adults, as well as scripts written and performed by children, student playwriting contests, poetry slams and excursions to Broadway shows.
"There is no comprehensive children's theater program here," said Mr. Karafelis, "and boy, if there's a town that's ripe for it, that would be West Hartford."
It is an idea that Mr. Hirsch readily embraces.
"Most kids have no idea what live theater is about," he said, and with television, movies, CD's and the Internet, "theater is in competition for the young mind, and it's a battle it could actually lose."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Manhattan Market;
Office Rents Are Up Sharply in the Second Quarter

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
OFFICE rents, which have been rising steadily for several years, spiked upward in the second quarter of this year, leading some real estate executives to express concern that vital service providers, such as smaller law and accounting firms, may be driven out of Manhattan.
According to figures compiled by the Williams Real Estate company, the average annual asking rent for office space in Manhattan increased 16.9 percent in the three months that ended in June, to $54.44 a square foot. Asking rents have increased 28.1 percent since the beginning of the year; the year-to-year increase was 35.3 percent. 
 The increase in rents is directly linked to the shrinking amount of space available for occupancy. Williams calculates that the overall vacancy rate for all office space in Manhattan is 5.1 percent, a decrease of 14.2 percent during the second quarter and a drop of 47.7 percent from June 1999.
And the averages understate the actual shortage of space available at what many consider affordable rents. In the Midtown market, 53.5 percent of the space on the market had an asking annual rent under $50 a square foot at the end of the second quarter of 1999. By the end of June this year, only 9 percent of the space was under $50 a square foot.
"A plausible Midtown business address is going to cost at least $55 a square foot and more likely $60 or $70," said Michael T. Cohen, the president of Williams. "For a while the financial district was the last refuge for companies priced out of Midtown, but it's not a refuge anymore. The space has been absorbed, and the rents spiked again in the last quarter."
The downtown business district had a 12 percent availability rate at the end of the second quarter of 1999 and an average annual rental rate in the low $30's a square foot. By the end of June this year, the availability was under 6 percent and the average rent over $40 a square foot.
"The vacancy rate is at the lowest point in 20 years," said Steven A. Swerdlow, senior managing director of the New York office of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services company. "And rents have eclipsed the highs of the early 1980's on an inflation-adjusted basis."
The strength of the market is all the more remarkable because of the recovery from the financial crises in several parts of the world in the fall of 1998, said Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, a brokerage and property management company. "People were very concerned there would be no liquidity, but now with the economy healthy and growing, everybody needs space."
Once again the averages mask some of the high points in a market where prosperous companies needing space to grow compete with one another for the limited amount available. "I am negotiating rates that start at $115 a square foot," said Tara Stacom, an executive director at Cushman & Wakefield, a large brokerage and real estate services company. "My father Matthew J. Stacom, also an official at Cushman & Wakefield predicted we would see rates of $100 a square foot by the end of the century, and people told him he was crazy. Well here we are and here they are."
Mr. Cohen said he was concerned that Manhattan would become home to an elite, with only the biggest, richest companies able to pay the rent to stay at prime locations. He said it would be bad for the city in the long term, and bad for his business as well.
Medium-size law firms, those with fewer than 100 lawyers, and moderate-size accounting firms are coming under intense pressure as a result of the rising rents. He said that one law firm that is his client -- which he would not name -- recently agreed to a rent increase before the expiration of its current lease to avoid being pushed immediately to the market rate when it rolls over.
"You like to think of New York as a land of opportunity, with a quilt of entrepreneurial companies of different sizes," he said. "But if only the big, rich companies can afford to stay, that thins out the city's economic base and leaves it vulnerable in the long term."
IN addition to the big picture, Mr. Cohen said he had strong little-picture fears as well. "I am a purchaser of legal and accounting services and I get better quality services when there are many firms competing for my business," he said. "If high rents thin out the ranks of local services providers, that works to my disadvantage."
Mr. Swerdlow said he also saw that as a danger. "There will be haves and have nots," he said. He said that Internet and new-media companies say they cannot afford to wait for new construction, such as the million-square-foot building Forest City Ratner Companies is planning at its Metrotech complex in Brooklyn, and so they increase the pressure in the existing market.
If only the richest companies can remain in Manhattan, "it changes the fabric of city life," said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage and services company. "It will be different if only the top knowledge workers and their immediate support staff remain, and the effects will ripple out to the stores and restaurants."
Real estate executives said they saw nothing on the horizon to dampen the office market in Manhattan and said it would continue to drive tenants to look for alternatives such as Jersey City and the rest of the New Jersey coast facing the city. Many say they expect more building in downtown Brooklyn and in the Long Island City section of Queens.
And the remaining fringes of Manhattan are expected to be renovated for tenants who cannot overcome a reluctance to cross a river.
"We are going to see a lot of activity on 11th and 12th Avenues between 30th and 59th Street," said James S. Meiskin, president of Plymouth Partners, a brokerage specializing in representing tenants.
This area is one of the last sections of Manhattan that is primarily industrial, with garage, warehouses and distribution centers. But the successful conversion of old factories farther south in Chelsea to offices for new media and Internet companies makes it likely there will be demand for office space farther north.
The high rents for office space are forcing companies to decide how many people they actually need in Manhattan, and how many might be just as well based in less costly boroughs and suburbs, real estate executives say.
Regardless of the effect it may have on the ambience of the city, economics are forcing tenant companies to look hard at their Manhattan operations. "Every business has to consider why they are here," Ms. Tighe said. "They have to determine what kind of work has a profit margin that justifies housing a person in Manhattan."
As companies split their operations, with only the high-value-added jobs staying in Manhattan, the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens should benefit, she said. "Queens is going to be hopping and downtown Brooklyn is going to be active too," Ms. Tighe said. "These areas have not shared in the job growth because, at least in the past, people wanted Manhattan addresses."
But even soaring rents are not a deterrent to companies that are lacking an even more precious commodity: skilled workers to operate the business.
"I have two clients who moved out and are trying to move back in," Ms. Stacom said. "They couldn't find the labor they needed and they're trying to come back because New York still has the right labor supply."

HEADLINE: On Stage, a Dancer's Busy Life

BYLINE: By E. KYLE MINOR

 BODY:
FRANK ROOT can breeze through Fairfield, his hometown, without being recognized, but there is hardly a Broadway dancer who doesn't know him. He has worked steadily as a supporting actor and director for more than 20 years, including choreographing as many as 7,000 dancers in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Currently, Mr. Root is performing in "George M!" at Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam in the supporting role of George M. Cohan's father, Jerry.
"I've played George 15 years ago and I've played Jerry before, too," Mr. Root said after a recent performance. "I'm more like Jerry Cohan than George. Jerry was polite, sedate. He didn't like getting in people's way." 
 On stage, Mr. Root is hardly sedate and yet never in people's way. Other than John Scherer in the title role, Mr. Root has the busiest feet in the production. He takes part in 18 of the 29 musical numbers, which is more than many of the company members nearly half his age. There aren't many middle-aged hoofers who can handle the load eight performances a week. "Frank is a wonderful performer and a wonderful person," said Greg Ganakas, director of the musical. "It is a demanding role, but Frank is a tireless worker."
One reason Mr. Root can handle the rigors of his role is that he has been dancing since his childhood in St. Louis. His mother, a dancer, started Mr. Root in classes when he was 7, along with his three sisters. By the time he was in his early 20's, Mr. Root had developed into an accomplished dancer, specializing in tap.
Mr. Root has performed on Broadway and in national touring productions of "42nd Street," "Mack and Mabel" and "Pirates of Penzance," to name a few. He has also directed and choreographed roughly a dozen other professional productions. Not strictly a song and dance man, Mr. Root also acts in straight plays, such as the Off Broadway production of "Dealer's Choice" a few seasons ago. He also teaches acting at New York University.
In 1977 his dance training introduced him to more than just work. He met Marianne Challis, a singer and actress, during a production of "Follies" at the Milwaukee Melody Tent. The two never parted and married a few years later. The couple worked together often, which is not easy in a business that offers more than enough unemployment for single people. Mr. Root has in fact worked so much that this is his fifth production of "George M!," a relatively obscure musical in which few of today's young actors get a chance to perform.
"George M!" was originally produced on Broadway in 1968 with Joel Grey in the title role. The show vaguely chronicles the life of the original "Yankee Doodle Dandy" from his youthful days in the family act, "The Four Cohans," through his last hurrah in the 1937 musical spoof of F.D.R., "I'd Rather Be Right."
Written by Michael Stewart and Francine and John Pascal, "George M!" features the best of Cohan's popular music, from his romantic "Mary's a Grand Old Name" to his banner-waving "You're a Grand Old Flag." The musical is based on both Mr. Cohan's autobiography and the 1942 film "Yankee Doodle Dandy," in which James Cagney won his only Oscar in the leading role. Considering that "George M!" opened during the height of the Vietnam war, it was a solid hit with its 437-performance run. "The show is fairly honest in its portrayal of Cohan," Mr. Root said. "He was pretty egotistical and not the most popular person in the business."
Mr. Root said that his favorite moment in the show is when Mr. Cohan shows his vulnerability. "It's right before George opens his first big hit, 'Little Johnny Jones,' " he said. "The curtain's about to go up when George tells Jerry he's afraid to fail. That relieves Jerry, who tells him that now he's ready to be a hit."
This is Mr. Root's first show at Goodspeed. He said he enjoyed working close to home so he could spend time with Ms. Challis and their two children, Lonnie and Abigail.
"Marianne and I have lots of friends who have worked here," Mr. Root said, "so we've come up to see shows. I really like it. It's beautiful. The town is so quaint." But, he added: "The best thing is the work. Although I really enjoy teaching and directing, my first love has been performing. This show is a lot of work, but I'm enjoying it."
"George M!" is at Goodspeed Opera in East Haddam through Oct. 7. (860) 873-8668. Tickets $20-$42.

HEADLINE: From Suitcases on Wheels To Tear-Free Onion Slicers

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
THEY all laughed when Edison recorded sound," Ira Gershwin wrote in 1937. They also laughed at Bernard Sadow and the funny-looking suitcase on wheels he tugged into Macy's one morning.
Mr. Sadow and his prototype were ridiculed and rejected by a buyer for Macy's, which carried the conventional luggage Mr. Sadow's company, U.S. Luggage, made. 
 But this was 1972, and no one knew from luggage on wheels. Soon, the glum luggage manufacturer found himself wheeling his idea right back out.
"They said, 'No one's going to pull a suitcase on the end of a strap,' " Mr. Sadow recalled.
But two weeks later, he got an appointment with a Macy's vice president who was soon doing just that: towing the suitcase around his office, giggling with glee. He called in the naysaying buyer and, smiling broadly at him, asked: "So, Jack, what do you think of my new idea?" recalled Mr. Sadow. "He looked at me and then back at the boss, and he said, 'Great, I love it.' "
The executive told the buyer to buy, and that was the start of wheels on luggage. Mr. Sadow, 75, recalled it all recently in the well-furnished living room of his sprawling Chappaqua home. Besides getting the last laugh, Mr. Sadow still receives licensing fees from manufacturers selling bags using his 1972 patent on rolling luggage.
"I know they're still selling because I watch the royalty checks coming in," Mr. Sadow said.
Westchester has had a long tradition of inventors. Most of the large corporations in the county, like International Business Machines, keep a stable of inventors on staff to develop technologies and processes. But more and more independent inventors are springing up, setting up shop in basements and garages around the county.
The county is still known for buttoned-down bankers and lawyers catching the 6:58, not eccentric shock-haired geniuses crying "Eureka!" from their workshops.
But, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, about 600 inventions a year are dreamed up in Westchester and patented. In New York State, only Monroe County, where Rochester-based Kodak is situated, had more patents last year at 1,549. By comparison, Manhattan had 533 and Nassau 351.
Inventors proliferate in areas with large corporations and high-education levels, said Richard J. Apley, director of the office of independent inventor programs for the Patent and Trademark Office.
Inventing is on the rise for a number of reasons, said Joanne Hayes-Rines, editor and publisher of Inventors' Digest magazine in Boston. The economy is booming, and the Internet provides a marketplace for inventors to sell their devices, as well as an information resource.
For Mr. Sadow, inspiration came one day in 1971 when he was lugging a large suitcase through customs and a man breezed by towing heavy machinery on a dolly.
"I said, 'Now that's what we need, wheels on luggage,' " recalled Mr. Sadow, who took the heavy casters from a large trunk and fastened them to the bottom of a suitcase. He tied a rope to it, "and it worked like a charm," he said.
Since then, his inventions include air-cushioned carrying cases for laptop computers, electric toothpicks and training wheels for tipsy suitcases. His latest innovation, a spray dispenser for holy water, now sells for $19.95 at the gift shop at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan.
Of course, not every inventor is as successful as Mr. Sadow.
So far, Vince and Patrice Cacciatore of Yonkers have not made any profit from their inventions; not from their toothpaste tube key, nor from their cough drop lollipop for children.
They are devout Catholics and say they invent in the name of the Lord. They hope their latest inventions hit big, so they can use the profits to rent billboard space for biblical quotations.
Mr. Cacciatore, who owns a copy machine repair service, invented a cardboard platform for take-out pizza boxes, to keep the pies from getting soggy by letting air circulate under the crust.
Mrs. Cacciatore invented memorial picture frames for owners of deceased pets. The pet's photo goes in the front and its crematory ashes go in the rear. The frames, which come in mirror and black acrylic finishes, have just gone on the Internet at a starting price of $18.99. Larger containers for human remains are coming.
On average, it takes 18 months to get a patent approved. Most applications are prepared by lawyers, who charge an average of $5,000 an application. Costs vary enormously to build a prototype and market it to manufacturers.
Inventing and then successfully marketing a product are very different things, said Stephen I. Mayo of New Rochelle, who owns Artistic Office Products in the Bronx.
"Some of your best inventions don't sell," he said, "and the least patentable turn out to be best sellers."
Mr. Mayo recently patented two items but wound up marketing only one -- a simple wire device he made to fit as a coat hook over an office cubicle partition. But his innovative retractable wall hook, an idea he got from a clothes hook in an airplane bathroom, never appealed to customers, so he shelved it.
Nowadays, he said, independent inventors find it more difficult to persuade retailers to carry their products.
"There's less interest in product innovation because the stakes are huge, and buyers don't want to take chances," Mr. Mayo said. "It's hard to introduce a new item unless you have big money behind you. Buyers don't want a product that's not backed by national advertising."
Rachel Kaminsky, a third grader from Ardsley, has not yet sought national advertising for her invention, a device for cutting onions without crying, but she did get national recognition and she is preparing an application for a patent.
Her "Dry Eyes" onion slicer helped her win a $5,000 savings bond in a national contest held this spring by Sears, Roebuck & Company and the National Science Teachers Association, becoming the only finalist from a region that includes New York and several other states (and the youngest in the country).
Rachel, 8, took an inventing class last fall at her school, the Concord Road Elementary School. She devised the slicer after her mother asked her to help in the kitchen by chopping onions. With her tears came a vow to solve the problem.
She made a dome out of a clear plastic bowl, attached a circular apple cutter to the bottom and a cloth screen to the top with an attached pouch of baking soda to absorb the onion odor.
Her mother said Rachel had long created inventions out of household items, like the view-finder she made to teach her little brother left and right.
As for the slicer, "We use it all the time," Mrs. Kaminsky said. "She thinks it should be in Lechter's."
Despite stories of Nobel Prizes and comfortable fellowships, inventing is tough, tedious work and rarely lives up to its sometimes romantic image.
"You hear about flashes of brilliance, that's the sexy part," said Neil Baldwin, author of "Edison: Inventing the Century" (Hyperion Books, 1995). "But stamina and persistence are as important as creativity."
Edison filled 3,000 notebooks with his ideas, Mr. Baldwin said, and he once spent 100 nights in his workshop, staying away from his family at home. His wife often complained about his absence from the dinner table.
The family of Richard J. Maiaro, an inventor from New Rochelle, knows the feeling. When he is on the verge of a breakthrough idea, he said, "it weighs on your brain till you come up with a solution."
"Sometimes I'll be at the dinner table with my kids, and I'll be in another world," he said. "The next thing I know, my 10-year-old son's looking at me, saying, 'Daddy, Daddy, where are you?' "
Mr. Maiaro had trouble with his earlier inventions. His idea for an alarm system operated by a remote key-chain switch was rejected by Cadillac. Discouraged, he never patented the idea, which has since become standard in the automobile industry. Then he designed a pen that was easier and cheaper to assemble than the competition's designs, but his silent partner began showing off the design and another manufacturer beat him to the patent and to market.
Now, Mr. Maiaro is trying to market two machines he recently invented. One is a machine that prints two colors simultaneously on promotional pens or pencils.
Printers have long had problems aligning pens correctly to add multiple layers of color, but Mr. Maiaro's machine marks the pen with invisible dye, which is then sensed by a scanner when positioning the pen for additional layers. His machine can print logos on 20,000 pens in eight hours, and he has sold two so far, for $70,000 apiece.
Last march, he patented a safety apparatus for a weight-lifting bench. The unit extends above the bench press, lifting the barbell with a winch if the user becomes too fatigued.
The Patent Office said one of the largest groups of applications involves exercise equipment.
Brian M. Dugan, a patent lawyer from Tarrytown, developed with one of his professors from Yale, Dr. Robert D. Grober, a device to teach golfers proper swing tempo.
The device is slipped onto the shaft of a golf club, and using an accelerometer, the device emits an even tone when the user is swinging smoothly.
Mr. Dugan has also patented another exercise feedback device, a hand-held computer game based on the user's exertion level during exercise. The more strenuous the workout, the better the computer character kickboxes his way out of captivity.
But "you don't have to be a technical genius, or come up with some breakthrough in computer technology to patent a succesful product," said Richard C. Wingate, a marketing lawyer for Sony Electronics.
Mr. Wingate, from Scarsdale, invented a wireless headphone set with a retractable microphone, which allows the user to answer the phone while listening to the stereo and television.
Looking for a headlight for night jogging, he fastened a small halogen penlight to his radio headphones and patented it.
"It's about having an idea that's useful and that nobody's thought of before you," Mr. Wingate said.
While many part-time inventors dream of doing it full time, some who work in research and development departments for large corporations complain that the patents, and most of the profits, go to the company.
Joseph R. Infantino worked 30 years for AMF, the sporting goods manufacturer, in its Stamford laboratories as the chief plastics chemist. He regularly met with athletes like Ben Hogan, Guillermo Vilas and Arthur Ashe, discussing the products they endorsed for AMF.
Mr. Infantino, 67, a lifelong Chappaqua resident, developed equipment like tennis rackets, skis and swim fins. His inventions for bowling alleys brought bowling into the modern era, where perfect games have become commonplace.
In the late 60's, he used a hard plastic called Surlyn to coat bowling pins, making them livelier and more durable. He also developed the urethane bowling ball, which had superior traction and could be hooked by bowlers to get consistent strikes.
He patented the inflatable interior used in Head ski boots, a concept now widely used in sneakers, and he patented a florescent bowling pin, now used by alleys for rock 'n' roll bowling.
In all, he had 16 inventions for AMF, most of which got him a handshake and a $100 bonus, he said.
"You sign your life away to these big corporations," he said, adding that if he had shared in the profits, "I'd be on the Italian Riviera right now."
Now he applies for his own patents and sells licensing rights to AMF.
In the cramped basement boiler room, crowded by boxes of pasta and cans of Campbell's soup, he works on improving bowling pins. He recently patented an improved method to adhere hard covers to the pins, which he is licensing to AMF for a six-figure payment.
Another corporate defector is Steven Linder, the self-proclaimed "king of inflatable furniture" and a former executive with the Ethan Allen furniture company.
Seeing inflatable cushions and seats that "were more like blobs," Mr. Linder designed a fully inflatable armchair and patented it in 1994, starting an inflatable furniture fad that pervaded college dormitories, tailgate parties and the living rooms of armchair quarterbacks.
Mr. Linder's Purchase-based Sterling Promotions company sells the chairs, which usually bear the logos of professional sports teams or beer companies.
His Dallas Cowboys ottoman, that doubles as an ice chest, and the Britney Spears armchair, are both evidence that inventions need not be groundbreaking contributions to modern science to sell.
With nine patents for inflatable furniture, Mr. Linder, 52, proudly boasts, "I've taken inflatable furniture to another level."
 
A Stable Full of Chemists, Physicists and Scientists
Most companies that deal in intellectual property keep large stables of inventors. Three of the state's top four patent recipients -- I.B.M., Xerox and General Electric -- have large offices in Westchester.
I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Center, the company's largest laboratory, occupies three buildings in Yorktown Heights and Hawthorne. Many innovations in information technology have come from the Watson labs, from semiconductor technology to the first "super computers" to the software that runs E-commerce systems.
The center's research and development staff includes 1,400 inventors -- chemists, physicists and computer scientists -- said Paul M. Horn, chief inventor for I.B.M.
The company spends roughly $6 billion annually on research and development worldwide and last year earned $1.3 billion from licensing fees. It has produced five Nobel prize winners and more patents than any other company in the world, Mr. Horn said.

It's Colonel Mustard in the Kitchen

BYLINE: By JOSEPH D'AGNESE

 BODY:
YOU can call him Paul Fischer. Or you can call him Paul. Or you can call him Mr. Fischer. But if you really want to get to heart of the matter, call him Mister Mustard. Really. He doesn't mind. Everybody calls him that.
For 28 years the Mr. Fischer, a 69-year-old Franklin Lakes resident, has owned and operated House of Herbs Inc., a Passaic company that puts out jars of a spicy condiment called Mister Mustard. It's a quirky brand that sports a retro image of a chef with a luxuriant mustachio and a dreamy look in his eyes. 
 "How shall I describe it?" said Mr. Fischer. "We make a mustard that's better in quality than the run-of-the-mill, but we're not a Grey Poupon."
Ah, but it's a Jersey mustard, and that's got to count for something.
More sophisticated than ketchup, more daring than mayo, mustard is the king of condiments, and the condiment of kings. King Louis XI of France traveled everywhere with his mustard pot. He would always have a supply on hand -- and he neatly sidestepped nasty poisoning plots. During the 14th century Avignon Papacy, Pope John XXII named his nephew Chief Mustardeer to the Pope. And Thomas Jefferson, who was consumed as much with perfecting the gardens surrounding Monticello as he was with nailing down inalienable rights, planted mustard seeds after sampling a good Dijon during his French ambassadorship.
Travel the nation in this season of beaches, ball games and cookouts, and you'll find millions slathering yellow or brown paste on their dogs and sausages, their pretzels, knishes and bratwursts.but historically, Americans have preferred not to mess with eye-watering, nose-running mixtures consumed with such, well, relish in the rest of the world. When the upstate New Yorkers George and Francis French introduced their classic yellow mustard in 1904, they softened the mustard seed's kick and added turmeric for coloring. The result was a mild (some would say bland) yellow mustard that has become the No. 1 mustard in North America, forever duking it out with the slightly spicier (though not by much) brown mustard first concocted by Charles Gulden on Elizabeth Street in Manhattan in 1862.
Mustard sales hit $300 million last year, a 10 percent rise over the last five years, and New Jersey tosses its fair share into that fray. Numerous food companies call the Garden State their home. There is French's (with headquarters in Wayne), Gulden's (Parsippany), Hellman's (Englewood Cliffs), and A&P (Montvale). Even Grey Poupon is distributed by Nabisco in East Hanover. This doesn't mean the mustards are made here. French's, for example, produces its condiment in Springfield, Mo. But scan the label on these products and you come up Jersey.
So in that sense, New Jersey brings mustard to the masses.
But faceless national brands don't exactly inspire local loyalty. Heck, in Cleveland, baseball fans alone are torn between two hometown brands -- Bertman's Ballpark and Stadium Mustard -- which have slugged it out for years. Things don't get that heated in Jersey. But if there is passion to be found, it could lie with the state's few small mustards.
One of the oldest is Pulaski Stone Ground, produced by family-owned Pulaski Products in Carlstadt. It is a strong, yellow-brown mustard that has graced shelves in Polish-American homes since 1934. According to Stanley Mazepa, who bought the company in 1977 from its founder, John Warren, the mustard is still popular in towns with a large Polish community: Garfield, Clifton, Linden, and Wallington.
As a youngster, Mr. Mazepa recalls slathering his grandmother's own homemade Old World mustard. "I wished I'd gotten that recipe," he said wistfully. "It had a kick."
When he wasn't eating that, his family enjoyed one of two types of Polish mustard: Pulaski or its rival, Chicago-based Kosciusko. Both came packed in a glass mug. The Pulaski label bore the image of Gen. Casimir Pulaski, the Polish-born hero of the American Revolutionary War.
Today, the glass mug is gone, but the general lives on, with his own delicate mustachio and presiding over a condiment that, thanks to a touch of horseradish, takes no prisoners.
"A few years ago we did kick it up a few notches," said Mr. Mazepa, 54. "We made it a little stronger, and people called saying they liked it. It's not bland. You could have it on a kielbasa and it stands out."
Another standout -- and maybe even hotter -- is the Original Hot Mister Mustard. According to Mr. Fischer, the pungent recipe was first conceived as a specialty mustard by the brand's originator, a man he knows only as Mr. Frank, of the Frank Tea and Spice Company of Cincinnati. "He liked mustard but he could never find one that he liked when he went out to dinner," said Mr. Fischer. So, like King Louis XI, Mr. Frank packed his own. "He'd walk into restaurants with this mustard pot and people would say, 'Here comes Mister Mustard.' "
Mr. Fisher bought the Mister Mustard brand, recipe and customer list from the Durkee company 20 years ago. Using the original recipe and label, he began grinding mustard seed with a stone mill at his Ann Street operation in Passaic, and introduced two more varieties: Sweet Hot Mister Mustard and a Mister Mustard with Honey.
Predictably, he could not escape picking up the monicker, too. "I started walking into my country club and people call me Mister Mustard," said Mr. Fischer. "I have a house down in Florida, and when I go down there, the same thing happens."
He has accepted the mustard mantle with pride. When in Florida, Mr. Fischer tools around Boca Raton in a sports Mercedes with an unofficial license plate that reads -- what else? -- MR. MUSTARD.
In the teeming world of condiments, Pulaski and Mister Mustard are scrappy supermarket sellers that consistently earn the love of their fans. They stand outside the realm of flashier brands competing in the same market. The Silver Palate, a specialty foods company in Cresskill associated with the "The Silver Palate Cookbook," produces five mustards and two mustard sauces. Jars are topped with a dainty red-and-white cloth tied with a bit of string. A 7.5 ounce jar of Mister Mustard retails for $1.39, tops; a 7-ounce jar of Silver Palate green peppercorn garlic mustard runs $3 to $4.
Customers pay for the product, and they also pay for the cachet.
Or the story. Like the one about Ed and Doris Simpson, high school sweethearts who grew up in Irvington before World War II. He was a mechanical engineer, she was a home economist with an interest in colonial recipes. In 1974, they opened Muirhead, a restaurant in their historic 14-room colonial home in Ringoes. They kept an herb garden and mixed their own dressings and condiments. Patrons often left asking for a bottle of the vinaigrette. In time, said Mr. Simpson, now 73, the couple decided to shift gears. In 1994, they closed the restaurant and devoted themselves to managing their growing food line, Muirhead of Ringoes. Their signature product, pecan pumpkin butter, is now sold through Williams-Sonoma.
Muirhead makes three mustards; the two best are the honey mustard and horseradish (the other is a Dijon). The operation is decidedly small: family members and employees still gather in the kitchen to mix small batches. A national company acts as distributor, and Mr. Simpson himself delivers jars to stores like Delicious Orchards in Colts Neck. He also fills orders placed through muirheadfoods.com.
A member of the World Mustard Association, Mr. Simpson can attest to the expanding challenges and headaches of the market. With so many mustards out there, how can customers find yours? And for all the market growth, not everyone is a mustard nut. A jar can last six months in most refrigerators. He chuckled when a wiseacre recently suggested that he approach the Meadowlands.
"Ballparks and stadiums in this country use about 15 million pounds of mustard a year," said Mr. Simpson. "Would one be able to corral that market, you'd be talking thousands of pounds. To them it becomes a price picture. If they can buy it for a penny cheaper, they will."
But the thought lingered in his head.
"Volume would enable me to lower the price," he said. "Let's just say it's available."

HEADLINE: THE LAW;
Waterfront Fire Safety Is Examined

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
Less than a decade ago, a section of waterfront here known as Harsimus Cove, a 40-acre expanse of trucked-in sand, lay like a bizarre, man-made Sahara amid the skyscrapers that had risen in the 1980's.
But high-rise buildings have been sprouting like dune grass in Harsimus Cove in recent years, as well as along other formerly barren stretches of Hudson River in Hoboken as well as here, irrigated by economic good times and the urge to be a PATH stop from Manhattan. Farther north along what is called the Gold Coast, town houses and condominium clusters are mushrooming at the base of the Palisades. 
 While the growth has generally been applauded by state and local officials, it has also increased the burden on firefighters, who say high-rise fires are labor intensive and demand knowledge of a building's intricate electrical and ventilation systems. They can also involve large numbers of residents with limited routes of escape.
"Obviously, any high-rise fire, depending on the type of fire that you have, is going to tax anybody's department," said Chief Frederick G. Eggers of the Jersey City Fire Department. "We had a certain amount of high rises up until this point, but ever since the Gold Coast has taken off, they're popping up every day."
Officially, high rises are buildings seven stories or higher. In the past 10 years, 20 of them have gone up here -- most on or near the waterfront -- for a total of about 120 buildings, officials say. Eight more are under construction, and more are planned.
Hoboken, a much smaller city, has about 40 high-rise buildings, officials there say, with construction at a similarly brisk pace. As a result, fire departments in the region have been designing training and prevention programs, seeking more firefighters with the tax revenue generated by the new buildings, and even planning new fire houses financed by developers.
Moreover, a plan is being developed by the fire director here, Armando Roman, who is also on the State Fire Safety Commission, requiring that high-rise buildings have fire personnel on duty around the clock.
Mr. Roman said that in a fire's crucial early stages, the managers could use a building's intercom system to communicate with residents and help firefighters by shutting down the power and turning off the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, which can spread smoke and fire.
Officials said that is what happened last month in a new 26-story apartment building in the Harsimus Cove section, where four people suffered smoke inhalation. "At that particular fire, had there been a fire manager, that person could have gotten on the P.A. system and as soon as he assessed the situation, could have told people, 'There's no need to evacuate the building, stay in your apartment,' " Mr. Roman said.
William Kramer, deputy director of the State Division of Fire Safety, said Mr. Roman's proposal would be the first such measure mandating safety managers. Mr. Kramer declined to comment on the proposal, which Mr Roman said he might offer at the next commission meeting Sept. 13.
Tom Gallagher, chief of staff for Mayor Bret Schundler, said Mr. Roman had briefly discussed the proposal, although the mayor had not decided whether to support it.
For now, state law requires that fire safety managers be on duty in Atlantic City casinos. In New York City, such personnel must be stationed in high-rise office buildings, whose wide floors make them more vulnerable to the rapid spread of fire.
At least one of Mr. Roman's fellow commissioners, Deputy Chief Richard Blohm of the Hoboken Fire Department, said he would support such a requirement, which -- if recommended by the commission -- would have to be approved either as legislation or as a regulation of the State Department of Community Affairs, which includes the Division of Fire Safety.
But the necessity, cost effectiveness and the potential benefit of requiring fire safety managers are far from certain. Deputy Chief Blohm said last month that he had begun surveying high rises and would then develop plans for each building.
Aside from last month's fire, in which no one was seriously injured, firefighters said they could not recall a major high-rise fire along the waterfront in recent years. But even supporters of such a requirement acknowledged that it would probably be opposed by most developers. Joseph Barry, president of the Applied Companies of Hoboken, which operates several high-rise builings there and in Jersey City, said the annual price tag could come to as much as $250,000 a building, a cost that would ultimately be passed on to tenants. In a building of 250 apartments, that would amount to $1,000 a year for each tenant, or $84 a month added to the rent.
"It's a very big burden," said Mr. Barry, who suggested that the money could be better spent elsewhere.
But Ed Cortese, a vice president for the Lefrak Organization, which has a dozen high-rise office and apartment buildings in its Newport complex, said the company already had the equivalent of round-the-clock fire safety managers. "We think it is an excellent idea," Mr. Cortese said.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
Huntington's Housing Plan: Too Little or Too Much?

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
HOUSES that moderate-income families can afford have become elusive in the Town of Huntington, where the median price in the resale market is $338,000 and the price of new houses is often half a million dollars or more.
Concerned about the lack of modestly priced housing, town officials have prepared legislation that would require that developers who are granted a zoning change set aside some units for moderate-income buyers. The Town Board is expected to vote on the proposal on Aug. 29. 
 Town officials say that the prices on these units should not exceed $125,000. This amount, they say, is the maximum that families with annual incomes of $60,000 or less can afford. The $60,000 figure is 80 percent of Long Island's median, a measure often used to define "moderate income."
All new subdivisions of 10 or more lots requiring a zoning change would be affected. Developers who are granted a higher density would have to set aside 20 percent of the additional units for moderate-income residents. A public hearing on the measure, which Frank P. Petrone, the town supervisor, and Steve A. Israel, a town councilman, are sponsoring, was held July 11.
"This is the start of a very, very aggressive housing program, probably the most aggressive of any of the towns on Long Island," said Mr. Petrone, a Republican.
While praising some aspects of the proposed law, housing advocates are sharply critical that it would not be retroactive, which means that it could not apply to one of the largest vacant tracts remaining in the town, on which a rezoning application is already pending.
The 380-acre parcel was formerly occupied by the Long Island Developmental Center, a state-owned children's psychiatric hospital. The site, part in Melville and part in Dix Hills, borders the Northern State Parkway and Carman Road just north of the Long Island Expressway. The current owner, SBJ Associates, bought it from New York State in October for $16.1 million. The state retains one children's hospital building and 34 group homes on 78 acres.
The zoning now in effect for the former hospital site would allow only one house on a two-acre plot, or fewer than 190 houses on the 380 acres. SBJ is proposing to build up to 1,375 housing units. Of these, 1,225 would be for sale: single-level condominiums, town houses, and semidetached and detached houses around a private 18-hole golf course. The remainder would be rentals.
Only 75 of the larger detached houses on half-acre and one-acre lots would be offered for sale to all age groups, and they are expected to sell for $500,000 and up. The remainder, including the rentals, would be restricted to families in which at least one member is 55 or older.
That provision has stirred the most controversy. Critics contend that property that once was publicly owned should now include housing for young families and for residents with moderate incomes.
SBJ is taking the position that it is meeting another important need: housing for older residents. "This property cannot solve all the town's housing needs," said John A. Harras, a partner in Morton Weber & Associates, the Melville law firm representing SBJ. "We are providing a project that meets a housing crisis for seniors, who are the fastest-growing population in the town."
In its rezoning application, SBJ, which is a partnership formed by two development companies, Benjamin Development of Garden City and Jobco of Great Neck, has offered to sell 100 of its proposed 400 condominium apartments for $145,000, which represents a $30,000 discount. State and county subsidies could further reduce the price to $125,000, Mr. Harras said.
Under an earlier proposal, SBJ wanted to build 150 assisted-living apartments. It is now offering to build 100 rental apartments under a federal program that subsidizes the rents of low-income elderly tenants.
SBJ has also said it would donate $2.5 million to a housing trust fund that the town could use for such purposes as subsidizing mortgages or providing grants for down payments for needy families. "There is no way that anyone can criticize this project for not having an affordable component," Mr. Harras said.
O NE of the two partners in SBJ, Benjamin Development, also owns an eight-acre tract on Ruland Road in Melville, where it is proposing to build 120 one-bedroom and studio garden apartments open to all age groups and selling for no more than $125,000 each. That would help provide badly needed starter homes for young couples working in the Melville area, Mr. Harras said.
But critics say regardless of all these proposals, moderately priced housing for young families should still be part of the mix at the former hospital property.
Jim Morgo, the president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group based in Hauppauge, called the SBJ plan a "missed opportunity."
"It perpetuates the idea that seniors only want to live with seniors and be segregated, and it misses the chance to do a visionary community with various housing types," said Mr. Morgo, who served as a consultant on the proposed legislation.
The Rev. John A. Jurik, the pastor of St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Huntington Station and a member of a coalition known by the acronym Lican, which stands for Long Island Congregations, Associations and Neighborhoods, said: "There is a crying need both for affordable housing for seniors and for affordable housing for families with children. Surely, out of 1,375 homes, 150 could be set aside for families."
The idea of developing the former hospital site largely for age-restricted housing was first proposed in 1996 by a task force formed to come up with a plan for the site when state officials first announced they would sell it. The 12 task force members represented the state and county governments and local residents.
The concern was that building housing for all age groups would bring an influx of children into the Half Hollow Hills school district, said Mr. Petrone, the town supervisor. He said that about 1,500 new homes have been built in the district in the last few years, and if the number of children continued to grow, new schools would have to be built. School taxes could rise by as much as 30 percent, he said.
"We understand that there is a need for affordable housing for families, but you also have the practical problem of crowded schools," he said. "So balancing all that, we came out with a senior housing program, for which we have now negotiated 100 affordable condominium units and 100 affordable rental units."
The remaining housing on the former hospital property would be 350 three-bedroom town houses expected to sell for $250,000 to $270,000 and 400 semiattached and detached three-bedroom houses on the golf course selling for around $350,000.
The Long Island Association, a nonprofit business group with offices in Commack, is also opposed to the SBJ plan, because it views high housing costs as a threat to the region's ability to keep or draw workers. "The issue of affordable housing on Long Island is more important than the effect on any individual school district," said Mitchell Pally, the group's vice president for legislative and economic affairs.
Although the town officials appear to bestanding firm on the SBJ proposal restricting housing at the former hospital site mostly to older residents, critics of the plan have won concessions on the pending legislation. It now specifies that developers cannot impose age restrictions on any of the units they are required to offer at reduced prices, and units must have at least two bedrooms.
But critics are pushing for another change. As now written, the proposal would permit developers to reduce the 20 percent requirement to 10 percent by contributing to the housing trust fund instead. The amount to be paid into the trust fund would depend on the density the developer is granted under a rezoning. A fee of $75,000 per house would apply where lots are 15,000 square feet or less; $150,000 per house for lots of 20,000 square feet and $200,000 per house for lots of one acre.
Opponents of that provision say that with so little land still available for development within the town, building housing is more important than building a trust fund. "Once the land is gone, the opportunity to build more affordable housing is also gone," said Mr. Jurik, the Lutheran pastor.
But Mr. Israel, the leader of the Town Board's Democratic majority, said he was unwilling to concede that point because the trust fund could serve a broad base of needy families and first-time buyers. "Housing advocates feel the entire 20 percent should be used for housing built on site, and I think that's very shortsighted," he said.
To guarantee that the housing will remain moderately priced, the proposed law would require deed restrictions to limit profits when owners resold their houses.
Although critics of the town plan say that it falls short, they also praise the town for proposing any program at all. "It's a town doing something," said Mr. Morgo of the Long Island Housing Partnership.
Mr. Jurik said the need now was for all groups to work together. "If reasonable people sit down around a table and talk about this," he said, "we won't end up as a fractured society."

HEADLINE: Near Asheville, Biltmore Is Building a 213-Room Inn

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE 

DATELINE: ASHEVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
A hundred years ago, shortly after George W. Vanderbilt built a 250-room French Renaissance country estate outside this western North Carolina city in the Blue Ridge Mountains, he carefully sketched out plans for a 50-room inn on the property.
His list began with $3,200 for 449 doors and windows. It ended with a total: $17,509.29, excluding wallpaper, plumbing, heating and electrical work. 
 Today, on a hill on what remains of Mr. Vanderbilt's estate, some two miles from the country home he called Biltmore House, a 213-room inn is taking shape. The Biltmore Company, led by Mr. Vanderbilt's great-grandson William A. V. Cecil Jr., will spend $31 million on an inn designed with the intent of giving guests a glimpse of what it was like to stay on the lavish estate about 1900.
Last year, 900,000 people visited Biltmore House and its outbuildings, including a conservatory and a winery. As a tourist destination, Biltmore now employs about 1,100 people, and it served as a location for several movies, including "Richie Rich" and "Being There."
Richard T. Pressley, the chief financial officer and executive vice president of the Biltmore Company, said that market research showed that 60 percent of the visitors to Biltmore House stay in local motels, and most stay in midpriced chains with room rates of about $100 a night. Most visitors are between 35 and 54 years old, he said.
"We've looked at this project for 20 years," Mr. Pressley said. Once convinced it was sound financially, company officials spent 18 months interviewing architects and contractors. They selected Thompson, Ventulett & Stainback Associates of Atlanta as its architect, along with the Design Workshop of Aspen, Colo., landscape architect; Hughes Design Associates of McLean, Va., interior designer; and the W. G. Yates & Sons Construction Company of Philadelphia, Miss.
The designers took some of their cues from the work of the distinguished team that designed Biltmore House before the turn of the century. Richard Morris Hunt, architect for the center part of the Fifth Avenue facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, designed the house. Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park with Calvert Vaux, created the landscape plan.
In designing the hotel, to be called the Inn on Biltmore Estate, "the intent was partially to create a building that didn't compete with the house but gave guests a sense of staying at the house," said Scott Sickeler, the project's lead architect. "What caught me by surprise was Olmsted and the influence he had over the estate," he added.
The designers sought to give guests the same sort of experience when driving up to the inn that visitors get on the three-mile approach road to the house, a road that meanders through five different North Carolina landscapes. The house is not visible until visitors get right up to it. In a similar manner, guests will be given only small glimpses of the inn as they wind their way up the hillside.
Landscaping, influenced by Olmsted's work, has already been done to allow a year's growth before the inn's opening, scheduled for March 1.
The inn faces Mount Pisgah and Mount Pisgah National Forest. "It is 270 degrees of uninterrupted wilderness," Mr. Sickeler said. Other views are of Biltmore House itself, framed by woodlands and mountains, and of downtown Asheville, several miles in the distance.
The Biltmore Company decided to manage the inn itself, rather than contract with a national chain, because corporate officials wanted direct control over quality, Mr. Pressley said. The company hired as general manager Michael Chaffin, who previously managed the Stephen F. Austin Hotel in Austin, Tex., and the Omni hotel, also in Austin. Biltmore's hospitality division is managed by Thomas B. Ruff, a senior vice president of the company who previously worked with Marriott Hotels and Resorts and the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Mr. Chaffin and Mr. Ruff say their goal is to create an inn that will win top ratings from guidebooks like those from AAA and Mobil.
In-season room rates will range from $160 to $195 a night. Nine suites will be available, ranging from $900 to $2,000 a night. The $2,000 suite has 1,400 square feet with a sitting room and one bedroom with an optional second bedroom. Discount packages will be available, but prices have not been set, Mr. Ruff said.
The inn can accommodate small corporate functions, but not conventions. Its largest meeting room will be the 1,800-square-foot Vanderbilt Room, and it will also have two smaller meeting rooms and two banquet rooms.
The lobby will have a large fireplace that mimics the huge fireplaces of Biltmore House. Mr. Vanderbilt was a book collector, and so the inn will have a library, an unusual feature for a hotel. The restaurant will be called simply the Restaurant at the Inn on Biltmore Estate. Guests will also be able to eat in the more casual restaurant at the estate's winery, just down the hill. Admission to Biltmore House -- $32 for adults -- will not be included in the room rates, and the inn will have a gatehouse, meant to keep out the merely curious.
The company has incorporated some of the signature features of Biltmore House in the inn's design. Limestone, used on the exterior of the house, will cover the lobby floor. The roof will be slate, and oak for the library came from trees on the property, as did the black walnut floors for the private dining room.
The inn will compete with two other venerable Asheville hotels, the 510-room Grove Park Inn, which is now building a $27 million 40,000-square-foot spa, and the 36-room Richmond Hill Inn. The area also has a number of upscale B & B's as well.
The company will begin taking reservations for the inn in October, and group events scheduled after April 15, 2001, are already being booked.
The Vanderbilt connection with the Asheville area began when George W. Vanderbilt, a grandson of the steamboat and railroad industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt, visited the North Carolina mountains in the late 1880's. The area was known for its healing mineral springs and fresh mountain air. In 1888, Mr. Vanderbilt decided it was the place for his country home. He began buying land, eventually assembling an estate of 125,000 acres, and commissioned designs for the house and its landscaping.
The house took six years to build. It covers four acres and included many amenities unusual for its time: elevators, electric lights and telephones. The first major event held there took place on Christmas Eve in 1895, when Mr. Vanderbilt, then a 33-year-old bachelor, entertained dozens of guests who had arrived in five train cars from New York and Newport, R.I. Through the years, Mr. Vanderbilt and his wife, Edith, entertained many celebrities at Biltmore, including Henry James, Edith Wharton and John Singer Sargent.
Mr. Vanderbilt died in 1914 during an emergency appendectomy in Washington, and Mrs. Vanderbilt returned to the estate, where the couple's only child, Cornelia, grew up. Over the years, Mrs. Vanderbilt donated and sold off much of the estate. Some 87,000 acres were deeded to the federal government for what is now Pisgah National Forest. Another chunk became Biltmore Village, a commercial area now just outside the Biltmore House gate.
But the house and 8,000 acres have remained in the family through four generations. It was opened to the public in 1930 at the request of Asheville city officials who hoped it would bolster an economy reeling from the Depression. It closed during World War II and was reopened in 1945.
By 1959, Biltmore House was losing $250,000 a year. William A. V. Cecil, a grandson of Mr. Vanderbilt and then a New York banker, returned to the family business shortly thereafter and began a turnaround that many people told him could not be achieved. The house was placed on the national Register of Historic Places in 1963, and almost a decade later, Biltmore made a profit: $16.
"The best money I've ever made," Mr. Cecil, now chairman of the Biltmore Company and the father of the current chief executive, is reported to have said.

HEADLINE: Move Over, Fire Island, Here Comes Asbury Park;
Urban Gays Lead Way in Reviving This Run-Down Resort

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK

 BODY:
ON MOST Saturdays in summer, Anthony Perrotta awakens to the clatter of breakfast dishes, the slamming of screen doors and the ceaseless chatter coming from the first floor of his four-bedroom 1920's stucco home overlooking Sunset Lake. The weekly ritual has begun: friends and neighbors drop in to discuss where everyone will be for lunch, whether it's a beach day, who will be host of a cocktail or dinner party, and what time they'll stop by the club at night.
Another activity that frequently dominates Mr. Perrotta's weekend agenda is arranging tours of the northern section of the city, with participants seeking "for sale" signs on houses, some of which may have stood vacant for so long it is hard to tell where the yard ends and the front porch begins. In the last several months there has been a growing -- and unfamiliar -- interest in real estate in this faded shore resort to a degree that realtors and city officials say they have not seen in almost 20 years. 
 While officials like to attribute the resurgence to the long-anticipated, ever-looming redevelopment of the city's decaying waterfront, those in the real estate business and those moving in say it is being driven by the market, which at the moment is largely made up of urban, professional gay men and women.
"Five years ago, a house might sit on the market for two years," said one realtor, Bruce Donaldson. "A year ago it would take six months, now they're on the market for an average of two months, and many are being sold privately before they even get listed," Mr. Donaldson added, noting that the asking prices had doubled over the last five years, and jumped by close to 50 percent in the last year alone.
Mr. Donaldson, who is also chairman of city planning board, said he had sold as many houses in Asbury Park in the first few months of this year as he sold during all of last year, with about 80 percent of his current buyers being gay.
Cheaper than the Hamptons, more relaxed than Fire Island, easier to get to than Miami Beach or Provincetown (or, for that matter, the Hamptons and Fire Island), this oceanfront city -- just an hour from Manhattan -- is seen by some as the next gay enclave. Those buying homes here either as weekend getaways or permanent residences cite several appeals: affordable houses, beautiful architecture, an almost private beach, plentiful entertainment and a certain "seediness" that has its own charm. And as their numbers grow, the gays moving in are increasingly finding a sense of community in this city of 17,000.
"It's not the Hamptons, where it's all about who's fabulous and what you're wearing," said Mr. Perrotta, 28, a Manhattan interior designer who with his partner, an attorney, bought two houses in Asbury Park in the last 10 months. "It's not the muscle boys and sex and parties of Fire Island. We all have the same bohemian mentality here: anything goes and nothing matters. It's the gay ghetto, and it's only going to get better."
Janice Gutloff, a 47-year-old guidance counselor for the New York City Board of Education who bought a 13-bedroom home with her partner here last November, said she had already made new friends since spending the summer here this year. "There's an acceptance here, a feeling of community, and there are a few gathering places for gay and lesbian people," said Ms. Gutloff, whose house also overlooks Sunset Lake. "There are lots of things going on here."
Probably the biggest draw are the bargains, where a large single-family house can be scooped up for about $150,000, about a third of the price for a similar home in such neighboring shore towns as Deal, Loch Arbour or Interlaken, and close to the cost of a seasonal rental on a prime place in Fire Island or the Hamptons. Of course, the reason real estate is so affordable here is that this 1.5-square-mile city has been impaled on hard times for more than two decades.
Founded in 1871 by James Brady, a visionary developer who also began neighboring Ocean Grove, Asbury Park was designed to be the premier resort destination on the Jersey Shore, with avenues 100 to 200 feet wide, two lakes and a mile-long oceanfront boardwalk. By 1890, the city boasted a 1,200-seat opera house, a dozen grand hotels, 1,000 guest cottages, and several large mansions owned by some of New York's finest families. A fire in 1917 wiped out many of the city's buildings, but that only made way for an even bigger building boom in the 1920's, which included the Convention Hall and the Casino, two Art Deco waterfront gems that have long since fallen into disrepair, as well as hundreds of other Victorian and Colonial-style homes.
The waterfront amusements drew hundreds of thousands of visitors annually in the 1940's and 50's, but by the 1960's the city had begun to look frayed around the edges. Businesses moved out of the downtown commercial district in favor of nearby malls, then race riots in 1969 dealt the downtown its final blow. Despite Bruce Springsteen's attempt to put the city back on the map with his 1973 album "Greetings from Asbury Park," the city continued to decline until a promise to revitalize the waterfront in the mid-1980's by a Connecticut developer, Joseph Carabetta, brought another surge of interest in Asbury Park. But Mr. Carabetta's financial failure left the waterfront in a state of abandonment, as it remains today.
Homeowners fled, leaving many properties in the hands of the city or absentee landlords who divided most of the larger homes into multi-unit rental properties. According to the latest figures supplied by the city, of the 7,692 housing units, 1,730 are single-family homes and only 1,584 are occupied by the owner.
Interestingly, however, some of the factors that have driven away other potential home buyers -- the blighted and sparsely visited waterfront, the multiracial population, and the deteriorating housing stock -- are precisely what the urban gay population finds most attractive.
"I love it the way it is now," said Bernard Figueroa, speaking about the vast, dilapidated amusement buildings that line Ocean Avenue. "It's very particular and very intriguing. I think it's beautiful."
Moreover, Mr. Figueroa, who is French, also dislikes Americans' attitudes about race and finds a perfect antidote in Asbury Park.
"People in America are so racist and prejudiced," said Mr. Figueroa, a 39-year-old shoe designer from New York who expects to close on a house on Third Avenue this summer. "They think if a neighborhood is more than 20 percent black it's a bad neighborhood. Between the gay people and the black people here, it makes an anti-yuppie atmosphere which I love."
His partner, Ted Scheffler, also says the multicultural aspect of Asbury Park was a deciding factor on where to raise the son he adopted in China four years ago. Mr. Scheffler, who teaches English as a second language, hopes to teach in Asbury Park in what many call a substandard school system that discourages families from living here. But for gay couples with children, Asbury Park again offers the best of both worlds.
"I was brought up in a house, and I wanted my son to have that same experience, but it needed to be in a community that accepted his parents as well," said Mr. Scheffler, 42, who admitted he was still weighing options on where to send his 4-year-old son, Matthew, to school. "That's usually not so easy to find in suburban setting, and in most city settings, you're not going to find a lot of gay couples with kids."
Nor is Mr. Scheffler the only gay family man in town. Morgan Mulford and his partner, Doug Palumbo, were among the first couples to buy a home in Asbury Park six years ago when they purchased a four-bedroom Craftsman-style house for $70,000. Mr. Mulford's 8-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter spend Christmas and summer vacations here with their father, and live with their mother in Florida the rest of the year.
"Because it's a town that's coming back, everybody is very open-minded," said Mr. Mulford, 39, a director of annuity sales for New York Life. "It's introduced the kids to a lot of different people, and if our goal is to expose them to and be accepting of a lot of things, then this is a good place for them to be."
Mr. Palumbo, who grew up here but moved in the early 1970's with his family in what he refers to as "the white flight," said that historically, Asbury Park had always been friendly to gays. He remembers the dozen gay bars that lined Ocean Avenue in the early 1980's, before many of the buildings were condemned by Mr. Carabetta. For the last six years, New Jersey Gay Pride Day has been held here on the first weekend in June, drawing thousands from New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia. So when the couple was looking for a weekend retreat, Mr. Palumbo thought of his hometown.
While Mr. Palumbo and Mr. Mulford may have been pioneers at the time, they now estimate that almost 50 percent of their block is gay, evidenced by the rainbow flags that fly outside many of the homes. Several rainbow flags also fly on homes on Locust Drive, where two longtime Greenwich Village residents, Deborah Walsh and her partner Carla Simpson, bought a five-bedroom colonial on Deal Lake for about $100,000 two years ago. Ms. Simpson is currently trying to get pregnant through artificial insemination because, as Ms. Walsh puts it: "It's a good place to raise a family. There's space and acceptance here."
Throughout the northern section of the city, multifamily homes are being converted back to single-family houses and restored to their original beauty. Speculators like RDR Properties are buying dozens of places, rehabilitating them, and putting them back on the market at a tidy profit. They say the problem is no longer a dormant real estate market but not having enough supply to fill the demand.
Houses in the most sought-after sections of the city -- a four-square-block area bordered on the north by Deal Lake, on the south by Sunset Lake, on the east by Park Avenue and on the west by Main Street, plus the northwest part of the city near Deal Lake -- often exchange hands privately, never making it to market.
"I just wish I had more listings,," said Georgia Burns, who has been in the real estate business here for 40 years. "There's not much left here to sell." Acknowledging that many of the interested buyers are now gay, Ms. Burns calls her current client crop "the best buyers I ever had."
"They're wonderful people," she added. "They love the old houses and they're restoring them."
There are even signs of life at the Asbury Park beach, which, despite a recent sand replenishment program and the reasonable $20 seasonal beach tag charge, is usually all but deserted. Two weeks ago, more than 500 black and Hispanic lesbians spread their blankets on the white sands of the city's north beach. The women were holding their sixth annual beach party, this year choosing Asbury Park over Fire Island because "it was a little more hospitable," said the event's organizer, Tracey Pridgen.
"The town council was very warm, said Ms. Pridgen, a Jersey City resident who also caught the home-buying fever after coming here in April. "We really felt very welcome and it's going to be our new home from now on." Since then, she said, she has checked out 15 houses.
Some savvy buyers aren't waiting for a house they like to go on the market. Mr. Perrotta, the interior designer from Manhattan, and his partner spent the Martin Luther King weekend knocking on the door and leaving notes at a house on Sunset Drive that they had their eyes on, asking the owners if they were interested in selling. On Monday they saw a police car at the house and found out the owner had died over the weekend. They contacted her relatives in New York and worked out a sale privately.
Others are pushing the borders of what is considered a stable neighborhood in Asbury Park, anticipating gentrification to continue to march southward. Jerry Scarano of Manhattan bought a 12--by-40-foot, two-story cottage on Second Avenue in April for only $20,000. Mr. Scarano spent another $12,000 replacing the bathroom, kitchen and roof, and adding siding and Victorian gingerbread to the outside. In July, his house was awarded the "Beautiful House of the Month" by the city's zoning board. Although his house is in a neighborhood that realtors like Mr. Donaldson would call transitional at best, Mr. Scarano is unfazed by the loud rap music that pours out of neighbors' windows and the frequent loitering in the streets. Instead, he has befriended the neighbors, who consider him something of an anomaly.
"While I was cleaning the place out I developed a network of contacts," said Mr. Scarano, 45, who hopes to be able to sell his house and double his investment so he can buy a larger house for himself here. "Everyday people in the neighborhood came by and asked me if I needed any help. I was able to hire them as day workers for about a third of the price that contractors were asking."
The newfound interest in homes here is beginning to have a spillover effect on other aspects of life. A few artists are moving back into some of the loft spaces along Cookman Avenue downtown. Activity has picked up at the Emeralds and Pearls cafe and gift shop on Bangs Avenue, particularly during the pre-dawn, post-club hours. Billy Meisch, who owns the retro furniture store, House of Modern Living, on Cookman Avenue, said he had been seeing a lot of new clients.
"They may need a new couch or a chair, and it's a lot easier buying it here than carting it down from Soho," said Mr. Meisch, who moved to Asbury Park in March after living in neighboring Ocean Grove for 20 years.
Mr. Meisch said Ocean Grove, which also has a large gay population, had become "too family-oriented."
The year-and-a-half-old alternative newspaper, triCityNews, has become a popular source for what's happening in the city, including news from the active night life that floats among the city's four gay bars.
With renewed talk of creating a state-controlled redevelopment authority to press forward on the proposed $780 million waterfront revitalization, Asbury Park's currency may go even higher. But for some who distrust the decisions of the current government, getting a foothold in the political arena is the only way to guarantee that the city continues to move in the right direction.
Last month, Robert DeSanto, who is a student and tends bar at Club Paradise, said he organized a "meet and greet your neighbors" event at the club, in part to "get everyone in to one place so we can see what our numbers are." While only about 50 people turned out, many who did joined the homeowners' association and filled out forms to switch their voter registration to Asbury Park, Mr. DeSanto said.
In a city where fewer than 10 percent of the residents typically turn out to vote, every vote counts. John Loffredo, president of the Asbury Park Homeowners Association, ran for City Council in 1997 and lost by a few hundred votes. Mr. Loffredo plans to run again next May, and, while he says he is not running as "the gay representative," he believes "the outcome will be different" based on the current makeup of voters.
"Right now there's no gay representation on the council, but hopefully we're moving in that direction," said Mr. DeSanto, who ran for the school board last April and lost by a small number of absentee ballots. "We're homeowners here, and it's important for us to keep our property values up."
For now, the political establishment may be a bit wary of the shifting demographics of Asbury Park. While acknowledging the increased presence of gays and lesbians in Asbury Park, Deputy Mayor John Hamilton does not see turning the keys to the city over to them any time soon.
"While I'm open to anyone moving here, I'm certainly not going to try to have Asbury Park designated as the gay mecca of New Jersey," Mr. Hamilton said. "If we do gear ourselves toward an entire gay and lesbian population, will we end up discriminating against straight people?"

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
College Tuition On Rise

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS

 BODY:
As students get ready for the start of the college year, they -- or their parents -- will find that the cost of higher education in the state is getting higher. All of the public and private four-year colleges in New Jersey are raising tuition this fall.
Increases range from a high of 10 percent at Rowan and Montclair, both public universities, to a low of 3.2 percent at Princeton University, which is already the state's most expensive institution of higher education, according to the Commission on Higher Education. 
 Still, the increases should come as no surprise. "Most schools raise tuition every year," said Janice Gams, associate director of public affairs for the College Board in New York City. "People should be prepared for that."
The average increase nationally last year was 3.4 percent for public colleges and 4.6 percent for private ones, according to the College Board, a nonprofit education association of schools and colleges that administers the SAT tests.
"College tuition rates regularly increase at more than the rate of inflation because colleges are labor-intensive and technology-intensive and both are expensive," Ms. Gams said. "It is unfair to compare tuition increases to the Consumer Price Index because consumers have a lot of different kinds of things to buy that don't apply to schools."
Most colleges cite the costs of new buildings and equipment, particularly computers, and salaries as the chief reasons for the rise in tuition costs.
Rowan University in Glassboro, where tuition will be $4,140 for the coming school year -- a 10.4 percent increase -- is in the fifth year of a five-year program that called for 10 percent tuition increases each year.
"Students, faculty and administration all wanted to do this," said Jose Cardona, director of university relations for Rowan. "We increased faculty, added six new master's programs, improved other academic offerings, added computers and increased financial aid for students."
He said he did not know if tuition at Rowan, where enrollment was capped at about 9,300, would increase again next year.
The second highest increase will be paid by students at Montclair State University, where tuition will go up 10 percent, to $3,470.
"The need for additional academic programs and facility renovations forced the increase," said Phyllis Miller, a university spokeswoman. "Technology costs and salary costs are increasing."
Montclair State is buying land in Little Falls to build additional housing for 600 students because of growing enrollment, which went up 20 percent last year and will grow another 6 percent this fall to about 13,500. The school anticipates that enrollment will increase by another 2,500 within three to four years, she said.
"We used to have the lowest tuition in the state and we are still the second lowest, even with the increase," Ms. Miller said.
The lowest rate will be paid by students at Richard Stockton College of New Jersey in Pomona, where the third largest increase -- 9.8 percent -- will bring tuition to $3,375.
However, two factors could reduce that cost. The college recently started its most ambitious fund-raising program to date by holding a contest to win the right to name the college gymnasium. So far $250,000 has been raised toward the $1 million goal.
An additional $1 million that had not been included in the budget was obtained from the State Legislature on the premise the money would be used to help hold down tuition costs for the 6,300 students at the school. The board of trustees will meet later this month to decide the final tuition cost, said Tim Kelly, college spokesman.
The state's oldest and largest public college, Rutgers University, with 48,700 students, will raise tuition 5 percent. As at most of the institutions, room and board and some fees will also go up this fall.
Rutgers and other public colleges receive substantial financing from the state, although not as much as in some other states, college representatives say. At Rutgers, 60 percent of operating costs are paid by the state, while Montclair and some other schools receive 50 percent or less of their operating revenue from the state.
Public universities and colleges in general would like two-thirds of the costs to be covered by the state, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
This year the state is increasing aid for operating expenses for public schools by 6.2 percent, to $1.2 billion. Aid to private colleges and to the 19 community colleges was also increased.
Tuition at all the public colleges except Stockton and at 8 of the state's 14 private colleges last year exceeded the national average, which was $3,110 for public schools and $13,392 for private schools, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
With a 3.2 percent increase in tuition rates, a year at Princeton will cost $25,430. Costs at Drew University, $23,472 for a 4.5 percent increase, and Stevens Institute of Technology, $21,900 for a 4.8 percent increase, are not far behind.
County colleges announced earlier this summerthat tuition would hold steady at 11 schools and would actually decrease by 7.1 percent at Sussex County Community College. Increases at the remainder range up to 3.4 percent. The state is in the third year of a four-year plan to increase the state subsidy for county colleges to one-third of the operating costs. The state now pays for 29 percent of the costs.
The Commission on Higher Education, which does not set tuition rates, encourages schools to keep rates as low as possible, said Judy Savage, commission spokeswoman. But "we also recognize keeping institutions strong requires an ongoing investment."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS: VOWS;
Yonel Letellier and Nadia Khalilpour

BYLINE: By LOIS SMITH BRADY

 BODY:
THE tango aficionados of New York -- a small but passionate group -- say that the tango can change your state of mind, the way you walk and how you dress. Women who once wore jeans and T-shirts start tango dancing and convert to gowns with slits and fishnet stockings. In a way, fishnets are the perfect metaphor for tango -- it is the dance form in which you reveal the most. Partners dance close, to music of grief, homesickness and hope.
Yonel Letellier, 43, is a lover of tango. He wears stylish suits and polished shoes, kisses people on the cheeks when he meets them and speaks comfortably about uncomfortable subjects. He grew up in Trujillo, Peru, and was politically active against the military government during his days at the National University of Trujillo. In 1982, he moved to New York, driving a cab while studying English and economics. Eventually, he became a vice president for financial services for small businesses at the Chase Manhattan Bank. 
 "For so many years, I was just studying and working, studying and working, 16 hours a day," he said. "I was very lonely. When I started to tango, I started feeling human warmth again."
In 1998, he met Nadia Khalilpour at a Halloween tango party in Manhattan. Ms. Khalilpour, who is 34 and grew up in Tehran, Iran, was then a live-in baby sitter in Manhattan for a couple from Iran. The mother of the children, Nasim Alikhani, a tango devotee, took Ms. Khalilpour to the party.
"Nadia has a very gentle manner," Ms. Alikhani said. "She's always smooth, never abrupt. Living with her, I never heard her footsteps. She was always floating about. At the same time, she's a very strong and clearheaded woman."
At the party, Ms. Khalilpour was sitting in the shadows, not knowing how to tango and trying not to be noticed, when Mr. Letellier saw her. "Just looking at her, I felt something strange, very, very strange, and I asked her to dance," he remembered. He led her around as she floated tentatively along. "She was so different, extremely sweet, extremely feminine, so delicate," he said.
Their courtship was also delicate, a slow accumulation of quiet conversations, at first on the telephone, then over dinner and in time in his Flushing, Queens, apartment, with tango music playing in the background. "He's very romantic," said Ms. Khalilpour, who is now an assistant administrator at Hunter College. "He likes red roses. He listens from his heart."
Soon, their tango friends could tell they had fallen in love by their body language on the dance floor. "I had a Christmas party at my apartment and invited them," said the Rev. Gerald Wagner, a nondenominational minister who tangos seven nights a week. "Yonel came a little later than she did. When he walked in, I happened to be dancing with Nadia, and she just softened and melted in my arms. I knew he was in the room."
On July 27, a Thursday, the couple were married at La Maganette, a restaurant in Manhattan that has a tango dinner-dance every Thursday night. As the guests stood close around the dance floor, Mr. Wagner, who officiated, began the ceremony by saying: "Tonight, love brings together a former student revolutionary from Peru, now a banker, and an expatriate from Iran, now a college administrator. And they were brought together by the Argentine tango."
Afterward, guests celebrated by dancing, the women kicking their legs out of slit skirts, the men dancing with eyes closed like pianists in a reverie. Sometimes, two partners would pause and lean against each other momentarily, waiting for one to suggest a move.
"Tango is about giving yourself to another person but keeping your own balance at the same time," said Deborah Winner, a guest. "It's so characteristic of a good relationship, having your own strengths and stability and independence, yet being able to ride the horse in the direction it's going."

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN; Laura Pedersen is a journalist whose books include "Play Money" (Crown), about her experiences as an options trader on the American Stock Exchange.

 BODY:
THE high school assignment seemed simple enough: draw or paint your dream house and don't hold back. And so my classmates up in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst, N.Y., dutifully submitted renderings of elaborate Southern plantations, festive pink and blue Caribbean bungalows and sprawling Spanish haciendas.
I, on the other hand, turned in a sketch of the architecturally lackluster Marriott Hotel that had recently gone up two blocks from my house. My instructor asked if I'd mistakenly signed up for his art class instead of the mechanical drawing course down the hall. I explained that no, the Marriott Hotel was my dream home. It still is. 
 As an only child living with my single, working mother in a house that needed constant upkeep, I knew all about the American Dream of home ownership: mowing the lawn, trimming hedges, cleaning out gutters, pumping a flooded basement. It was for the birds. Or at the very least, the neighbors.
Well, now that I've put in 16 years as a Manhattan apartment dweller, I'm even more convinced there's nothing noble about do-it-yourself home maintenance. Ask me today to draw my dream house and you'll get a brochure for the Phillips Club at Lincoln Square, a new and improved version of an old concept in urban living.
Back then it was called an apartment hotel and offered long-term rentals with a full complement of hotel services. The Phillips Club, which opened four years ago at Broadway and 66th Street, is an extended-stay refuge for wealthy individuals who couldn't care less about tax breaks and real estate appreciation, just as long as they don't have to change sheets, mop floors, call the plumber, shop for furnishings, wait for the cable guy or schlep groceries from Zabar's.
Of the 184 units, from studios to three bedrooms, 88 serve regular overnight guests. The remaining 96 are for people who either rent by the month ($6,000 to $17,000) or who, as club members, are given a deed to a fractional share of a residence, much like a time share.
But everyone at the Phillips Club gets all the hotel amenities: round-the-clock housekeeping, concierge and valet service, an on-site library, a personal safe and even use of the nearby Reebok Sports Club. Eloise, eat your heart out.
Generally out of fashion since the Great Depression, this style of living is now on the rise. A new Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Battery Park City will offer accommodations in the apartment-hotel vein, as will the St. Moritz. Citywide, the Marriott hotel chain has 600 apartments for executives that offer hotel-like services, and the number is growing.
"Hotels offer a style of living that's very appealing to people and, given the strong economy, it's definitely making a comeback," said Gary Schweikert, general manager of the Plaza Hotel. Mr. Schweikert, himself a year-round resident of the Plaza, envisions a return to offering residential accommodations there in the foreseeable future.
One reason for the resurgence is the rising number of renovations in the city, as well as sales of residences before the occupants have found new digs. But there may be deeper causes.
For one, the concept of what it means to be wealthy is evolving. For some, being rich no longer means owning the most toys, but owning nothing at all, save for the casual Friday clothes on their backs. Even to the middle class, leasing a sports utility vehicle may be as credible a symbol of prosperity as plunking down cash to purchase it. Why buy and have all the grief of ownership if you can rent, hire or charter whatever estates, jets, old masters or yachts that your lifestyle requires?
Faith Popcorn, the futurist, says hotel-style living is also particularly appealing to busy professionals. "The hotel is the substitute wife," says Ms. Popcorn, the co-author of "Eveolution," a new book about marketing to modern women whose dual roles require juggling career and family. "Women need wives these days, especially married women with children."
Frances Rochat may well agree. She and her banker husband, Andrew, and two small children moved into the Phillips Club six months ago. A registered dietitian who is attending New York University for a master's degree in nutrition, Ms. Rochat says she loves the arrangement because she doesn't have to do dishes and because the doormen help her carry things.
THE earliest apartment hotels in New York City date to the late 1870's. They appealed mostly to single men and young families unable to afford servants. But then, in the 1920's, such accommodations became trendy for the well off and even the rich.
"In town it is no longer quite in taste to build marble palaces, however much money one may have," wrote Arthur Pound, a social commentator of the time. "Instead, one lives in a hotel." However, few wealthy New Yorkers were interested in a life without servants. The apartment hotel was the perfect answer.
Like the current comeback, this rise in hotel living in Manhattan came during prosperous times. It was the Jazz Age, when money was easy, stocks were soaring and the city was in the midst of a postwar building boom. The cost of the hotel amenities and the lack of equity for the money did not seem to matter to many people.
One of the first post-World War I hybrids was the Buckingham Apartment Hotel, built in 1924 at 101 West 57th Street. Now primarily a tourist hotel, its large staff provided top-notch hotel service. But the comforts didn't come cheap. "A pen and a checkbook are the sole requisites of housekeeping or homemaking," wrote Martin Clary, a real estate publicity man, in 1926.
The fanciest, and at 42 stories the tallest, was the Ritz Tower, which was opened the year after the Buckingham by Arthur Brisbane, a Hearst newspaperman-cum-investor. A Renaissance palazzo in travertine marble throughout, the building, at Park Avenue and 57th Street, supplied its well-heeled tenants with anything their wallets desired, including hot meals sent up in electrically heated dumbwaiters and served by butlers stationed on every floor. From 1940 to 1966, the structure housed Henri Soule's Pavillon, one of New York's most luxurious restaurants.
Comfort was what those residential hotels were all about. H. L. Mencken said the Algonquin, which offered residential living to him and Dorothy Parker, among other writers, was the most comfortable hotel in America. "The distance from the front door to the elevator is only 40 feet," he wrote, "an important consideration to a man whose friends all drink too much, and sometimes press the stuff on him."
One niche of the apartment-hotel business rested on the city's reputation for slightly different standards than the rest of the country. Years ago, everyone knew that a young woman of a certain social standing -- or with a minister father back in Duluth -- who headed off to live on her own in New York would take up lodging at places like the Barbizon, on East 63rd Street. The Barbizon, now an upscale boutique hotel, was a "women's residence club" from 1927 to 1981, home at various times to Grace Kelly, Joan Crawford, Liza Minnelli and Candice Bergen. In these and similar spots, which have now virtually disappeared, housemothers reigned supreme on every floor, and only in the lounge and music room could ayoung woman entertain a young man.
"You didn't have to worry about men trying to come up to your room," said Judy Hauser, a Wilhelmina fashion model who arrived at the hotel in 1966 from a conservative family in Dearborn, Mich. "Also, drugs were just coming onto the scene, and of course the Barbizon excluded all that."
By the late 1920's, apartment hotels were proliferating so greatly that they aroused the competitive ire of regular hoteliers. Soon the hotel owners marched on City Hall and petitioned Mayor Jimmy Walker to outlaw the hybrid poseurs, claiming they violated safety regulations and building codes.
The hotel owners got their wish with the 1929 Multiple Dwelling Law. That state statute loosened many rules that applied to both regular apartments and regular hotels, allowing both to give the upstart apartment hotels a run for their money.
But before the industry had a chance to absorb these changes, the stock market crashed. Aside from a few projects already on the drawing board, construction halted.
By the start of the Depression, the city had as many as 150 apartment hotels, housing some 15,000 wealthy and middle-class families. After World War II, with the shine off the onetime fad, some of the buildings were converted to regular apartments. Many others, caught up in the postwar economic boom, were demolished to make way for office skyscrapers. And although some of the apartment hotels, like the Pierre, still cater to extended-stay guests, many others were changed into regular hotels. Among the more prominent to make the transition were the Gotham (now Peninsula), Barclay (now Inter-Continental), Drake (now Swissotel New York the Drake), Roosevelt and Mayflower.
The day of the apartment hotel had come and gone.
The airplane speeded its demise. "Hotel living in general declined as air travel became the norm for people of means," said Mr. Schweikert of the Plaza. "When the Plaza opened in 1907, the wealthy traveled by steamship. They would be loaded down with steamer trunks and staff and think nothing of settling in for months at a time."
The Vanderbilts considered the Plaza their Manhattan pied-a-terre, as did Enrico Caruso and of course Kay Thompson, creator of "Eloise." The F. Scott Fitzgeralds were frequently in residence at the Plaza, and at least once made fully clothed guest appearances in the fountain in Grand Army Plaza out front. The couple so loved the hotel that Ernest Hemingway advised Fitzgerald to bequeath his liver to Princeton and his heart to the Plaza.
Hotel living may have declined after those heady days, but it never went out of style for Herbert R. Weissberg, 87, the owner of the Gramercy Park Hotel. For the last half century he's been happily ensconced in a suite at his 509-room hotel in the East 20's.
The hotel, whose long-term rates start at $3,500 a month, remains one-quarter residential, and has been home to many other permanent lodgers over the years. Joseph P. Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's father, had an apartment at the Gramercy. More recently, an "extended stay" by Paul Shaffer, David Letterman's bandleader, lasted for 12 years.
 IN the current comeback, three types of people seek hotel living, according to Marty Weissberg, son of the Gramercy owner. The first are those who aren't willing to look in the Yellow Pages for a carpet cleaner, call Con Edison or wait for telephones to be hooked up. The Gramercy provides phone, fax, food and housekeeping, and there is also a barbershop, a beauty parlor and valet service on the premises.
And it all goes on one bill. Marty Weissberg said that having to pay a long distance phone bill in addition to a local one was the last straw for many harried New Yorkers.
The second type of guest is the young woman who doesn't want to be wandering the halls of an apartment building, the sort who might have stayed at the Barbizon years ago. "The hotel has a security staff and room clerks who recognize you, and of course there's a wake-up service," Marty Weissberg said.
The third kind of resident is recently separated or divorcing. "They get brain dead," he said. "There's so much going on with lawyers that they can't handle food and laundry."
Uptown, the Carlyle Hotel at Madison Avenue and 76th Street, the longtime New York abode of President Kennedy, has always offered residential living to those who can afford it. "Residents are financially capable of having their own sizable apartments anywhere in the world," said James Sherwin, the manager. "But then they would have to deal with security and staffing."
Long-term Carlyle dwellers either own their apartments and pay a monthly service charge or sign a three-year lease.
With the renewed interest in hotel living, more companies are entering the field. Millennium Partners, the owner of the Phillips Club, is building a Ritz-Carlton Downtown in Battery Park City to expand on such accommodations. In addition to a 311-room hotel, the company will offer 122 condominiums with a separate lobby and access to all the hotel's amenities. The condominiums start at $500,000 for a one-bedroom. Forty have been sold, said Matthew Hall, a Millennium spokesman.
"You can pick up the phone and order anything, and yet you only have to pay for extra services on an as-needed basis," Mr. Hall said. "Wall Street workers with long hours and lots of travel don't want to screen maids and dog walkers."
Millennium Partners is also converting the elegant St. Moritz Hotel on Central Park South into a 300-room Ritz-Carlton. The top 12 floors will accommodate condominiums, whose owners will get all hotel amenities.
Meantime, for the business market, Marriott has leased about 600 apartments so far in which it offers maid service, furnishings and the like. A Marriott competitor, Oakwood Corporate Housing, is also fattening its stake in this niche. It has 300 such apartments in the city and plans to add 200 more.
Some moderately priced hotels, like the Roger Williams, 28 East 31st Street, and the 30-30, formerly the Martha Washington, 30 East 30th Street, have recently done away with their residential accommodations. But this countertrend seems small compared to the revived interest in such arrangements.
Fortunately for those lacking trust funds, at least one moderately priced residential hotel has no plans to convert. The venerable Chelsea Hotel on West 23rd Street has been catering to long-term tenants since 1905. Still delightfully bohemian, it has a guest register that is living history, bearing the signatures of long-term tenants like Arthur Miller and long-gone literary lions like Thomas Wolfe, O. Henry, Mark Twain, Vladimir Nabokov, Tennessee Williams and William S. Burroughs. Arthur C. Clarke wrote "2001: A Space Odyssey" while in residence. Tour guides and necrophiliacs like to point out that the hotel is where Dylan Thomas stayed during his final visit to New York, when he drank himself to death, and where Sid Vicious fatally stabbed his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen.
"It's funky," said Holly Solomon, who has an art gallery in the Chelsea and has lived in the hotel since February. "If you're feeling bad, you walk through the lobby and someone says hello and then you feel better."
If you're not talented enough to leave art in lieu of payment, as have some former residents -- there's a gallery of their work in the lobby -- one-year contracts at the Chelsea start at $1,900 a month.
Meanwhile, my husband continues to buck this trend by agitating for the purchase of a weekend home outside the city. While he's devouring the real estate ads, I'm getting price quotations from the Hotel Wales on Madison Avenue, complete with VCR and CD player in every room and conveniently located above Sarabeth's restaurant and bakery. For the nature lover in me, there's not one, but two potted topiaries out front. Because when you say country house to this city mouse, I say dry rot, dead tree removal and termite infestation.
My husband (who has seen a gutter up close only once, and that was in the Leisure Time bowling alley in Port Authority) insists that we can call in professionals for such inconveniences. I say that in a hotel we can call professionals who will call those professionals. I want to get my wake-up call in my dream hotel and say: "Honey, there's a leak in the ceiling. Call the concierge. And have them send up some Bloody Marys."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: David W. Simpson;
WM Growth Fund of the Northwest

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
LIKE other people who live in Seattle, David W. Simpson is never too far from Mount Rainier, the highest peak in the Northwest. But he is often closer than most. On weekends and during vacations, Mr. Simpson leads climbers over the Mount Rainier's glaciers and rocks; on weekdays, he drives past the mountain on his way to work managing the $721.1 million WM Growth Fund of the Northwest.
The mountain is also the polestar of the portfolio, whose prospectus requires it to be at least 65 percent invested in companies with headquarters in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska. The remainder must be in companies doing business in that region. The geographic area may be small, but it has been fertile territory for investors. 
 "We're quite diversified in terms of industries, and we've become something of a hotbed of technology," Mr. Simpson said from his office overlooking Puget Sound. "Many executives leave Microsoft with enormous amounts of wealth that they use to finance new businesses, seeding the region with start-ups."
The fund returned 26.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, versus 7.4 percent for its peers among small blend funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
Mr. Simpson, 41, can pluck almost any of the roughly 300 public companies in those five states. He can find long-term capital growth in start-ups or choose behemoths like Starbucks, Microsoft and Nike. Small fry make up 60 percent of the portfolio; the balance is split between midsize and large-cap companies.
His style could be called eclectic. The fund may hold basic materials companies in forestry and steel as well as red-hot technology concerns. Unprofitable biotech businesses rub shoulders with value plays. "There's a perception that regional funds are dependent on the local economy," he said. "But that's not true. What drives the companies we buy are national and global markets."
Mr. Simpson works with three equity analysts to pick the fund's 70 or so holdings. He aims to keep shares at least three to five years; the turnover rate is 40 percent.
He does not use computer screens to scout out purchases. "I keep a hit list of new companies that I look at every day," he said, "and I pay attention to the local news and investment analysts."
In particular, he wants companies to have relatively low debt and adequate working capital. Although working-capital needs vary by industry, as a rule of thumb he wants companies with current assets that exceed current liabilities, and the bigger the margin, the better. He also checks a company's "quick ratio," which compares cash and accounts receivable to current liabilities; again, bigger is better.
Generally, he wants a company to have a price-to-earnings multiple that is lower than its growth rate, although he will pay more for technology companies and less for consumer cyclicals.
"I want to identify a competitive advantage and make sure that it is protected," he said. That advantage may be a brand name (Starbucks), a technology (Intel or Microsoft) or domination of a small market niche (Electro Scientific Industries).
Solid management is vital. For big companies, he relies on Wall Street research to evaluate management's record. "I'm more active talking to management of smaller companies," he said, "because we can gather information that's not well understood on the Street."
What does he look for? "I like them to be able to articulate business strategy in a sensible way," he said. "And I prefer management that can answer my detailed questions on the spot, because it means they have their finger on the pulse of the business."
MR. SIMPSON recently added shares of Paccar Inc., a Bellevue, Wash., company that sells heavy-duty trucks. "The stock was very inexpensive, because an industry downturn is under way domestically," he said. "But the company is more global than perceived."
The company has some debt but low fixed costs because it assembles trucks from components rather than manufacturing them from scratch, he added. That has helped earnings during the downturn.
He first bought shares in 1991 at $16.96 and recently added more in the low 40's. They closed on Friday at $41.9375, or almost seven times Wall Street's earnings estimate of $6.27 a share for 2000.
The fund also expanded its position in Monaco Coach, a manufacturer of recreational vehicles in Coburg, Ore. "We're playing into a strong demographic trend," he said. "Young retirees love these things, and the market should be very strong as baby boomers reach retirement age."
The company's stock price is down because of rising interest rates and fuel prices, he said, but the company is debt-free and management is adjusting production. He started buying in July 1999 and has paid an average of $12.94. The stock now trades at $15.8125, or more than six times the consensus 2000 earnings estimate of $2.48 a share.
Another favorite is the Corixa Corporation, which he bought at the initial offering in 1997 at $13 a share. It closed on Friday at $38.875. Corixa, a biotechnology company in Seattle, is developing vaccines for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Its chairman and chief executive, Steven Gillis, was co-founder of Immunex, another biotechnology company in Seattle. Mr. Simpson said he had "confidence in his grasp of the business and science of managing a biotech company."
Canadian regulators recently approved the company's melanoma vaccine, and approval by the Food and Drug Administration is expected by year-end, he said.
Wall Street's consensus estimate is that the company will lose $1.62 a share this year. Nevertheless, Mr. Simpson is optimistic about the long-term prospects.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Little Room To Tinker In Latin America

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
THE wave of economic reforms that has washed over Latin America first touched shore in Chile. That small nation, with an economy roughly the size of New Jersey's, was the first to tear down import barriers, liberalize exchange-rate policy, bolster the domestic savings rate and otherwise whip itself into shape for the new global economy.
Now it wants to go further. 
 Chile already has the highest bond ratings of any Latin American country. Its finances are impeccable, and it has remained stable even during regional crises. A recession last year was its first in 16 years; it is now on track to springing back to 6 percent growth. Perhaps most vividly, Chile has managed in the last decade to cut by half the number of its people who live in poverty.
Problems remain, of course, but even so, other nations in the region look to Chile as a shining example. Mexican leaders seem particularly enchanted. President Ernesto Zedillo based his reform of Mexico's social security system on the Chilean model, which lets workers contribute to individual retirement accounts. And Mr. Zedillo's successor, Vicente Fox, wants Chilean-style changes that lower corporate taxes when profits are reinvested locally.
Despite all that, there were a few moments of economic uncertainty before Chile's presidential elections in January. Voters and investors wondered whether a new president -- particularly a Socialist candidate like Ricardo Lagos, who won -- might stunt or even reverse some of that much-admired record.
The uncertainty did not last long and, in hindsight, it appears that there was never much to worry about. There may be a lesson in that: New administrations in the region, no matter their political leanings, have scant leeway to radically change economic policy.
"It's true -- there is very little in terms of sound market-dominated economic policy and market-oriented resource allocation that any new president can change," said Nicolas Eyzaguirre, Chile's minister of finance. While some tinkering is possible, no country that has bought into a system that relies on free trade and open borders can easily afford to back out.
Mr. Fox's victory in Mexico may be a good example. Although he campaigned against almost everything that the Institutional Revolutionary Party stood for, his promise of sweeping change did not extend to economic policy. He says he wants to put a human face on the economy, but his background as an entrepreneur and former head of Coca-Cola of Mexico actually put him closer to the free-market ideas of Mr. Zedillo, an economist, than was the ruling party's own candidate, Francisco Labastida, a former state governor with a populist bent.
IN Chile, Mr. Lagos seems committed not only to continuing economic liberalization but also to making a course change even more difficult. Advisers say he is preparing to introduce a reform package that would remove the temptation to fool with the economy for short-term political gain.
The new laws would mandate an average 1 percent surplus in the structural balance, or what public finances would be like if the economy was at or near full employment. On a theoretical level, this is a mechanism to take account of cyclical conditions. In practical terms, it puts the Chilean president in a fiscal straitjacket.
Mr. Eyzaguirre said recent problems in Asia and Russia, as well as the Mexican peso crisis in 1995, were set off not by unsound policies but by the inconsistent way that sound policies were administered. The rules that Chile is considering would pre-empt much of the chief executive's discretion. "We want to arrive at a position where macroeconomic policy is not just sound," Mr. Eyzaguirre said. "It is based on rules."
Chile's proud record has a glaring omission: The Clinton administration has not kept a promise to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement. A leery Congress denied President Clinton the fast-track authority needed to negotiate the deal.
Chile's disappointment is unmistakable. "We put our house in order and then we put our house in order even further," Mr. Eyzaguirre said. "We thought this would be an easy marriage."
Being jilted by Washington has given Chile incentive to pursue other deals. It has signed its own trade pacts with Canada and Mexico, the other parties of Nafta, and is working on others with the European Union, South Korea and perhaps Japan.
So now it is Chile that is looking to Washington for a policy change that might revive trade talks. "We are waiting for a new administration to give signals," Mr. Eyzaguirre said. "But the experience so far has not been brilliant."

A Gas Giant Bets Heavily On a Surge In Demand

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
WILL natural gas prices stay high? Consumers hope not, but the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, for one, is betting that they will.
Prices at the wellhead have leapt 80 percent this year, to more than $4 per million British thermal units. Further, if colder temperatures return after the unseasonably warm winters of the last few years, supplies could be squeezed tighter, sending prices even higher. 
 But that may be just the start, contend executives at Anadarko, one of the largest independent oil and gas producers. They and a number of other producers and analysts say a fundamental shift in the natural-gas market has brought permanently higher prices. They cite soaring demand from new electricity generation plants, after years of weak overall consumption.
Anadarko is making a huge bet on this thesis. The company, based in Houston, has just acquired Union Pacific Resources for almost $6 billion, gaining drilling rights in gas-rich western Canada and elsewhere. And last week, it announced that it would raise capital spending this year to $1.5 billion, one-third more than earlier projections.
Investors were not impressed when the Union Pacific deal was announced in April, but they have come around. Anadarko shares are now up more than 40 percent for the year. At $49, they are trading at about 12 times the $4 a share that Robert J. Allison Jr., Anadarko's chief executive, expects the company to earn over the next year.
"There just isn't enough supply, or enough supply excess, to get soft gas prices again," Mr. Allison said in an interview last week. A severe winter will cause spot shortages, he predicts, potentially causing prices to hit $7 early next year.
William Featherston, an analyst at PaineWebber, says a group of 15 gas producers he tracks are expected to post a 75 percent gain in discretionary cash flow -- net income plus depreciation and deferred taxes -- to $9 billion this year.
Yet even strong fundamentals are subject to the whimsy of investors, whose appetite for technology stocks hurt valuations of old-economy stocks in recent years. Lately, the shares of some big exploration and production companies have moved almost inversely with the Nasdaq index, rising as the index has fallen. Even so, some analysts say they have much further to go. "The stocks are reflecting $2.50 gas," Mr. Featherston said. "It's a real disconnect."
Often found in the same fields as oil, natural gas has far different economics. By and large, it cannot be transported like oil -- some is liquefied overseas and shipped to the United States, but it is very expensive to do that -- so the United States gets nearly all its gas from North America. It is moved around the country through pipelines, mostly from places like the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, Texas and Oklahoma.
For this reason, natural gas has little OPEC risk, and prices are much more closely tied to pure supply-and-demand forces than to political decisions made half a world away. But that also means that the United States cannot browbeat foreign producers into higher production when prices rise, as it has sometimes done with oil.
"Oil markets are global, but the gas market is continental," said Tom Robinson, a managing director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting and research firm in Cambridge, Mass. "Producers tend to be full out into the market, and what that means is that no reserves can be turned on when the market gets tight."
To be sure, some developments could cause prices to fall. A recession, for example, would check demand. Should oil prices drop, some industrial users would switch to other fuels. And if the industry were to raise exploration spending substantially, supplies could rise, putting pressure on prices. That has not happened yet, although there are now 772 active gas rigs working in the United States, an increase of more than 50 percent from a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes Inc.
But in the near term, prices could go higher simply because there may not be enough gas in storage. Last year, winter demand caused gas stocks to fall from threetrillion cubic feet in November to one trillion in April, and that was during one of the warmest winters on record.
Today, however, gas stores are already 18 percent lower than last year, and analysts forecast that stocks may not reach more than 2.7 trillion cubic feet by November. Another warm winter could be enough to leave inventories lean by early next year, but normal winter temperatures could raise demand by 100 billion cubic feet or more a month, cutting deeply into storage, Mr. Robinson said. "There is a rude awakening coming," he said, for homeowners in the Northeast, where annual gas bills will average $200 higher.
Supplies are tight now partly because demand was unusually soft until recently, lulling the market into complacency. Warm winters played a role, but there were other factors. The Asian recession affected American industry's gas use. Low oil prices -- before OPEC moved last year to curtail production -- made other fuels cheap alternatives. Oil and gas companies held back from new investment in production in response to pressure from Wall Street to use cash flow to pay off debt. Domestic gas production has actually dropped slightly in the last few years, analysts say.
But now, demand is rising, oil prices are high, and mass layoffs from the industry's shakeout two years ago have helped create a labor shortage that has somewhat constrained drilling. Even more important is the new demand created by utilities and independent power producers scrambling to build plants to supply electricity to regions running short of power. With coal and nuclear power out of favor, almost all of the new electricity generation plants are gas-fired.
The National Petroleum Council, a group of industry officials who advise the secretary of energy, expects annual demand in the United States to rise to 29 trillion cubic feet over the next decade, compared with 22 trillion this year.
So far, imports from Canada, liquefied natural gas from overseas and depletion of gas in storage have made up the gap between domestic production and demand. But what about future demand? Proven reserves in the United States are about 160 trillion cubic feet, and those have started to fall. New technologies have allowed producers to pump more gas out of existing properties, but by and large the nation's gas fields are maturing, and it is becoming harder, and more expensive, to find more gas.
Industry executives, including Mr. Allison of Anadarko, argue that if federal officials allowed more drilling in places that are off limits, including certain parts of Alaska and offshore sites in most of the lower 48 states, reserves might double eventually. Otherwise, he said, "you can only squeeze the oil fields so far."

The Donors Rule, But in Name Only

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
IT began with Team 100, a name for a political club that was purposefully subtle and maybe even a bit coy. One had to imagine what the 100 stood for: Senators? Dollars? Nickels?
Hardly. Team 100 was made up of the $100,000 contributors, the pinnacle of political generosity back in 1988 when George Bush invented the Republicans' first elite donor club for a handful of the party's most generous patrons. 
 But in presidential politics, donation inflation is at least 50 percent, and last week the Republican convention was overrun by a stampede of 600 Team 100 members. Their suite at the Ritz-Carlton was jammed. Those who complained were offered an option: Take out those checkbooks and give the party $250,000, the entry fee to the Republican Regents, the party's newest and most exclusive donor club, whose suite at the Four Seasons had plenty of leg room.
Last week, the Regents were given receptions with both George Bushes, a Saks Fifth Avenue fashion show and a party at Tiffany & Co. "There's something to do every minute," said Sam Fox, the top-giving Regent (nearly $600,000), who sounded worn out by the yacht rides and golf tournaments.
The word regent is defined as one who governs a kingdom in the minority, absence or disability of the sovereign ruler. In this era of outrage over campaign finance excesses, it seems odd that the Republicans would choose a name that allows Americans to imagine a seat next to the throne for the party's $250,000-and-up sponsors -- a list that includes the Phillip Morris Companies, the National Rifle Association, AT&T and Enron Corporation, the Houston energy and commodities conglomerate.
The donor group was named by Mel Sembler, the Republican's gregarious finance chairman, who made a royal fortune building shopping centers. "I just thought it had a nice ring to it," he said earlier this year. But a few fund-raisers have quietly complained that the name opens the party to criticism that it caters to a blue-blood elite.
The Democrats were far more careful, calling their top donor club Leadership 2000 (for people who give or raise $350,000; there are 18 members). Other Republican club names also sound benign: the Eagles, the Majority Council.
Yet the Regents is a runaway success. Mr. Sembler's goal was to sign up 100 members by Nov. 7, but there are already 139. Two-thirds are individuals who say they give not because they want something in return but because they believe in what the party stands for -- less government and lower taxes.
What's next for the Republicans? A $500,000 club? A $1 million club? Perhaps, a few fund-raisers acknowledged last week. But they quickly promised that the name would give nothing away.

Don't Ask Alan

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Onstage, the song and dance went perfectly. Offstage, however, George W. Bush's top economic adviser flubbed his lines. On Wednesday The Financial Times ran an interview with Lawrence Lindsey in which the former Fed official made much of his relationship with Alan Greenspan, and appeared to claim that Mr. Greenspan endorses Mr. Bush's economic plan. By the next day Mr. Lindsey was furiously back-pedaling, conceding that he had in fact never discussed the plan with the Fed chairman, and further opining that "It's not for Chairman Greenspan to endorse one tax plan or another tax plan, or to endorse one candidate or another."
Presumably Mr. Lindsey -- perhaps a bit rattled by analysts at Goldman Sachs and elsewhere who have warned that Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts will drive up interest rates -- was just being sloppy. One hopes that from now on the Republican team will defend its plans on the merits -- starting, in the case of Social Security, by explaining what the plan actually is -- instead of trying to reassure us that everything is O.K. because Uncle Alan approves. And yet there is something more to this story than Mr. Lindsey's blooper. If you ask me, we're hearing too much these days about Mr. Greenspan's opinions. 
 Mr. Greenspan, after all, holds a position that must be filled with great discretion, because he has a degree of autonomy that is peculiar in a democratic polity. Neither Congress nor the president can tell Mr. Greenspan what to do: he is a power unto himself.
There are good reasons for that special status. Monetary policy presents politicians with dangerous temptations -- for example, to pump up the economy just before an election. To protect themselves from those temptations, even countries where the central bank used to take orders from the finance ministry, like Britain and Japan, have chosen (after hard-learned lessons) to have independent monetary policy boards.
And no central bank has justified its independence as thoroughly as the Fed. Mr. Greenspan has been lucky to preside over an era when everything has gone right with the U.S. economy, but he has made the most of that luck, letting growth rip without reviving inflation. And twice -- in 1987 and 1998 -- he calmed markets at a time when a financial meltdown seemed imminent. It's no surprise that his opinions are sought on many issues.
But here's the problem: if the Fed is to be exempt from normal political control, it must itself be scrupulously nonpolitical, if only for its own sake. Stuff happens: it's a safe bet that one of these years the Fed -- perhaps under Mr. Greenspan, perhaps under his successor -- will make a big mistake. If it is perceived as an institution that carefully respects its limits, that mistake will be forgiven. But if the Fed chairman has come to be perceived as just another political player, trying to influence policy in areas that have nothing to do with his brief, the cries of "Who elected him?" will be hard to answer.
So I get uneasy when I see Mr. Greenspan weighing in on issues that seem remote from his job description. For example, what was he doing testifying in favor of normal trade relations with China? I happen to agree with him on the issue -- but trade policy is a long way from monetary policy, and he should have stayed out of it.
Even the response to Mr. Lindsey's faux pas was inappropriate. According to Mr. Greenspan's spokesman, his "preference is for high or rising surpluses," but "if growing surpluses become politically infeasible to defend, he would prefer that they be allocated to tax cuts rather than to spending initiatives." I guess the first part of that is O.K. -- since monetary policy and fiscal policy are interdependent, it's legitimate for the Fed chief to recommend fiscal restraint. But decisions about whether surpluses should be used to cut taxes or provide benefits -- should we eliminate the estate tax or provide the elderly with drug coverage? -- are surely matters for the electorate, not for unelected monetary technocrats.
If and when Mr. Greenspan becomes a private citizen, his views on such issues will and should be heard. But as the chairman of the Fed, he has to be careful: he must avoid any hint that he is overstepping the boundaries of his position.

The Road Less Traveled To the Oval Office

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
BACK in 1832, the Anti-Masons were growing so concerned about secret societies and ruling elites in young America that they ran a candidate for president, William Wirt of Maryland, a former United States attorney general.
Wirt failed to arouse much interest, scoring less than 8 percent of the popular vote in an election won by Andrew Jackson. But the erstwhile lawyer started a trend that has continued to this day, offering voters a third presidential option to the major political parties of the time. In every presidential election since then but one (1864), a Whig, Free Soiler, Abolitionist, Greenback or some such third party standard bearer has won votes. This year, it's Ralph Nader for the Green Party and either Patrick J. Buchanan or John Hagelin for the Reform Party, which holds its convention this week in Long Beach, Calif. 
 But just what role can these mavericks hope to play? The historical answer appears to be a small, but occasionally important, one. About the best any of them did was Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, when he broke from the Republican Party of President William H. Taft to run as the candidate of the Bull Moose Party and won 27 percent of the popular vote. That was good enough to get Woodrow Wilson into the White House for the Democrats. Similarly, many Republicans still blame Ross Perot for siphoning off conservative voters in 1992 and helping Bill Clinton defeat President George Bush.
In general, third-party presidential candidates fare better when they have something to rail against. Martin Van Buren, of the Free Soil party, did so against slavery in 1848, as did Mr. Perot against globalism and the loss of American jobs. Both lost, but like other third-party insurgents, they played a vital role in the political system by expanding it and maybe even preserving it.
"Look at the Communist Party in the 1930's," said Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, a publication that follows election laws. "By running thousands of candidates for state and local offices, it served as a safety valve, directing their efforts into the system instead of bombing and rioting."
Historically, third parties have also called attention to issues ignored or avoided by the major parties of the day. The Reform Party helped to make the economy such an important issue during the 1992 election that, shortly after his victory, President Clinton held an economic summit meeting. Much the same thing appears to be at work this year. Mr. Nader and Mr. Buchanan, who agree on little else, have each asserted that the Republican and Democratic parties have effectively merged into a political corpocracy, in which both parties feed at the trough of big business campaign contributions and ignore the needs of ordinary citizens.
Mr. Nader, a longtime consumer advocate who won almost 700,000 votes in the 1996 election, has taken particularly derisive aim this year at the major party candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, calling them "Tweedledee and Tweedledum," although he does not specify who is which.
Of the two outsiders this year, Mr. Nader is poised to have the greater impact on the election. Gnawing at Mr. Gore from the left, where he has considerable support among environmentalists and union workers, Mr. Nader has polled as high as 10 percent in some states, which could be enough to throw one or two of them to Mr. Bush. If that should happen in California, where Mr. Nader is popular among disaffected Democrats, Mr. Gore would have little chance of winning.
The Democrats might consider sending a few million in campaign funds to Mr. Buchanan, a far-right conservative who is polling so low these days that it hurts Mr. Gore by not providing a counterbalance to Mr. Nader. As an ardent opponent of free trade, abortion rights and American military involvement abroad, Mr. Buchanan might have earned wider support if Mr. Bush had chosen a more moderate running mate than Dick Cheney. But Mr. Cheney's past positions on national defense, trade, abortion and other issues are close enough to Mr. Bush's -- and Mr. Buchanan's -- that Mr. Buchanan cannot claim to be the conservative alternative to a moderate Republican ticket.
Mr. Buchanan's one advantage over Mr. Bush, as Steven J. Rosenstone, dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota, said in an interview, is an outsized personality that allows him to be "more vociferous, more outrageous," calling attention to issues he cares about.
That might not be enough this year. In his 1996 book, "Third Parties in America," Mr. Rosenstone wrote, "Most importantly, third parties are expressions of discontent with the major parties and their candidates."
With the nation enjoying economic prosperity and the world largely at peace, neither Mr. Nader nor Mr. Buchanan seems likely to persuade the electorate that the major party candidates cannot steer a proper course into the future.
In general, Mr. Rosenstone contends, the best third-party leaders have "magnetic personalities" and voting for them is motivated by any of three factors: "major party deterioration, attractive third-party candidates who present a viable alternative to the major party nominees and an influx of voters with no loyalty to the two major parties." Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota arguably fits this description.
While it does not appear that those factors apply enough this year to draw more more than marginal attention to Mr. Nader or Mr. Buchanan (whose opponent Mr. Hagelin has not even registered on recent national polls), there is some evidence to suggest that Americans increasingly enjoy having political options. The last two presidential elections were the first consecutive pair since 1856 and 1860 in which alternative parties have won as much as 10 percent of the popular vote. To some political experts, that portends a trend.
"I think we're getting more like the British system, where 15 to 20 percent of the votes, as a matter of course, are cast for other parties," Mr. Winger said.
"We're seeing that happen all over the world," he said. "But America remains the anomaly. We have this huge, terrifically diverse country where most people are still just voting for two parties. But I think it's changing."

Power: Get It While It Lasts

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
FOR as long as anyone can remember, reliable, cheap electricity has been taken for granted in the United States.
Not anymore, at least not in California. 
 Four years ago, the nation's most populous state -- and the world's seventh-largest economy -- decided to deregulate its electric industry. New power generators would compete for retail customers with established utilities, and businesses and consumers could choose their power suppliers. The competition would lower everyone's prices.
At least that was the theory. Things have not worked out so well in practice. This summer, power bills have doubled in San Diego, rolling blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has repeatedly cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its power grid. The power supply is near collapse.
"What we have in San Diego is an unnatural disaster, a man-made storm unleashed by the state and federal governments," said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a 42,000-member group in San Diego. "We're hearing panicked calls from customers saying, 'I can pay my electric bill, or I can pay my rent in full.' "
Nearly everyone agrees that deregulation shoulders a significant amount of blame for the crisis. The reason is that with deregulation looming in the mid-1990's, the state's utility companies were afraid to build new plants, while independent power producers only began planning plant construction two years ago, when the state's voters confirmed their support for deregulation.
Now, with demand rising unexpectedly fast, the state is critically short of power. And for at least the next two years, the soonest any significant capacity can be added, there is no easy solution.
"The squeaking gets tighter in 2001," said Daniel Nix, deputy director for energy information at the California Energy Commission, a state agency that licenses new power plants and estimates energy demand. If next summer is even slightly hotter than normal, "there is a good chance we would have inadequate resources," he said.
Blaming deregulation for the current crisis, however, leaves the more important long-term questions unanswered. Can deregulation solve the problems it has created, or should it be repealed? And does California's experience presage other crises as deregulation moves forward nationwide?
Independent power producers and electricity traders, whose future depends on deregulation, argue that California is an anomaly. They say the state faces an exceptionally tight power supply situation as a result of fast economic growth throughout the West and the state's traditional reluctance to build new plants. Moreover, they say, power companies are moving quickly to build plants throughout California and in neighboring states, and the crisis will subside within a couple of years.
"A deregulated world is the right market for electricity," said Ron Walter, senior vice president at Calpine, an independent power producer in San Jose that is building three plants.
All told, the state's energy commission has been asked to approve construction of 14 power plants. Combined with four already under construction, that would add more than 11,000 megawatts of power, 20 percent of the state's total peak demand. This would significantly improve the current situation.
Nationally, the response has been similar, said Jeffrey K. Skilling, president of Enron, the Houston company that is the world's leading trader of electricity and natural gas. Enron reports that power companies have announced plans to add nearly 240,000 megawatts in new North American generating capacity, increasing supply by more than one-quarter.
"Within two or three years, the problem will be fixed," Mr. Skilling said, provided that the market is allowed to operate freely.
But regulators and some other utilities are less sanguine. Electricity is a unique commodity, they say. First, power consumption varies widely, with summer peak demand 20 percent or more higher than average. So meeting peak loads requires the heavy expense of building many "peakers," plants that run only a few hours each year, when demand is highest.
Second, there is no substitute for electricity. It undergirds modern life, and while demand can be marginally reduced by briefly closing factories, turning off air conditioning and elevators in office buildings, even those slight reductions cause significant disruption.
"When oranges go up, when they double or triple or quadruple, I eat apples, when electricity goes up, I can't avoid using it," said Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
Finally, electricity is also "supply inelastic." When all the plants in a region are running at full steam, there is simply no way to get more power.
Those factors mean that as power demand approaches peak supply in a deregulated market, generators can charge 10 or 100 times the normal price for electricity and know that they will find takers. With the possibility of windfall profits every time there is a hot summer, the power producers have little incentive to build enough plants to have a large reserve.
IN the long run, said Eric Hirst, an industry consultant who supports deregulation, smaller reserves would result in lower prices, because unnecessary plants would not be built. Meanwhile, overall reliability for most customers will not be affected, because companies like Enron will seek out customers willing to cut demand for the few hours a year when supply is inadequate.
In the past, "big brother spread the cost of extra capacity among all customers," Dr. Hirst said. "We paid for that."
That explanation does not carry much water in California these days, said State Senator Steve Peace of San Diego, who helped write the state's deregulation legislation, but is now calling for some controls on prices. It ignores the huge price spikes that come if demand runs too close to supply, the power to set prices held by a small number of generators, and the importance of a reliable supply of electricity for everyday life.
And Mr. Peace notes that, while power companies and economists talk of competition leading to lower bills, consumers want the stable prices and reliability they have had for 50 years under regulation.
"This whole market on a national level suffers from an excess of philosophical engagement and a deficiency of practical management," he said. "The market can either prove that it's disciplined enough and stable enough to address its problem. Or inevitably, whether it's the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do, the political system will cut them off at the pass."'

Online Davids vs. Corporate Goliaths

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
IN a business culture that has long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing technological revolution in their garage, the back-story to the pair of digital copyright battles being waged in federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring.
The Napster case in San Francisco involves a 19-year-old college student who created a program allowing him to swap music files with his friends. The program became so popular so fast that the major record labels claim it has led to widespread music piracy, threatening their ability to turn a profit and the incentive of artists to create music. 
 The DVD trial in New York began with a Norwegian high school student who cracked the encryption program protecting Hollywood's digitized movies from unauthorized copying. Leading movie studios argue that unless a judge stops a Web site publisher from distributing the 16-year-old's decryption code, they will soon suffer the same fate as the record industry.
Depending on who you believe, these are either tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim at the establishment. But no matter which side you're on, both cases have underscored the unprecedented ability of individuals armed with digital technology to upset the status quo.
"We're very much looking at a biological model of an epidemic," said Esther Dyson, publisher of the technology newsletter Release 1.0. "On the Internet, a product doesn't require a central host and it doesn't require central distribution, it just spreads. It's new in business. It's been going on a long time in viruses."
As more people connect to the Internet, with faster connections, the information released on it takes on ever-greater momentum and scale. Services like Napster are seen as only the beginning of a technological siege for industries founded on traditional notions of intellectual property.
In fact, many Internet watchers, Ms. Dyson among them, believe that companies that put information online, from music to books to software, may have to resign themselves to relinquishing control over that material. The fact that you copyrighted something simply may no longer entitle you to control it or get paid for it.
"This is an idea whose time has come," said John Perry Barlow, the vice chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and author of an essay "The Economy of Ideas," which in 1994 predicted a fundamental shift in the way intellectual property is valued. "We're dealing with a profound historical shift in the economy that has been enabled by technology."
This is essentially what happened in the Napster and DVD cases, and though federal judges saw fit to issue injunctions in each case, that may be irrelevant in the world of electronic commerce.
PERHAPS the most telling moments in the Napster saga came between the time Judge Marilyn Patel issued a temporary injunction effectively shutting down the service and the stay that was granted not quite 48 hours later by a higher court. Despite a clear statement by Judge Patel that Napster was likely to be found guilty of contributing to copyright infringement, millions of individuals swarmed to download music from the service, or learn about alternative services that provide the means to swap music files.
Similarly, the DVD decryption code patched together by Jon Johansen in Norway has been posted on hundreds of Web sites besides the one that Hollywood has taken to court, many of which say they are simply upholding their right to share technology information.
In both cases, technology and its users are undermining traditional institutions, while asserting a populist sense of what is ethical that may well clash with what is legal. That has raised questions that go well beyond the outcome of the court battles.
What happens, for instance, if Judge Patel in San Francisco and Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in New York come down on the side of the entertainment industry, but the distribution of both copyrighted music and a computer code that cracks legally protected encryption continues undeterred?
"Law is very vulnerable when it makes orders that don't get enforced," said Charles Nesson, director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. "Law consists of two things, the coercive power to impose a sanction on someone who violates it and the willingness of people to obey the law without actually putting it to the test. The more you undermine the credibility of law with the people who are governed by it, the more you need sanctions to keep order."
But can any court arrest 20 million Napster users around the world? Intellectual property has always depended on both legal and physical barriers to copying, Mr. Nesson noted. With the physical barriers all but removed, the reliance of copyright holders on the law may be straining it beyond its capacity to be effective.
These information-sharing technologies are still in their infancy. Napster's file-swapping progeny, like Freenet and Gnutella, dispense with any vestiges of central information altogether. Everything from video games to Scientology texts are being traded over such networks, which hit the Internet just a few months ago. And the inventors of even newer ones with names like MojoNation and COLAVision were demonstrating their wares last week at a hacker convention in Las Vegas.
BASED on what has become known as "peer-to-peer" technology, such services have vastly simplified the ability of individuals to trade files of any sort among themselves, and to decide for themselves whether or not to obey copyright law. Most seem to be choosing the latter.
"I use Napster, I'd be crazy if I wouldn't," wrote one 14-year-old in an e-mail message after Judge Patel issued her preliminary injunction last month. "It lets me sample the songs from a CD and I get to see if I want to buy the CD or not. I don't find it to be any damaging to any musicians. I actually think it is helping them."
In part because that attitude may herald a shift in the law and in part because the music industry will face other, less centralized networks using similar technology, many legal experts and economists believe that the record labels would be better off adapting their business models than suing Napster for copyright infringement.
"We are still very much a common-law culture," said Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford University who has submitted a brief urging that Napster not be shut down. "If the law does not accord with the view of the common kid, then the law will change."
Few of the Napster refugees flooding the Gnutella mailing list with set-up questions last week seemed terribly concerned about the outcome of the San Francisco case.
"Can someone please inform me on how to start everything up," read one typical post by a new user, "I wanna get to mp3's."

Serving Up the Campaign Message, However Bland

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
SUSAN ESTRICH, the manager of Michael S. Dukakis's unsuccessful 1988 campaign for president, was rattling off ways Al Gore could use the Democratic convention to rebut George W. Bush's accomplished performance last week when she stopped short and laughed at herself. "Most people won't be listening to any of this!" she exclaimed.
Ms. Estrich may be on to something. It is true that Mr. Bush went a long way toward achieving two essential goals: to recast the Republican Party's image as sunny, nonthreatening and compassionate, and to demonstrate that he was not the untested political ingenue that the Democrats have labeled him. 
 But equally significant, at least as far as Mr. Gore is concerned, was Mr. Bush's success at orchestrating a convention that was uncontroversial and, for the most part, dull. At a time when public interest in political conventions is already in decline, the G.O.P. convention may have in effect been an anticommercial -- Don't Watch This! -- for Mr. Gore's convention next Monday in Los Angeles. Mr. Gore is getting a lot of advice on what he should do to spark his campaign, but it's not going to help his already uphill effort if no one is watching.
Even if the convention didn't draw many viewers, its essential message -- a blurring of ideological differences between Republicans and Democrats -- was seeping out. A candidate doesn't have to be watched to be effective. As recent interviews with the voting public have made clear, it's not how many were watching but who: the opinions of those who do watch filter down to the public at large. Others turn to news coverage on television and in local newspapers. Convention viewership, however, was generally lower than in 1996.
To be sure, Mr. Bush delivered a lively acceptance speech, and Dick Cheney, his running mate, went on the attack. But dissent was so discouraged that hours would slog by without any indication that this was a partisan gathering, much less a Republican one. The production, often as relentlessly upbeat as a Pepsi commercial, sent million of potential viewers (and potential voters) scurrying to find more compelling fare on television.
The Republican convention was important to Mr. Bush, who entered it ahead in the polls, but the Democratic convention is crucial for Mr. Gore's hopes of moving from his residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory to the White House next January. The gathering next week is likely to be one of the last high-profile opportunities that this very familiar political figure has to get voters to reconsider him, outside of the expected debates. Oddly, it is now Mr. Gore, who has spent a lifetime in government service, rather than Mr. Bush, who is in the position of having to make the speech of his life.
The issue of viewership aside, there is no shortage of advice on what Mr. Gore should do and say once he gets to Los Angeles. Indeed, there is a surprising amount of agreement among Democrats and Republicans alike.
If Mr. Bush needed to demonstrate that he had both intellect and an engaging personality, Mr. Gore probably needs to show the reverse: to demonstrate that he is something else than the brainy if drab No. 2 who has stood off to the side of the national stage for the past eight years. Accordingly, Mr. Gore's campaign has assembled a heavy package of biographical tributes (Mr. Gore, you will learn, served in Vietnam) in their undying hope that to know Mr. Gore is to like him.
Beyond that, the orchestrated fluffiness of the Republican convention is being seized by Mr. Gore's advisers as a tactical mistake. And in response, a strategy is taking shape.
"Given that the Republican convention avoided issues, we ought to have an issues-oriented convention," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat. "And everything should be related to prosperity. I am of the view that that is our strongest suit. And I would pound that theme in."
AND that is what Mr. Gore is intending to do. His advisers say convention speakers in Los Angeles, and the vice president as he campaigns en route, will offer detailed discussions of one Democratic initiative each day, starting with Social Security. They are already encouraging reporters to draw contrasts to what they describe -- with a touch of envy -- as Mr. Bush's "cotton-candy convention."
The risk is that this might evoke an image of Mr. Gore as the dreary, pedantic candidate at a blackboard, holding a piece of chalk. That said, Mr. Gore may not have much choice. "Bush has a more appealing personality than Gore and the Republicans have put on an appealing convention in terms of image," said William Kristol, the publisher of the conservative Weekly Standard. "They need desperately to make this a campaign about issues, rather than image. And here they have been given something of an opening."
Beyond that, Mr. Gore's advisers are taking solace in the fact that Mr. Bush spoke first, giving Mr. Gore the last word. For example, in what was probably the central political formulation of Mr. Bush's speech, the Republican argued that President Clinton and Mr. Gore squandered eight years of prosperity. It opened the way for Mr. Gore to respond with what his aides asserted was abundant evidence to the contrary -- as well as to remind voters of what the economy was like under the George Bush who preceded Mr. Clinton.
"Gore now has an opportunity," said Michael McCurry, the former White House press secretary under Mr. Clinton. "They're going to have to go back and remind people of what they've done for the past eight years."
The other George Bush, by the way, was in the convention hall almost as often as the most conscientious delegate, sitting in a V.I.P. section that included a who's who of Republican warhorses: among them, 87-year-old Gerald Ford, former cabinet officials under Presidents Bush and Reagan and Mr. Cheney, who served as defense secretary under Mr. Bush's father. This aging if distinguished tableau of power offers another point of contrast that Mr. Gore intends to make at the convention.
"The mistake they made is the they posited themselves in the past," said Rahm Emanuel, an adviser to both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore. "And that's from the moment of the Cheney selection forward. The thematic of the campaign is future versus past."
Mr. Gore is well aware, an aide said, that none of this will matter if no one is there to hear his tree fall. His campaign has begun to try to deal with that: Mr. Gore will, for example, do hard-driving, telegenic events during the day intended to get him on the network news, and is considering a range of interviews with unusual sources, from MTV to Jay Leno, reminiscent of what Mr. Clinton did in 1992. The daytime events are designed to get the vice president on the television news every night, with the convention serving as something of a late-evening coda that reinforces the message of the day.
THE challenge for Mr. Gore now is grabbing the the public's attention. Even someone like Ms. Estrich who has lived and breathed politics for more than 20 years had little interest in tuning into the high point of the Republican convention, Mr. Bush's speech. In the midst of an interview last Thursday, she noted that she had arranged to have drinks that night with another Democrat involved in planning Mr. Gore's convention. Their appointment, she said, was scheduled at the time Mr. Bush would take the stage to offer his vision for the presidency.
"Watch his speech?" she said. "Why? I'll watch a clip in the morning."

HEADLINE: Castro Attacks Bush on Platform and Missiles

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PINAR DEL RIO, Cuba, Aug. 5

 BODY:
President Fidel Castro expressed alarm today over both the Republican party platform on prolonging sanctions against Cuba and George W. Bush's pledge to deploy a missile defense system.
Speaking to a crowd estimated by officials at 200,000 in this tobacco-growing province west of Havana, Mr. Castro noted that if Mr. Bush was elected, he would be the 10th president to hold office since the Cuban leader took power. Mr. Castro, who turns 74 this month, is still working energetically to ease the American embargo imposed in 1962. 
 The Republican platform's plank on Cuba sets tough conditions at a time when the Clinton administration and some lawmakers, including some Republicans, are trying to ease sanctions. A measure recently passed the House easing restrictions on exporting food and medicine to Cuba. The platform says no trade or travel restrictions should be eased until Mr. Castro releases all political prisoners.
It also calls for "active American support for Cuban dissidents" and says sanctions will be lifted when Mr. Castro also legalizes opposition parties and commits to democratic elections.
Mr. Castro said this stance catered to the "terrorist and annexationist mafia of Miami," a reference to Cuban-American exiles.
Mr. Castro criticized both Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic candidate, as "boring and insipid," and assailed Mr. Bush's pledge to deploy a national missile defense system. Mr. Gore supports a limited version of such a system.
Mr. Bush's support for a missile defense system could take the world on a "new, dangerous and extremely costly arms buildup," Mr. Castro said.
Large gatherings have been held in recent days to mark the 47th anniversary of the start of Mr. Castro's revolutionary fight, and as part of a campaign to keep up pressure on the United States to change its policies toward Cuba in the wake of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's return here in June.

HEADLINE: Administration Plans Cuts In Some Drug Payments

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
In an effort to save money for Medicare, the Clinton administration is planning to cut payments for anticancer drugs administered to patients in doctors' offices. This could affect hundreds of thousands of elderly patients.
The move has provoked an outcry from patients, doctors, nurses and members of Congress, who say the cuts will make it financially impossible for many cancer specialists to provide chemotherapy in their offices. 
 Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, says the cuts are justified because Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, is paying too much for the drugs -- far more than doctors pay for many of the medicines.
Dr. Shalala said the government would reduce the "excessive Medicare payments" later this year, perhaps as early as Oct. 1, because federal investigators had obtained more accurate data showing what doctors actually paid for the drugs.
Doctors said they would send many of their Medicare patients to hospitals for treatment, causing inconvenience to patients while increasing costs to Medicare.
Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York, said: "I am very concerned about the impact of these cuts on cancer patients. Many oncologists will find that it's financially impossible to provide chemotherapy services in their offices."
Doctors confirm that they receive more than they pay for some drugs, but insist that the extra payments are essential to cover chemotherapy costs not reimbursed by Medicare.
The dispute illustrates the passions aroused when the fate of cancer patients gets mixed up in debates over drug prices and doctors' income.
At least 120 members of Congress -- 69 Republicans and 51 Democrats -- have signed letters to Dr. Shalala expressing alarm about the administration's plans. Many complained that the administration appeared to be acting unilaterally, without soliciting public comment, as agencies usually do before making major changes in federal regulations.
Dr. Joseph S. Bailes, former president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which represents 15,000 cancer specialists, urged the White House to "reconsider and rescind these cuts." He estimated that 750,000 Medicare beneficiaries received chemotherapy in doctors' offices each year. Most have cancer of the breast, colon or lung.
Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said he was not surprised at the criticism from cancer specialists because they derived substantial amounts of income from Medicare's payments for drugs. He said the White House had asked Medicare officials to assess whether the cuts would harm access to care or the quality of care.
"Patients should not be hurt in any way, but taxpayers should get a fair deal," Mr. Jennings said in an interview this week. "The current reimbursement policy is unsustainable. It's appropriate to reimburse doctors for the cost of the drugs they purchase, but they should not be allowed to mark up the price by 20, 70 or 700 percent, as they do now in some cases."
A 1997 study by the Department of Health and Human Services said that Medicare payments for 22 drugs, including many cancer drugs, exceeded the actual wholesale prices by 29 percent, or $447 million, in 1996. For 8 of the 22 drugs, it said, Medicare paid more than twice the actual wholesale price.
In the last decade, most cancer chemotherapy has shifted from hospitals to doctors' offices. Doctors say the cuts in Medicare payments would reverse that trend.
Medicare's policy is important for two reasons. At least half of all patients receiving chemotherapy in this country are on Medicare, cancer experts said. Private insurers, which cover other patients, often follow the government's example and could be expected to lower their reimbursement rates as well.
"This is not just a threat to the Medicare program," Dr. Bailes said. "It's a threat to cancer care in general."
Ellen L. Stovall, executive director of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, a patients' group, said, "I'm not interested in helping the physician make more money, but I am worried that patients may have less access to care as an inevitable and unintended consequence of these cuts."
Dr. Barton C. McCann, who was the chief medical officer of the Medicare program from 1986 to 1998, said the cuts "may have the unintended consequence of making it financially impossible for oncologists to treat patients in their offices." If Medicare beneficiaries cannot receive chemotherapy there, Dr. McCann said, they will seek it at hospitals, where care is more expensive, and "total costs to the Medicare program could rise" as a result.
Medicare generally does not pay for prescription drugs outside a hospital, but there are exceptions. Medicare does, for example, pay for drugs provided "incident to a physician's service," including cancer drugs given to patients by injection or infusion in a doctor's office.
Doctors receive separate payments for the drugs and for the service provided when they or their nurses administer the drugs.
The doctors acknowledge that they can buy some cancer drugs, especially older drugs, at prices lower than what Medicare pays. But, they say, Medicare pays much less than what it costs to administer the drugs. Federal officials agree that the doctors' "practice expenses," including the costs of medical staff, supplies and equipment, far exceed the amounts recognized by Medicare.
For years, doctors say, the markup on cancer drugs has partly offset the inadequacy of the payments for administering chemotherapy.
Before 1998, Medicare paid doctors the average wholesale price of cancer drugs. Payments were reduced by a 1997 law, which said that Medicare would pay "95 percent of the average wholesale price," but the law did not specify how that price should be determined.
In 1999 and again this year, President Clinton proposed a further cut. He wanted to pay 83 percent of the average wholesale price. Mr. Clinton said that would "eliminate the physician markup for outpatient drugs." Dr. Shalala said the cut would save Medicare $2.9 billion over 10 years.
Congress has rejected that approach, but Clinton administration officials said they had found a way to achieve a similar result by different means. They intend to redefine "average wholesale price" to reflect the lower prices that they now believe are available to doctors.
For years, the government obtained wholesale prices from trade publications like the Red Book, published by Medical Economics, a unit of the Thomson Corporation.
Representatives Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, and Ken Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, said "wholesale price" was understood by Congress to mean the price listed in such publications.
But now, Dr. Shalala said, the government will use the data it recently obtained from catalogs of certain drug wholesalers. The Justice Department compiled the data in an investigation of drug pricing under Medicaid, a separate program.
By redefining "average wholesale price" in this way, federal officials said, they can reduce payments for drugs without any change in federal law or regulations.
"This is the most immediate action we can take without undergoing the formal rule-making process," Dr. Shalala said.
Mr. Chambliss said the question of how to pay for cancer drugs had been repeatedly addressed by Congress in the last few years. "It is," he said, "disturbing that the Department of Health and Human Services would seek to circumvent those Congressional actions by unilaterally adopting a new definition of average wholesale price."

HEADLINE: Farm Work by Children Tests Labor Laws

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: CHERITON, Va., Aug. 1

 BODY:
Fourteen years old and barely 4-foot-6, Amelia Gomez spends her days stooped over, pulling weeds and picking red peppers, often complaining that the pesticides give her rashes.
Daniel Velasquez, 13, who picks cherry tomatoes nearly 12 hours a day, recently arrived on Virginia's Eastern Shore after a two-day bus ride from Florida's tomato-growing region. 
 Jose Arispe, 14, whose migrant family divides the year between Virginia and his native Texas, is so proud of the $160 he earns each week doing farm work that he says he wants to quit school to help his family make ends meet. Some days his 11-year-old brother joins in the picking.
Amelia, Jose and Daniel are among hundreds of child farm workers on Virginia's Eastern Shore, part of the estimated 150,000 children 16 years or younger who work on the nation's farms, picking fruit and vegetables. For the most part migrants, these children often work 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, facing dangers from pesticides and risking exhaustion and dehydration from toiling under the sun.
These children, many labor experts say, are among a steadily growing group of young field hands and constitute one of the least visible and most vulnerable workers in the nation. Their plight is such that Democrats in Congress are planning to introduce legislation next month to make it harder to hire 12-, 13- and 14-year-olds.
"Sometimes my fingers start to bleed, and then they start to sting from the poison in the plants," said Herman Perez, a 14-year-old tomato picker who, with his older brother, arrived from Guatemala three weeks ago.
Farm worker advocacy groups say many child farm workers are exploited because they are vulnerable, scared to speak up and desperate to hold onto their jobs and because many are illegal immigrants. They are eager to help their families or to pay back the smugglers who sneaked them across the border.
Child farm workers are often paid less than the $5.15 minimum wage, sometimes receiving $2.50 an hour. Growers often do not provide them with toilets and drinking water, and some child pickers say growers occasionally order them to resume picking even when the 24 hours required by law have not passed after pesticides are sprayed.
"When people think of agriculture, they think of the agrarian myth and what a wonderful, nurturing, safe, wholesome environment to raise a child," said Diane Mull, executive director of the Association of Farm Worker Opportunity Programs. "In some cases, that's true, but it's certainly not true for migrant farm worker kids. They're often breathing pesticides, they're often not paid the minimum wage and they often end up dropping out of school."
Many farmers say children often provide them with fake ID's stating that they are 18. And farmers deny exploiting these children, saying that they do not overwork them and train them in dealing with pesticides.
In a report in June on child farm workers, Human Rights Watch criticized what it called a double standard in labor laws, noting that children in nonagricultural jobs are not allowed to work more than 40 hours a week but there is no such limit for children doing agricultural work.
The report criticized laws that do not prohibit 14-year-old farmhands from working 70-hour weeks. Federal laws prohibit children under 18 from doing hazardous work in nonagricultural jobs, but the laws allow 16- and 17-year-olds to do hazardous work on farms.
"Agricultural employment for kids is bloody dangerous," said John Fraser, director of the Department of Labor's wage and hour division, the main agency overseeing child labor laws. "Only 6 to 7 percent of the jobs that young people take are in agriculture, yet 40 percent of the work-related fatalities that young people suffer are in agriculture."
Child farm workers are divided into three groups: unaccompanied migrants, usually teenage illegal immigrants from Mexico or Guatemala; children of migrant farm workers, who often force their teenagers to work and sometimes take children as young as 7 into the fields to pick alongside them; and, last, about 40,000 minors who are the children of farm owners and who start milking cows and harvesting at an early age to learn how to operate the farms that they may someday inherit.
Thin, shy and soft-spoken, Herman belongs to the fastest growing group of child farm workers, migrants who travel unaccompanied by their parents. At 6:30 each morning, an old school bus takes Herman, his 20-year-old brother and 30 other migrants to a dew-covered tomato field. Herman strains to pull up three-feet-tall weeds that hinder the harvest. Then from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., he picks tomatoes for 40 cents a bucket.
"I can't pick nearly as fast as the experienced men," said Herman, who fills 8 to 10 plastic buckets an hour while others do twice that. At 90 pounds, he struggles to toss the full 20-pound buckets into a truck.
By dusk, he is exhausted, his fingernails caked with dirt, his fine dark hair matted from sweat. After work, he returns to a labor camp where he sleeps in a small room with six other migrants. There are two bunk beds and three mattresses are spread on the floor.
Still, Herman says he has no regrets about leaving his family, his school and his country. "We're peasants," he said, "and people in Guatemala can't earn much money."
His journey to the United States was grueling. After Herman was smuggled into Arizona, the smugglers stuffed him, his brother and 30 others into the back of a truck that carried them to Virginia.
"It took 48 hours, and we didn't have anything to eat," said Herman, who owes the smugglers $1,850. "It was very hot. There was no water. Some people fainted. We were very weak when we got here."
For a recent 60-hour week, he received a $240 check. That translates to $4 an hour, but his managers said he received the minimum wage.
Social Security and other deductions were taken out, his boss said, but many farm workers wonder if their bosses pocket the deductions.
Put simply, poverty drives the two largest groups of child farm workers -- those like Herman who come from other countries and those like Jose Arispe, born in Texas but compelled to work because his father makes less than $10,000 a year doing farm work. On average, the adult farm worker earns less than $7,500 a year, partly because many find work for only eight months a year. Their incomes are cut back further because federal laws do not require that farm workers receive time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week.
Farm workers' advocates say growers are happy to hire these youngsters. But many farmers say they prefer not to hire young workers but are forced to because of a labor shortage.
"The farmers' view is that workers under age 18 lack maturity and are not particularly productive workers, and they do things that are foolish and dangerous, so you prefer not to have them around the farm," said Bryan Little of the American Farm Bureau Federation.
When the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1938, it set more lenient standards for children doing farm work than nonagricultural work, largely because farm work was seen as wholesome and family-oriented. Agriculture has changed immensely since then with the advent of huge corporate farms and of a network of more than one million seasonal and migrant workers, many of them teenagers.
Children's advocacy groups say the laws need to be changed. "Farm-working juveniles have second-class status -- they enjoy fewer rights than their nonfarm-working peers, and they are exploited while the government looks the other way," the Human Rights Watch report said.
Mr. Fraser, of the Labor Department, said the government was increasing its investigations into improper use of child farm workers. Last year it cited 46 farms for violations involving 102 minors. There are 1.9 million farms in the United States.
The government is spending more for day care centers for young migrant children, and for migrant teenagers, it is financing special education programs, including summer schools, to keep them from dropping out. But all this might not be enough to keep Jose Arispe in school.
"He wants to quit school," said Jose's mother, Elizabeth. "But I don't think that's a good idea. But he said he needs to work and contribute money to the family."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE FISCAL AGENDA;
Bush Puts New Spin On G.O.P. Blueprint

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The economic agenda presented to the Republican National Convention and the nation on Thursday night by Gov. George W. Bush stuck closely in many ways to Republican orthodoxy.
Its centerpieces were tax cuts and the creation of personal investment accounts within the Social Security system. 
 It emphasized that the solutions to some problems, like the growing numbers of people without health insurance, rested not with government bureaucracy but with the private marketplace. And it promised a budget that would provide more money for the military.
But there were twists.
Throughout the convention, the Bush team sought to counter the idea that Republicans stand for sweeping tax cuts that are reckless and a boon only to the country-club set. Tax cuts were showcased in Philadelphia as a prudent way to spur entrepreneurship, help people looking to reach the middle class, and provide an economic pick-me-up should the long business expansion begin to flag.
Gone was the Republican call to shrink government's size and influence by starving it of revenues. Mr. Bush went so far in his speech as to single out his support for federal programs like Head Start.
Perhaps most notably, Mr. Bush made clear how he intended to handle one of his trickiest political tasks: making a case against an incumbent vice president whose administration is presiding over an economic boom.
Rather than ignoring it, or getting into a battle over who deserves the credit, Mr. Bush said the real issue should be what the nation chooses to do with its prosperity.
"We will use these good times for great goals," Mr. Bush said, pledging in particular to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.
To some degree, Mr. Bush was trying to do for Republicans on economic policy what President Clinton has done for Democrats.
By emphasizing elimination of the federal budget deficit and the national debt, Mr. Clinton sought to erase the perception that Democrats were the party of profligacy and high taxes. In the end, doing so gave him more freedom to press for substantially more spending on the issues at the core of the Democratic agenda, especially health and education.
Similarly, Mr. Bush seems intent on dispelling the idea that conservative policy is inconsistent with helping people who have not already made it economically, and his tax plan contains elements specifically intended to help the working poor.
But Mr. Bush is by no means apologizing for the fact that his proposals to cut all income tax rates would do what such proposals always do: provide most of their benefits to the people who make the most money.
So Mr. Bush is certain to draw heavy fire from Vice President Al Gore. Democrats said that the focus in Philadelphia this week on helping single mothers, struggling family farms and Hispanic entrepreneurs was nothing more than camouflage for the usual conservative effort, embodied by the Bush campaign, to reward the wealthy people and powerful interest groups that finance Republican campaigns.
Worse, they said, Republicans would squander the projected federal budget surpluses and leave nothing for priorities like adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare or modernizing schools.
Democrats look at the Bush tax plan and see 43 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent of households by income, those making more than $319,000 a year, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning research group.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said Republicans remained focused on the incentives that tax cuts provide to earn and save more, whether for a waitress earning $18,000 a year or the entrepreneur who wants to be able to pass a painstakingly built business along to her heirs without being subject to a hefty federal estate tax.
After several years in which their agenda seemed to generate little public enthusiasm, Republicans have taken heart from polls showing that support for tax cuts is growing.
But to the extent that he emphasizes the substance of economic policy, Mr. Bush risks not only inviting an onslaught from Mr. Gore over class politics and fiscal rectitude, but also focusing voters on the fact that the Clinton-Gore years have been pretty good for most people.
With unemployment at 4 percent, inflation benign and incomes broadly rising, Democrats gathering for their Los Angeles convention this month will no doubt be eager to show that on those counts, Mr. Gore's election would mean more of the same.

HEADLINE: G.M. Has High Hopes for Vehicle Truly Meant for Road Warriors

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Trying to capture the spirit of the times, General Motors occasionally introduces a whole new brand, hoping it will grow as popular as Cadillac, Buick or Oldsmobile. A decade ago, it brought out Saturns and Geos to tap a national desire for affordable, sporty, fuel-efficient cars.
Now G.M. is at it again. Its latest venture: the Hummer. 
 Like the Jeep but far bigger, the Hummer started as a military transport, the Humvee, which was used in the Persian Gulf war for everything from launching missiles to ferrying the wounded. With the cold war ended, the Humvee's manufacturer is looking to civilian buyers. It has sold about 1,000 a year, for about $100,000 apiece, to affluent entrepreneurs, limousine companies and a sprinkling of celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mike Tyson and the rapper Coolio.
G.M. recently acquired the Hummer brand, placing a big bet that the decade-long trend toward ever larger and more aggressive-looking sport utility vehicles would continue. Besides selling the current version, G.M. will introduce at least two smaller Hummer models over the next three years, at much lower prices than the current model.
With a national network of Hummer dealerships, and plans to pursue the New York City market in particular, the company expects to make Hummers as common as BMW's, with sales approaching 150,000 a year.
"You'll see a lot in New York City, places like Manhattan where your affluent buyers are," said Michael DiGiovanni, G.M.'s general manager of Hummer operations.
But the mass marketing of Hummers raises the same safety and environmental issues that have dogged the largest sport utility vehicles: extremely poor fuel efficiency, higher emissions of smog-causing pollutants than cars, and a variety of risks and annoyances to motorists in other vehicles.
Even without its military look or a celebrity at the wheel, the Hummer would be hard to miss: it is taller, much wider and a full ton heavier than even G.M.'s largest sport utility vehicle, the Suburban. Indeed, while it seats only four, the current Hummer weighs as much as two Jeep Grand Cherokees or three small cars.
G.M. says its research shows that many prosperous baby boomers cannot afford the current model but still love its military look. G.M.'s surveys have found that the Hummer is also the favorite brand of teenage boys and the third favorite of teenage girls, after only Volkswagen and Saturn. That is especially important to G.M. because people tend to form lifelong preferences during their teenage years.
The Hummer's teenage admirers include Cooper Schwartz of Bellevue, Wash. As a small boy, he used to collect model sports cars -- Corvettes, Porsches and Ferraris. Now 17, he keeps a scale model of a black Hummer on the shelf next to his bed, and dreams of the day when he can afford a real Hummer.
"I love the fact that the Hummer is a tank; it's like a tank with fashion, it's like having your own war toy," said Mr. Schwartz, co-captain of his high school football team. "I like something where I can look down into another car and give that knowing smile that, 'I'm bigger than you.' It makes me feel powerful."
Indeed, the Hummer can seem downright overpowering compared with other passenger vehicles, raising the issue of safety.
The current Hummer has 16 inches of ground clearance, half a foot more than any other mass-market sport utility, and is designed to climb over vertical walls up to 22 inches tall. Federal regulations require car bumpers to be 16 to 20 inches high. So the Hummer's height greatly increases the risk in crashes that the vehicle will ride over cars' bumpers and doors sills and slam into the passenger compartment. And because the Hummer is so heavy, it inflicts far more damage in crashes.
While future Hummer models will have somewhat less ground clearance and weigh somewhat less, they are being designed with a central goal of "unparalleled off-road performance." So they will still be tall and heavy enough to pose problems for safety engineers like Terry Connolly, G.M.'s director of North American vehicle safety, who said that his office had played little role in the company's Hummer planning and design.
Even more than other sport utilities, Hummers can block the view of other motorists. While cars tend to be five or six feet wide, and most sport utilities are a little over six feet wide, the current Hummer is 7 feet 2 inches wide, and G.M.'s prototype for a model the length of the Chevrolet Tahoe full-sized sport utility is 6 feet 10 inches wide. G.M. says that the unusual width of Hummers is part of their brand identity, so that even the smaller Hummers will be extra wide, making them hard to park as well. The wide stance should reduce the risk of their rolling over, however.
Among the environmental problems, the Hummers will emit far more air pollutants than cars. Current federal rules allow large sport utilities to emit 5.5 times the smog-causing nitrogen oxides that cars do. While Ford has improved its sport utilities and pickups so they pollute no more than cars, G.M. does not plan to reduce air pollution from its Hummers and other large sport utility vehicles until required to do so by federal regulations in 2004.
Fuel economy is another issue. A.M. General, the military contractor that developed the vehicle, says that the current Hummer gets 13 miles to the gallon in the city and 15 on the highway. The Hummer only manages this mileage because it has weak acceleration and burns diesel fuel, which gives 35 percent better mileage than gasoline. G.M. plans to make its next Hummer, like the current one, heavy enough to be classified as a medium-duty truck and therefore exempt from federal fuel-economy rules.
But Harry Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman, said G.M. would include Hummers in its voluntary commitment, announced on Wednesday, to have better gas mileage than Ford for sport utilities in 2005. G.M. will have to make its other sport utilities much more efficient to offset the Hummers.
The Hummer as a passenger vehicle also troubles some American war veterans. Hummer buyers typically have not served in the military, let alone fought in combat. "It's like someone who always wanted to be a cowboy and who goes out later in life and buys a hat and a horse -- well, that doesn't make you a cowboy," said Bruce Harder, a retired Marine colonel who is now director of national security and foreign affairs at Veterans of Foreign Wars.
During the Reagan administration's military buildup, a large factory was built in South Bend, Ind., to manufacture 25,000 Humvee military transports a year. Production soon plunged below 4,000 Humvees a year, so in late 1992 A.M. General began building nearly identical Hummers for civilians on the same assembly line. G.M. and A.M. General broke ground last Monday on a second Hummer assembly plant in Mishawaka, Ind.
G.M. will rely mostly on new models to increase Hummer sales, while continuing to sell the current Hummer, which it is renaming the Hummer H1. It plans to introduce in 2002 a $45,000 Hummer H2, to be built in Mishawaka, with maximum sales of 40,000 a year. The H2 will be the length of the Tahoe but considerably wider.
The Hummer H3, the size of midsize sport utilities like the Chevrolet Blazer or Ford Explorer, is to go on sale the following year for just under $25,000, as a higher-volume model aimed at a market of young men. G.M. has also done a little work on a possible Hummer H4, which would be slightly smaller and cheaper yet, but has made no decisions on it.
John G. Middlebrook, G.M.'s vice president for North American vehicle brand marketing, said G.M. would choose some of its most successful dealers to sell Hummers. "Like when we started up Saturn, we have a clean sheet here," he said.
Saturn sells 230,000 cars a year.
G.M. decided against a Hummer dealership in Manhattan because of real estate costs. Instead, it plans dealerships across northern New Jersey and Long Island, and at least one for Westchester and Fairfield Counties.
Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director for market analysis, said that the rising concentration of wealth and income in America over the last two decades had been the most important social trend for automakers. A very large class of high-income, fairly youthful households has been created, he said, and these people care little about gasoline prices and other vehicle operating expenses.
G.M. plans to aim the H1, H2 and H3 at different markets. The H1 will be marketed to "rugged individualists." These are people who are irreverent and daring and want to be seen that way by other people, Mr. DiGiovanni said. "The rugged individualists are people who really seek out peer approval -- they're really going to go off road, go out in the desert and come back and tell people about it," he said.
Keri Quinn, a 44-year-old bachelor and co-founder of a software company in Dallas who sold his Nissan 300ZX sports car and raided his retirement account to buy his Hummer, said he went on frequent off-road driving trips with his friends but also liked the thumbs-up signals he received from strangers.
The Hummer H2 is intended for "successful achievers," especially people who perceive themselves as daring risk takers, but tend not to take risks involving their physical safety. "They're daring in the sense they may take a big stock market position, like buying 20,000 shares of an e-commerce stock," Mr. DiGiovanni said. "They really have not much intention of going off road, but it's really important for them that people tell them how successful they are."
The Hummer H3 will be for young buyers, including those under 25, and is still in the early stages of design. The nation's top-selling Hummer dealer, Jim Lynch in O'Fallon, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, said 10 of the 162 Hummers he sold last year were to parents who were buying them for their teenage children.
Jason Frankel, the Houston owner of a factory that makes what he described as "hillbilly" novelty teeth, said he had bought two Hummers and planned to buy another for his 9-year-old daughter when she turns 16. "I think it's a great first car for a kid," he said. "They can't destroy it, and they'll be the envy of all their friends."

Maine Lobstermen Protest Dumping of Dredge

BYLINE: By Paul Molyneaux 

 BODY:
New York and Connecticut lobstermen are not alone in fearing that their precious resource is being threatened by man-made contaminants. Maine, the nation's largest lobster source, has not suffered the alarming die-off that decimated the Long Island Sound lobster fishery this spring, but Maine fishermen, environmentalists and town officials have seen enough red flags to voice their concerns.
In April, Maine's Department of Transportation announced plans to dump dredge spoils contaminated with lead, mercury, PCB's and petroleum derivatives, into the prime lobster grounds of Penobscot Bay. The proposed disposal site, five miles from Vinalhaven, Me., an island about 50 miles northeast of Portland, lies within an area where 19 million pounds of lobster were caught last year -- nearly 40 percent of the state landings. 
 When Penobscot Bay lobstermen and community leaders heard about the dumping proposal, they came out in force to protest.
"I'm not a scientist," said Vinalhaven's town manager, Sue Lessard, looking at the Transportation Department's plan. "But I'm intelligent enough to know this is not a good idea."
Although the causes of the Long Island Sound disaster remain uncertain -- last week, New York area lobstermen blamed pesticide spraying -- some scientists believe contaminated dredge spoils played a role. Consequently, Maine fishermen have asked regulators to find new ways to dump dredge material.
Maine's Transportation Department did not expect any opposition when it applied for its dredge material disposal permit, part of a port redevelopment project at Mack Point, in upper Penobscot Bay. At an April hearing on the application, Paul Pottle, the department's project manager, told the public that the permit called for dumping 121,000 cubic yards of dredge material and that the contaminated material would be left at the site.
Lessard, armed with facts, caught Pottle off guard when she took issue with his statements.
"I obtained copies of the permits being applied for," Lessard told Pottle, "and I'm a little confused as to what I've heard." Lessard said the application asked to dispose 375,000 cubic yards of material at the Rockland, Me. site, at least 50,000 cubic yards of it contaminated.
Lessard also pointed out that federal rules required the Rockland site to be monitored every 10 years and that it had not been monitored since 1989. She, and many others, said that they did not object to the Mack Point port project, only the proposed disposal of the dredge spoils. They called for a review of the Rockland site before any future dumping.
The Mack Point project, high on Gov. Angus King's list of priorities, has "a lot of political will behind it," Lessard said. "If it's a state mission to build this port, we want it handled responsibly," she said.
In Vinalhaven, where 75 percent of the year-round residents depend on the lobster industry for their livelihood, it comes as no surprise that a furor over the disposal of dredge spoils spread in coastal areas and led to another meeting in late April. State and federal officials addressed the concerns of Vinalhaven and other Maine fishing communities.
Carl Boutilier of the New England office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers said the disposal site off Vinalhaven was scheduled for review this year. "We'll be seeking input from fishermen on how best to conduct the site evaluation in order to address their concerns," he said, but he added that the results might not affect the Mack Point project.
Peter Jones, owner of the Vinalhaven Lobster Company, suggested that a review of the Rockland site should lead to the end of dumping. "We don't want another Long Island Sound," he said. "We need to close the Rockland site permanently."
Maine's commissioner of marine resources, George Lapointe, urged fishermen and community leaders to work with the state to find solutions to Mack Point and future dredge disposal issues. "Let's get the facts on the table," he said.
He noted that "dumping had occurred at the Rockland disposal site since the 50's, concomitant with the largest increase in lobster landings in Maine history." Lobster landings have increased to 53 million pounds from 22 million pounds in the last 50 years.
With dredge material from Mack Point and several harbor maintenance projects scheduled to go to the Rockland disposal site, Maine's transportation commissioner, John Melrose, asked fishermen to consider the economic repercussions of closing the area's only ocean disposal site.
"One thing that's left me sort of unsettled is that much of the discussion has been focused on the lobster resource," Melrose said. "You need to consider what will happen to other projects."
Ocean dumping of contaminated dredge spoils has become a nationwide problem, and Melrose acknowledged that "the long-term prospects for doing business as usual are not good." But for the short term, he expressed worries that if the Rockland dump closes, the rising cost of dredge spoil disposal might shut down marine activity in Maine.
The Transportation Department estimates that each ship entering a Maine port generates $40,000 to $74,000 for local communities. In addition, the Mack Point port would link shipping with rail service to northern Maine, Montreal and maritime Canada, providing goods to those areas and export opportunities for the region's forest products.
Leroy Bridges, president of the Downeast Lobstermen's Association, countered that Maine's $70 million lobster industry also contributed to the state's economy and the tourist industry. "People don't come to Maine to see ships unloading," he said. "They come to eat lobster, and see us catching them."
Lance Stewart, a University of Connecticut marine biologist who has studied the effects of dredge disposal on lobsters for decades, believes the lobsters in Long Island Sound succumbed to a number of stresses, including pesticide spraying and rising water temperature. "Although dredge spoils may be having some impact, they are not at the top of my list as far as the cause of the die-off," he said.
Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine-affiliated Lobster Institute, agrees that anything that will kill an insect will kill a lobster, but he remains cautious. "We still worry about dredge spoils," he said. Many Long Island Sound lobstermen had lost boats and homes, Bayer said, as a result of the economic repercussions of the crisis. "Is it worth the risk?" he asked.
Seeking a resolution of conflicting interests, Bridges, Lessard and representatives from several advocacy groups met with state officials on June 13. The meeting resulted in some progress, but the situation remains tentative, said Ben Neal of the Island Institute in Rockland.
"M.D.O.T. agreed to consider reducing the total volume on its application to 75,000 cubic yards and find an upland disposal site for the contaminated material," he said. "I think it's good that people are talking, but the jury is still out on what level of commitment M.D.O.T. has."
Lessard said she believed the department "is cognizant of our concerns and is trying to compromise." She added, however, that nothing had yet been put in writing.
Melrose, the transportation commissioner, is hopeful that affordable ways can be found to use contaminated material, possibly in the construction at Mack Point. But dredge material will continue to be generated by other projects, and Melrose wants to avoid future conflicts.
To that end, the Army Corps of Engineers and Maine agencies, including the Transportation Department, have set to work with various individuals and groups to create a long-range plan balancing environmental and economic interests.
Lessard and Bridges have faith in the negotiations. But economic realities continue to drive the Mack Point project, and contaminated dredge material could still legally be dumped in waters off Vinalhaven.
"It's important we don't go down that road," Lessard said. "There's way too much at stake."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore's Theme-a-Day Tour Will Start With a No. 2 Pick

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, N.Y., Aug. 5

 BODY:
In the days leading to the Democratic convention, Vice President Al Gore plans to tour several important battleground states, from Georgia to Pennsylvania to Michigan, hammering at the emerging themes of his campaign: that the presidential election will be about substance versus flash and new ideas against old, his aides said today.
In separate appearances with Southern Democratic governors, President Clinton and his soon-to-be-announced running mate, Mr. Gore will focus on a different issue each day, including welfare, Social Security, health care and the economy, seeking to draw sharp differences in style and policy with his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. 
 "This tour will offer a striking contrast to the Bush campaign's approach of image rather than issues, photo-ops rather than substance," Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said.
The "Going the Distance Tour," as the Gore campaign has dubbed it, will begin on Tuesday in Nashville, when the vice president will appear for the first time with his running mate. It will end on Tuesday, Aug. 15, in Michigan when Mr. Gore stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Mr. Clinton for a symbolic passing of the party's leadership torch.
Mr. Gore will arrive at the convention in Los Angeles the next day, and will accept the party's nomination the night of Thursday, Aug. 17. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to address the convention on Monday night and then leave the next day, effectively clearing the stage for Mr. Gore.
The vice president has previewed many of the themes he plans to emphasize during his tour in speeches over the past two days. The tour is also intended to highlight Mr. Gore's biography, and today in remarks before the National Association of Police Organizations in Washington, he talked extensively about his time as an Army reporter in Vietnam and as a police reporter for The Nashville Tennessean newspaper.
"I saw a lot and gained a tremendous respect for what law enforcement officers do every day," he said. He added with a smile that he was "one of those good" reporters and not one who tried to dig up dirt on police officers.
Mr. Gore told the group that he would push for "common sense" laws to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals. He noted that in Congress, he had supported bills banning so-called cop-killer bullets and plastic guns. In doing that, he drew an implicit contrast with Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, who voted against both bills while a congressman from Wyoming.
The vice president heralded the administration's efforts to help police departments hire 100,000 new officers, and said he would push for money to hire 50,000 more. He also said he would fight to allow officers to carry their weapons while off-duty and for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing victims the right to be heard at criminal proceedings involving their attackers.
The police group, which endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996, has not decided whom to support this year. But in introducing Mr. Gore today, the group's president, Thomas J. Scotto, warmly praised Mr. Gore, saying the group has had a relationship with the White House that "is probably the envy of all other law enforcement groups and politicians throughout this country."
From Washington, Mr. Gore flew here to spend the weekend on Long Island attending three fund-raising events.
Mr. Gore continued to hold any vice-presidential decision close to the vest. When he landed this afternoon at the Suffolk County Airport, reporters asked him if he was close to making a decision.
"I'm about two and a half days away from it now," he said, stating the obvious, since he has imposed a deadline on himself for an announcement at noon on Tuesday.
Mr. Gore was attending two fund-raisers tonight for the Democratic National Committee. He raised $250,000 at a fund-raiser sponsored by Scott Bessent, a hedge-fund manager, and Will Trinkle, a real estate developer, from about 100 people, many of them gay or lesbian.
At a later dinner, he raised $1 million from about 100 people at the home of Craig Hatkoff, a real estate developer, and Jane Rosenthal, a film producer who, with the actor Robert De Niro, founded the Tribeca Film Center.
Other guests at the events included Christie Brinkley, the model; Andrew Tobias, the author; Charles Nolan, the designer; and John Sykes, the president of VH-1.
From Long Island, Mr. Gore heads to Nashville on Sunday afternoon to prepare for the announcement of his vice-presidential pick on Tuesday. He will travel on Wednesday with his running mate to Carthage, Tenn., Mr. Gore's hometown. They will hold a town hall meeting at the Carthage elementary school with about 150 Tennessee residents, many of whom will reminisce about Mr. Gore.
From there, they will travel to the home state of the vice-presidential candidate. Speculation is narrowing to three Democratic senators -- John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
Chatting with reporters outside a fund-raiser here, Ed Rendell, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, suggested that religion could be a factor in the vice-presidential selection. He said Mr. Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, would be "a bold and courageous choice."
But Mr. Rendell, who is Jewish himself, added, "I don't think anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew on the ticket."
If Mr. Lieberman were Episcopalian, Mr. Rendell said, "it would be a slam dunk." Still, he said, picking Mr. Lieberman would probably not cost too many votes because those who would oppose Mr. Lieberman because he was Jewish would probably not vote for the Democratic ticket in the first place.
Mr. Rendell also said that William S. Cohen, the Republican who is secretary of defense, could have been the candidate if he had not announced that was voting for Mr. Bush. "He might be our candidate -- he'd be dynamite," he said.
On Thursday, Mr. Gore and his running mate will go to Atlanta for a meeting with Southern governors and a discussion on welfare.
On Friday, it is on to the Philadelphia suburbs for an event with working women. On Saturday, they will travel to western Pennsylvania and the girlhood home of the late Rachel Carson, the environmental advocate and author of "Silent Spring," a book that Mr. Gore says strongly influenced him.
Next Sunday, Mr. Gore plans to discuss children's health care at University Hospital in Cleveland. On Aug. 14, the day the Democratic convention opens, Mr. Gore will be in Independence, Mo., home of Harry S. Truman, where he will discuss issues involving senior citizens.
That night, Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, will speak at the convention. Mr. Gore will meet Mr. Clinton on Tuesday at an as-yet-undesignated spot in Michigan, a crucial state, where they will showcase the nation's economic expansion and try to highlight Mr. Gore's role in the prosperity.
The next day, Mr. Gore will fly to Los Angeles, where his running mate will be nominated. Thursday night, Mr. Gore gives his acceptance speech and flies out that night to the Midwest, where he will begin a four-day boat trip across the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River.

HEADLINE: Help Doctors Who Help the Poor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The drying up of funds for the National Loan Repayment Program and the plight of physicians like Dr. Regan Andrade (front page, July 30) is grossly unfair, but it also begs attention to a larger problem: the enormous costs of medical education in the context of trimmed doctor salaries.
I am a pediatrics resident in New York City with $150,000 in educational debts, and my loan payments far exceed my paycheck of $2,000 a month. This salary, while hardly extravagant, is too high to allow me to qualify even for interest subsidization of my federal loans. 
 Recent college graduates working in the Internet industry make six-figure salaries with no postgraduate debt whatsoever. If the economy is willing to pay out so disproportionately for Internet communications, perhaps it is time for an education tax on the Internet.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT'S VETO SETS UP A BATTLE ON MARRIAGE TAX

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: EDGARTOWN, Mass., Aug. 5

 BODY:
Two days after Republicans wound up their political convention with promises of tax relief, President Clinton set up an election-year battle today by vetoing as too costly a tax break for married couples that is the cornerstone of the Republican effort.
Mr. Clinton accused the Republicans in his weekly radio address of advancing a series of "tax giveaways" that abandon the fiscal discipline that has helped produce the longest economic expansion in the country's history. 
 "We can't retreat from this opportunity of a lifetime to keep our economy strong and move our country forward," said Mr. Clinton, who signed the veto this morning during a visit to Martha's Vineyard for a weekend vacation and fund-raising.
"That's why I'm vetoing legislation that represents the first installation of a fiscally reckless tax strategy," Mr. Clinton said.
The veto, which Mr. Clinton had long threatened, sets the stage for a renewed partisan fight over tax policy when Congress returns to Washington after Labor Day. It is a fight that Republicans especially view as defining the parties in both the presidential and legislative elections.
John Feehery, the spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said Mr. Hastert planned to try to override the president's veto in the first vote. He said the veto would put pressure on House Democrats, who are competing for control of the chamber. Still, overriding it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate; neither passed the bill by such a wide margin. The vote in the Senate was 60 to 34, with seven Democrats joining all but one Republican, George V. Voinovich of Ohio, in support of the bill. In the House, the vote was 271 to 156.
Mr. Clinton said in his radio address that the door was still open for compromise.
"They've got another chance," he said. White House aides said they expected efforts to override the veto to fail and negotiations with the Republican leadership on a deal that would meet the president's priorities to continue through the fall.
As his campaign train stopped at the station in Durand, Mich., Gov. George W. Bush of Texas called the veto yet another "squandered opportunity" of the Clinton administration, which he pointedly called the Clinton-Gore administration.
"It sends the wrong signal in America, and yet my opponent showed us where he stands," said Mr. Bush, who earlier in the day had urged Vice President Al Gore to intervene against the veto. "Instead of standing on the side of families," Mr. Bush said, "he stands on the side of big government. Had I been president of the United States, I would have signed that bill."
Republicans, in their own weekly radio address, said Mr. Clinton was turning his back on married couples and perpetuating the view that the federal budget surplus belonged to the government instead of the taxpayers.
"At that special and sacred moment when the bride and groom say 'I do,' they also unwittingly say 'I do' to higher taxes," said Representative J. D. Hayworth of Arizona.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore "still peddle the shopworn slogan that correcting this injustice is just a break for the rich," Mr. Hayworth said. "But Americans know better. We understand that two spouses earning $25,000 each are not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination."
In Westhampton, N.Y., today, Mr. Gore said: "I'm for repealing the marriage tax, but not going beyond working families and not giving tax relief to people who are in the upper brackets and people who are not even married who are benefited by the version that was passed. I do support the veto. I also support the right kind of repeal of the marriage tax."
Both parties have plans to remedy the so-called marriage penalty, a quirk in the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay more tax than they would as singles. But the Republican plan is broader, giving an election-year break to nearly all married couples, even those who do not pay the penalty.
The issue is a sticky one for Democrats, who are seeking to walk the line between fiscal discipline and providing what is a politically popular benefit.
The bill would remedy features of the tax code that force 25 million married couples to pay higher income taxes than single people, mainly by enlarging the bottom 15 percent tax bracket and increasing the standard tax deduction for couples filing jointly. But it would also cut taxes for millions of other couples who now enjoy a marriage "bonus" because one spouse earns the bulk of the family income.
Mr. Clinton is urging a more modest tax-relief package intended to benefit people of low and middle incomes. He has given himself some wiggle room, however. Last month, Mr. Clinton said he would agree to the Republican tax reductions for married couples if Congress backed his proposal for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Republicans, who have their own, less sweeping prescription drug initiative, refused.
The two approaches over how to spend the record federal budget surplus mirror the turf staked out by the two presidential candidates. Mr. Gore has advocated a more modest tax-relief package than his Republican opponent. Mr. Gore has called Mr. Bush's plan risky. Mr. Bush dismisses Mr. Gore's stance as government as usual.
Republicans took great pains at their convention in Philadelphia to portray themselves as an inclusive party that reaches out to people of all ethnic groups and income levels. But as Mr. Clinton stumps on behalf of Mr. Gore, he knocks the Republicans for favoring the wealthy and turning their backs on minorities. At a Friday night fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton's New York Senate campaign, he told a group of wealthy donors that Mr. Gore would not leave anybody behind.
"The other guys are going to give you a bigger tax cut than we are," Mr. Clinton told 200 guests at the seaside gathering on Nantucket. But he said the country as a whole would be better off under Mr. Gore's stewardship, helping rich and poor alike.
"We'll give you lower interest rates and a better stock market," the president said. "You'll make more anyway. But I think we ought to all go along for the ride."
Mr. Clinton compared Republican plans to spend much of the projected surplus to a foolhardy person spending sweepstakes money before the check arrived. "Did you ever get one of those letters from Ed McMahon and Publishers Clearing House?" Mr. Clinton asked in what has become one of his biggest applause lines of late.
"Think about it: 'You may have won $10 million.' Now, if you went out the next day and spent the $10 million, you should support their program. But otherwise, you ought to stick with us."
The standoff over tax cuts is a repeat of past end-of-the-year budget confrontations, which Mr. Clinton has shown himself quite adept at maneuvering.
But in this case, the Republicans profess to be relishing the fight.
"House Democrats will have an opportunity to get rid of the marriage penalty by overriding the veto," Mr. Feehery said. "It's going to be a tough fight. We're going to expose their real proclivity for higher taxes."
Some Democrats praised the president's action as fiscally prudent. Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, called Mr. Clinton "wise to veto tax cuts that are not directed at the middle class."

HEADLINE: A Professional Hand For Elegant Gardens

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
HALF a century ago, Beverley Nichols, an English journalist, defied common sense and the advice of his friends and bought a small country estate. Upon inspection he found that the property came with a number of fixtures, the most permanent of which was Oldfield, the gardener, who had worked on the place for more than 40 years, and outlasted the two previous owners.
Although the relationship began with caution and a degree of skepticism on both sides, Mr. Nichols gradually realized that the old gardener was invaluable. Together they created a showplace, a process that Mr. Nichols described in three books, "Merry Hall," "Sunlight on the Lawn" and "Laughter on the Stairs." 
 Times have changed, but the need for professional gardeners has not. With the economy growing like chickweed in the spring, more and more people have both the desire and the means for significant gardens. A well-designed planting design can be a work of art, with the power to elevate a brand-new faux chateau to a higher aesthetic realm. But a garden, unlike a painting or a piece of sculpture, needs constant care and maintenance. Most landscapers and lawn care crews don't have the necessary expertise, and these days, people like Oldfield are hard to come by.
They do exist, however. Kathy Parsons is one of them. For the past 20 years, she has spent a good portion of her professional time caring for other people's gardens in Essex and Bergen counties in New Jersey. Working mostly by herself, Ms. Parsons waters, feeds, weeds, deadheads and monitors annual and perennial plants for diseases and pests. She also stakes, thins, prunes and divides -- tasks that often intimidate gardeners.
Though she tends some estate gardens, not all of her clients have extensive property. "I've done everything from a golf club to a small suburban home," she said.
Ms. Parsons characterized her average client as a "relatively wealthy and independent" person who loves his or her garden, but is too busy with career, family or community service to look after their plants without help. Those crowded schedules and demanding lives mean that often the professional gardener can use a certain amount of latitude in plant choice and installation.
"I don't get specifics," said Ms. Parsons, who added that the ability to do "a lot of mind reading" was often just as important as knowing when to apply the rose food.
If Beverley Nichols's Oldfield had a spiritual descendant, he would be Andy Turbridge, a professional gardener, designer and estate manager on the North Shore of Long Island.
In the business for 10 years, the English-born Mr. Turbridge has spent the past four years working for his current employers and living on their estate. His job combines both hands-on and administrative elements. The hands-on tasks include tending the estate rose garden and monitoring for pests and diseases, as well as planning for planting on the property. His administrative responsibilities include supervising arborists, lawn care professionals and other providers of services.
Mr. Turbridge has a flexible arrangement with his employer that allows him to do design work and maintenance planning for other clients. He stressed the importance of the latter. "Maintenance is the first thing you address when you design," he said. "Any designer who doesn't talk about maintenance will probably make mistakes."
But even the best maintenance plan can't succeed without appropriate personnel. Mr. Turbridge says there is a definite need for skilled professional gardeners with enough knowledge to cope with the "higher end of horticulture."
Fanny Clark, who is soon to retire after many years as a professional gardener in the Montclair, N.J., area, values the personal relationships she has cultivated along with her clients' plants and shrubs. Those relationships begin with lots of questions.
"I want to know what colors they like, which windows they look out of in their homes," she said. "I find out how much they will be outside and when, and whether they go away in the summer."
Once Mrs. Clark has gathered the information, she and the clients get down to specifics.
"Clients know the look and feel they want," she said. "I translate that into what's doable." Eventually, added Mrs. Clark, "You get to know a client well enough so you can tuck a surprise into the garden, and you know they will love it."
Like Ms. Parsons, Mrs. Clark cares for a variety of gardens. She restricts herself to established planting schemes rather than new ones and has often been called upon to tame an estate garden that has been neglected. Her favorite gardens are those that were laid out during the 1920's and 30's, an era she refers to as the golden age of American garden design.
Mrs. Clark says these older gardens benefit from having "great bones" or defining structures such as walls, terraces and walkways as well as mature trees. Rejuvenating them sometimes means simplifying labor-intensive plantings by installing less finicky shrubs, vines and foliage plants.
Once a garden is under control, Mrs. Clark maintains it on a weekly basis. Both she and Ms. Parsons are also frequently called upon to spruce up clients' gardens before parties and other events.
Over the years, Ms. Parsons and Mrs. Clark have noticed a demographic shift among their clients.
"Economics has changed the face of gardening," Mrs. Clark said. "Clients have gotten younger, and are now often two-income couples in their 30's." These people, she said, frequently reject traditional workhorse plants such as impatiens and hostas in favor of newer and more exotic materials.
Some of the professional gardeners have clients who like to get out and do some work in their own gardens. In such situations, Mrs. Clark maintains the beds in a way that makes the prospect of that work a pleasure rather than just another source of guilt for not tending to the needs of the garden.
"A garden should be a place that people can fuss in a little bit when they come home at the end of the day," she said.
Mrs. Clark is a professional gardener whose work frequently involves aspects of garden design.
Jody Staunton of New Canaan is a garden designer whose work leads her to garden maintenance.
"I only maintain the gardens I design," said Ms. Staunton, who cares for properties in New Jersey, Westchester and Connecticut. "Maintenance is so important in keeping the shape and form of the garden that maintenance and design are really one and the same."
Some of her clients are intensely interested in new plant colors and varieties, and she travels around the United States and Europe to find them. This nurturing of clients and their properties makes it hard to play favorites.
"I feel attached to all of the gardens," she said. "I have good chemistry with the owners."
Each gardener arrived at the vocation by a different route. Mr. Turbridge said he came from a family of green thumbs and he did "many things aside from horticulture," before settling into his current line of work.
Mrs. Clark grew up on a farm and attended a school run by Quakers, a group renowned for an interest in horticulture. By the time her children had grown to the point where they no longer needed constant supervision, she had become an avid gardener.
A serendipitous meeting with Montclair's celebrated landscape designer and gardener, Avis Campbell, led to a job offer. When Miss Campbell died, she left Mrs. Clark her clients and her library. With skills honed by lots of on-the-job training, and an education gleaned by reading the many classic garden works in the older woman's library, Mrs. Clark hung out her own shingle. Working alone, she had, at the peak of her career, 13 regular clients, whose gardens she visited once a week. During the gardening season she worked from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. every day. "By the end of each day I was absolutely dead," she said.
Ms. Parsons began her professional career by working for a commercial nursery and also, like Mrs. Clark, worked for a time for Avis Campbell. Eventually a desire for greater responsibility led her to go into business for herself. Now she maintains gardens of her own design, as well as some designed by others.
Ms. Staunton has worked in the landscape design and garden maintenance business for 15 years. After studying at Radcliffe, she began her career at City Gardens, a Boston company that specializes in indoor landscape design. Later she worked for both wholesale nurseries and a landscape designer. Seven years ago she went into business for herself. She does most maintenance work on her own, with occasional help from Richard Wingus, her senior crew chief, who is a Jamaican-born naturalist. He is especially skilled at pruning.
Mrs. Clark has always worked alone, preferring to maintain an intensely personal relationship with her clients and their gardens. Ms. Staunton and Ms. Parsons would like to hire gardeners to help with maintenance, but the supply of knowledgeable people is limited.
"There is such a shortage of talented gardeners who know what they are doing," said Ms. Staunton, who added that many people seem more attracted to design than maintenance. This, she said, may be partly because of the physical challenges posed by maintenance work, which can include such inelegant chores as mixing green sand and composted manure together, then digging it into heavy clay soil.
Each of the four gardeners stressed that in horticulture the learning never stops. Mr. Turbridge keeps the process going by maintaining trial beds in his personal garden on the estate where he works.
On the verge of retirement, Mrs. Clark remains philosophical. "Just when you think you have a handle on shade gardening," she said, "you get a client who has nothing but full sun. It's the most humbling profession in the world."

HEADLINE: The Lure of Raw Space

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
IN the 10 years that Anna and Peter Bakst waited to buy their dream house, Mrs. Bakst regularly clipped architectural and decorating ideas from magazines. So by the time they finally bought, they pretty much knew exactly what they wanted. Which is why after buying a 4,200-square-foot condominium in SoHo in 1997 they were content to wait almost a year to move in while the contractor transformed a virtually empty space into a home for themselves and their two young sons.
"It was a fairly high-end job, because we had been waiting 10 years," said Mrs. Bakst, the president of the accessories and footwear division of the Donna Karan fashion house. "But it was worth the wait and the investment." 
 With loft prices soaring in lower Manhattan in the last few years, the Baksts' purchase of an unfinished condo in a former manufacturing building was indeed a solid investment. While Mrs. Bakst declined to give the price of her 10th-floor apartment, real estate brokers say that condos in her building -- the 12-story New Museum building at 158 Mercer Street, between Prince and Houston Streets -- have tripled or quadrupled in price since they came on the market as raw space in 1997.
"Back then," said Helene Luchnick, a senior vice president of the Douglas Elliman brokerage concern, who was showing a recent visitor around a 4,500-square-foot four-bedroom apartment in the New Museum building, "this loft sold for $1.65 million raw. It just closed for $6.75 million."
Despite the high prices, developers say there appears to be no shortage of customers for raw-space condos. A number of buildings in which apartments are delivered as raw space have sold out within months of going on the market, the developers say, while some raw-space buildings now under development have waiting lists.
The purchase price is only part of the cost of buying what is called raw space, "white space" or "white raw." The cost of turning raw space into bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, closets and the other comforts of home can easily amount to as much as the sale price.
"With raw space you're basically buying four walls, floor and ceiling, so depending on what you plan to do with it, it can be expensive," said Steven M. Lamazor, the president of Taocon Inc., a Manhattan construction company that specializes in residential and commercial renovations. "We just finished two $1 million renovations."
While the cost of transforming raw space into a finished home is typically at least $200 a square foot, Angelo Cosentini, a developer and the vice president of On the Level Enterprises, a construction company, said that he is doing a renovation in TriBeCa for $500 a square foot. "And we're doing a 3,000-square-foot loft where the plumbing alone is $200,000," he added.
The transformation from raw space to a finished home costs as much as it does, brokers and builders say, because many owners want the very best. "Everybody wants to see their home in Architectural Digest," Mr. Lamazor said. The number of people with both the desire for showcase homes and pockets deep enough to pay whatever it takes has allowed contractors who specialize in such work to be selective. "We're basically taking only jobs of at least $1 million or $2 million," Mr. Lamazor said, except for repeat clients.
Decades ago, in some of the neighborhoods where million-dollar-and-up apartments are now common, artists, bohemians and those down on their luck lived in lofts or abandoned buildings with just the bare necessities, if that.
Alex Katz and Al Held, artists who were then teaching at Yale, bought an entire building in SoHo in 1968. The price was so low that even now Mr. Katz is reluctant to say what they paid for it, other than that "it was very little" and that he was very lucky. He and his wife live in the same 5,000-square-foot co-op penthouse to this day; a co-op of similar size two blocks away sold for $6.4 million last year.
When lofts became highly popular in the 1970's, they were converted to co-ops, said Jan Hashey, a senior vice president at Douglas Elliman who specializes in the sale of raw space. A 3,100-square-foot loft in NoHo, Ms. Hashey's first raw-space sale, sold for $31,000 in the 70's, or $10 a square foot. Today, she said, a similar property in NoHo would likely sell for $1.3 million.
On Crosby Street in SoHo, where Ms. Hashey still lives in a loft she bought in 1977 for $15,000 -- and where she spent $75,000 more to bring it up to city requirements for a residence -- a penthouse in a raw-space condominium recently went to contract at $8.5 million.
LOFTS continued to increase in popularity and price until the real-estate market soured in the late 1980's, after which loans for such conversions were hard to come by. By the time the economy had turned around in the 1990's, raw-space co-ops had generally fallen out of favor, in part because co-op purchasers do not own the property -- they purchase stock in the co-op corporation, which entitles them to a proprietary lease to occupy the apartment. When the market recovered, developers and real-estate agents say, the co-op form of ownership yielded to the condominium, which imposes far fewer restrictions on buyers.
As Manhattan became safer and cleaner, families and others seeking large amounts of space were drawn to SoHo, NoHo, TriBeCa, Chelsea and the Flatiron and financial districts, home to an estimated 90 percent of the dormant factories and warehouses that could be converted into lofts.
Those factories and warehouses not only have lots of space, many have ceilings up to 16 feet high, panoramic windows, Grecian columns, brick walls and maple floors. These days many raw-space condos also have wood-burning fireplaces, dedicated basement storage, modern elevators, common terraces and roof gardens as well as supers and door attendants.
And raw space is no longer synonymous with converted onetime loft buildings. The 28 apartments in the two sleek 15-story towers designed by Richard Meier that are to rise at 173 and 176 Perry Street in the far west area of Greenwich Village are to be delivered as raw space, at prices of up to $8 million.
Location can also be a major factor in the lure of raw-space lofts.
"When I saw that view of the Hudson, in one minute I said to the broker, 'I'll take it,' " said Roy Liebenthal, the owner of PoP and Lemon restaurants.
Mr. Liebenthal paid $1.7 million for his fourth-floor condo in an 11-story building at 495 West Street in the West Village. Then he spent $750,000 more renovating it. Now, Mr. Liebenthal said, he and his companion, Fabienne Terwinghe, a model, couldn't be happier. "From our condo," he said, "we can see only green trees, water and boats. It's like living on vacation."
For developers, one attraction of delivering apartments as raw space is that such buildings take less time to complete than do those with finished layouts and equipment. "And it's much less challenging for developers than finished space, no muss, no fuss," said Jane Gladstein, an executive vice president of Corcoran Group Marketing.
Cary Tamarkin, the architect and developer whose conversion at 140 Perry Street is generally credited with bringing raw space back into vogue in 1996 after it had fallen out of favor a decade or so earlier, said that there were pitfalls for prospective buyers. "Raw space costs less and takes less time if your only concern is the balance sheet," he said. "That's why you see a lot of schlock out there. "
Rob Tiburzi, a developer with Houlihan-Parnes Realtors, suggested another motive for developers' penchant for raw space. In at least half the high-end loft conversions in Chelsea a few years ago, he said, buyers were substituting their own preferences for the finished space. "So," Mr. Tiburzi said, "the developers thought, why should I spend the money on finished space when it's just going to be tossed away?"
And James Lansill, director of development for Stribling & Associates, proffered a somewhat similar explanation. "Some developers," he said, "are inflicting their own vision, so people buy them to gut them."
And some buyers, according to Edward Ferris, a broker with the William B. May Company, will pay a premium for a blank canvas: "Raw space is appealing to people who don't want to pay for other people's work. So they're willing to pay the same as others pay for finished space."
Mr. Lansill oversees sales and marketing for the raw-space loft condos under construction at the Cooper Square buildings that until last year had been the home of Carl Fischer Inc., a music publisher for 76 years. Residential space at the 12-story building at 62 Cooper Street, whose exterior is adorned by a distinctive large clock in the shape of an eighth note, will range from 7,385 square feet per floor to 8,404 square feet, while residential space at the two vacant adjoining four-story buildings is 3,250 square feet per floor. No price has been established for the condos, pending acceptance of the offering plan.
The Atalanta, a 17-story building being converted into 43 raw-space condos at North Moore and Varick Streets in TriBeCa, went on the market two months ago, and, according to Mr. Tiburzi, one of its developers, "We're going to contract with five buyers who are paying in excess of $5 million each."
Ms. Luchnick of Douglas Elliman said that at 6,900 square feet, the price for each of those properties -- in what had been the home of the Merchants Refrigerating Company -- works out to an average of $800 a square foot.
In Chelsea, 5,720-square-foot residential condos in the 12-story City Prairie at 206 West 17th Street -- the renamed former business offices of Barneys, the fashion retailer -- range in price from $1.65 million to $6.25 million for the penthouse, which includes an additional 3,500 square feet of private roof deck. While the average price for the 11 condos is $520 a square foot, according to Mr. Tamarkin, the architect and developer, the penthouse price will work out to a lofty $1,000 a square foot for the residential space.
Unlike buying a completed apartment, buying raw space is only the beginning of a time-consuming and expensive process, one that many apartment-seekers would have no patience for.
"Many of them are extremely busy," said Ms. Gladstein of the Corcoran Group, "so they're not inclined to spend millions buying lofts, then pay a minimum of $200 a square foot fixing them up and then having to wait at least nine months to move in. We counsel clients that it's a daunting prospect for most people."
As happy as Mrs. Bakst, the Donna Karan executive, is with her former raw space home, she acknowledges that even though she and her husband (an investment banker) hired an architect, an interior designer and a well-recommended contractor, the conversion was often stressful.
"Even though I had in mind what I wanted, I'm also a working woman, so I needed somebody to come to me with ideas so I could pick from them," she said. "And as the project moves along, there are a lot of technical details that require an engineer to come in and work out, like where your pipes go when you want a bathroom here instead of there, or where to put the heating and cooling system."
BECAUSE her sister had already developed a couple of raw spaces, Mrs. Bakst's experience was less onerous than it might have been. In addition to having already done her homework about what she wanted, she knew the importance of having detailed architectural plans for the contractor and of being resigned to wait.
Mrs. Bakst also knew -- or does now -- that for all her planning, there are the inevitable changes. "Once you're done with it you look and say I'd probably have done this or that differently," she said. "For one thing, I would probably have made the size of the boys' bedrooms more equal."
But the biggest lessons she learned, she said, were not with space but with time and money. "Assume every estimate will cost 25 to 50 percent more and that it will take 25 to 50 percent longer," she said.
She also has few illusions that the money spent on improvements, as opposed to the appreciation of the real estate, will reap huge dividends. "I think that generally whatever return you get if you sell is because of the space, not because of what you put into it," she said.
Buyers of raw space need to have enough cash in hand, after paying the mortgage, to pay for the construction.
While most banks usually do not give both a mortgage for buying the property and another loan for construction, Neil Bader, the president of IPI Skyscraper Mortgage, said there are banks known to most mortgage brokers that will make construction loans. Such loans typically cost one-half a percentage point more than a home mortgage, Mr. Bader added, and the money is given to the borrower as the work proceeds.
Developers and architects who specialize in raw space acknowledge that its appeal is limited both by geography and by the unwillingness of most buyers to spend the time and put up with the frustration.
But within that limited market, architects, developers and builders say they are confident raw space will remain popular. For example, Mr. Tamarkin said he is "definitely considering raw space" for his proposed development at 91st Street and Madison Avenue, which was turned down in June by the Landmarks Preservation Commission but is being redesigned.
"It doesn't need to be confined to old warehouses," he said. "You can do it in an apartment house, if you do it in style. And if you do it in style, it will appeal to people who can afford it and are willing to go through what it takes to finish it the way they want."
Mr. Lamazor, the contractor, cited another reason raw space is not likely to disappear. "More and more people with money want something beautiful," he said. "Not long ago it was a $2 million work of art. But the $2 million works of art being commissioned now have walls, floors and roofs, and instead of being done by painters they're designed by architects."

HEADLINE: Distilling the Truth In the Ecstasy Buzz;
Much Talk, and Dissent, on Drug's Rise

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
Every other week, it seems, the authorities convene another news conference to announce another sweep, another bust, another gigantic distribution network crushed. Stick your head out the window these days and you cannot help hearing about Ecstasy.
Seizures of the little white pills have occurred so often in recent months that it is beginning to feel as if law enforcement officials are doing little else besides cracking down on the drug. Mafia turncoats are charged with moving it in Arizona. Israeli mobsters are caught distributing it in Brooklyn. Even New Jersey college students are rounded up on quiet campuses, accused of selling it to their peers. 
 Ecstasy, a euphoria-producing psychedelic known to chemists as MDMA, has been around since 1912, when it was introduced in Europe as a potential appetite suppressant. It was readily -- if illegally -- available to those who cared to find it 5, 10, even 15 years ago. So why has the discussion about Ecstasy reached such a fever pitch now?
Clearly, the concern about the drug is grounded in fact. It no longer is used by "club kids" alone but has spread into the professional world. It turns up in airport searches and nightclub raids, and law enforcement officials say it is pouring into the country in precedent-setting amounts.
But the much-publicized crackdown has attained an almost breathless quality as each new case is touted as the biggest, the broadest to date, and as newspaper headlines and magazine covers proclaim the drug to be the scourge of the moment. At a time when less public attention is being paid to marijuana, cocaine and heroin, the fight against Ecstasy provides a renewed look into how the machinery of the drug war works in this country. It also opens a window on the lingering tensions between the authorities who prosecute the war and the drug treatment experts and sociologists who say that a law enforcement approach may result in splashy stories about arrests but is unlikely to stem drug use or the public health problems it causes.
Law enforcement statistics on Ecstasy tell only part of the story, but that part is powerful. New York City officials say seizures of Ecstasy at Kennedy Airport alone have risen to 858 pounds in 1999 from 68 pounds in 1997 and 8 pounds in 1996. Nationwide, federal agents have confiscated 8 million doses of the drug this year, dwarfing the 3.5 million pills seized last year and the 750,000 in 1998, the Customs Service said.
Last week, a cadre of the country's top drug officials gathered in Washington to talk about the Ecstasy trade. The prognosis was grim: use of the drug is soaring, they said, particularly among the young. Moreover, the authorities have said, the popularity of Ecstasy is slowly spreading beyond the narrow confines of the youth culture, where a typical user pops a pill or two before an evening out and rolls through a night of dancing awash in the empathetic, supersensual haze that gives the drug its name. Ecstasy, they say, has started infiltrating older castes and has even begun to pique the interest of minority groups, which have traditionally ignored it.
"We are seeing Ecstasy all over the country these days in tremendous amounts," said Raymond W. Kelly, the commissioner of the Customs Service, who added that his agency had beefed up its resources in an effort to stop the influx of the drug about a year ago. "What's really happening is a convergence of several factors: better organizational skills by the criminals who distribute it, lots of disposable money out there in a healthy economy, and the promulgation of the myth that Ecstasy use has no downside."
Amid such worry, however, several experts who are critical of the crackdown approach to fighting drugs have come forward to say that while the problem with Ecstasy may be growing, it is not -- at least for now -- at the panic stage. They draw comparisons to the supposed middle-class heroin crisis of the mid-1990's or the supposed rise in teenage marijuana use a few years earlier -- drug epidemics, they say, that never really panned out.
For example, Michael Massing, the author of "The Fix" (1998, Simon & Schuster), which offered a critical appraisal of more than 30 years of America's efforts against drugs, pointed to a recent study that showed the percentage of high school seniors who said they had used Ecstasy in the previous month had increased only to 2.5 percent in 1999 from 1.5 percent in 1998. (That rate is low compared with marijuana use among high school students, which, according to other studies, has reached as high as 40 or 50 percent.) Mr. Massing added that another recent study had shown that only 1,024 people had sought emergency-room help because of Ecstasy in 1998, compared with 637 people in 1997.
"These are tiny numbers -- not the numbers of a national crisis," Mr. Massing said in an interview last week. "The drug war establishment needs periodic crises to justify their budgets. But I think that the level of what is almost hysteria about Ecstasy is out of proportion to what's actually going on."
But critics like Mr. Massing say there is equal exaggeration among the drug's devotees who claim that it provides a harmless high with little or no debilitating side effects. Although Ecstasy is often praised by its fans as a drug that lessens inhibitions, fosters comradeship and enhances sexual encounters, some medical professionals say that chronic consumption is quite dangerous. Prolonged use, they add, can lead to depression, memory loss and brain damage, while overdose can cause high blood pressure, fainting, muscle cramps and panic attacks.
"There is frenzy and there is hype surrounding Ecstasy," said Dr. John Morgan, a professor at the City University of New York Medical School who researches pharmacology and drug abuse. "But there is also still a potential that there is more danger about this drug than we originally thought."
For now, it appears that the war against Ecstasy has centered more on law enforcement than public health -- unlike the war on crack, for example, which encompassed an effort to roust dealers as well as a strong push to deal with the medical effects of a drug that was unquestionably damaging and often lethal. Still, as scientists learn more about Ecstasy's deleterious qualities, there is a growing movement -- especially among the authorities -- to crack down on the drug because of its medical dangers.
"It's killing young people," Mr. Kelly said. "If you read a lot of the early literature on Ecstasy, it was all, 'Hey, you're going to feel great.' But we know that doesn't hold up over the long run."
So far, however, these dangers have not resulted in any large-scale public health initiative. The reason, Dr. Morgan said, is that scientists are only now beginning to understand the long-term harm that Ecstasy can cause to the body and brain. "We're worried more about what damage might be discovered in the future," he added.
In the meantime, a welter of criminal cases involving Ecstasy have occurred. In February, for instance, Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia hit man and informer, was arrested in Phoenix on charges of trafficking in the drug. Just last week, Kenneth S. Gregorio and Brian J. Juliano, a pair of college students in New Jersey, were taken into custody after being accused of selling Ecstasy to their classmates at Monmouth University. Mr. Gregorio hanged himself in his cell hours after being arrested.
The news media have followed the lead of law enforcement officials, and drug-of-the-moment stories have fueled anxiety and created a somewhat nervous sense that Ecstasy use has gone terribly overboard.
There is a nagging temptation to label Ecstasy as the drug of the 90's and beyond. After all, it has started to supplant other drugs on the radar screens of the criminal justice system, and its reputation for creating a genial glow without medical downsides catches something of the passing decade's desire for guilt-free gladness in the same sort of way that the nervous surge created by cocaine caught the restless energy of the decade before.
The drug has become so prevalent that traffickers have begun to sell adulterated and even fake versions of Ecstasy -- a development that truly frightens drug experts.
"If law enforcement starts really cracking down on Ecstasy, I don't think it's going to lessen demand," said Marsha Rosenbaum, who, in the early 1990's, conducted the first federally financed sociological study on the drug. "And I worry that sales of the look-alike substitutes will increase, and they can be more dangerous than Ecstasy itself."
Nonetheless, the authorities insist that their efforts to stop the flow of Ecstasy did not create the hype about the drug. They say they are simply reacting to what has become the hottest commodity in the market.
"We didn't make Ecstasy the flavor of the day," said Bridget G. Brennan, New York City's special narcotics prosecutor. "We respond to what's in front of us."

HEADLINE: Personal Business: Seniority;
Some Guides To a Redefined Retirement

BYLINE: By Fred Brock

 BODY:
BOOKS aimed at the growing, and increasingly affluent, senior market are filling bookstore shelves around the country. Here is a sampling of recent additions, which touch on subjects from retirement to the Internet:
 
RETIREMENT MATTERS Retiring means more than just quitting work. It is one of life's major transitions that can carry heavy-duty emotional and psychological issues, involving nothing less than a redefinition of the self. "Breaking the Watch: The Meaning of Retirement in America," by Joel S. Savishinsky (Cornell University Press, $26), and "Taking Retirement: A Beginner's Diary," by Carl H. Klaus (Beacon Press, $16), both grapple with the meaning and ramifications of this transition. 
 "Breaking the Watch," which will be available in October, takes a broader look at retirement by exam- ining the lives of 26 people 13 men and 13 women from various backgrounds and professions in an upstate New York town. "Taking Retirement" is the diary of one man's efforts to come to terms with his first year of full retirement. But despite this difference in focus, both books go right to the main issues, practical and otherwise, that we all are facing or will face one day.
Mr. Savishinsky, a professor of social sciences at Ithaca College, does an admirable job of interviewing his 26 retirees on a wide range of topics. Partly, he succeeds because he lets his subjects have their say. The book is divided into six major chapters and a final, smaller one, "Conclusions: Lesson and Cautions."
 One nit: The author does not use the real names of the town, which he calls "Shelby," or the people he interviews. He writes that this is to protect their privacy. Well, maybe, but there are plenty of nonfiction books about considerably more controversial subjects that don't need that cover.
 Still, it's the voices of the retirees that power the book:
 "Retirement is like a progressive illness and a spiritual experience. There's a loss of efficacy, but the moral side grows."
 "In retirement, it's not the watches that get broken, it's the promises. No one who talked to me about a job ever came through. I came to feel you can't rely on anyone, and I'd never felt that way before."
 "I call it drift time.' It's not being in a fixed frame of work or routine. You bicycle instead of drive through life, letting each day unfold, taking you wherever it does."
 "My children are so uptight. Where did I go wrong?"
 In "Taking Retirement," Mr. Klaus, 68, a former college professor and the founder of the nonfiction writing program at the University of Iowa, uses his diary to take us inside his struggle to come to terms with a new life after 42 years of teaching. His musings chronicle the highs and lows as he copes with worries about money and health and with fears that he has been cast adrift, without the moorings of work. In the end, it is partly the work he continues to do - his writing - that lets him find balance in his new life.
 
 BITS AND BYTES For seniors who are anxious about jumping into the world of computers and the Internet, two books can be a big help.
 "Computer Friendly," by Raymond Steinbacher, is a guide for those who are really beginners. Clearly written and easy to follow, it begins with the assumption that the reader knows nothing about computers. The book is available only from the publisher, Green Tree Press in Erie, Pa., (800-834-3888). The price is $15.95, including shipping.
 "Mr. Modem's Internet Guide for Seniors," by Richard A. Sherman (Sybex, $19.99), is an excellent map for navigating the Internet. Its lists of Web sites are especially valuable. However, the book's constant efforts at cuteness can get a little tiring.
 
 SOCIAL SECURITY If you're confused by the political discourse over the future of Social Security, two books from the University of Chicago Press may help sort out the issues.
 "Social Security: The Phony Crisis," by Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot ($22), argues that because of overly conservative economic projections, Social Security is not in danger and doesn't need to be "saved" by putting some of its funds into individual stock market accounts, as George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, and others advocate. This is a very readable book by two economists that is actually influencing the political debate.
 "Making Sense of Social Security Reform," by Daniel N. Shaviro ($25), is due out next month and does a good job of explaining the nuts and bolts of Social Security. In the end, Mr. Shaviro, a law professor, comes down in favor of what he calls "progressive privatization," in which some money would be transferred at retirement from the individual accounts of people who have done well with them to those who have not. I wouldn't want to bet on that idea getting past conservative Republicans in Congress.

HEADLINE: The World;
Everyone Asks for Arab Unity. Getting It Is Harder.

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
POLITICAL slogans tend to long outlive their authors in this part of the world and none is more enduring, or more musty with age, than the 1950's-vintage catch phrase "Arab unity."
Ten years have passed since all 22 leaders of Arab League countries last gathered for a summit meeting, which was held here, in the aftermath of Iraq's surprise invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990. It was not a pretty sight, marred by food fights between angry Kuwaiti sheiks and bellicose Iraqi officials, and by recriminations and vacillation all around. 
 Now, at the urging of the Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have renewed the perennial call for a new summit meeting, this time billed as an emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the failure at Camp David and to counter the spin from Washington that the breakdown was due solely to Arab recalcitrance. Chances for a summit meeting and a new Arab consensus are slim, Arab officials now say. Still, the chimera of a united Arab front continues to shimmer on the horizon -- and, suddenly, not just for the Arabs.
The United States has long found the Arabs' fractiousness useful in promoting bilateral peace talks and maintaining sanctions on Iraq. But now Edward Walker, the American assistant secretary of state, has been sent on a tour of Arab states that maintain relations with the United States; he is asking leaders to persuade Mr. Arafat to accept Israeli and American proposals for a final peace.
The centerpiece of those proposals is an offer of shared administration of Arab East Jerusalem, but not of sovereignty over it. So far, the public reaction to Mr. Walker's trip has been resentment that the United States seems to be calling in its chits in the Arab world.
"True, the Arab state of affairs is sufficiently dismal to foreclose a decisive pan-Arab stand on Jerusalem and the need to restore Arab sovereignty over its eastern sector," wrote Joseph Samaha, a Lebanese analyst for the international Arabic daily newspaper Al Hayat. "But it's not that bad that the Arabs will concede the loss of the city to Israel forever."
If a less fragmented Arab leadership would be helpful to Washington and Israel for the first time in a decade -- and helpful to Arabs who are nostalgic for the days when, collectively, they counted for more -- it is also much harder to nail down now.
First, the internal political and economic situation in the Arab world is more fragile than it was a decade ago, when Washington could stitch together an anti-Iraq alliance that included most Arab nations and then proceed to establish its own primacy in the region, where many countries are beggars for money and arms.
Long-serving military figures who once could simply impose their will on their people, like King Hussein of Jordan and Hafez al-Assad of Syria, are gone. The nations they left behind for their sons and successors suffer under sick economies with raging unemployment. Moreover, their heirs are still consolidating power, making them more sensitive to hints of internal discontent and to the threat, real or not, of minority extremists who criticize anything that seems to be catering to Israel or the West.
At the same time, the new cast of characters in Arab politics is theoretically more free of the constraints of history than the old.
King Hussein and President Assad, along with the assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, were warriors of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Mr. Rabin carried an aura of victory, as the former commander in the 1967 war, in which Jordan and Syria lost big chunks of territory to Israel. But their 1967 defeats, and their failure to regain either the West Bank or the Golan Heights through war or diplomacy, weighed heavily on the shoulders of the two Arab leaders.
THE history of the Syrian and Jordanian leaders also contributed mightily to the lack of Arab unity. No friends of each other, both also had hostile relations with Mr. Arafat, as did the late King Hassan of Morocco, another leader who has bequeathed a regime to his son.
While their absence from the scene could be considered helpful to peacemaking and Arab unity, the legacy they left of failing economies and ideologically rigid governments may sabotage those goals for their heirs.
"The baggage of history on their sons is just as great," said Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian foreign minister who is now president of the Jordanian Institute for Diplomacy. "That's the historical danger of Camp David. It may revive in these young leaders, who may be willing to compromise, a tendency to refreeze into rigid attitudes."
More than ever, the Arab world is also running at different speeds.
Islamic fundamentalist movements, while brutally suppressed in places like Egypt and Syria, are still alive and well elsewhere. The ruling family of Saudi Arabia feels under constant threat from extremists inside and outside the country who criticize it for the continued presence of American troops on its soil. Fundamentalist groups opposed to the Saudi policy of cool cooperation with the West send out streams of e-mails each day accusing the royals of corruption and decadence.
In Kuwait, a new alliance of Islamists and nationalists has warned the government against making contacts with Israel or Israelis. So while people in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt may yearn for the presumed economic benefits of a comprehensive peace, the domestic message to the rulers in the Gulf is far different. "Nobody here cares about the supposed economic benefits," said Ahmed al-Baghdadi, a professor of political science at Kuwait University. "In contrast, the religious movement in the National Assembly is very strong."
SO the Old City, a tiny island that contains sites holy to Islam, Christianity and Judaism, may be the one topic that can unite the Arab world.
"The place where Jesus Christ was resurrected, where Omar built his mosque, where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven -- that's not big stuff?" commented Abdel Moneim Said, director of the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. "It's in the Koran. It's in the prayers."
A number of Arab analysts warn that those concerned with the Middle East should be careful of what they wish for. Unity in the Middle East has historically been reactive: a collective "no." The Arab League was created in 1949 to organize opposition to the state of Israel. The Organization of the Islamic Conference, a broader group, was created in 1969 to focus Muslim anger at an attempt by a Christian extremist in Jerusalem to burn down Al Aksa mosque.
In the end, if a final peace settlement is the goal, the region may be better served by disunity, with each nation following its own interests and path.
"If there is a final settlement, then here in Jordan at least we hopefully can start talking about a country that is concerned about something other than the Palestinian question," said Adnan Abu Odeh, a former adviser to Jordan's King Hussein. "These days, unfortunately, the region is clouded with illusions."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 6 about efforts to achieve Arab unity misstated the date and purpose of the formation of the Arab League. A letter dated Sept. 1 from its Washington representative points out that the treaty establishing the league was signed on March 22, 1945; the date was not 1949 and the purpose was not to organize opposition to the state of Israel, which had not yet been founded. The treaty spoke only of strengthening relations among members in financial, communications, cultural, health, social, nationality and social areas.

HEADLINE: A Cautionary Tale From NewZealand

BYLINE: By Edward B. Fiske and Helen F. Ladd; Edward B. Fiske, an education consultant and a former education editor of The New York Times, and his wife, Helen F. Ladd, professor of public policy studies and economics at Duke University, spent five months in New Zealand studying its school reforms in 1998 and visited the country again recently. They are the authors of "When Schools Compete: A Cautionary Tale" (Brookings Institution Press, 2000).

DATELINE: WELLINGTON, New Zealand

 BODY:
WHEN Trevor Mallard became New Zealand's Minister of Education several months ago, one of his first steps was to bolster direct government assistance to troubled urban schools.
Although the programs he announced were hardly unusual -- more money for early-childhood education, clustering of schools with common problems, a bigger national investment in teacher training -- they were notable far beyond this island nation. The reason: they signaled the end of a decade-long flirtation with the notion that parental choice and competition among schools would, in and of themselves, improve the educational offerings of troubled urban schools. 
 "We're definitely moving away from the nonintervention approach," Mr. Mallard said in a recent interview in his office here. "Our goal is to close gaps between rich and poor schools, not widen them."
For the last 10 years, New Zealand has provided a laboratory for many of the educational theories that have become increasingly popular among would-be reformers in the United States in recent years, most notably charter schools and vouchers.
With a population of 3.8 million, New Zealand is roughly comparable to an American state, and its Ministry of Education is the functional equivalent of a state department of education in the decentralized American system. It has social, cultural and political traditions similar to those in the United States and, perhaps most important, a significant minority population.
Those minorities, Maori and Pacific Islanders, many of whom live in urban areas, make up 20 percent of the population, and schools affirm their cultures, both through the formal curriculum and through extracurricular activities and festivals.
As in the United States, success in school correlates closely with socioeconomic status. Large numbers of Maori and Pacific Island pupils come from low-income families, and their collective achievement levels are well below those of white students. At high schools -- which are called colleges -- administrators have taken steps to deal with such obstacles to learning as iron deficiency, high cholesterol rates and family violence. For example, they have created a health clinic at Tamaki College in South Auckland.
In 1989, New Zealand embarked on what is arguably the most radical overhaul of a state education system ever taken by an industrialized country. The first step was taken by a Labor government that abolished the country's heavy-handed central educational bureaucracy and turned the running of all primary and secondary schools over to locally elected boards of trustees dominated by parents.
Two years later, in 1991, a new National government committed to free-market principles added to the reform mix by giving parents the right to choose which school their children would attend. Schools that attracted more applicants than they could accommodate had considerable discretion over which ones to accept.
Under the package of reforms, known collectively as Tomorrow's Schools, the central Ministry of Education continues to fund schools, draft national curriculum guidelines and operate an accountability system under which teams from an independent Education Review Office visit schools.
Many school reformers in the United States and other developed countries see governance changes like those adopted in New Zealand as a key to improving the quality of public schools, including those serving disadvantaged students. The core argument is that if schools are freed from bureaucratic controls and forced to compete for students, they will have both the means and the incentives to become successful.
Since New Zealand has no national standardized tests, it is not possible to measure the impact of Tomorrow's Schools on student achievement. Nevertheless, it is evident that self-governance and parental choice were generally popular and that they had an energizing effect on many primary and secondary schools in middle- and upper-middle-income communities.
The Gladstone Primary School in Auckland, for example, has prospered by offering a program organized around the theory of multiple intelligences articulated by Howard Gardner, a Harvard University psychologist. "No one is restricting us," said Colin Dale, the principal. "The potential is now there to do whatever you want. It's all about meeting needs and performing. If you get it right, people will flock to you."
On the negative side, however, the educational marketplace has polarized enrollment patterns by ethnicity and seriously complicated the problems of schools serving large disadvantaged populations.
Research shows that New Zealand parents of all races judge the quality of schools in part by the ethnic mix of their students. Schools with a preponderance of European students are seen as superior to those with large numbers of Maori and Pacific Islanders. In the new educational marketplace during the 1990's, student transfers caused schools that had served predominantly white students to grow in size, while those that served large numbers of minorities saw their rolls decrease.
DATA from the Ministry of Education show, for example, that here in Wellington the proportion of Maori and Pacific Island students in primary and intermediate schools who ranked lowest in socioeconomic status increased to 84 percent from 76 percent between 1991 and 1996. A recent study by the government-supported New Zealand Council for Educational Research also reported that the intended reforms "appear to have acted in an unintended manner, which has increased ethnic polarization."
Not surprisingly, competition has produced both winners and losers. Popular schools have been able to fill their rolls with students from family backgrounds conducive to academic success, while undersubscribed schools, which by law must accept all comers, must now cope with greater concentrations of difficult-to-teach students -- those from impoverished homes, with weak English skills or with learning problems. Ministry data show that suspended students are likely to end up in a school with a higher concentration of poor and minority group students than the school from which they were suspended.
By the mid-1990's New Zealanders had come to speak of downwardly "spiraling" schools in which declining enrollments and the subsequent loss of teachers and other academic resources compound the challenges they face. A student at one such high school in Auckland, Tangaroa College, said that she dreamed of going into medicine but feared that she would not be adequately prepared. "At our school, dreams seem so far away," she said.
Market theory holds that if schools lose the capacity to attract a sufficient number of students, they will close their doors and other schools will come along to serve their students. But that shift rarely occurred in New Zealand, partly because it is politically difficult to close a school and partly because there were few
incentives for educational entrepreneurs to move in unpromising situations.
Faced with mounting political pressure to rescue troubled urban schools, the National government began in the late 1990's to look for ways to assist them. Policy makers did so reluctantly, however, knowing that under the theory of the educational marketplace, there was no justification for direct intervention.
Initial efforts centered on improving the management skills of principals in troubled schools. It soon became evident, though, that while good management was important, it was not sufficient in and of itself to turn around spiraling schools.
"With the benefit of hindsight, there was far too much optimism about what managerial reform could accomplish," said Howard Fancy, a civil servant who was secretary of education under the National government and continues in that post in the Labor-led coalition government that was sworn in last December.
The Ministry then initiated a School Improvement Project aimed at assisting struggling schools with substantial direct investment. A plan for Hilary College, a high school in Auckland, provided the equivalent of approximately $1 million for such purposes as buying out "underperforming" staff members, an anti-violence program, counseling services and new equipment. A similar plan for nearby Tangaroa College provided funds for staff buyouts, new equipment and support of a guidance clinic, a nurse, a truancy officer and a part-time sports coordinator.
The new government has vowed to strengthen the School Improvement Project. Eighteen primary, intermediate and secondary schools in a low-income and immigrant section of Auckland have now formed a coalition to address common problems, and leaders say they plan to try new approaches.
"We have to think long and hard about pedagogy," said Terry Bates, the director of a new project linking schools in Auckland.
"The teaching methods that we developed after World War II are not suitable for inner-city kids who have all kinds of interruptions in their lives that do not hinder middle-class kids," he continued. "We need to provide more one-on-one instruction. We need to find ways of using technology in ways that allow pupils to take greater control of their own learning."
The new government has taken other steps to address what it views as some of the excesses of the Tomorrow's Schools reforms. In an effort to rein in the ability of popular schools to cherry-pick easy-to-teach students, new legislation requires schools that have more applicants than they can handle to hold a lottery to determine who can enroll.
Mr. Fancy, the education secretary, pointed out that while Tomorrow's Schools had exacerbated the problems of some urban schools, many of those schools were failing well before 1989. In highlighting the negative impact that a competitive environment had on troubled schools, he suggested, the reforms had the effect of drawing public attention to their needs.
"Tomorrow's Schools has sharpened our focus on educational failure," he said. "Only now, 10 years into the reforms, are we seeing a serious effort to turn schools around."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
Hospital Chain's Critics Call Recovery Incomplete

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

 BODY:
AS he built the nation's second-largest hospital chain and achieved stellar profits in a battered industry, Jeffrey C. Barbakow, the chief executive of the Tenet Healthcare Corporation, has taken a lot of heat. Over the last seven years, people from Philadelphia to Los Angeles have watched Tenet buy their community hospitals, streamline operations and cut back on staff. Labor relations have suffered. Union leaders and some public health advocates question whether Mr. Barbakow's economizing will harm patient care, especially for the poor.
Mr. Barbakow says the financial skills he honed in a career outside the hospital business have let him improve Tenet's performance for shareholders and patients alike. But his mission now is to keep patients and employees as happy as he has Wall Street. 
 At the least, he has turned Tenet, formerly National Medical Enterprises, from one of the most scandal-ridden chains into one of the most admired among its peers and on Wall Street. Since he took over in 1993, Tenet's revenue has grown fivefold, to $11 billion a year. After four years of erratic earnings, Tenet reported a 20 percent jump in profits for the year that ended May 31, to $302 million, and its stock price has doubled in the last year.
Many analysts say they think that its days of draconian cutbacks are over. "Tenet's operating performance has been extremely good in a tough environment," said John Hindelong of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "It could help undo the damage to the reputation of for-profit hospitals."
As hospital reimbursements have shrunk, especially from Medicare, hospitals have lost either money or integrity. The nation's largest hospital chain, Columbia/HCA, paid $745 million this spring to settle the government's charges that it defrauded Medicare.
Tenet itself has problems in its history. Its predecessor, National Medical Enterprises, owned the second-largest chain of psychiatric hospitals when Mr. Barbakow became a company director in 1991. At the time, former patients contended that employees had routinely restrained and drugged them in order to loot their insurance funds. In 1993, not long after Mr. Barbakow was hired as chief executive, F.B.I. agents arrived one morning and seized company records.
Over the next two years, the company paid more than $600 million in legal settlements, agreed to install a hot line for employees to report abuses and started ethics training. In 1995, the company changed its name to Tenet and next year moved from Santa Monica, Calif., to Santa Barbara, where Mr. Barbakow already had a home.
 BUT in trying to rebuild his company, Mr. Barbakow faced employees who already suspected him of being in it only for the money. They recalled how Mr. Barbakow, a former investment banker, spent two years in the late 1980's helping Kirk Kerkorian, the financier and deal maker, sell his troubled MGM/UA Studio. Even though the sale unraveled, Mr. Barbakow pocketed $20 million. "He's a junk-bond salesman who's interested in fees," said Jorge Rodriguez, an officer of the Service Employees International Union, Local 399, of Los Angeles.
After taking over at Tenet, Mr. Barbakow shed psychiatric hospitals and focused on acute care. He also consolidated Tenet's purchasing, saving millions of dollars.
Then Mr. Barbakow acquired weaker chains, like American Medical International in 1995, and OrNda Healthcorp in 1997. He sold or closed unprofitable hospitals, some with occupancy rates as low as 20 percent.
The closings forced some patients to travel farther and required some urban hospitals to absorb more emergency room visitors.
"We often lose access to care for the people who need it most," said Dr. Michael Cousineau, a professor of health administration at the University of Southern California. "But it's part of the industry's consolidation trend." Tenet, in response, says it has increased charity care at some hospitals.
But cases of business practices run amok continue to recur. In 1998, doctors at two Tenet hospitals in California refused to give poor women epidurals to relieve their labor pains unless they each paid $400 in cash. Tenet, which confirmed the episode, reprimanded the doctors.
In St. Louis, an uninsured patient at Lutheran Medical Center, a Tenet facility, was refused a $1,250 operation in 1997 for endometriosis, a condition of the uterus that threatens fertility. Lacking the credit to qualify for even a hospital loan, she borrowed a down payment from her grandmother.
When Tenet tried to buy the prestigious St. Louis University Medical Center that year, Archbishop Justin Rigali opposed it, saying, "The poor will pay the price." Likewise, when Tenet wanted to buy the Queen of Angels/Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in California, Cardinal Roger Mahoney threatened to go to the pope.
Mr. Barbakow persevered and bought both hospitals. "You have to fight the battle every time you enter a community, and show people that you are going to do the right thing," he said.
Lately, Tenet has at times even been seen as a savior. The Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation, with eight nonprofit hospitals in Philadelphia, had lost $2.5 billion and was about to fold in 1998. Gov. Tom Ridge lobbied for Tenet's $345 million purchase, which was completed late that year. Tenet immediately began cutting expenses like golf club memberships for some Allegheny officers and trustees.
Medicare cutbacks have forced Tenet to reduce costs more broadly by laying off administrative staff, subcontracting janitorial services and selling 17 hospitals last year, leaving 110.
To achieve growth, Tenet is looking to the Internet. The company has invested $37 million in Internet start-ups, mostly related to health care, and realized $73 million in gains. "We got lucky in the beginning," Mr. Barbakow said.
Tenet was also co-founder of Broadlane.com, which hospitals can use to buy supplies, compare vendors and track orders. Not yet a year old, Broadlane, which plans to go public, has contracts with about 2,500 hospitals that buy $7 billion in supplies.
Tenet employees, however, say the company is not sharing the wealth. Earlier this year, union negotiations between Tenet and Massachusetts Nursing Association members in Worcester stalled over mandatory double shifts two times a quarter. The nurses went on strike, and Tenet hired expensive replacements.
After nearly two months, Gov. Paul Cellucci and Senator Edward M. Kennedy forced the parties back to the bargaining table. In a new contract, the nurses agreed to work some overtime, but only voluntarily. "Now, it seems that Tenet is more interested in working with us," said a union spokesman, David Schildmeier.
IN California, the nurses' union in Tenet's hospital in San Luis Obispo, formed in 1995, struck last year for the third time before winning its first contract. The nurses' union at its hospital in Palm Springs picketed this year and won 3 percent raises. "Tenet consistently prolongs negotiations, provokes nurses into striking and refuses to have discussions with us about patient care," said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses Association. "It's almost their policy."
Mr. Barbakow, however, says that keeping his staff satisfied and productive is his top priority. "Now we need to make sure that all of our employees are doing the best possible jobs, that they're happy and they focus on quality and service," he said. "Everything else flows from that." He cites new management training for supervisors and an online educational system that employees can use to obtain degrees from Tenet's many academic hospitals.
Employees, however, are no longer willing to accept Tenet's contention that it cannot afford to give them more control and better pay. Despite the Medicare cutbacks, Tenet is doing so well that Mr. Barbakow, besides receiving $1.8 million in compensation last year, also received stock options worth $26 million. His pay has become a target for union leaders and public health advocates. It is a sensitive topic for Mr. Barbakow, who dismisses the required calculations of his options' value as unfair because they vest over three years, and adds, "It's embarrassing."
But Mr. Barbakow works in an industry in which an embarrassment of riches is hard to find these days.

HEADLINE: New Economy;
The response to Deutsche Telekom's bid for VoiceStream brings into focus an unwritten tenet of U.S. trade policy.

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma 

 BODY:
IT used to be that the way America threw around its military might was what perturbed our allies. Now, it seems, it's the way we do business that rankles.
A perfect example surfaced late last month when Washington got into tiffs with two of the United States' most important trading partners, and very nearly a third, over what could be called the corn syrup corollary. 
 This unwritten tenet of United States economic policy goes basically as follows: "Do as I say, not as I do."
The corollary refers specifically to the 1993 negotiations that led to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Worried that sugar produced in Mexico's ancient refineries would flood the United States, an inventive Congress decided to count corn syrup as sugar in determining the level of Mexican sugar exports that would trigger tariffs.
This verbal alchemy came at a time when President Clinton was badgering Mexico to drop its own trade barriers. Mexico's economy is one-twentieth the size of America's, and Mexicans resented what they saw as pure protectionist posturing. But they felt they had no choice but to enter Nafta. The United States sugar lobby was happy, even though as recently as this month it has continued to lobby against Mexican exports.
The corn-syrup-for-sugar swap set a pattern that has dismayed allies and trading partners alike. Consider the European Union, which has been in high dudgeon since late July when the United States Senate threatened to block Deutsche Telekom's $50.7 billion acquisition of a rookie American cellular telephone company, the Voice Stream Wireless Corporation.
The United States Senate is concerned about Deutsche Telekom's family tree. The German government still owns about 58 percent of the giant telecommunications company, which was totally state controlled until 1996. Several key senators worry that any company even partially owned by a foreign government would have unfair competitive advantages when it comes to raising capital. They also have concerns about national security.
But the VoiceStream deal would reduce the German government's stake in Deutsche Telekom to 45 percent, and the company says that the government stake will continue to dwindle through subsequent acquisitions or through government sell-off of its shares.
For their part, the Germans suspect the United States is trying to shield its domestic telecommunications industry. They are backed by their cohort in the European Union, who say that restrictions against Deutsche Telekom violate commitments the United States made to the World Trade Organization a few years ago to keep its telecommunications market open to all. The European Union has threatened to retaliate.
Riordan Roett, a corporate consultant and director of the Western Hemisphere program at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said the reason for the contradictions in United States economic policy was "as simple as catering to special interests," with little regard to the effect such zigzags have on the nation's trading partners.
"In their night of nights, in the dark of their dark, they probably understand what they're doing in Washington," Professor Roett said. "On a case-by-case basis, they rationalize this strategy by saying they are defending U.S. interests from the dark forces that come from outside. They say they don't see the contradictions in that position, but they have to."
To clear things up, those Beltway insiders probably should take a second look at what happened at the end of the same week sabers were rattled against Deutsche Telekom. A few days later, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and President Clinton's enforcer on international commerce, took the first steps toward hauling Mexico before the World Trade Organization.
The charge? Well, looky here: Failing to live up to commitments Mexico made to the W.T.O. to keep its telecommunications sector open to competition. The same charge, in other words, that the Europeans are making against the United States.
In this case, it seems clear that Ms. Barshefsky is carrying water for big American telecommunications companies that are fighting for market share in Mexico, while key members of Congress are trying to ward off Deutsche Telekom in the United States market.
AT&T and WorldCom accuse Mexican regulators of being soft on Telefonos de Mexico, which, like Deutsche Telekom, is a former state-owned monopoly. They say that as Mexico's telecommunications sector has been deregulated -- partly because of Nafta -- Telefonos de Mexico continues to dominate the market.
Ms. Barshefsky said there was no doubt Telmex was thwarting competition by greatly overcharging for connections to the local grid and refusing to provide the high-speed lines that competing companies need to offer Internet services.
"The situation is intolerable," she said rather testily during a conference call with reporters to announce the action against Mexico.
Mexico now must explain itself before the W.T.O., and if the problems cannot be resolved, Ms. Barshefsky will file a formal complaint against Mexico, which is the United States' second-largest trading partner after Canada.
Mexico insists it has met all its commitments to the W.T.O. Jorge Nicolin, director of the Federal Telecommunications Commission of Mexico, said Ms. Barshefsky was protecting the interests of American companies, not the principles of free trade.
In the same week, the United States offended the Europeans and angered the Mexicans, the corn syrup corollary was invoked by yet another United States ally. At a hearing before the subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere of the House Committee on International Relations, Brazil's ambassador reminded United States officials that globalization and free trade were not a one-way street.
"Reciprocity is the name of the game," said Rubens Antonio Barbosa, the ambassador.
Despite Washington's avowal that free trade is the foundation of prosperity and peace, Mr. Barbosa told the panel, an arsenal of trade barriers impedes the entrance of 80 major Brazilian products -- including sugar, shoes, steel and frozen orange juice -- into the United States.
The list of American barriers he rattled off is formidable: "Tariff peaks, retaliatory threats, antidumping and countervailing measures, quotas, safeguards, voluntary restriction agreements, restrictive technical norms, sanitary and phytosanitary measures and increasing domestic subsidies."
The ambassador wondered out loud how the United States could defend such a battery of trade restrictions while pushing for the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the year 2005.
The answer, if anyone were willing to give it, would sound a lot like the corn syrup corollary.

U.S. Echoes Europeans In a Phone Market Fight
While the European Union contends that opposition by American lawmakers to Deutsche Telekom's $50.7 billion offer for VoiceStream Wireless violates commitments the United States made to the World Trade Organization to keep its telecommunications market open, the United States is making similar arguments against Mexico.
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, says there is no doubt that Telefonos de Mexico, the former state-owned monopoly, is thwarting competition and that Mexico is thus not living up to its W.T.O. commitments. New Economy. Page C5.
 
Government's Business Goes Online
Now that the only Year 2000 disaster has turned out to be the stock prices of dot-com businesses, Internet executives and federal bureaucrats are taking a much closer look at each other. Thanks to the Year 2000 scare, the government is much smarter about information technology systems and processes, and it is directing that knowledge to Internet purchasing efforts. Internet companies, meanwhile, are looking for any market that can deliver revenue and keep their businesses afloat. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. C13. 

'Big Brother' Host Seeks Credibility
The appointment of Julie Chen, the news reader on "The Early Show," as a host of the reality program "Big Brother" on CBS touched off a renewed debate over whether the lines between network news and entertainment were becoming too blurred. Now, executives close to the program say, Ms. Chen is doing what she can to maintain her stature as a newscaster, fighting with "Big Brother" scriptwriters, who have been handing her lines that are hardly the stuff of news people.

Rival Has Money Manager's Name
Even though Thomas F. Marsico, a money manager at Janus Capital, left three years ago, his domain name has found its way back to his old employer. The name tommarsico.com was registered by James P.

Newscasts Tailored for Individuals
A handful of Web sites are offering users television-style news reports on the Internet, in digestible bits that can be put together into personalized newscasts.

HEADLINE: Argentina Searches Its Soul Over a Suicide

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 6

 BODY:
It has been more than a week since Rene G. Favaloro, Argentina's most esteemed surgeon and a pioneer in the heart bypass operation, committed suicide. But the outpouring of grief seems to be compounding day by day, opening a channel of despair so profound that Argentines are raising the deepest of questions about themselves and their country.
As wreaths of flowers pile up in front of Dr. Favaloro's research foundation, newspapers are publishing extra columns of letters to the editor in a deluge of long, sorrowful and often bitter diatribes blaming the entire society for the suicide. Dr. Favaloro's photograph is on covers of magazines filled with details of the suicide and theorizing by Argentine writers about what Dr. Favaloro's death means. There has been blanket television coverage showing pictures of his life along with recordings of the most doleful tangos. 
 Argentines -- and especially Portenos, as residents of this capital are known -- are among the most psychoanalyzed people in the world. Depression is a topic of everyday conversation of people of all classes, and Argentines are not shy about airing complaints, from the weather to the pressures of their jobs. Funerals and cemeteries are elaborate, and suicide is not uncommon.
But there is something so distinctive about Dr. Favaloro's suicide that it goes beyond the national fixation with neurosis and death. Some analysts say that the national mourning could be just the epiphany Argentines need to kick themselves out of their lethargy and the long decline the nation has suffered since its economic and cultural heyday in the 1920's.
Ernesto Sabato, the Argentine novelist, noted that it was profoundly tragic that one of Argentina's most creative sons would feel so "desperate and impotent" that he would end his own life. But he added, "I ask myself if this sadness that is draining all of us might just jolt us out of our inertia. Perhaps that was his final wish."
Such thinking may well be wishful in the extreme, an example of what one newspaper article today characterized as an Argentine propensity to swing from despair to euphoria.
The talk of Buenos Aires's smoke-filled cafes these days is about how Dr. Favaloro's death is just one more symptom of a country in which a deep two-year recession has ravaged the middle class, forcing the best and brightest to line up at the American, Spanish and Brazilian embassies seeking visas letting them find work elsewhere. It has also spurred a debate about health care in Argentina, and how the country does not put enough resources into scientific research.
In an essay entitled "The Sad Land of Psychoanalysis and Tango," published today in La Nacion, the country's most prestigious newspaper, Dr. Favaloro's death was linked to a deep national melancholy. "Millions of Argentines, trapped by unemployment and recession, are confronting an insecure future with anguish," Claudio Ivan Remeseira wrote in the essay. "The death of Rene Favaloro marked a transcendent moment in this climate of frustrated expectations."
Meanwhile President Fernando de la Rua was put on the defensive by reports that the surgeon had sent him a letter crying out for help just days before he shot himself in the chest. It was more than awkward, and some said it was heartless, when the presidential palace put out a statement early last week denying that the government was to blame.
The 77-year-old heart surgeon had a rags-to-riches life story. The son of a seamstress and a carpenter who grew up in the provincial city of La Plata, Dr. Favaloro became one of the world's best known doctors. He developed a technique for heart bypass surgery while working in a clinic in Cleveland in the 1960's. He returned to Argentina and started a foundation dedicated to heart transplants and research that is among the most important medical centers in South America. Beloved and respected, he was repeatedly mentioned over the years as a possible presidential candidate. But along with the Argentine economy, the Favaloro Foundation has fallen on hard times in recent years.
Dr. Favaloro's body was found by his brother and secretary in a bathroom of his apartment in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo on July 29 with a .38-caliber pistol beside him. No foul play has been suggested, but his suicide immediately stirred controversy.
For the past week, the news media have reported that the Favaloro Foundation was being sued by the government because it was behind in paying social security contributions to its employees at a time when the government reportedly owed the foundation a more substantial amount of money for unpaid services to a public retirement institute.
The government suit was disclosed by a federal judge, Julio Cruciani,, who bitterly complained that "this is a country that comes down hard on people who are doers."
The political magazine 3 Puntos commented on its cover, "The suicide of Rene Favaloro has hammered Argentine society like some special crime committed by an inefficient and corrupt state."
President de la Rua's handling of the suicide has been criticized as clumsy and is at least in part fueling the hand-wringing.
The president responded to the news of the suicide by decreeing that the nation was in mourning. But over the following days, the Argentine press reported that before his death Dr. Favaloro made a desperate appeal to the president to help him solicit financial support for his foundation from the business community. Mr. de la Rua said he received the letter only a day before the suicide.
"The government has no guilt to wash off its hands nor does it want to enter the debate over whether or not someone is to blame," Jorge de la Rua, the president's brother and chief of staff, was quoted by local newspapers as saying.
And the author Tomas Eloy Martinez wrote: "It would be unjust to attribute to the government of Fernando de la Rua the responsibility for these tragedies -- the emigration of so many young people, the worsening poverty, the suicide of an exceptional scientist. But all these things are alarming symptoms that we cannot pretend not to see."

HEADLINE: America in the World

 BODY:
These are heady yet baffling times for the world's sole superpower. Less than a decade after the demise of the Soviet Union, the United States is a military and economic colossus. No nation in history has possessed the wealth, military might or technological edge over its rivals that America has today. Yet as the presidential campaign enters its final months, the country seems uncertain about its role and perplexed by the changing array of threats that it faces. There should be vigorous debate about these matters in the days ahead, starting with an assessment of America's critical national interests.
There are clear and important differences between Gov. George W. Bush and and Vice President Al Gore on Russia, China, missile defenses and other pressing issues. We intend to return to some of these matters as the campaign unfolds. But specific policies cannot be developed or evaluated in isolation. They should flow from principles that reflect the nation's core values and interests. 
 It is harder today than during the cold war to define American interests and to determine how best to defend them. Contamination of the world's air and water or a currency crisis in Asia can threaten American security as much as a fleet of Russian bombers. The free flow of information across national borders may be a more potent force for advancing democracy than dispatch of American aircraft carriers to a distant sea.
Still, some core national interests remain unchanged. The physical defense of America's territory, people and economic lifelines is paramount. The Pentagon can safely eliminate thousands of nuclear weapons left over from the cold war, but must maintain enough to discourage attack. America also needs highly trained and mobile military forces, adequately paid and equipped with advanced weaponry. Washington must also guard against international terrorist groups. Effective intelligence gathering is an essential first line of defense. Washington should provide adequate financing for these purposes, but spending must be based on realistic needs, not inflated threat assessments or parochial Congressional interests.
In the absence of a powerful enemy like the Soviet Union, the country has found itself with few established guidelines to decide when military intervention abroad is warranted. Clearly, self-defense and the protection of allies and economic lifelines are reasons to use force, as Washington did when oil supplies were endangered by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
But as recent upheavals in Africa and the Balkans have shown, ethnic conflicts can escalate to imperil the stability of an entire region, and genocidal attacks on civilians sometimes can be stopped only by outside force. Washington should consider intervening in such conflicts if it is clear that force can make a difference and sufficient military resources are available to assure success, the case in Kosovo.
As the last decades of the 20th century showed, the defense of American security is no longer primarily defined by sending military forces into combat. The United States is uniquely suited to encourage peacemaking in troubled regions like the Middle East. President Clinton has used American influence constructively in the Middle East and Northern Ireland, and his successor should continue the work he has begun. It may also be appropriate, as in Bosnia, to send American troops overseas to serve as peacekeepers once warring parties have laid down their arms and agreed to a peace accord.
Today, the country's security and prosperity are connected to the global movement of goods, capital, information and people. Keeping these channels of commerce and technology open can be as important as defending a foreign border. Washington should advance these interests through trade agreements that lower barriers to imports and investment. But the preservation of a stable global economic order, a vital American interest, cannot be accomplished without spreading prosperity's benefits more fairly. Three billion people, or half the world's population, live on less than $2 a day. Bettering their lives requires more effective governance, increased private investment and expanded access to education and health care.
America also makes its own democracy more secure by promoting democracy elsewhere. The evolution of Russia and China into enduring democratic states would make the world a far safer place and erase two of the greatest potential threats to American security. Encouraging democracy and the rule of law in these nations should be among the primary goals of the next president.
Protecting health and the environment are central American interests. Epidemics and climate change know no borders. Strong environmental treaties and efforts to make medicines more widely available must be a high priority for Washington.
Once Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore engage foreign policy, they should spell out their thoughts about these broad national interests. Mr. Bush has so far taken the more creative approach to the question of nuclear weapons reductions. Mr. Gore has been more forward looking on environmental issues and has shown a more nuanced appreciation of the role American troops could play in halting regional conflicts. But the debate between them has not moved much beyond rhetorical flourishes. Voters deserve a serious discussion of how this country's power should be used to advance the global interests of its people.

Bush's Education Record

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Whenever George W. Bush talks about his achievements as governor of Texas, the item at the top of his list is education reform, especially the remarkable improvement in test scores by the state's public school students.
In his acceptance speech Thursday night, he told the party's delegates, "We improved our schools dramatically, for children of every accent, of every background." 
 His wife, Laura, in her address to the convention last Monday, said, "The highly respected nonpartisan Rand study released just last week found that education reforms in Texas have resulted in some of the highest achievement gains in the country among all racial, socioeconomic and family backgrounds."
That happened, she said, "because George led the way" by focusing state money and the attention of the schools on reading.
Well, not exactly. George W. has done some nice work with the school system in Texas, but he can't legitimately claim much of the credit for the gains documented by the Rand study. The dramatic improvements in the public schools in Texas were the result of years of hard work and big spending that not only predated Mr. Bush, but were inspired and organized by none other than H. Ross Perot.
The Rand Corporation study was a state by state analysis of scores from standardized tests that were given in math and reading from 1990 through 1996. The study found that the most important components in raising student achievement appeared to be smaller class sizes in early grades, widespread access to prekindergarten classes and improved classroom working conditions for teachers.
The study compared scores from one state to another by students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds and found that youngsters in Texas did especially well. "Texas," the report said, "was in the highest group of states and California in the lowest on scores for students from similar families."
The problem with George Bush taking credit for this achievement in the years 1990 through 1996 is that he did not become governor until 1995. And, as the authors of the report have made clear, it takes several years for students to realize the benefits from the kinds of reforms in place in Texas. Improved test scores in the fourth and eighth grades, for example, come from students who were part of the reform effort when they started school.
The gains in Texas were no accident. When Mark White was governor back in the 1980's, he got Ross Perot to lead an educational reform effort that led to both smaller classes and the most extensive public school prekindergarten program in the nation. This was no altruistic initiative. It was in response to a lawsuit.
Mr. Perot's effort also led to a re-allocation of school spending, with more money being used for disadvantaged students. Thanks to Mr. White and Mr. Perot, Texas found itself approaching the vanguard of education reform. When Ann Richards was governor in the early 90's, she expanded the original effort and offered some new initiatives.
While George W. Bush had little or nothing to do with the gains reported in the Rand study, he has maintained his state's focus on education reform. He was responsible for a reading initiative that is widely admired and he has not undermined the reforms he inherited.
The problem for Mr. Bush, if he is thinking about the improvements he could bring to public schools nationwide if he becomes president, is the fact that both he and his party are opposed to federal assistance for the very programs that have meant so much in Texas -- smaller class size and prekindergarten programs.
David Grissmer, the lead author of the Rand study, believes substantial help from the federal government is essential. He noted that after adjustments for inflation, some states spend as much as $9,000 per pupil per year, while others spend as little as $4,000.
You can't have smaller classes in the early grades, and expanded pre school, and more classroom tools for teachers without an infusion of additional resources from somewhere.
The federal government, in this era of plenty, could lend a much-needed hand to school systems across the country. To get that done, Mr. Bush and the Republicans would have to do a pretty neat philosophical shift.

HEADLINE: With 3 Indian Tribes Vying in Catskills, Casino Is in Doubt

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Four months after the federal Interior Department approved plans for an Indian casino in Monticello, N.Y., three separate developers with three different tribes are battling to bring gambling to the Catskills.
Unfortunately, none of the three are the same team of developer and tribe approved by the Interior Department. And, after decades of futility, many proponents are becoming increasingly worried that their best shot at bringing casinos to the Catskills may be on the brink of slipping away. 
 "I think the window of opportunity is closing," said Anthony P. Cellini, supervisor of the Town of Thompson in Sullivan County. "I think people are getting sick and tired of being promised something that comes and goes, comes and goes. There's a lot going on here, but it's all contingent on gambling."
Many residents were counting on casinos to provide thousands of jobs and bring back the tourists who until the 1970's used to flock to the now crumbling hotels and bungalow colonies scattered across the wooded mountains. With the prospect of gambling, politically connected developers have been buying property in the area in recent years.
But Rusty Pomeroy, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature, said he feared that a proposed performing arts center and redevelopment of the Laurels and Concord resorts might not work without gambling to draw newcomers to the area.
"A casino is the engine that helps drive the economy for the rest of the tourism industry in the county," Mr. Pomeroy said.
Last April, the Interior Department approved a four-year-old proposal by the St. Regis Mohawks and a company, Catskill Development, to build a $500 million casino on 30 acres at Monticello Raceway, about 90 miles northwest of New York City. Although casinos are illegal in New York, a federal law would permit gambling on sovereign Indian land.
But eight days after gaining federal approval, the Mohawk tribal council spurned Catskill Development and signed a secret agreement with Arthur M. Goldberg, chief executive of Park Place Entertainment, the world's largest casino company. The tribe granted Park Place the rights to develop and manage tribal casinos in New York in return for a $3 million loan for the Mohawks' small, nearly bankrupt casino on the Canadian border. Former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Mr. Goldberg's adviser at the time who also knew the Mohawk chiefs, played an important role in securing the deal.
Mr. Goldberg then announced plans to build a huge casino-resort with the Mohawks at the old Kutsher's resort, about five miles away from the racetrack. Mr. Goldberg discovered, however, that he could not simply transfer the federal approval from the track to Kutsher's. Federal officials, flabbergasted by the turnabout, said it would take more than two years for a new application to wend its way through the approval process.
It was a stunning move by a corporate executive who had been warning shareholders that a Catskill casino would cut into the profits of the company's gambling operations in Atlantic City. At least initially, local officials, as well as Senator Charles E. Schumer, regarded Mr. Goldberg as an interloper who secretly wanted to scuttle the project to protect his interests in New Jersey.
Furious about the last-minute sabotage, Robert A. Berman and the other partners in Catskill Development refused to meet with Mr. Goldberg, leaving one side with an approved site and the other with an approved tribe. In May, Gov. George E. Pataki, whose approval is needed for any Indian casino deal, said he would not make a decision on the Sullivan County proposal until the dust cleared.
"Each side has something the other needs," Senator Schumer said. "I'm trying to get both sides together. My goal is to bring gaming to this area, which needs it."
A third proposal surfaced recently about 10 miles south of Monticello in Mamakating, where a group has been quietly negotiating to build a casino-resort on a 720-acre parcel owned by Crescent Heights Investments, a development company. According to two people involved in the talks, Crescent Heights has been meeting with David Flaum, a developer from Rochester, and Len Wolman, managing partner of a gambling company owned in part by Sun International, about building a casino-resort with the Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohicans. The tribal band, which is based in Wisconsin, has a 24,000-acre land claim in central New York.
The proposal got a warm reception from officials in Mamakating, but the prospective partners hit a snag in mid-July. The three sides resumed negotiations recently but may work with a different tribe. One person involved in the project said MGM, another gambling company, had expressed interest in a casino.
Still, the future of that proposal is cloudy. It is part of the continuing battle between Catskill Development and Park Place that has received the most attention in Sullivan County. Local political leaders say they now fear that the prospects for a casino are dimming. There will be a new president in Washington next year, and many of the pro-gambling officials at the Bureau of Indian Affairs are leaving the agency. Some politicians in Albany are also expected to resubmit a bill requiring legislative approval of any Indian casino, making any gambling project, proponents said, highly unlikely.
In recent months, Mr. Goldberg has spent an enormous amount of time successfully convincing officials like Mr. Cellini, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Pomeroy that he truly intends to build a major resort. The profits he would make from a casino in the Catskills, he has said, would more than offset the loss of revenues in Atlantic City.
Mr. Berman, in turn, met for months with leaders of the Cayuga tribe, which has a 64,000-acre land claim in central New York, about building a casino at the track. As they talked with John F. O'Mara, Mr. Pataki's chief negotiator on Indian land claims, the outline of a deal came together: The state would give the Cayugas $130 million to settle their land claims and allow the tribe to buy about 10,000 acres in their ancestral lands, according to documents that circulated among the three parties.
The Pataki administration would also approve a Cayuga casino at Monticello Raceway, while the tribe agreed to revenue-sharing and to work out a tax arrangement. But shortly before the Cayugas went back to court in Syracuse on July 17 for their land claim, state officials suddenly broke off all contact. A jury had already awarded the tribe $37 million in damages and Judge Neal McCurn of Federal District Court is now determining whether to increase the award to as much as $1 billion.
"The deal was done," said Martin Gold, a lawyer for the Cayugas, "but it's nowhere now. The state walked away."
Mr. O'Mara did not return telephone calls requesting comment.
"The state's inaction is disappointing," Mr. Berman said. "It's a question of leadership; it requires the governor's intervention."
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said there had been discussions with a number of different Indian nations. "Talks are ongoing," he said.
In recent weeks, Mr. Goldberg has told local officials that he would be able to obtain federal approval within 11 months for a proposal to transfer land at the Kutsher's resort to the Mohawks for a $500 million to $750 million resort and casino on 66 acres, Mr. Cellini said. And Clive Cummis, general counsel for Park Place, said his company expected to file the application with the Interior Department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the next 45 days.
But federal officials said it was unlikely that Park Place's application would be completed within a year. "That's optimistic and not in keeping with our previous record on these matters," said Kevin Gover, the assistant secretary for Indian affairs at the Interior Department. "Traditionally, it's taken two to three years on a new application."
The project could lose momentum during that time, so Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cellini and Mr. Goldberg have prevailed on Mr. Berman's group to sit down with Park Place officials to work out a deal for at least a temporary casino at the racetrack.
"We're still hoping that the two parties can find a way to resolve their differences and move forward with a project at the Monticello Raceway," Mr. Pomeroy said.
But Joseph Bernstein, a partner in Catskill Development, said that even if his group did agree to meet with Mr. Goldberg, they could not trust the man who he said had stolen their project. If they do not work out a deal with another tribe, he said, Catskill Development will sue Park Place.
"They thought it was checkmate," Mr. Bernstein said. "Now, it's stalemate. The question now is: Who's the knight who's going to save the day?
"Our case against Park Place is worth more than a casino. We either get the Cayugas or go to court. There's no way you can do a deal with a guy who stabbed you in the back."
Mr. Cummis, who has known Mr. Bernstein for nearly 15 years, said he was surprised at the harsh words.
"Any businessman dealing from a rational basis would want to sit down with someone on the other side to find out our position," Mr. Cummis said. "Even the Arabs and the Israelis met."

Exegesis of Acceptance

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The well-accepted acceptance speech of George W. Bush is worthy of an exegete's eye.
Most moving and evocative passage: In his visit to a jail for juveniles in Marlin, Tex., when a 15-year-old inmate asked him, "What do you think of me?", Bush perceptively interpreted the question to mean, "Do you, a white man in a suit, really care what happens to me?" He drew on John Donne's no-man-is-an-island philosophy to decry the imprisoning wall of indifference separating rich and poor, ambitious and despairing. Bush had alluded earlier to the Berlin Wall that had come down "with the leadership of Presidents Reagan and Bush." He then connected the metaphor of the jailed juvenile to Ronald Reagan's words in cold-war Berlin: we must "tear down that wall." 
 Most subtle play on discomfort of many Democrats with the current president: He quoted Robert Frost, the poet older Americans remember speaking in the cold at John F. Kennedy's inauguration, of the dream of the nation's founders "to occupy the land with character." That reminder set up Bush's observation that "a president himself must be responsible," significantly followed by his pledge to "uphold the honor and dignity of the office," which most voters believe Clinton failed to do.
Most adept plays on phrases of previous presidents: Although Al Gore now leads F.D.R.'s party, "the only thing he has to offer is fear itself." Bush had already improved on Clinton's phrase "the tyranny of low expectations" with his own "the soft bigotry of low expectations" and drove it home again in his acceptance.
Most useful verb to deride the opposition's misuse of only-superpower status and economic boom: "Instead of seizing this moment, the Clinton-Gore administration has squandered it." This word, of unknown origin but more mouth-filling than "waste," should become a staple of Bush rhetoric.
Most unexpected use of a code phrase to take an unequivocal stand: "I will lead our nation toward a culture that values . . . the life of the unborn." This definition of the fetus as alive, which is unequivocally anti-abortion, showed the depths of his pro-life belief and the nonpolitical reason for his refusal to modify the G.O.P.'s extreme anti-abortion platform plank. It also gave millions of Republican women clear reason to vote for his opponent, which I suppose shows his confidence in holding his lead.
Most uneven credo: This series of sentences beginning with "I believe," summing up the speaker's core beliefs, both soared and stumbled. "I believe in a God who calls us, not to judge our neighbors, but to love them" was especially welcomed by gays, and there was tasteful eloquence in "I believe in grace, because I have seen it, in peace, because I have felt it, in forgiveness, because I have needed it." But to cap this with "And I believe this will be a tough race, down to the wire" was demeaning.
On the debit side, more on substance than style:
Running against Washington. The Yale graduate and child of privilege assumed, Jimmy Carter style, a hardscrabble pose to assert that his "background may lack the polish of Washington." And then, following a focus-group distaste for controversy, he dissociated himself from all investigations into Clinton-Gore scandals, including illegal fund-raising: "I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years." Republicans on the unpopular ramparts of the rule of law were coolly informed he preferred "civility and respect."
Oversimplifying foreign and defense policy. "When America uses force in the world, the cause must be just, the goal must be clear and the victory must be overwhelming." This is the old Weinberger-Powell doctrine, and had it been applied in the Balkans would have awarded Kosovo to Slobodan Milosevic. If Bush becomes president, that all-or-nothing policy sentence -- denying limited intervention -- will come back to haunt him.
Feeble labeling. "It is a time for new beginnings. . . . I believe America is ready for a new beginning." We are readier for new sloganeering; Bush's "New Beginning" will go over as thunderously as Clinton's "New Covenant."
Gore has put out word that he is composing his own acceptance. Welcome to the world of speechwriting, Al; the nonpartisan blades of exegesis go snicker-snack.

HEADLINE: VERIZON WORKERS FORM PICKET LINES AS TALKS CONTINUE

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Thousands of workers fanned out to picket sites throughout the East yesterday as negotiators for Verizon Communications and its unions pressed forward with efforts to end a strike by about 86,000 telephone employees.
While hardly affecting routine services, the labor dispute at Verizon, the nation's largest local and wireless telephone company, disrupted operator-assisted services, repairs and installations for 25 million residential and business customers from Maine to Virginia. More broadly, the strike, over issues including the outsourcing of work and the unionization of employees in the wireless business, may help define the role of organized labor in some of the most rapidly growing high-technology industries. 
 "This could open the door for unions to move not only into wireless but into other high-tech parts of the economy as well," said Paul Osterman, professor of management at M.I.T.
Verizon was able to limit the immediate impact of the strike by deploying about 30,000 managers to cover tasks normally performed by the striking employees, who walked off the job at 12:01 a.m. yesterday. Automated services on Verizon's network and wireless services were not disrupted. But delays in repairs and operator-assisted services could become more common as the workweek begins.
While members of the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers picketed at several hundred Verizon facilities in several Eastern cities, there was progress in the talks in Washington.
Late Saturday night, Verizon offered concessions that would allow the unions to organize more easily in the company's fast-growing wireless division, a central bargaining issue that could have a substantial effect on labor relations in the entire wireless communications industry, said people close to the talks.
Verizon (pronounced va-RISE-en) was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE and its venture in wireless communications with Vodafone AirTouch. Though it operates the nation's largest wireless carrier, only a few dozen of the wireless company's 32,000 workers are union members, compared with 80 percent of the 120,000 employees in Verizon's local telephone division.
But even as the company and the unions approached compromise on the wireless issue, on job security and on Verizon's practice of outsourcing work in fast-growing areas like the installation of high-speed Internet lines, they appeared to be far apart on other issues last evening.
According to a spokeswoman from the Communications Workers of America, the unions and the company remained most divided over forced overtime and job stress.
Neither side appeared optimistic that an agreement could be reached late yesterday, although the unions and Verizon said they were ready to continue negotiations into the morning if necessary.
Meanwhile, striking workers in 13 Eastern states and Washington, dug in for a walkout.
"My wife and I figured it out: three days," said Roger Doucette, 53, when asked how long he could afford to be on strike from his job as a trainer at a Verizon service center in Braintree, Mass.
But he said he was ready to strike as long as necessary, given his particular concern over the company's policy of outsourcing work in the installation of high-speed Internet lines.
In New York City, only a scattering of union members could be found at Verizon facilities, perhaps because of the progress in the talks. At the company's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, six protesters, clad in red for union solidarity, stood behind police barricades.
"We're not trying to sabotage. We just want more money," said Shirley Harris, 33, an administrative assistant. "It's very expensive to live in New York."
In other cities, the strike generated greater tension between workers and management.
In Pennsylvania, striking employees blockaded entrances to Verizon's main switching facility in Philadelphia, effectively keeping managers from entering the building. In Delaware, some strikers also blocked access to facilities. The company was seeking court injunctions to deal with these cases, said Eric Rabe, Verizon's spokesman.
Only about 740 union workers out of 3,100 scheduled to work in the strike region yesterday showed up. Most of those were in New Jersey and not covered under the same contract as the striking workers, according to Verizon.
Managers were expected to work 12-hour shifts to provide stopgap service while the strike continued.
"After a while I'll probably get tired of this," said Stephenne L. Bell, who normally does budget tracking analysis in Verizon's marketing and communications department. On Sunday, she was working a 5:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. shift at a customer service center in Washington.
In the Bronx, where about 2,500 telephone lines were put out of service yesterday because of a cut line, Verizon said repairs could be delayed because of the walkout.
In New York City, Verizon deals with an average of 2,600 requests for telephone installations and 4,500 requests for repairs each day, said Steven Marcus, a spokesman for the company.
As the company moved to handle potential service problems and talks continued, the negotiations were of particular interest to employees in Verizon's largely nonunionized wireless division.
"I'm tired of being treated like a second-class citizen within the company," said a customer service representative from a call center in Woburn, Mass. She declined to provide her name, she said, because Verizon had told employees at the call center that they would be fired if they discussed joining the union on work premises.
"With a union contract, I'd have chances for better pay," she said.
According to the union, customer service representatives at Verizon's wireless unit who are not union members in Massachusetts make about a third less than unionized employees who do virtually the same job in other parts of the company. The company says pay differences are much smaller than what the union contends.
The union is seeking assurances from Verizon that the company will not interfere with or actively discourage organizing activities at the wireless division, making it easier for the union to sign up employees. Because Verizon Wireless controls nearly 30 percent of the wireless market, the outcome of the strike could affect labor relations throughout the wireless industry.
"If labor can't penetrate the new economy, they will be assigned to its margins," said Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New York. Mr. Aronowitz compared the situation to union efforts in the 1930's to organize in the automotive and steel industries.
"They are going after the biggie with the idea that the others will fall in line," he said.
Nearly all of the striking workers are from former Bell Atlantic divisions. Employees at old GTE units are not involved in the walkout, although the communication workers' union said the strike might prompt walkouts by 1,200 workers at former GTE operations in Kentucky and North Carolina, where separate contracts have expired.

To the Editor:
Universities in New York certainly need to be more aggressive in licensing and selling their intellectual property, following the successes of Columbia University (news article, Aug. 2). Yet there is a larger strategic goal for our region as a whole, and it's one that Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio need to emphasize. The region should exploit its scientific and technological assets far more effectively than it does in order to achieve real economic growth. 
 New York, New Jersey and Connecticut can be competitive in national and global markets only when their universities see themselves as part of the regional economy. Evidence from around the world shows that academic excellence and entrepreneurial verve must be fused to accelerate economic development.

It Takes a World Wide Web to Raise a Village

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Overlooked in last month's Group of 8 discussions about the challenge of a growing "digital divide" between the information rich and the data deprived was the work of Bernard Krisher, a 69-year-old former journalist who is trying to bring the Internet to one of the poorest regions in Asia.
Most recently, Mr. Krisher's nonprofit group, American Assistance for Cambodia, has been toiling to create a permanent Internet connection to a primary school in the village of Robib, a cluster of six rural communities in north central Cambodia, more than a nine-hour drive from Phnom Penh. On Monday, the group plans to announce that it has succeeded. 
 The Internet link is being provided at no charge by Shin Satellite in neighboring Thailand. By placing the village directly on the Internet, Mr. Krisher, an American who worked as an Asia correspondent for Newsweek for decades, says he hopes to assist in the economic transformation of a region of Cambodia in which the average per capita income is about $37 a year.
In addition to providing computer education and Web access to a village school attended by 400 young students, the Internet project is supporting the creation of a small woven-silk industry in the village, which plans to sell silk scarves and table runners on the Internet. Once production begins, Mr. Krisher said, it might be possible to generate as much as $2,000 a month in revenue.
"We're trying to show that the Internet can really help a single village," said Mr. Krisher, whose nonprofit group is based in Tokyo, where he lives. "If this is copied elsewhere around the world it might help eliminate the digital divide."
Though the effort is on a small scale, Nicholas Negroponte, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer scientist who is also engaged in the effort to aid Cambodian villages, said the project demonstrated that the global impact of the Internet could ultimately serve to reverse the disparity between urban wealth and rural poverty.
"The Net will reverse urbanization," said Mr. Negroponte, director of the M.I.T. Media Laboratory. "The past 150 years of development have been one of urbanization. To be rural has meant to be poor. The Net could bring some of the same opportunities to the rural world and maybe even turn being rural into being rich."
The e-commerce effort has been created with the help of the Hotel Okura, a luxury hotel in Tokyo that has agreed to process credit card purchases made from the village's Web site, whose server computer is in Phnom Penh (www.villageleap.com). The plan is to ship the products by express mail through Cambodia's postal service, with the intention of reaching customers anywhere on the globe within two weeks.
A number of the Robib villagers are now being trained in the once traditional weaving skills of the region -- skills that atrophied under the brutal reign of the dictator Pol Pot in the 1970's and the years of strife afterward, isolating the country and disrupting traditional trade patterns.
A satellite dish provides a continuous 64,000-bits-a-second connection to a small group of computers in the village, which are powered for part of each day by a small solar power system. The hookup is also being used for a simple experiment in telemedicine that American Assistance has organized.
A group of doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston has agreed to answer health-related questions from villagers via e-mail, as well as offer general guidance on diseases like malaria and H.I.V.
"This is not what we usually think about when we talk about telemedicine, where a doctor may transmit an X-ray to a colleague for a second opinion," Mr. Krisher said.
Part of the challenge of Mr. Krisher's effort lies in helping recreate the social structure of the village, which was disrupted by the Khmer Rouge military under Pol Pot.
"It was a nice, traditional Cambodian village," Mr. Krisher said. "They had some old, dilapidated schools, and the Khmer Rouge arrested all of the teachers."
Mr. Krisher's commitment to Cambodia grew out of his years as a foreign correspondent for Newsweek. While many of the magazines' other reporters were drawn to Vietnam alone, Mr. Krisher traveled widely in Asia during the 1960's and 1970's. He became close with the Indonesian leadership and through those relationships was introduced to Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia.
Although the two men initially had a mercurial relationship, they ultimately became good friends, and Mr. Krisher kept in touch while the prince was in exile when the Khmer Rouge were in power.
When Mr. Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in 1990, he asked Mr. Krisher to help the struggling country. In 1994, Mr. Krisher founded and became publisher of The Cambodia Daily, a small English-language newspaper in Phnom Penh. He also raised money for and helped found the Sihanouk Hospital of Hope, in Phnom Pehn, which is now the nation's largest hospital.
Mr. Krisher set up American Assistance for Cambodia in 1990, running it with his wife, Akiko, and his daughter, Deborah Krisher-Steele.
 The hope is to construct 200 rural schools in Cambodian villages, under a program in which donors contribute $14,000 to build small school houses, with matching funds from the World Bank.
Mr. Krisher said he thought the Internet added a powerful lever to his small village-level projects. He said he received three or four e-mail messages from children at the Robib school each day, asking questions about his home in Tokyo.
"This is it," Mr. Krisher said. "You have to do things in a micro way that doesn't require a vast amount of money. My basic philosophy is to build a small sample and make it work and then just copy that."

HEADLINE: Sharing the Wealth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Charles W. Kadlec ("How Taxes Trickle Down," Op-Ed, Aug. 1) supports the repeal of the estate tax and the lowering of income taxes because he thinks the poor, not just the rich, will benefit. 
 However, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans doubled their share of our country's wealth between 1976 and 1997 (from 19 percent to 40 percent), while the share of the bottom 90 percent plunged from 51 percent to 27 percent.
Furthermore, the estate tax is paid by only a tiny minority of people, those lucky enough to be born in wealthy families. Why shouldn't they share their good fortune with the rest of society?

HEADLINE: Affordable Housing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The plan for affordable housing presented at a recent New York City Hall news conference (news article, Aug. 3) should form the basis for a larger, urgently needed plan.
Recent census data show that 25 percent of New York renters pay more than half of their income for rent, and that there is a shortage of close to 400,000 affordable apartments for the city's poorest renters. And in June, the number of homeless people in shelters exceeded 24,000 for the first time since 1996 and included more than 10,000 children. 
 A recent Coalition for the Homeless report outlines the challenge facing New York City: rising population, declining housing production and a widening affordability gap.
A multiyear capital commitment of $750 million a year is needed to develop new housing for low- and middle-income New Yorkers. In a time of economic prosperity, nothing less will reverse the growing shortage of affordable homes for all New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Credit Bush Doesn't Deserve

BYLINE: By Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres; Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres, professors of law at Harvard and the University of Texas, respectively, are authors of the forthcoming "The Miner's Canary: Rethinking Race and Power."

 BODY:
At the Republican Convention last week, Colin Powell boldly challenged his party to be inclusive and follow the leadership of George W. Bush in Texas. As a model of inclusive reform, he touted Texas' 10 percent plan, which grants automatic admission to the flagship public colleges to all state students graduating in the top 10 percent of their high school classes.
Governor Bush calls this plan, which has been remarkably successful, an example of his compassionate conservatism. But this claim would be more convincing if his oratory about the program today had been matched by action when it was being debated. The Texas Legislature adopted it in 1997, after a federal Court of Appeals ruling, the Hopwood decision, had outlawed affirmative action at the University of Texas. Black and Hispanic state legislators conceived and advocated the plan. Governor Bush's contribution? He didn't veto it. 
 During the debate over the bill, Mr. Bush "never publicly supported the idea," says Irma Rangel, the Democratic chairwoman of the higher education subcommittee in the Texas House and the plan's sponsor.
Texas has about 1,500 high schools. But before the program's inception, the University of Texas at Austin, the most selective state-supported Texas college, filled 75 percent of its freshman seats from about 150 economically privileged suburban and private schools. Under the 10 percent plan, several poor white counties in rural West Texas sent graduates to Austin for the first time. Moreover, about 300 African-American freshmen were enrolled last year, a 50 percent increase over the year immediately after the Hopwood decision ended affirmative action. The number of Hispanic students has also increased, to more than when affirmative action was the official policy. (It is worth noting that the plan ensures integration at the university level even if the high schools remain segregated. But as some national Democrats point out, the plan is not a panacea for educational reform, especially in states without the extraordinary racial and economic segregation of Texas.)
Contrary to the fears that they would be unqualified, the 10 percenters exceeded expectations; their collective grade point average in their first year of college was higher than the freshman average for all students before the Hopwood decision. Part of their achievement comes from the university's efforts to make the school itself smarter. The university created more small classes for freshmen and allocated full scholarships to high schools with large numbers of poor and working-class students.
Despite these successes, and despite the high regard in which Governor Bush professes to hold the plan, there are rumblings among Republicans about trying to change it in the next legislative session. They want to restore a requirement that applicants take the SAT, which rewards those who can afford coaching and test preparation and does not predict the qualities of leadership and achievement that the university values. And Governor Bush is notably quiet about these proposed overhauls. "Hopwood required forward thinking, and he's been passive," Michael Olivas, a professor at the University of Houston who specializes in higher education law, says of Mr. Bush.
The 10 percent plan has worked in Texas to spread educational opportunity to those who have had too little of it. It never would have happened without leadership of people of color. Governor Bush should be bold enough to credit the black and brown leaders who gave him the opportunity to crow about its success today. That would be inclusiveness.

HEADLINE: Shoplifting on a Grand Scale: Luxury Wear Stolen to Order

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY 

 BODY:
From the look of it, a person with identity issues had done some heavy shopping. Tossed on a bed in a Brooklyn apartment were a $600 Vuitton Broadway satchel, two $600 burgundy quilted polyester nylon skirts from Chanel, a $545 scarf with the block-lettered Chanel logo worked into the weave and two pairs of blunt-toed $425 Prada Nero shoes for men. None of the garments matched. But that did not matter. The apartment was a way station on a convoluted route of distribution, and the clothes did not yet have owners. Unless, that is, you count the retailers they were stolen from.
"These are going right out to Manhattan," said Angie E., a transgendered person who pilfers clothing for a living. The apartment is hers. "I use this fence in the diamond district," Ms. E said. "There's two brothers. They're the ones that sell it. I just mop the stuff and get my little cut." 
 Mopping, or shoplifting, is no new development on the retail scene. But large-scale shoplifting of luxury goods to order may be. Although criminal law does not distinguish between shoplifting and other kinds of larceny, law enforcement officials say that theft to order of luxury brands appears to be a growth sector. "They're going for the upscale stores," said Joe Morrash, a detective assigned to a stolen-property task force with the Alexandria, Va., police. "They're stealing in volume and selling to fences and underground boutiques." At one drab single-family home in Queens, Detective Morrash said, the New York police uncovered over $500,000 in stolen clothes in 1998. "The inside looked like Macy's," he said.
But Macy's isn't the only target of enterprising thieves. As label culture signals social arrival, even crooks are getting into the act. "It's a society where everybody's got their Fendi and their Chanel and their Vuitton," said Gerald Dupree, 39, a Brooklyn maintenance worker who said he left a career as a semiprofessional shoplifter when he broke a longtime heroin habit four years ago. "You've got to keep pace."
It is a breathtaking pace. In a survey conducted by the University of Florida, retail "shrinkage" -- as shoplifting is euphemistically called in the business -- was shown to have caused losses exceeding $8.9 billion in 1997, the last year for which figures are available.
Recently, police officials say, an increasing number of semiorganized crime syndicates, many of them South American, have been operating along the Eastern Seaboard, in urban centers and at upscale suburban malls. "It's not normal shoplifting anymore, where they're stealing one or two items," said Andrew McColl, a Washington-based agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who heads a task force on property crime. "They're going for the leather coats, the luxury items. The last arrest we made at Tysons Corner mall here, they had $100,000 in goods."
It is not hard to imagine running up a total like that when you consider the tagged prices of what the thieves are now after. "You can order a Chanel suit in size 10, and there are people who can mop it and fences who have the goods," Mr. Dupree said. Such suits typically cost around $4,000.
Angie E. is a thief whose audacity has led her, by her own account, to steal satchels from Louis Vuitton, baguette bags from Fendi, shoes from Prada and scarves from Hermes, things that are often kept in glass cases or under lock and key. She is, as Mr. Dupree said, "one of the ever-famous fierce girdle bandits of New York," a term referring to the practice of stuffing stolen goods into underclothes. "One thief I know put a whole mink in a girdle," Mr. Dupree asserted. Another, he said, would "go into a jewelry counter and, you know how they have chains hanging on display racks?" He paused. "She could just lift the chains up all at once and drop them down her sleeves."
At Saks Fifth Avenue last week a salesman said, "If you don't nail it down, they're going to take it." He was recounting an episode in July, when a woman grabbed six $200 Coach bags from a counter near the main Fifth Avenue exit and bolted. Although the bags were equipped with acoustomagnetic sensors, designed to trigger an alarm, that did not serve as a deterrent. "Do you think they care about the sensors?" asked the salesman, who, like most of the retailers I interviewed, did not want to be identified. "They're in, they're out, it's fast. Who's going to chase them for the bags? The bags are insured."
The subject of shoplifting is an abiding taboo. Only one of a dozen luxury store managers in Manhattan I spoke to would consent to discuss shrinkage on the record. The response of Ellen Hopfinger, manager of the Versace store on Fifth Avenue, was typical. "It's not something we would ever talk about," Ms. Hopfinger said. "I used to work at another luxury store, Armani, and no one talks about it, ever."
The reasons are various, explained Bruce Van Kleek, a member of the Loss Prevention Advisory Council at the National Retail Federation. "It points to internal problems, high turnover, people coming and going all the time," he said. Public admissions about shoplifting problems can also, of course, give potential thieves a heads up.
"It's sick that you have to write about these things," said Stephanie Greenfield, a retailer who attributes a low level of shrinkage at her two Scoop stores in Manhattan to security guards posted at every entrance. Still, she said: "It's going to happen. Look at the economy. Everybody wants stuff. I don't think it's only people who can't afford it. I think there's a prejudice that people don't steal on all class levels, all income levels. There's a mistake people make only looking at one type of crowd."
Mr. Van Kleek added that shoplifters "come in all shapes and sizes, from the 10-year-old stealing a comic book to sophisticated criminal gangs." The innovation, Detective Morrash said, is that inroads are being made on the luxury goods trade by professional gangs with greater levels of sophistication and, yes, of taste. "The South Americans are only doing upscale stores now," he said. "The Limited, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Bloomingdale's."
Goods obtained by one Chilean syndicate, the Washington police reported, were later used to stock a "legitimate" Los Angeles boutique. "We had six guys who'd stolen $150,000 in three days," Detective Morrash said. "They move around the major cities like L.A., New York, Washington and Chicago."
They rent hotel rooms and getaway cars. They use sophisticated signaling methods as they go into department stores, to rake designer clothes into bags. One group compiled a written manual for its "contractors," advising them on the fine points of shoplifting both on and off the sales floor. "Never wander around with any of the pieces you are planning to take," read a copy of these guidelines that I obtained, "because not only will the salespeople want to help you or hold them for you or put them in a dressing room for you, all of which defeat your purpose, but it gives security a chance to count how many you have."
For all that, the method remains simple. "Why worry about alarms going off or electronic tags or radio tags?" Detective Morrash asked. "Speed is what makes them successful. They can get in and roll the merchandise up and run before anyone knows."
By the time an alarm sounds, most professional thieves are gone. In Manhattan particularly, where shoppers are made uneasy by excessive security and surveillance, shoplifters often have preferred exits from their favorite stores. "The Madison Avenue side of Barneys," Ms. E. said, citing an example. "The Fifth Avenue entrance to Saks. I did a job at Pink's," the London shirtmaker with a branch on Madison Avenue and 53rd Street. "They had $165 Sea Island shirts and a side door with nobody around," she continued. "I got six. Everybody's always complaining that they can't find anyone to wait on them. I say: 'Thank you. Let's keep it that way.' "
An assistant manager at Pink, who would not give his name, responded, "That's sad, but that's New York."
Shoplifters have been known to line shopping bags with foil or duct tape to thwart sensors. But Mr. Van Kleek of the retail federation said that the spate of successful theft owed less to cunning than to new levels of brazenness.
It is a view that Mr. Dupree, the former thief, confirmed. The secret of success, he said, is a formula that rings of business motivational seminars: "You go in there thinking, 'This is mine and I'm taking it with me.' "

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
British Airways Reports 65% Drop in its Earnings

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
British Airways reported a 65 percent decline in quarterly earnings today, attributing the poor performance to the effects of the strong British pound and the rising price of jet fuel.
The results for the March-June quarter were reported as the airline is trying to break out of a prolonged slump, partly through a proposed deal to acquire KLM Royal Dutch Airlines N.V. But there were increased signs today that those negotiations, which began in early June, had not advanced very far. 
 While both airlines are still in exclusive talks, concerns over regulatory approval from both the European Union and the United States have cast doubt over the deal. Executives close to the talks have said that the two sides are not yet close to an agreement on a price for KLM. The chief executive of British Airways, Rod Eddington, said today that it remained unclear whether the talks would result in an agreement.
The regulatory obstacles are high for a deal with KLM to receive approval. British Airways encountered regulatory problems when it tried to form an alliance with American Airlines. A deal with KLM was expected to face tougher antitrust scrutiny in Europe because the combined routes of both airlines would cover a large share of the market.
For British Airways, which last year reported its first full-year loss in its history, the pressure to complete the deal and to push profit higher is enormous. The airline dismissed its previous chief executive, Robert Ayling, because of the company's continued downward spiral and hired Mr. Eddington away from Ansett Holdings, the Australian airline company, to strengthen management and help British Airways return to profit.
The airline said pretax profit before one-time items dropped to 8 million, or $12 million, from 23 million a year earlier. Sales rose 4 percent, to 2.3 billion.
Nonetheless, British Airways posted a loss of 50 million after the charges were accounted for, compared with a profit of 200 million a year earlier. Mr. Eddington acknowledged the problems. "These results reflect the scale of the challenge we face in a highly competitive and price-sensitive market," he said. "However, we are also beginning to see the benefits of the investment we have made in every section of the aircraft. The growth in premium traffic has been strong and yields throughout the airline are up."
Indeed, British Airways said business-class traffic during the first quarter rose 8.2 percent, which the airline said equates to a 2.9 percent rise in revenue per passenger.
The airline said the rising price of jet fuel and the strong pound were largely responsible for the financial results. Fuel is one of the largest expenses for airlines, and a strong currency translates into fewer profits when overseas earnings are repatriated. "The effect of a persistently strong pound on British manufacturers and the high cost of fuel give cause for concern," said Lord Marshall, chairman of British Airways. However, he said, "We remain encouraged by the generally favorable economic climate which prevails in most of our key markets around the world."
Analysts said today that there was nothing surprising in the earnings results.
"We remain cautiously optimistic," Andrew Light, an analyst at Solomon Smith Barney, wrote in a note to investors. But, he said, the uncertainty of the KLM deal remains a big risk for the stock.
Shares of British Airways dropped 3 pence, to 388 pence, or about $5.82. KLM stock rose 5.9 percent, to 30.39 euros, or $27.50.

HEADLINE: Bail Reduced for Man Accused of Leading Philadelphia Protests

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
A man accused of being the ringleader of the illegal street protests during the Republican National Convention had his bail reduced from $1 million to $100,000 yesterday, as defendants contended that the Philadelphia police were guilty of jailhouse brutality and city officials maintained there was a criminal conspiracy to shut down the city.
During an appeal hearing, the million-dollar bail on misdemeanor charges was ruled excessive for John Sellers, the 33-year-old leader of the Ruckus Society of Berkeley, Calif. He denies leading a conspiracy and insists that he only trained demonstrators in the techniques of nonviolent civil disobedience. 
 At the same hearing, Common Pleas Judge Lisa A. Richette rejected a request for bail reduction for about 150 defendants still in jail who are protesting their arrests by refusing to give their identities to city authorities. Most of the defendants are charged with misdemeanors, with bail of $20,000 or less. They would probably be released with no bail once they properly identified themselves, said the district attorney, Lynne M. Abraham.
As more defendants from a total of 391 arrested returned to freedom with complaints about their detention conditions, the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania cited "credible stories concerning serious injuries inflicted" in jail, and urged anyone who was injured to file complaints with the city Police Advisory Commission.
Larry Frankel, executive director of the A.C.L.U., accused city authorities of overreacting to the provocations and relatively petty crimes of some demonstrators.
"We believe that vandalizing property, turning over trash cans, assaulting persons and shutting down the city by blocking traffic are not activities protected by the First Amendment," Mr. Frankel said, summarizing the main street incidents that occurred last Tuesday. "However, they are not the kind of crimes that justify treating the defendants as if they were dangerous urban terrorists."
The main demonstration group, R2K Network, protests the "corruption of democracy" through the power of Wall Street and the globalized economy. Network leaders accuse the city of "criminalizing dissent" by pre-emptively arresting some protesters and seeking high bail, amounting to preventive detention. Network members noted that some of the same demonstrators arrested in April in Washington during a similar protest were eventually fined $5 for jaywalking.
A network organizer, Beka Economopoulos, said some defendants had been brutalized, denied medication and "hog tied" ankle-to-wrist in jail.
The police denied the accusations and said defendants were creating their own problems by offering fanciful identities, staging hunger strikes and, in some cases, stripping off their clothes to hinder identification from videotaped street protests.
Mayor John F. Street has accused the protesters of "a very well-thought-out, well-planned conspiracy to shut down the city." And the police commissioner, John P. Timoney, maintained that protest leaders had far more than nonviolent dissent in mind.
"I call them conspirators and criminals and cowards," he said on Friday in detailing some charges, including what he said was the stringing of piano wire across Market Street in an attempt to injure police officers on horseback and bicycles.
The gravity of that charge was conceded in an interview by Bradley Bridge, an assistant legal aid lawyer with the city's Defender Association. But Mr. Bridge complained that 70 defendants were being held for a far less suspicious incident -- being present in a factory raided by the police where street puppets and other protest materials were made.
"I was there negotiating and saw the puppets," Mr. Bridge said. "It's appalling those guys are still in jail."
City officials contended that, with the police widely praised for exercising restraint during the protests, the demonstrators were deprived of bloody encounters and now sought to create an issue with allegations of jailhouse brutality.
Protest leaders argued that the city was bent on detaining defendants beyond the Democratic National Convention next week in Los Angeles. But they vowed that demonstrations planned for that convention would be stronger because of the arrests in Philadelphia.
With bail appeals continuing, the court did not reduce the $500,000 bail set for Darby Landy, 20, who is accused of a felony assault on the police in a street fracas with bicycling officers led by Commissioner Timoney.

Russia Asks U.S. to Reconsider Steel Limit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The Russian government has asked the United States to reconsider an agreement that limits Russian steel exports into this country.
A Commerce Department spokesman said today that the Clinton administration was working with the Russian government to confirm a date in September to discuss the request. 
The Russian request immediately met strong opposition from representatives of United States steel companies, which are suffering earnings drops this year.
Russia and the United States signed the so-called suspension agreement in July last year after the Commerce Department found that Russia was selling steel in the United States at prices below the cost of manufacturing, and threatened retaliatory tariffs.
As a result, Russian steel exporters have diverted about five million tons of steel products, worth about $1 billion, from the United States market over the last year.
Under the accord, Russia agreed to a 64 percent cut in its exports to avoid tariffs of as much as 185 percent on hot-rolled steel, a product that is widely used in cars and appliances.
The agreement was reached on the day the United States was to have set final duties on Russian hot-rolled steel and other products.
When Russia's economy collapsed two years ago the country's steelmakers began selling steel at below-market prices on the United States market, according to the Commerce Department. American steelmakersasked the United States government to intervene and impose the duties.

Broad-Based Rally Extends to a 3rd Day

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks climbed for a third day yesterday on optimism that the economy is slowing enough that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again in 2000.
Nortel Networks, Wal-Mart Stores and EMC led the Standard & Poor's 500 index higher. 
 "Investors are coming to the realization that the underlying market fundamentals are in really good shape," said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer for Value Line Asset Management, which oversees $7 billion. "The economy continues to decelerate nicely, yet corporate earnings are still in decent shape."
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 75.63, or 2 percent, to 3,862.99. The S.&. P 500 rose 16.39, or 1.1 percent, to 1,479.32. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 99.26, or 0.9 percent, to 10,867.01. The Nasdaq advanced for a third day, while the Dow and S. & P. 500 climbed for a sixth.
A report on productivity today is expected to underscore the premise that the economy can continue to grow without setting off inflation.
Still, some investors see concern about rising rates preventing a sustained rally. "I don't infer anything from the Nasdaq going up a few days in a row," said Larry Smith, chief investment officer of Credit Suisse Asset Management, which manages about $200 billion. "The risk of a tightening will remain with the market."
Nortel gained 4 7/16, to 79 3/8; Wal-Mart advanced 11 5/16, to 55; and EMC climbed 41 1/16, to 90.
With today's gains, the Nasdaq year-to-date loss is 5.1 percent, while the S & P 500 has risen 0.7 percent. The Dow has lost 5.5 percent.
Internet stocks like Ebay, Safeguard Scientifics and Quokka Sports fell after Henry Blodget, the Merrill Lynch analyst, lowered ratings on those stocks and eight others.
Mr. Blodget said his downgrades were needed because "the tide is no longer rising fast enough to lift all boats." He also cut ratings on eToys, 24/7 Media, Buy.com, iVillage, Pets.com and Webvan Group.
Ebay lost 3/4, to 50, Safeguard fell 2 3/8, to 29 9/16, and Quokka dropped 15/16, to 6 1/16.
I2 Technologies Inc. soared 17 5/16, to 143 3/8. The company, which makes software that lets manufacturers and suppliers swap information on the Internet, joined with Citigroup and three others to create a new company to make it easier for buyers and sellers to pay on line.
Citigroup rose 3/16 to 73 11/16. Ariba, which makes software to help companies buy and sell goods on the Internet, rose 105 9/64, to 135. Ariba signed an agreement with Sabre Holdings, the world's largest travel-reservation company, in which Sabre agreed to use Ariba software in its corporate travel-management system. Sabre fell 1/8, to 28 3/4.
Financial stocks fell after gains last week on the expectation the Fed would not raise rates when it meets Aug. 22. Banks, personal-loan companies and savings and loans were the best-performing groups in the S.& P. 500 last week. American Express declined 11/16, to 58 3/8, and J. P. Morgan lost 15/16, to 141 15/16.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasuries fell yesterday after a wave of buying dried up and market participants made room for $25 billion of new government supply due this week.
 "The market has really discounted any kind of tightening from the Fed at this point," said David Gottlieb, governments trader at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.
 Friday's employment report, which showed easing in the tight job market, lessened concern that the Fed would raise rates for a seventh time since June 1999 at its Aug. 22 meeting. But dealers said trading volumes dried up yesterday as the euphoria that swept the market on Friday failed to carry through.
 The 10-year Treasury note fell 13/32, to a price of 103 31/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.95 percent from 5.89 on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32, to 107 1/32. The yield rose to 5.75 percent from 5.71 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	 	 		6-Mo. Bills	 	 	Price	98.459	96.936	 	High Rate	6.09%	6.06%	 	Investment Rate	6.27%	6.33%	 	Low Rate	6.06%	6.00%	 	Median Rate	6.07%	6.05%	 	Total applied for	$27,857,651	$28,009,051	 	Accepted	$13,543,951	$13,044,051	 	Noncompetitive	$1,323,623	$1,266,073

HEADLINE: Oakland Joins the Bay Area Boom

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The construction cranes and cement trucks are taking over the downtown here, like the artillery of a conquering army.
Smack in the middle of the commercial district, a brick's throw from the falling-down houses that have symbolized Oakland for a generation, is the growing behemoth of an office tower -- the first to be built in the city in more than 10 years -- that promises to alter the landscape here for decades to come. 
 All around that project, dot-com businesses are plowing down old walk-ups for shiny new headquarters or swooping down on boarded-up, sad-sack buildings and restoring them to the proud, handsome office complexes they once were. In short, downtown Oakland can boast that it is within striking distance of 1.6 million square feet of offices and stores, built over the last three years.
That Oakland has become so popular, already facing the same space shortage, skyrocketing rents and gentrification battles that plague the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area, is an extraordinary testament to the new economy.
The last hot property within commutable distance of Silicon Valley has long been the plain Jane cousin to San Francisco's prom queen, never noticed except for its missteps (remember Ebonics?) and flaws. From its slums, which rival the toughest in the nation, to its reputation for high crime (a reputation not always deserved, but hard to shake) to its poorly performing schools and deteriorated housing, save for a few choice neighborhoods that prefer to call themselves something other than Oakland, the city has had a bad rap for so long that Mayor Jerry Brown likes to say it has stagnated with "diminished expectations."
Now, largely because it is -- or was -- the last affordable bastion in the Bay Area, and because it has courted new residents and businesses, Oakland is feeling the ups and downs of a boom. Those celebrating include Ask Jeeves, the $1 billion Internet search company, which is one of dozens of dot-coms that have staked a claim here, with a commitment to moving at least 700 employees into its new space from the nearby city of Emeryville.
The Port of Oakland is getting in on the action as well, with a $727 million modernization. Forbes magazine is impressed enough to rank Oakland as No. 12 on its list of the top cities in the nation to do business, ahead of San Francisco (No. 42) and Silicon Valley's unofficial capital, San Jose (No. 29).
But the pressure is building along with the boom. Oakland, always considered a Bay Area haven for the poor and dispossessed, has also become the last refuge for the middle class. Nonprofit organizations, renters and house buyers alike have been leaving the overpriced, overcrowded city of San Francisco in droves. They are coming to this city of 400,000 people as their best hope for an affordable place in the Bay Area. Soon, a real estate agent said recently, "all that will be left is the wishbone."
All this new money gives Oakland an odd feel. In a scene from the new Oakland, dot-comers with Palm Pilots are sitting in Starbucks while homeless panhandlers who have lived here forever stand outside waiting to ask them for spare change. The hot real estate market is also creating a panic among members of the working class, who have made up the backbone of the city, as rents rise and renters are evicted, legally and not.
Nancy Nadel, an Oakland City Council member whose district includes much of the prime development zones, said that real estate speculation had led to a housing crisis for the poor as landlords evicted longtime tenants and, sometimes illegally, raised rents. "As new owners acquire properties at higher prices, they are raising prices higher than our somewhat weak rent control laws allow, and evicting people illegally," Ms. Nadel said.
Oakland still has a lot of its old problems, too. Its crime rate, which has been dropping steadily, recently took an upturn. Poverty and homelessness, drug dealing and AIDS, all plague the city.
And now, there are the new worries: skyrocketing rents, the condemnation of old buildings that have given refuge to the very poor and a growing sense of uneasiness on the part of many longtime residents, many of them African-Americans, that their city is now for sale.
"I don't think we're getting enough attention focused on the housing needs going on here," said Linnie Cobb, a 62-year-old homeowner who has lived in Oakland most of her life. Ms. Cobb, who is co-chairwoman of the local chapter of Acorn, the national community advocacy organization, says she hears complaints all the time from people who wonder what is happening to their city.
"It's bad when you have a whole community up in arms except for the yuppie types or the middle class or the rich," Ms. Cobb said. "We're seeing a migration of yuppie types moving in, and blacks and minorities are being pushed out."
The newcomers are the city's biggest cheerleaders. John Dolby, marketing director for the Shorenstein Company, which is building a 20-story office tower downtown, said the falling vacancy rates for prime office space -- down to 1 percent (almost as low as San Francisco's) from 9 percent last year -- reflected a changing perception among wealthy companies.
"There was a perception of Oakland that it was crime-ridden and dilapidated, which is not the case," Mr. Dolby said. "And then Jerry Brown came in and the perception is changing for the better, blocks getting cleaned up, not only downtown but surrounding neighborhoods."
Sam Nassif, owner of the Waterfront Hotel on Jack London Square, was vice president of the city's Convention and Visitors Authority when it sputtered to a close in 1998. Now, as chairman of a revived bureau, he leads a 24-member board that can boast that Oakland's 2,000 hotel rooms are near capacity in peak times. An additional 630 rooms are slated to open in the next two years.
A growing problem for the city is sparked by its war on decades of blighted housing. Since the city strengthened its antiblight laws two years ago and urged citizens to file complaints, it has issued 14,000 summonses for ugly nuisances, including trash cans left at the curb too long and building code violations. "This is a very self-conscious effort at social engineering to get us on the train of economic revival," said Claudia Leed, a deputy city attorney.
For some residents, the enforcement goes too far, punishing poor people who cannot afford to repair their houses to code. Slapped with fines that start at more than $700 and quickly climb, old homeowners may be pushed out of their only option at housing. This, a growing number of ministers and community organizations say, is a part of the consequence of Oakland's newfound popularity with the rich and middle class.

An Effort by U.S. to Change the I.M.F. Is Set Back

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Poor countries are fighting a proposal by the leading industrial nations to increase the cost of borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, dealing a blow to a campaign by Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers to change the lending agencies.
The differences emerged today when Horst Kohler, the I.M.F.'s new managing director, chided Group of Seven finance ministers for announcing their desire to charge more for loans instead of working within the fund to build consensus on the issue. Several big nations that vote on loan decisions at the I.M.F. and the World Bank oppose the changes. 
 "The direction the G-7 have set up, I think, is right and should be considered carefully," Mr. Kohler said here, addressing a plan that had been endorsed by the wealthy nations in advance of their meeting of top leaders in Japan last month. "But it is now a problem because a big group of countries within the fund feels itself lectured by the presentation of these ideas. It makes things not easy."
Mr. Kohler's comments came after the fund's board rejected the proposal from the Group of Seven in an unpublicized, informal tally late last month, a board member said today. Only about half the board members, by voting power, sided with the Group of Seven, with 70 percent support required to change lending rates.
The board's decision was a setback for Mr. Summers, who has tried to change the way the I.M.F. works and has persuaded the Group of Seven -- Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, in addition to the United States -- to endorse an increase in lending rates as an important element of his plan to overhaul the international agency.
The treasury secretary, responding in part to heavy criticism in Congress, has tried to change some of the fund's practices to address concerns that it has made mistakes while expanding its role in recent years.
The I.M.F. has repeatedly lent to a growing number of poor and modest-income nations, fought financial crises, helped the West transform Russia, and attached sweeping conditions to loans in an attempt to turn borrowers into efficient capitalists.
There appears to be broad agreement, especially among wealthy nations, that the fund should streamline its activities. But developing nations, which make up a substantial voting bloc on the fund's board and double as borrowers, do not want to pay more for their loans or to agree to apply for help less often.
Some board members from poor countries also disagreed with the reasons the Group of Seven gave for wanting to raise rates. The industrial nations said higher rates could make more money available for new lending and the forgiveness of debts of the poorest countries.
"This is a case of them asking the poor to help the poor," a board member said.
Speaking at the National Press Club, Mr. Kohler said he personally supported the idea of raising loan rates, but disagreed with the rich nations' decision to push for the changes outside the fund. He said the job of winning support had now become harder.
Mr. Kohler became managing director three months ago, after a protracted struggle that pitted the United States and several other nations against Germany. The Clinton administration effectively vetoed Germany's first choice of a candidate to head the I.M.F. before settling on Mr. Kohler, who is a former German government official.
Mr. Kohler used his speech today to preview other elements of a plan he is working on to change the I.M.F. As he has signaled in the past, he said he intended to focus the fund primarily on broad economic management and to reduce overlapping activity with the World Bank, whose mandate includes fighting poverty and overhauling the way poor countries manage their economies. His ideas are broadly similar to those of Mr. Summers.
Some in the Group of Seven had expressed hope earlier that the I.M.F. and the World Bank would endorse pricing changes during their annual meeting in Prague late in September. But several fund officials said that was unlikely now. An official at the World Bank said that its board was also discussing lending rates but that there was no consensus to increase rates at this time.
A Treasury Department spokeswoman said the Group of Seven often agrees on changes to I.M.F. and World Bank policies among themselves before presenting them to the boards of the two institutions. She said the Clinton administration still hoped that the changes would be made. "We are glad that the managing director supports pricing reforms," the spokeswoman said. "It will be an important test of the I.M.F. to forge a consensus."

HEADLINE: Murder Rate In New York Sliding Back

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
New York City's murder rate, after a surge that alarmed the Police Department and brought about an expensive and aggressive street enforcement campaign, has begun to slide back down.
The upturn in homicides, which by the end of last year was 6 percent above the count from 1998, had put the department on the defensive and loomed as a potential political liability for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had made crime reduction his most important accomplishment. 
 But recent department statistics show that the homicide rate has flattened, with this year's murder count, which was 413 as of yesterday, an even match with the corresponding period in 1999.
The numbers looked even better just last week, with homicides down 1 percent for the first seven months of this year, compared with the same period last year, but the rate edged up slightly this weekend, when the city had one of its most violent nights of the year, with six people fatally shot or stabbed throughout the city late Saturday night into early Sunday. By the end of July, there had been 392 murders, compared with 396 by the end of July 1999.
The emergence of a flat murder rate belies a more marked decline, given that at the beginning of the year, the police were still facing a rise in homicides. By the end of March, the city had 13 percent more murders than in the first three months of last year. That the weekend's onslaught of slayings did not push this year's homicide count over the total from last year at this time illustrates that, blips and spurts aside, the situation is stabilizing.
"The crime rate," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday, "is down all over the city, even with the violence over the weekend, which occasionally, unfortunately you deal with."
"There is a sense of relief that we've turned the trend around," said Garry F. McCarthy, the deputy police commissioner of operations. "Although it's not the bellwether crime -- the bellwether crime is robbery -- it's obviously the most important."
The police credit the drop to Operation Condor, an antinarcotics program begun in late January. The program has come under intense criticism for its high cost, for saturating neighborhoods with narcotics teams and for increasing the number of arrests for petty offenses. The police say they have since broadened the program to take aim at crimes against drivers of taxicabs and livery cabs and to add uniformed street patrols focusing on quality-of-life offenses like jumping subway turnstiles and peddling without a license.
So far, at least $41 million has been spent on the program; police officers working under its banner have made 53,933 arrests in the course of about 100,000 overtime shifts. In its latest, broadest incarnation, the police say, Operation Condor is not so much a new strategy as a redoubling of the department's regular enforcement efforts in the neighborhoods that need it most.
Critics are reluctant to credit the program for the decline in homicides, saying the numbers are small, the downward curve is new, and the murder rate could simply be fluctuating based on forces that have little to do with law enforcement.
"I think the Police Department has done a lot to reduce crime, but I'm not sure that they can take all the credit," said Karim Ismaili, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. John's University in Queens. "If the economy goes on a slide and if some other drug market or underground economy flourishes, we're going to see an increase."
One problem in attributing the drop to police work alone is that in the Bronx, where Operation Condor has been as active as it has in any other borough, the murder rate was 57 percent higher in the first seven months of this year than in the same period of 1999. The Bronx was the only borough that had a decline in the number of murders last year, but through July, there were 124 murders there, up from 79 in the first seven months of 1999. The Bronx recorded one of those homicides during the weekend, when one person was shot to death at a block party at which seven other people were wounded by gunfire.
Police officials said they were puzzled by the Bronx statistics. "Whatever we've done there, it has not succeeded," Mr. McCarthy said, "so it's time for us to change gears there and try something else."
The department says the drop is still a powerful piece of evidence that the city remains safe. While overall crime was down 8 percent last year, the 6 percent rise in killings took center stage, illustrating the extent to which grim homicide figures can eclipse favorable trends in other types of crime. A body count is as solid a figure as exists, and no other number is as incontrovertible or as closely watched.
The police also mentioned a possible broader pattern. Officials say that as the murder rate in New York has declined 70 percent in the last decade, to levels last seen in the 1960's, the patterns of murder have changed, restoring the classical understanding of the crime as personal, not random.
The gradual return of past murder patterns marks the end of a time when drug-related street violence bucked conventional thinking about the context and circumstances of homicide, criminologists and police officials say.
"If you look at the long-term picture, it becomes obvious why the city of today barely resembles the New York City of 10 years ago," Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. "Ten years ago, innocent people were being killed in gun battles right on the city's streets." Mr. Safir is expected to announce today that he is leaving the job by the end of this month, officials said.
According to the police, only one bystander was killed during the first half of this year, a figure that includes both people caught in cross-fire and victims whom a killer mistook for someone else. In the first half of 1990, 101 bystanders were killed, the police said.
There has also been a decline in the proportion of homicides that take place on the streets: 39 percent during the first half of this year, down from 55 percent in the same period in 1990, the statistics indicate. And the percentage of murders that took place inside private homes (as opposed to public housing projects) rose slightly, to 29 percent for the first six months of this year from 27 percent in the first half of 1990.
The experts generally concur that the statistics reflect a real trend. "I think it's fair to say that murder today is less random than in the past," said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. "Whether that's because of changes in the drug markets or in the way people conduct their everyday life or because there's a fear of police, no one knows."
Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, said he had no doubt that the overall portrait of murder had changed, becoming "much more diffuse, much less concentrated in a small number of places" than a decade ago. "It may well be time," he said, "to rethink the tactics for dealing with the kinds of homicides that are left, which are in many cases tougher to deal with but may call for a different set of approaches."

HEADLINE: As Japan Deregulates, Quality-of-Life Laments;
Mom and Pop Do Battle With Discounters

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: MACHIDA CITY, Japan

 BODY:
Sales started sliding at the Katos' small sake shop here a decade ago, when trucks began coming into the neighborhood and selling cut-price beer and other alcoholic beverages off their tailgates.
Now the trucks have been put out of business by convenience stores, supermarkets and discount shops, but Yoshiro Kato and his wife, Mitsuko, soldier on, determined to resist forces that could turn shops like theirs into quaint memories of a Japan that no longer exists. 
 "It's deregulation," she said. "People in government say Americans have deregulation, so we should, too, but those saying that don't understand the feelings of people like us who are just struggling to survive. It's like they're telling us, just hurry up and die, would you."
Mrs. Kato has suppressed her anger many times as once-loyal customers walk past the shop in this Tokyo suburb, lugging heavy bottles of alcohol from the supermarket nearby. She does not blame them for the shop's waning business. Her own children, she said, frequent discount stores, drawn by ample parking space, late hours and low prices.
Roughly 10 years have passed since Japan began to dismantle the list of licenses, permits and other regulatory approvals that were long part of breaking into business here. Under deregulation, competition has grown, the number of stores has increased and Japanese consumers now enjoy many of the same benefits as Americans in areas ranging from convenience banking to the purchase of gasoline. But the endangered shotengai, or local shopping district, has become a rallying point against deregulation among Japanese worried that they are destroying something precious.
In some isolated cases, the forces opposing deregulation are prevailing. Neighborhood groups have banded together to fight incursions by big store chains. And in a throwback to a more regulated era, large retailers must now get permission from local committees to open stores.
"Deregulation has been accepted without any criticism in Japan as a great measure for reviving the economy," said Shoji Muranuki, leader of a citizens' group that won concessions from a retail chain seeking to open in the neighborhood. "But how can we say that deregulation is helping the economy when so many local shopkeepers and merchants are hurting because of it?"
Groups like Mr. Muranuki's and business associations that sat by quietly as the effects of deregulation spread are now increasingly vocal about drawing the line somewhere. Breaking up a telephone monopoly like the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation is one thing, they say, but destroying the livelihoods of local shopkeepers is going too far. This sympathy for local shopkeepers has given them a powerful means of defense that N.T.T. does not have.
"The difference is like the difference between an elephant and an ant," said Hiroshi Yamada, the mayor of Suginami ward in Tokyo, when asked to compare the power of small shops with that of N.T.T., the telecommunications giant that is under heavy political pressure to accept further deregulation. "N.T.T. bows to the politicians, but the politicians bow to the local shopkeepers."
Shopkeepers have traditionally been the backbone of the Japanese neighborhood. They organize festivals that make the long, sticky summers here tolerable. They are active in school affairs and community sports. They hang out in front of their shops, chatting with patrons and handing out candy or small toys to children.
"They might be feeble in terms of their sales power, but they have a big say in what happens in local areas," Mr. Yamada said. They lack the financial resources of big corporations like N.T.T, he said, "but the local shop owners can collect something even more valuable -- votes."
As a young member of Parliament a few years ago, Mr. Yamada was a strong proponent of deregulation. But as a local politician, he has pressed for passage of an ordinance to restrict the discount stores in the interest of protecting his constituents from the traffic jams, even the motorcycle gangs, that some say will blight their neighborhoods.
"Now that I have come to the front line, I have learned that just legislating deregulation does not make deregulation fruitful," he said. "I realize that many conditions need to be imposed to make deregulation work in society."
That may be, but the shotengai are one of the biggest drags on Japan's sputtering economy. According to a new study by the McKinsey Global Institute that attributes Japan's economic troubles to low productivity, traditional shops like the Katos' are far less productive than their counterparts in the United States.
Many shops stay in business in part because of high tax penalties that discourage them from selling their property. Government loan guarantees and subsidies also make it easier to survive.
But the McKinsey study discloses another important source of the traditional shopkeeper's power: mom-and-pop shops account for 55 percent of retail employment here, while the entire retail industry accounts for 12 percent of total employment and 5 percent of the gross domestic product.
Kabun Muto, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, is making a name for himself as a champion of small liquor-store owners like the Katos, and as a critic of deregulation in general. He has submitted a bill to postpone any further deregulation that could hurt neighborhood stores.
Mr. Muto and the 220 representatives who support him also oppose the relaxation of rules on taxicab licensing. Mr. Muto contends that looser rules have given organized criminal groups a toehold in the taxi business.
"There is less intervention by the bureaucracy now," said Mr. Muto, whose family owns a sake brewery. "But in creating such an open environment, we have weakened society, and people would have different opinions about whether that's a good thing or not."
So Japanese are grappling with the question of whether the social costs that concern Mr. Muto -- the loss of livelihood by shopkeepers who are often pillars of their communities and a potential increase in troubled youth -- offset the benefits of deregulation.
In the fiscal year that ended in March 1998, the Economic Planning Agency estimated that deregulation had created 8.6 trillion yen, or $83 billion at current exchange rates, in consumer benefits.
The agency also concluded that growth was notably strong that year in deregulated businesses like telephone services, electricity and gasoline, even as the overall economy shrank. "The progress in the last few years has been marvelous," said Yoshihiko Miyauchi, chairman of the government's Regulatory Reform Committee.
He regards Mr. Muto's campaign and the lobbying of the All-Japan Liquor Merchants' Association -- whose officials paid 300 visits to politicians last year and contributed nearly $400,000 to the ruling party -- as a sign of how far deregulation has penetrated the economy. "One reason we have these types of movements is because the efforts we have made are having an effect," he said.
Yet Japan is falling behind the other big economic powers, as Mr. Miyauchi sees it. "We are walking in the right direction at a very leisurely pace," he said, "congratulating ourselves for our progress, while other countries are running this race like Olympic athletes."
Those pressing for fast-paced regulatory change here seem more like, well, Don Quixote -- which happens to be the name of a discount store chain that has become the bane of the groups opposing deregulation. The Don Quixote store in the Suginami district has become a cause celebre on both sides of the argument, with its extended hours, big parking lot and cut-rate prices.
Neighborhood residents and local merchants united last year and gathered 6,271 signatures in their campaign to keep Don Quixote out. The group argued that the store would increase traffic and worsen pollution. They said some merchandise -- in particular, sexually explicit toys and videos, as well as knives -- would end up in the hands of youngsters.
Plus, "if the store operated 24 hours a day, regular shops could not compete," said Mr. Muranuki, a retired salaryman who leads the group. "Already, our shops are suffering from large-sized retailers like supermarkets."
The group extracted some concessions from Don Quixote. The store agreed to close from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. daily, to avoid flashy advertising and handouts that might lead to litter, and to keep the risque merchandise and the knives off its shelves.
Moreover, the Suginami local legislature passed an ordinance early last month allowing the mayor to block the opening of stores larger than 500 square meters -- almost 5,400 square feet -- if he thinks the owner has not addressed local concerns.
The ordinance revived restrictions on retailers that had recently been abolished by the Japanese government. "Now, the entire nation is focusing on what's happened here," Mr. Muranuki said proudly.
Takao Yasuda, the president of Don Quixote and a passionate proponent of deregulation, contends that the citizens group won a Pyrrhic victory. His store did open, and its sales are running 30 percent above expectations. "We are closed in hours when few customers would visit the store anyway," Mr. Yasuda said, "and if the store is closed, we can do preparatory work like straightening up the cash registers and shelves."
Members of the group that opposed the liquor store acknowledge that their worries have proved unfounded -- and they take credit for that. They still watch the store, patrolling the parking lot between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. and making spot checks of the merchandise.
"Right now, the shop isn't causing any trouble," said Kyoko Hashiguchi, the group's secretary. "Traffic jams outside the store are much less than we expected because local people seem to ride their bicycles to the store."
But Mr. Yasuda says he is concerned about the precedent the fight in the Suginami district has established. The citizens' appeal to quality-of-life concerns has resonated in the news media and with politicians in a way that complaints solely about the economic impact of deregulation have not.
Their ability to enlist local officials in their cause is also alarming, he said, adding that the ordinance's vague command that retailers must "protect the environment" leaves plenty of room for government interference.
"The ordinance itself is not so strong," Mr. Yasuda said, "but I worry that it is rather arbitrary and fuzzy in its meaning." Then he added, "In a uniquely Japanese way, the local government can exercise its own power of interpretation, and that worries me."

HEADLINE: Picket Lines Swell and Telephone Disruptions Spread in Strike

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
A strike by more than 86,000 workers of the nation's biggest telecommunications employer intensified yesterday as problems with local consumer telephone service -- some of it a result of vandalism -- began to spread and picket lines swelled in a 13-state region stretching from Maine to Virginia.
Chances of a quick resolution to the strike, which began on Sunday, appeared to grow more distant as negotiators hit a snag on several issues, according to people close to the negotiations taking place at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington. 
 Members of the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are striking against Verizon Communications, the company which was formed by the recent merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE Communications.
On the walkout's second day, about 14,500 union members were picketing outside 550 telephone company buildings in the region. That was more than than five times the number of workers walking picket lines on Sunday.
While business customers appeared to be relatively unaffected by the strike yesterday, residential service in scattered parts of New York and other Eastern cities was knocked out by incidents of vandalism, which police officials said might have been strike related. In New York alone, the police department reported more than 70 such incidents.
Emergency services continued to function normally, along with other parts of Verizon's network that are automated. But delays in repairs and installations seemed inevitable even as Verizon (pronounced va-RISE-en) dispatched some 30,000 managers to fill in for striking employees. Workers remain on the job at the company's nonunion Verizon Wireless unit, the nation's largest cellular telephone company.
Strikers seemed determined to stay on the picket lines as negotiators in Washington continued discussing a range of issues that include forced overtime and the loss of jobs from mergers. One issue, extending union representation to workers in the company's fast-growing wireless and Internet access businesses, could potentially alter organized labor's role in high-tech industries that are fueling the economy's expansion.
"We're going to be here till we get what we want," Ella Simmons, a striking telephone operator, said as she picketed outside a call center in Washington yesterday.
The C.W.A., which represents 72,000 of the striking employees, said that the biggest gap between labor and management involved the union's effort to limit the number of jobs that can be shifted from one region to another as a result of Bell Atlantic's takeover of GTE.
"My family doesn't want to get uprooted any more than yours does, but this company doesn't care about that possibility," said Richard Leath, 50, who works as a line splicer for Verizon in Brooklyn.
Verizon has amended an earlier proposal that had called for 6 percent of its work force to potentially be forced to move or lose their jobs as a result of the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger. The latest offer from the company would set that figure at 4 percent.
But the union is seeking a figure closer to the half of a percentage point it was guaranteed after Bell Atlantic acquired Nynex in 1997.
Among other issues, the two sides have yet to reach an agreement over how to make it easier for the union to organize workers at Verizon Wireless, which has 32,000 employees and is seen as the fast-growing part of the company and the area where the best jobs may be found in the future.
The union filed a complaint last month with the National Labor Relations Board over an incident the C.W.A. contends took place at a Verizon Wireless call center in Woburn, Mass.
According to the complaint, management representatives, in what would be a violation of the law, told employees they could not distribute union literature or discuss unionization anywhere on the premises of the center, which has about 300 employees.
The National Labor Relations Board is reviewing the complaint, a process that could take months or even years. "I'd be very surprised to find out we acted illegally" said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon.
Efforts to organize Verizon's wireless division are being closely watched elsewhere, because so far the nation's wireless industry has had few union workers.
As negotiators continued with talks that were expected to last late into the evening, the relative lack of network disruptions reflects the high degree of automation in modern telecommunications networks.
More than 98 percent of the calls that the 25 million business and residential customers in the strike region place on the Verizon network take place with no human assistance.
Any disruptions yesterday were "nothing big, nothing more than normal," said Rob Wilson, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy, the state's utilities regulator, which fields complaints about telephone service from consumers.

In a major shift, timber companies have stepped up logging operations in the South, where they face less regulation than in the carefully monitored forests of the Pacific Northwest.
Timber harvests in North Carolina, Tennessee and 11 other Southern states increased by 50 percent from 1977 to 1997, from 6.8 billion cubic feet to 10.2 billion cubic feet, according to the draft of a federal report, the Southern Resources Assessment. And the trend has accelerated. 
 Today, the states from Virginia west through Texas account for two-thirds of the 16 billion cubic feet of timber harvested in the United States.
Industry officials said almost all of the logging in the South had been conducted responsibly. And they point to the very forests now being cut as an example of that stewardship. Most Southern forests, they said, were logged extensively as long as a century ago and then cut again in successive logging cycles.
Federal officials and industry critics said the geographic shift reflected, at least in part, the relative permissiveness of the South, where most forests are in private, not public, hands and where logging is subject to few regulations.
In general, Southern states have given free rein to logging on private land, in contrast to the West, where state regulations are stricter and where the abundance of federally owned forests means that cutting must meet tight federal guidelines.
Nearly 70 percent of the 214 million acres of forest in the South is held by private, nonindustrial owners, with an additional 20 percent owned by the forest products industry.
In North Carolina, which is typical of Southern states, logging on private land does not require state approval, and the state does little to monitor the extent of timber harvests.
As a result, federal officials and industry critics said, they are seeing several troubling trends. For the first time, softwoods like pine are being harvested faster than they can be replaced, and projections in the Southern Resources Assessment suggested that the more valuable hardwoods face a similar fate.
Officials also pointed to a wider use of clear-cutting operations that have laid bare vast tracts of forest.
The relentless appetite for wood is being fed by an economy that has produced a strong market for construction. Small towns like Union Mills in western North Carolina have felt the boom in the form of chip mills, like the one here owned by the Willamette Industries Inc. of Portland, Ore., that grind wood into chips for making paper. More than 100 such mills have sprung up across the South in the past 15 years, most since 1995.
Among those concerned about the shift in logging has been the chief of the United States Forest Service, Mike Dombeck. Over the past 20 years, Mr. Dombeck said in a speech in June to a group of writers, a huge surplus in the growth of timber over harvests in the South has been all but eliminated.
"The issue is a question of basic sustainability," Mr. Dombeck said. "Harvest levels cannot exceed growth if forests are to continue providing healthy fish and wildlife habitats, clean and pure drinking water, and scenic beauty."
In the South, according to federal estimates, the growth deficit is widest on land owned by the timber industry, which is about 20 percent of the forests and where removals in 1997 exceeded growth by 15 percent.
Even in cases where forests are being replanted, as is encouraged but rarely required in Southern states, it is often with varieties like the fast-growing loblolly pine, a tree that is a valuable commercial crop but one that biologists say is less likely to promote animal habitat than the natural mixed forests.
Timber industry officials said that the concerns are groundless and that most logging was being conducted with an eye to the future health not only of the forests but of the industry.
They also acknowledged that in isolated cases, too much timber had been cut too fast with too little thought about what replaced the existing forest. But logging, they said, was the only way to clear old, marginal timber and make way for healthier, newer trees.
"You have a resource that's getting old, and its growth is slowing, and the removals are increasing," said Bob Slocum, executive vice president of the North Carolina Forestry Association, an industry group. "So you might have a period where your removals are exceeding the growth."
Mr. Slocum said it was important to remember that the timber in the South was extensively cut in the early 20th century and that it is again time for harvesting.
"I would argue that the more important issue is what happened to the land after the harvest," he said. "If it stays in forestry, you're going to be O.K. But if you pave it over, if you replace it with a Home Depot or Wal-Mart, it's going to be lost."
Industry critics have cited the speed and scope of the logging in the 13 states as their main concerns.
"The basic fact is that the Southeastern states were ill prepared in the extreme for this incredible acceleration of timber products," said Lark Hayes, who, as a senior lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law Center has helped lead an effort to impose greater controls over timber operations.
Earlier this year, Missouri, under Gov. Mel Carnahan, imposed a two-year moratorium on permits for chip mills. North Carolina is also considering a moratorium, as part of a study ordered by Gov. Jim Hunt.
But it is in small communities like Union Mills where the newest outrage can be heard.
"We're not a bunch of tree huggers, and we do want to use the forest," Caroline J. Edwards, a seventh-generation North Carolina resident who works as a soil scientist and forest management consultant, said in the county seat town of Rutherfordton, N.C., not far from Union Mills. "But we want to use it wisely."
Shannon A. Buckley, who as district procurement forester for Willamette in western North Carolina has been at the center of the local fight, offered a contrasting view that restrictions of logging would be a blow to property rights.
"It's all got to come from a willing seller," Mr. Buckley said of the 300,000 tons of wood chips the mill could produce each year for Willamette's expanding papermaking operations in Kentucky and Tennessee. "If the landowners don't want to sell the wood, it's not going to happen."
Nationally, groups like the Southeast Forest Project have tried to pressure Vice President Al Gore, as an environmental advocate and a native of Tennessee, to address concerns about chip mills and Southern forests.
In his comments, Mr. Dombeck has been careful to point out that the widespread private ownership of Southern forests means that there may be little the government can do.
"These are not public lands I'm talking about, and we will not try to regulate private forest land," Mr. Dombeck said in a recent speech to members of the American Forest and Paper Association. "I challenge you, the world's foremost leaders in private forest management, to show leadership on this issue."
The Southern Resources Assessment, which should be completed next year, is expected to provide a more detailed look at Southern forests. But one picture of the transformation can be gleaned from periodic estimates by the Forest Service, which tries to gauge the nation's timber supply.
In 1977, the studies show, the growth of timber stock in the South exceeded harvests by 75 percent. But by 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the gap had dropped to less than 5 percent, as harvests increased and growth declined.
Among softwoods regionwide, a large surplus in 1977 changed to a deficit of 10 percent. Among hardwoods like oak, hickory and poplar, the surplus has also dropped, prompting researchers to warn that those woods will also fall into deficit within the next decade if the current increase in logging remains unchecked.
And though 20 years ago, about 15 percent of the nation's timber production came from national forests, mostly in the Northwest, that figure has dipped below 5 percent, driven by a series of federal decisions aimed at protecting the environment, and in particular by the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan, crafted to meet a court-ordered directive to save the endangered spotted owl.
As across most of the country, logging in the South takes place far from the cities and the Interstate.
But the view from the air can offer a more vivid picture, exposing one checkerboard after another, with patches of natural forest interspersed by tracts razed to the bare earth, and by others whose uniform green was a telltale sign of a the planting of a single variety of tree.
On one recent afternoon, in the rugged terrain of the Cumberland Plateau, not far from Chattanooga, in southeastern Tennessee, the extent of the leveling was particularly vivid and appeared to support the findings of one federal research project whose conclusions suggested that in particular cases, the broad-brush estimates might not reflect the severity of timber loss.
"It's very clear that, more broadly, no one really yet knows exactly what is going on," said Jonathan Evans, a biologist at the University of the South who is director of the federal project, which focused on impoverished, rural Grundy County and found that the county lost 12 percent of its hardwood habitat from 1981 and 1998.
Among particular points of dispute is whether the chip mills are part of the problem. Only 32 of the more than 150 chip mills existed before 1985, but timber industry officials say the increase represents a step toward efficiency, by making it possible to ship pulpwood to paper mills as chips, instead of as logs.
"There's a demand out there that's going to be met," said Mr. Slocum of the forestry association.
As a corollary benefit, foresters like Mr. Buckley say, the mills provide a market for scrap wood that otherwise would have little commercial value, thus encouraging an overhaul they say is necessary to make way for healthier forests.
But environmental groups and their allies see the mills more as instruments of an assault on Southern forests whose only guide is the corporate bottom line.
The Dogwood Alliance, a group formed to the protect Southern forests, has estimated that more than 1.2 million acres of forest a year, or about 1,500 square miles, is needed to feed the chip mills now in operation.
In operations of that scale, the critics said, neither time nor attention is given to selective logging measures aimed at promoting natural habitat.
"Personally, I've always waited until the trees get big, and only then do I saw them," said Rodney Robbins, 44, a third-generation logger from Union Mills. "But these timber companies only see one way of doing things: they just want to go in and mow everything down."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Whole New World

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
In the 1976 election campaign, Jimmy Carter vowed to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. When Mr. Carter won, the first words he had to eat were his vow to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea, as Congress and the allies revolted against him.
Should George W. Bush win, it is useful to consider how different a world he and his foreign policy advisers would confront from the last time Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Condi Rice and Paul Wolfowitz were in office with President Bush eight years ago. The book on Governor Bush is that while he doesn't know much about the world, his advisers -- who were all his father's advisers -- are experts. That is true, but many are experts in a world that doesn't exist anymore: We do not have a cold-war global system anymore, we don't have a cold-war military and we don't have a cold-war public. In short, this ain't your father's foreign policy. The players may be the same, but the world isn't. Here are five things President Bush could never have taught his son about the world: 
 1. While America was certainly a superpower when President Bush left office, its economy was just coming out of stagnation and the Soviet Union had just collapsed. Today, America is not just a superpower, it's a hyperpower, with both unrivaled military might and an information economy that is the envy of the world.
What's new in all this is that while other countries still call for U.S. leadership, they envy and resent America more than ever. No one wants to be America's enemy, but few want to be perceived as its friend. And what that means is that if Mr. Bush tries out some of the more macho-unilateralist policies talked about by his advisers -- such as abrogating the ABM treaty or sponsoring an uprising in Iraq -- he will face a ferocious reaction from U.S. rivals and allies alike.
For instance, because of U.S. economic sanctions on Iraq, Saddam Hussein is now more popular than ever on the Arab street. Indeed, I am sorry to report, a huge cheer would go up from the Arab street today if Iraq were to acquire nuclear weapons to counterbalance the U.S. and Israel.
2. President Bush had to manage the waxing military power of China, the waning military power of the Soviet Union and the soaring economic power of Japan. What U.S. foreign policy is about today is managing the weakness of China, the weakness of Russia and the weakness of Japan, as all three go through the wrenching internal adjustments to globalization that have made their possible collapse more threatening to us than their strength. In the Bush years, U.S. officials liked to say "We lead, Japan pays." Now we must lead and pay.
3. The Internet did not exist as a foreign policy tool when President Bush left office. Today, it's huge. Jody Williams won the Nobel Peace Prize for organizing a global ban on land mines -- against the wishes of the major powers -- using e-mail. If Governor Bush really did try to abrogate the ABM treaty unilaterally, and cram it down the throats of the Russians and Europeans, I believe it could trigger a Seattle-like, Internet-driven, mass-based, anti-nuclear protest against the U.S. -- identical to the popular movement in Europe today against America's genetically modified foods. This could make it impossible for any NATO ally to cooperate with the U.S. on missile defenses.
4. America was a deficit country when President Bush left office, and now it is a surplus country. That means that the Republican ethos of steadily cutting back government, and the foreign affairs budget, is not only unnecessary, it's reckless, and it will be perceived by the world as increasingly selfish.
Indeed, it's easy for the Bushies to sneer that they won't be the world's 911 or global cops, but such aloofness is much harder in practice now that America is so dominant. As the Clintonites discovered, we are now held responsible for everything, but Americans don't want to die for virtually anything. So finding ways to make a sustainable difference in places such as Kosovo or Rwanda is a lot harder than uttering a sound bite.
5. Globalization: The speed, interconnectivity and economic impact of global markets today is much greater than eight years ago. If Mr. Bush does try a deep tax cut that the markets perceive as reckless, their judgment on him will be nasty, brutish and swift -- swifter than he may ever imagine.
Other than that -- nothing's changed.

HEADLINE: Those Shocking Electric Bills

 BODY:
Many New Yorkers stared at their electric bills this month in confusion and disbelief. The cost of electricity distributed by Consolidated Edison in June went up about 40 percent over last year. July's bills are expected to be 30 percent higher than a year ago -- all despite a summer so temperate that even fans cooled lazily on their lowest speed.
The reasons for this sudden spike in electric costs include not only higher fuel prices but also dramatic increases in the use of electricity because of the booming economy and no comparable increase in the amount of power being produced. But the main underlying cause is the deregulation of the power industry in New York and many other states in the last few years. Over the long haul, deregulation is supposed to usher in lower prices by giving consumers the chance to shop around for their energy supply the way they shop around for their telephone service. But while deregulation was being debated in state legislatures across the country, power companies, uncertain of what a deregulated market would look like, held back on building new power plants. 
 Thus occurred a shortfall in reserves just when demand was rising. In the short term, there may not be a lot that New York can do about this. But in the medium and long term, if energy prices are going to drop the way deregulation proponents promised, the state's task is clear. It needs to encourage the building of new, efficient and environmentally sound power plants. Meanwhile, Con Ed should also find ways to expand transmission lines, especially in New York City and Long Island, to help bring in electricity from outside the region.
There is some suspicion that New York's problems have been aggravated by policies specific to Con Edison, which is still the primary distributor of power in the New York metropolitan region. Con Ed officials have repeatedly said that the cost of their distribution has not gone up, only the cost of electricity that they now buy and pass along to consumers. Still, Senator Charles Schumer and the New York State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, have begun asking important questions about whether the Public Service Commission does enough to encourage lower prices at every stage in the process.
These and other critics also argue that the Public Service Commission should move quickly to give consumers a fair share of the money Con Ed received from the sale of its many power plants under deregulation -- one way to cut future costs to consumers. In addition, there is a bill on Gov. George Pataki's desk that blocks Con Ed from requiring its own customers to pay more than $600,000 a day for additional electricity to replace that lost by a shutdown at its Indian Point plant since February. Signing this bill would give more relief to ratepayers than an alternative proposal from Con Ed to deal with the Indian Point problems.
New York is not the only area struggling with difficult energy questions this summer. Deregulation has caused upheaval around the country, and each state has come up with a different recipe for transition into a freer energy market. California, where few new power plants are coming on line and demand is rapidly outstripping supply, has already warned consumers of the possibility of rolling blackouts this summer. With a nasty heat wave, New York could find itself in much the same fix.

HEADLINE: Big Apple Circus Cries Foul at Ringling's New Holiday Show

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
And now, ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages, direct your attention to the stupendous holiday war between two big-top circuses.
For the first time the City of New York will permit the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus to raise a custom-made Italian tent in Bryant Park to present a high-end, one-ring, family-oriented circus during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. After eight months of deliberation, the mayor's office, the Parks Department and the Bryant Park Conservancy have given Ringling their blessing. 
 But for 23 years a feisty hometown show, the Big Apple Circus, has become a holiday entertainment tradition by raising its custom-made French tent in Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center to present its own upscale, one-ring, family-oriented circus.
The Ringling show hopes to turn a profit, and Big Apple -- a nonprofit organization -- is crying foul.
"It could be an enormous financial blow to us, because the Lincoln Center season is key in providing income for the Big Apple Circus," said Alan B. Slifka, a Big Apple board member who was its first board chairman.
Mr. Slifka said "it is possible that we could be driven out of existence," adding that "we hope that this decision will be reconsidered by the mayor as the serious threat to our circus that it is."
Mark Green, the public advocate, wrote a letter last week to Rudy Washington, deputy mayor for Business Services and Community Development, urging the city to reschedule the performance of the Ringling one-ring show because "we are dealing with a small potential audience, and this conflict risks diminishing both events," he said in an interview.
The new circus, called Barnum's Kaleidoscape, was created 16 months ago by Ringling and has visited 12 American cities.
Kenneth Feld, Ringling's 51-year-old producer and chief executive, said Kaleidoscape would be "the ultimate Christmas ornament for New York City," referring to the champagne-colored tent with its red stars and stripes. The elaborately produced, $10 million show offers the comforts of crushed-velvet padded seats with backs, and red-carpeted hardwood flooring, as well as premier "couch" seating at $75 a head.
Customers will be welcomed by costumed ticket-takers and ushers, and will be encouraged to buy not only cotton candy and popcorn, but also high-end fare ranging from panini sandwiches to designer water.
"It is the right kind of entertainment for that time of year," said Michael Fuchs, chairman of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, the nonprofit group that oversees the park.
The Kaleidoscape crew will erect its reception tent around the fountain in Bryant Park. Like all attractions using the park, Ringling is contractually obligated to replace any damaged grass or shrubbery.
Kaleidoscape will also return part of every ticket sale to the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, the total amounting to "several hundred thousand dollars," Mr. Feld said.
Several city managers with knowledge of the deal said that Ringling had guaranteed the park a minimum of $200,000 for the run.
At Lincoln Center, Big Apple will hold the debut of its new show, "Clown Around Town," from Oct. 19 through Jan. 7, charging $18 to $62 for seats. The show features 12 horses and 2 dogs; some 120 of its 140 performers and crew members live in the city.
Kaleidoscape will charge $20 to $75 for seats. It will raise its tent on Nov. 16 and have its debut on Nov. 21, two days before Thanksgiving Day. The closing performance will be New Year's Eve. It has 62 performers, 54 crew members, 8 horses and 27 geese. Only the show's musical composer, Linda Hudes, is a New Yorker.
Paul Binder, the 57-year-old founder and artistic director of Big Apple, said he did not want to be quoted "in a sour grapes way" about Kaleidoscape, which he has seen and said is "extraordinary."
Mr. Binder added: "I love the show, and I love the performers in that show. I am only sorry that they have chosen to compete with us."
Mr. Slifka was not as sanguine. "For New York to invite Ringling in to crush the Big Apple Circus," he said, "it's almost as if the city invited a for-profit opera company to come in and compete with the Metropolitan Opera."
Mr. Fuchs said that "we weren't trying to harm the Big Apple Circus," adding that the city "no longer puts money into Bryant Park, so we are dependent on the money we can bring in," namely, fees for such activities as fashion shows, concerts and movie-screening nights.
Mr. Feld's personal connection with Mr. Fuchs helped cement the deal. The Kaleidoscape proposal "seemed to our staff so out of the ordinary that it sort of got turned down automatically," said Mr. Fuchs, formerly the president of HBO.
But he said that when Ringling came back to him: "I knew Ken, and I said we'd look into it. The more we got into it, the more we thought it was a good idea."
Ultimately, he said, the go-ahead was given by the office of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during the last few weeks. Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern declined comment.
"Initially I was concerned about elephants and lions in the park," said Deputy Mayor Washington, who explained his involvement by saying that the approval was "a parks function, and parks reports to me."
"But when we learned that it would be geese, and horses, that wasn't a problem," he said. "We deal all the time with mounted police."
Mr. Washington said that Big Apple "shouldn't be upset," because "it's not as if each show will have an audience of 20,000 people." He added, "The audiences for each circus are so small that everyone can do well, and help our economy."
Big Apple plays to 450,000 annual circusgoers in Damrosch Park, paying several hundred thousand dollars a year to Lincoln Center for the privilege. Big Apple estimates that it turns back a third of its $19 million yearly budget to city community programs, health institutions and charities. "Any money that Feld takes out of our box office," Mr. Binder said, "is lost to the children and the families of the city of New York."
For years Big Apple has done fund-raisers for city charities and other nonprofits like Mount Sinai and Montefiore Hospitals. It runs the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit, which sends 25 trained clowns into seven city hospitals to perform for sick children.
It teaches circus arts to inner-city schoolchildren and gives free performances for blind and hearing impaired children and donates 50,000 free tickets to poor children.
Mr. Slifka, a principal at a Manhattan investment management firm, contended that Ringling chose New York "to cripple the Big Apple Circus."
"There are probably 50 other cities that Ringling could invade that don't have not-for-profit circuses," he said. "The only reason for them to come at Christmastime is to compete with us."
But Mr. Feld said he chose the city because "New York is the ultimate goal of any entertainment attraction." He hopes it will attract attention for future additional Ringling one-ring shows intended to tour the United States and foreign countries.
Ringling, however, has its own claim to New York tradition. "Its three-ring circuses have played in Manhattan back into the last century," said Greg Parkinson, a circus historian who is the executive director of the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis., "and there was P. T. Barnum's American Museum," a forerunner of the Ringling show established in Lower Manhattan in 1842.
The arrival of Kaleidoscape will be "the first time that Ringling has pitched a tent in Manhattan," Mr. Feld said, as the Ringling show has for decades occupied Madison Square Garden in its various incarnations. Big Apple bills itself as the city's original tented circus, since of the 18 circuses that played New York before its arrival, all performed in buildings.
If Mr. Slifka termed the battle of the circuses David and Goliath, Big Apple, which was founded in 1977, is hardly an impoverished neophyte. It bolsters its $19 million budget with yearly tours to nine cities including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and Washington. Nevertheless, Mr. Slifka said that Big Apple "operates on a very tight budget."
But Mr. Parkinson, the historian, said that in the winter season, "Paris is able to support five competing circuses, which all seem to do well." He added: "I can understand Big Apple's sensitivity to the arrival of another one-ring circus in New York, but a competitive rivalry could lead to near-record sales for both circuses. New York is a very big city."
If Mr. Feld brought Kaleidoscape to Manhattan in the spring, he would be competing with his own three-ring extravaganza, scheduled to return to Madison Square Garden next March 30.
The holidays were "the only time Bryant Park was available," Mr. Feld said, given the summer and fall fashion shows and the peak occupancy by visitors during the summer, "and it is the time of year when people want to see things."
But Mr. Fuchs of Bryant Park Restoration said that "for our purposes they could come in during February," adding, "we felt O.K. about any time in the winter."
Kaleidoscape will feature David Larible, who was for years a star clown of Ringling's three-ring performances, as well as Sylvia Zerbini, who performs on the trapeze and with horses, and Alex Petrov, a wire walker who balances a spangled lady atop his head on a 12-foot pole.
Ringling executives have confirmed that Mr. Feld spent $10 million to start Kaleidoscape, but several circus marketing experts said under the condition of anonymity that the company had spent more than $20 million thus far on its one-ring venture without turning an overall profit, partly because of the show's elaborate sets and its luxury seating, which require transport by a staggering 50 trucks.
But Mr. Feld insisted that Kaleidoscape "is going to be a major profit center for this company."
And although Ringling has only a one-year contract to bring the circus to Bryant Park, Mr. Feld said that Kaleidoscape hopes to return "year after year."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
The Negatives Of Recycling In New York

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
DURING the 1990's, defenders of the city's costly recycling program deflected criticism with a mantra: just wait until Fresh Kills closes. Once the city lost that cheap place to dump trash, they predicted, recycling would become the most practical alternative.
Fresh Kills is now set to close, and the Department of Sanitation has done the number-crunching for a new plan. The trash that is now shipped by open barges to Staten Island will be loaded into airtight containers, then shipped by barge or rail to other states. 
 The new environmental precautions, shipping expenses and landfill fees will indeed raise the cost of burying trash. But somehow recycling will still be even more expensive, according to the department's projections.
Collecting recyclable material costs more than collecting trash, because there's less material to pick up at each stop, and the materials themselves aren't worth enough to offset that expense. The city receives only $5 to $10 per ton of paper, and it must pay recycling companies $45 per ton to accept metal, glass and plastics.
The Department of Sanitation projects that in fiscal year 2002, even assuming the recycling program becomes more efficient, it will cost the city about $12.5 million: an extra $13 for each of the nearly one million tons that are to be recycled instead of buried.
The city's recycling program was begun in 1993 with the expectation of saving money. The City Council formally declared recycling to be "economically desirable" and even issued a five-year plan mandating precisely how many tons were to be recycled annually.
But the budget savings projected by the sanitation department were replaced by "incremental costs," as the sanitation department noted in several studies during the 1990's computing how much extra it was spending per year to recycle material rather than bury it. The added annual expense ranged from $70 million to $127 million.
That means that if New Yorkers had simply thrown away all their garbage instead of sorting paper and washing out bottles and cans during the last seven years, the city would have saved at least $500 million. The savings would have been enough to build a dozen new public schools or to put $15,000 worth of computers in each existing classroom. It might have been used to increase the parks department's operating budget by about 50 percent each year.
City officials now acknowledge that past projections were too optimistic, but they expect recycling to become more cost-efficient as more New Yorkers sort their garbage. "The gap is narrowing between recycling and landfilling," said Robert Lange, director of the sanitation department's Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling. "Within the next decade it will be cheaper to recycle."
Perhaps this time the optimistic projections will be correct, but there are still reasons for doubt. The planners are assuming that New Yorkers, who now recycle 20 percent of their trash, will raise that rate to 25 percent by 2002 and then go still higher.
MAYBE they will, but maybe they'll just tire of working as unpaid garbage sorters, especially if they realize how little the end product is worth. Recycling becomes hopelessly uneconomical if, unlike the department's planners, you account for the time and space that New Yorkers are forced to donate to recycling. Paying for that labor and storage space would add at least $1,500 per ton to the cost of recycling, by my calculations.
Even recycling's environmental justifications can be problematic, at least on the local level, since the program creates more truck traffic and therefore more air pollution. If there were no recycling program, the city would need fewer trucks over all for curbside collections, because trucks work more efficiently when they pick up all the trash at once instead of in two or three separate collections.
There would also be no need for the private trucks that now carry recyclables from sorting centers here to recycling plants outside the city. Instead, all the trash would make a single relatively short truck trip to a local transfer station for shipment by barge or rail.
Many environmentalists would say that any local drawbacks are outweighed by the global benefits of recycling, but the value of those benefits is debatable. After spending half a billion dollars and donating countless hours of free labor to a program that's still uneconomical, some New Yorkers might prefer to heed the environmental tenet, Think globally, act locally.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE RECORD;
Senator Often Stands To Right of His Party

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
In his two terms in the Senate, Joseph I. Lieberman has often taken positions at odds with Vice President Al Gore and important constituencies of the Democratic Party on school vouchers, affirmative action, regulation of managed care, capital gains taxes and product liability.
He has sided with the Clinton administration on all important budget votes, and unlike many other Democrats he has supported the administration's positions on trade and welfare. 
 Senator Lieberman's views are completely in tune with the vice president's on abortion, the environment, gun control, gay rights and the death penalty.
On Social Security, a central point of conflict between Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Lieberman has suggested that he could support allowing workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the private markets. That is Mr. Bush's position. But Mr. Lieberman has never been faced with a vote on the matter and never made explicit what kind of investments he would allow and in what circumstances.
He has usually supported the Clinton administration on foreign policy issues, and in 1991, Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Gore, who was then a senator, were among only 10 Democratic senators who voted to give President George Bush the authority to use military force in the Persian Gulf.
When he has opposed the Clinton administration, Mr. Lieberman has invariably taken a more conservative stance, often the one held by Republicans.
For example, since he first entered the Senate, Mr. Lieberman has supported and sponsored legislation establishing pilot programs in which the federal government would give parents vouchers they could use to pay their children's tuition at private schools, including those with religious affiliation.
Mr. Gore has argued that such programs could undermine public schools. Teachers' unions, which are important supporters of Democratic causes and contributors to Democratic candidates, strenuously oppose vouchers. And many Democrats believe that vouchers violate the doctrine of separation of church and state.
Mainly because of Democratic opposition, no voucher plan has ever become law.
But in testimony in 1997 before a Senate committee about schools in the District of Columbia, Mr. Lieberman declared: "There are some who dismiss suggestions of school choice programs and charter schools out of hand, direly predicting that these approaches will 'ruin' the public schools. The undeniable reality here is that this system is already in ruins, and to blindly reject new models and refuse to try new ideas is simply foolish. We can and must do better for these children, and to cling stubbornly to the failures of the past will just not get us there."
Similarly, Mr. Lieberman has been critical of programs that give special breaks to blacks and other groups to make up for past discrimination. Mr. Gore has been a strong supporter of affirmative action.
In a speech on the Senate floor in 1995, Mr. Lieberman said: "Affirmative action is dividing us in ways its creators could never have intended because most Americans who do support equal opportunity and are not biased don't think it is fair to discriminate against some Americans as a way to make up for historic discrimination against other Americans. For after all, if you discriminate in favor of one group on the basis of race, you thereby discriminate against another group on the basis of race."
On managed care, Mr. Lieberman was part of a bipartisan group that tried last year to break a deadlock between the Clinton administration and Republican senators over how to regulate health plans. The administration maintained that the legislation Mr. Lieberman favored would have been too generous to insurance companies. Consumer groups and labor unions were among those siding with the administration.
In the early 1990's, when Democratic senators used a filibuster to block the Bush administration's proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax, Senator Lieberman opposed his party's leaders and voted with Republicans against the filibuster and in favor of the tax cut.
Mr. Lieberman has also regularly voted for legislation to limit damages that can be assessed in civil lawsuits. In doing so, he took on not just the Clinton administration but also trial lawyers, who are among the Democrats' biggest contributors.
Many of Mr. Lieberman's friends said he had no alternative but to take this position because it was the one favored by the insurance industry. The industry is important to Connecticut's economy and has generously donated to Mr. Lieberman's campaigns over the years.
But that is not Mr. Lieberman's explanation for his stand. At a news conference last year, he said the American system of civil law had "gone way off track and become a lottery in which literally a few people do very well but most of the people injured don't really get adequately compensated."
His vote in 1996 in favor of overhauling the welfare system lost him friends among liberal Democrats. And his consistent support of international trade measures like the North American Free Trade Agreement and favorable trade relations with China runs against the views of organized labor.
On the other hand, on other issues of primary importance to the unions like increases in the minimum wage and prohibitions against employers' hiring permanent replacements for striking workers, Mr. Lieberman has taken labor's side.
Throughout his career in Congress, Mr. Lieberman has voted for proposals to overhaul the campaign finance system. Most recently, he supported legislation that would ban unregulated gifts to political parties, known as soft money, a position also backed by Vice President Gore.
Republicans tried today to portray Mr. Lieberman as less than 100 percent in favor of abortion rights. They produced a letter he wrote to a constituent in 1989 suggesting that he favored a requirement that parents of a minor be notified before an abortion could be performed.
But the organizations here that favor abortion rights said Mr. Lieberman had never wavered in his votes on abortion, and the National Right to Life Committee put out a statement criticizing Mr. Lieberman's record across the board.
On national security issues, Mr. Lieberman has regularly voted against efforts to reduce the military budget and has supported submarines and aircraft built at least in part by the many military contractors in Connecticut. Until the Clinton administration took office, Mr. Lieberman favored cutting funds for the Star Wars missile defense system, but recently he was one of the first Democrats to endorse deployment of such a system as soon as it was technologically realistic.
The one time he challenged the Clinton administration on a major foreign policy matter was in 1995, when he and Bob Dole cosponsored legislation requiring the president to break the United Nations embargo on sending arms to Bosnia.

HEADLINE: Bear Stearns Settles Case Accusing It of Bad Advice

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
The Bear Stearns Companies has closed the books on one of the darker chapters in its history as an investment bank by writing a check for $30 million.
Bear Stearns, the sixth-biggest United States securities firm, paid that amount to settle a lawsuit over its role as an adviser on an ill-fated takeover, lawyers involved in the case said yesterday. The case sent tremors through Wall Street two years ago when a federal jury in California found the firm was negligent in the way it advised its client, the Daisy Systems Corporation, on a 1989 purchase of Cadnetix Inc. 
 The jury awarded $108 million in damages to the shareholders of the two companies, both of which are now defunct. That was easily the biggest award against an investment bank for giving bad advice in a merger or acquisition, and it held up other bankers' opinions to the scrutiny of jurors, securities law experts said.
Lawyers for the creditors of Daisy Systems, a software company, had argued that Bear Stearns contributed to the failure of the companies by telling them that it was "highly confident" that it could line up financing for the highly leveraged transaction, said John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, who testified as an expert witness in the original trial. When the firm failed to arrange bank loans, Daisy Systems had to borrow at interest rates higher than it could afford, Mr. Coffee said.
The judge later reduced the award to $36 million, but Bear Stearns and the bankruptcy trustee for Daisy Systems appealed that decision. Then, as those appeals headed for a midsummer hearing, Bear Stearns agreed to settle the case for even less. It paid $30 million and withdrew a bankruptcy court claim for $2.5 million in investment banking fees, said J. Thomas Hannan, a lawyer in San Francisco for the trustee.
"It's a lot better than paying out $108 million -- and they had use of the money for two years," said James Linn, a lawyer in Oklahoma City who defended Bear Stearns. "Bear Stearns wanted to be rid of the case, and the plaintiffs wanted to be rid of the case."
Mr. Linn also defended Bear Stearns in a case in which a wealthy, Canadian currency trader won a $167 million award against the firm in May. A hearing for an appeal of that judgment, for which the firm took a $96 million charge against its earnings last quarter, is scheduled for Sept. 28 in United States District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Linn said.
By settling, Bear Stearns averted the possibility of having to pay much more, even having the original $108 million award restored, Mr. Coffee said. But, he added, the firm also ruled out the chance of having an appellate panel completely throw out the original decision by finding there was not sufficient evidence to hold Bear Stearns liable.
"People in the investment banking industry who weren't facing this liability were hoping that it would be reversed," Mr. Coffee said.
They fear increased liability for what they say in the "fairness opinions" they render on all mergers and acquisitions, he said. Corporate directors insist on having investment bankers sign off on proposed transactions to shield them from liability if shareholders sue.
"Investment bankers make very high fees for giving these opinions," in part, because "the law places great weight on obtaining these opinions," Mr. Coffee said. "As a matter of public policy, we want some risk of liability to attach to these opinions or else they're likely to be fabricated."
Mr. Hannan, the lawyer for the trustee, said the case was notable because "two companies died but the creditors will recover" some of their losses and because it laid down guidelines for the responsibilities of investment bankers in mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Coffee said the jury had found that investment bankers, like doctors in medical matters, play a pivotal role in mergers and can be liable for malpractice.
The settlement is unlikely to have much of an effect on Bear Stearns's earnings because the firm had already set aside money to cover the larger, original damage award and will be able to use what is left of that reserve to cover other legal costs.
"There could be some reversal" of the legal reserve in the next quarter, said Joan Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, "but I would not imagine that it would be a total reversal. They could either fully release the reserve or find some other use for it."

Ruling by Arbitrator Splits Arthur Andersen in Two
An international arbitrator ruled that the world's largest consulting firm could separate from the the world's largest accounting firm.
The ruling frees Andersen Consulting, with 65,000 employees, from its parent company, which now consists entirely of Arthur Andersen, a tax and auditing firm with 77,000 employees. In exchange, Andersen Consulting will have to give up its name and pay Arthur Andersen $1 billion. Analysts called the decision, coming at the end of a three-year battle, a major victory for the consultants. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Michigan Pact Resolves Battle Over Limits on Indian Fishing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: PESHAWBESTOWN, Mich., Aug. 7

 BODY:
The federal government, the State of Michigan and five American Indian tribes in northern Michigan signed an agreement today aimed at rebuilding fish populations in the upper Great Lakes and improving strained relations between whites and Indians in upstate Michigan.
The pact settles 27 years of litigation over whether the state can restrict Indian fishing, people involved in the negotiations said. 
 A vibrant national economy has created a boom in vacation homes and tourism here in the northern third of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. The accompanying surge in pleasure boating and recreational fishing has increased tensions between whites and Indians, as pleasure boats become dangerously entangled in Indian nets and charter boat operators blame the Indian fishermen for depleting trout and salmon populations.
Some Indian nets have been sabotaged, state officials say. Indian leaders have denied that they are responsible for declining fish stocks and have angrily denounced what they have described as efforts to take away some of the few ancestral rights they retain.
Today's pact calls for the tribes to reduce sharply their use of large-mesh gill nets, which kill fish of various sizes and species and can entangle boats. The Indians are to replace gill nets with trap nets, which catch fish more discriminately and are less likely to entangle other boats. The state government will pay $17 million to buy boats equipped with trap nets and fishing permits from white-owned companies and give them to Indian fishermen to replace boats with gill nets. The trap-net fishing permits are mainly for remote areas of northwestern Lake Michigan and northern Lake Huron, pulling Indian fishermen far from Michigan's main recreational boating and fishing areas.
The federal government will pay an additional $8.3 million to the five tribal governments. The tribes are expected to use some or all of the money to compensate small-scale Indian fishing operations, which will not receive the trap-net boats but will face restrictions on gill-net fishing for the next 20 years. Use of large-mesh gill nets by non-Indians has been heavily restricted since 1968.
The dispute has been particularly acrimonious here in this Indian community and eight miles west in the mainly white town of Leland. Both towns are on the northwest shore of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, 220 miles northwest of Detroit.
For whites like John Lindenau, who stood on the dock in Leland this morning next to his 30-foot charter fishing boat, the Infinity, the dispute has been about imposing the same rules on Indians that white fishermen must meet. "We won the Indian wars and gave it all away," Mr. Lindenau said.
But here in Peshawbestown, on the tiny reservation of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, the agreement is the cause of considerable bitterness. "The Grand Traverse Band hesitantly, really hesitantly agreed to sign off on the deal," said Ardith Chambers, one of seven members of the tribal council, as she sat glumly in her office this afternoon. "All the state wants to do is take apart treaty rights, and so does the federal government."
The five tribes ceded the upper third of Michigan's Lower Peninsula and the eastern half of Michigan's Upper Peninsula to the federal government in the Treaty of Washington, concluded in 1836. That treaty allowed the Indians to continue fishing in the region, but allowed non-Indian fishing, too. The Indians have used the treaty to oppose efforts by the state to limit Indian fishing, because the treaty was signed a year before Michigan became a state.
The Grand Traverse Band has only a dozen fishermen left. Most will lose their livelihoods because they do not catch enough fish to qualify for trap-net boats from the state, and they will face new restrictions on the use of gill nets, Ms. Chambers said.
The Grand Traverse Band agreed to the pact because it is engaged in a separate dispute with the state over its main livelihood, the Turtle Creek Casino, a few miles east of Traverse City. The tribe is so dependent on the casino that it felt compelled to accept the fishing deal.
Unlike the other four northern Michigan tribes, the Grand Traverse Band is far from the trap-net fishing grounds being established. The pact was signed tonight in Brimley.
Drivers along the coastal highway here in northern Michigan find that Peshawbestown, with its battered trailers and small wood houses, is a sharp contrast to other communities. The coastline elsewhere has numerous million-dollar homes, many new.
Leland has older houses, and has been a center of white fishing since the late 1800's; the old wood fishing shanties and smokehouses of its Fishtown neighborhood are popular with tourists. Leland fishermen say that the trout population has plunged in recent years, and blame two large, Indian gill-net boats moored this morning at the Leland dock.
But Indian officials attribute the fish shortage to environmental factors, like unusually warm lake water in recent years.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
LIEBERMAN WILL RUN WITH GORE; FIRST JEW ON A MAJOR U.S. TICKET

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore picked Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut to be his running mate today, putting a Jew on a national ticket of a major party for the first time and choosing the first prominent Democrat to chastise President Clinton openly for his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
Mr. Gore is to announce his decision formally at a rally here at noon on Tuesday. 
 Mr. Lieberman was one of five candidates to be vetted by a corps of lawyers over the last two months and emerged as Mr. Gore's choice early this morning, after the vice president huddled for hours with top aides and family members at a hotel suite here.
Gore aides said Mr. Lieberman brought a sense of moral rectitude to the ticket as well as a seriousness of purpose, qualities that Mr. Gore was intent on seeking after Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican rival, chose Dick Cheney, the former secretary of defense, as his running mate.
Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state, who led Mr. Gore's selection process, said in an interview today that Mr. Bush's choice had influenced Mr. Gore.
"Cheney meant that the vice president's choice would be measured by a standard of seriousness reflected by his record," Mr. Christopher said.
But the comments of the Gore camp, laced with words like "integrity" and "rectitude," also seemed to reflect their desire to use Mr. Lieberman to move their candidate away from the scandals of the Clinton administration, which provided a theme of the recent Republican National Convention.
"If you look at both men, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, they're both people who throughout their lives made the right choices," said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. "Both led very responsible lives and are people who, when faced with tough choices, have time and time again made the right choice."
Mr. Lieberman has also been a vigorous advocate of campaign finance reform, and he recently supported legislation that would ban unregulated donations to political parties. His record on the issue could clearly benefit Mr. Gore, whose aggressive fund-raising efforts in 1996 are expected to be the subject of Republican attacks in the fall.
But in choosing Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Gore has also picked a running mate whose record on several issues, from school vouchers to capital gains taxes, is more conservative than the vice president's. Page A19.
Although reporters were informed of Mr. Gore's choice around dawn, Mr. Gore did not formally offer the spot to Mr. Lieberman until shortly before noon, catching him on his cell phone as he drove into his driveway in New Haven after giving a speech to the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O.
"That was the call," Mr. Lieberman told reporters waiting at his house. "It was directly from Al Gore."
He said the two had said a short prayer together.
Mr. Gore chose Mr. Lieberman over several other senators, including John Edwards of North Carolina, whose only governmental experience was two years in the Senate, and John Kerry of Massachusetts, whose liberal voting record would surely have become an inviting target for the Republicans.
Also vetted were Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.
Mr. Lieberman, a 58-year-old Orthodox Jew, is known on the national stage chiefly as the first Democrat to condemn President Clinton in the Lewinsky affair, when he took to the Senate floor and branded Mr. Clinton's behavior "immoral." Mr. Gore, who did not criticize the president throughout the impeachment process, has had a difficult time in his campaign distancing himself from Mr. Clinton's personal behavior, in part because he has also sought to associate himself with the president's positive job performance and the booming economy.
The choice of Mr. Lieberman, Gore advisers said, recognizes that the Republicans will try to make the president's character a campaign issue, and they hope the move will shield Mr. Gore from such attacks.
Gore advisers said the decision, and its timing, a week before the opening of the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, also was grounded in Mr. Gore's recognition that he needed to do something to shake up the race. The latest polls show Mr. Gore trailing Mr. Bush by as much as 17 percentage points.
The Gore campaign portrayed the selection of Mr. Lieberman as a bold choice because of its historical nature in naming the first Jew to a national ticket, but questions were raised early on and again last night about whether Mr. Lieberman's religion would work against him.
At the same time, aides said they believed that the decision would demonstrate something the campaign had been trying to convey for months: that Mr. Gore is a "principled fighter" who will stand up for those who have been discriminated against.
Mr. Christopher said that the question of Mr. Lieberman's religion had been raised but that Mr. Gore "shut it down."
Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said Mr. Gore was aiming his selection at independent voters and the 15 percent of the electorate that liked Mr. Clinton professionally but not personally. Mr. Hart also said Mr. Lieberman, with his "moral absolutism," could appeal to supporters of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president.
"Gore is saying, 'I have to find a way of talking to the middle and getting to the middle,' " he said.
The centrist message that Mr. Lieberman sends was an important consideration for Mr. Gore.
Mr. Gore began interviewing potential running mates in mid-July and had completed them by July 25. He interviewed Mr. Lieberman in Washington at the vice president's residence, where four of the five candidates were sneaked passed television cameras. He interviewed the fifth candidate in New York.
An overriding factor for Mr. Gore was that he pick someone who could become president on a moment's notice. This became more imperative, advisers said, after Mr. Bush picked Mr. Cheney. Although Gore advisers saw immediate weaknesses in Mr. Cheney's voting record, they also saw that Mr. Bush had picked someone whose ability to step into the Oval Office would not be questioned.
In an interview today, Mr. Christopher said Mr. Gore had chosen Mr. Lieberman for several reasons. He said he valued his independence. He said the two were personally compatible. And, he said, Mr. Gore regarded Mr. Lieberman as "a symbol of rectitude."
"Gore could visualize his being a very wise counselor in the White House," Mr. Christopher said. "People in the Senate have a very high regard for the values he brings to decisions," he said, adding, "He conveys a very serious purpose."
The final selection process spanned several hours on Sunday, when Mr. Gore met at his hotel suite here beginning at 3:30 p.m. with top aides and family members.
Mr. Gore made his decision after midnight. Some in the room asked him if he wanted to sleep on it. He said no.
Mr. Lieberman said he awoke to news reports that he had been chosen. Monica Dixon, a Gore adviser, told Mr. Lieberman's staff that the reports were based on statements by Democratic officials, but Mr. Lehane said she had not told them whether the accounts were true. When the cameras caught up with him midmorning, the senator said he was still awaiting the call. But he was confident enough to be overjoyed, saying, "Miracles happen."

HEADLINE: United States Is Worried About an Increased Threat of Nuclear Conflict Over Kashmir

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER and JAMES RISEN 

 BODY:
Behind President Clinton's blunt warning last spring that South Asia was the world's most perilous region lay an assessment from American intelligence agencies that the likelihood of a war between India and Pakistan that could erupt into a nuclear conflict had increased significantly, according to officials with access to the secret intelligence.
The officials said that the Central Intelligence Agency and the nation's other intelligence organizations had reached their consensus after examining the nuclear capacities of both countries and the growing tensions between them, in particular over the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. 
 The assessment, known as a National Intelligence Estimate, began late last summer after Pakistan-backed militants crossed over the high mountain peaks of Kashmir into the Indian-controlled area of Kargil, setting off weeks of heavy fighting that included airstrikes.
At that time, the administration grew fearful that the conflict could escalate into a nuclear exchange, officials said, citing both states' relatively poor intelligence about each other's intentions and movements and their lack of direct communications.
"The Kargil episode really got everyone's attention," said George Perkovich, deputy director of the W. Alton Jones Foundation and the author of "India's Nuclear Bomb," published last year by the University of California.
Several analysts who took part in drafting the assessment said the report had succeeded in underscoring the importance of working to ease political tensions between two rivals that have fought three wars in the 50 years since their independence. In the past, the administration had focused mainly on trying to stop the development and spread of nuclear weapons on the subcontinent.
Last week, for instance, President Clinton talked by telephone with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India, who is due on a state visit next month, said Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser. Mr. Berger added that he himself talks with Pakistan's military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, as part of the dialogue with Islamabad.
President Clinton received the intelligence assessment shortly before his first visit to South Asia in March. And he clearly reflected the report's conclusions when he twice called the Indian subcontinent "the most dangerous place in the world." India's president scolded Mr. Clinton and called the description "alarmist."
After the Kargil episode, the assessment, which remains secret, concluded that there was a sharply increased chance of a nonnuclear military conflict between India and Pakistan, possibly erupting into a nuclear exchange.
The chances of such a nonnuclear conflict, one White House official said, were put in the "50-50 range."
"The likelihood of a nuclear conflict goes up and down," said another official. "It's less important to assign a probability to it than to warn senior officials that there is a serious threat here that demands immediate and focused attention and action."
The assessment contained no specific guidance on what the administration could do to reduce tensions, according to those familiar with the document. But Mr. Clinton and other top officials have urged senior Indian and Pakistani officials in public and private meetings to open a direct political dialogue and give up their nuclear programs, warning them of the growing peril of an accidental or deliberate nuclear exchange.
While administration officials agreed that Mr. Clinton's visit helped ease some tensions, neither country has signaled that it intends to halt development of the arsenals the two countries revealed to the world by exploding nuclear devices in quick succession in 1998.
India continues to see its nuclear arsenal as necessary for its status as an emerging power and to deter not only Pakistan but also neighboring China, an ally of Pakistan. Pakistan, less populous and poorer than India, sees its nuclear force as essential to counterbalance its rival's larger conventional forces.
Additionally, analysts have warned that if American plans for a missile defense prompt China to build up its nuclear arsenal, still more momentum will be added to the arms race across the region.
While the president's visit has not prompted New Delhi or Islamabad to scale back its nuclear program, many experts say the trip and subsequent administration diplomacy have helped to nurture other positive political developments.
India has released some political prisoners related to Pakistani-backed militant groups in Kashmir, and last month one of the most important of those groups, the Hizbul Mujahedeen, declared a unilateral three-month cease-fire. The group opened talks with India on Friday. But diplomats and other experts still see the chances of a lasting breakthrough as low, and violence has continued in Kashmir.
Given the Kashmir dispute, diplomats and arms control experts see nuclear weapons on the subcontinent as particularly dangerous. India and Pakistan, unlike other nuclear powers -- for example, the United States and Russia -- share a common border, have had no sustained dialogue and lack even a framework to hold serious negotiations.
After Pakistan moved into Kargil, Pakistan's rhetoric grew increasingly harsh and India prepared to mobilize a significant force that could have led to a dramatic escalation, experts say.
"Kargil proved that having nuclear weapons would not deter new conflicts," Mr. Perkovich said. "It also showed that unless such conflicts themselves were prevented, the possibility of an accidental or deliberate nuclear exchange would also increase given both states' relatively poor systems of intelligence surveillance and nuclear command and control."
While neither private experts nor the American government has firm estimates of the size of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear arsenals, Mr. Perkovich estimates that India has produced enough plutonium for 60 weapons.
But he said he believed that India had far fewer actual bombs, "in the neighborhood of 35 weapons." In the event of a nuclear war, these would be delivered by aircraft. Pakistan has enough highly enriched uranium for roughly the same number of bombs, he added, and it could deliver them by a combination of bombers and missiles.
Stephen P. Cohen, a South Asian policy scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, called the risk of nuclear conflict "serious" and "increasing." But the president's trip, he said, had succeeded in engaging Washington in the region, a development that was particularly important to India, which has long desired to be seen as an Asian power. "The president should have gone much earlier," he said.
Robert Oakley, a former ambassador to Pakistan, said that Washington may have inadvertently helped fuel Pakistan's nuclear ambitions and reduced American leverage over Islamabad by failing to resume economic and military assistance to Pakistan that Congress cut off in 1990 because of the Pakistani nuclear program.
Experts and diplomats said President Clinton had been determined to visit India after Mrs. Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, toured the country in 1995, and when he finally went, in March, the trip was billed as a "war prevention trip," according to one participant in the intelligence assessment, which was begun with the two-month Kargil conflict that ended the previous July.
"Since the intelligence report concluded that the region demanded high-level attention to defuse tensions and prevent the outbreak of conflicts that could escalate, the politics of the trip dovetailed perfectly with the intelligence assessment," he said.
During his visit, in an address to the Indian Parliament, Mr. Clinton appealed to the "great nation of India" to give up its nuclear arsenal, and he urged India to take the lead in starting a dialogue with Pakistan.
Progress toward such a dialogue seemed to be building with a meeting of the two countries' prime ministers on their border in early 1999. But after the Kargil incursion, which came just months later, India's leadership felt betrayed.
Since Kargil, Pakistan's civilian government was overthrown in a military coup last October. Mr. Clinton met briefly with the leader, General Musharraf, after his much longer visit to India, but made no headway on a range of American concerns, including when Pakistan would return to democratic government.
Pakistan continues to maintain that it will not scale back its nuclear program unless India does so first.
While India has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict in the region, it has made clear it will respond if attacked. Indian officials brushed aside efforts by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to persuade them to join international talks aimed at ending the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. And Prime Minister Vajpayee has steadfastly refused to renounce the country's nuclear arsenal, though he has pledged not to conduct further nuclear tests.

HEADLINE: In Upstate New York

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The occasional articles in your series about upstate New York include this statement: "But the national economic boom that swept into New York City and its suburbs passed it by." 
 The upstate recovery began in 1997. Last year, and so far this year, upstate expanded faster than 30 states -- including all of the country's industrial states.
Your July 28 article about Syracuse allows that the region is improving, "at least on paper." Since 1997, with national manufacturing jobs declining, industrial jobs in central New York rose 5.1 percent, igniting the rest of the economy. The region's labor force is growing 2.3 percent, nearly double the national rate.
In Syracuse and most of upstate, the problem is finding and training enough people to fit the needs of an expanding economy.

HEADLINE: The Little Museum That Could;
Dahesh Tries to Shake Founder's Mystical Image and Move Into the Mainstream

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
When the mystical Lebanese writer Salim Moussa Achi died in 1984 at age 75, he left an eclectic legacy of unfashionable art and devoted disciples who told tales of his miraculous powers to "cleanse" leprosy or pluck a live bird from a painting.
To true believers, he was a beloved prophet with some 2,500 "spiritual revelations" to his credit. He restored shattered crystal with a glance. He transformed losing lottery tickets into instant winners. And, as a young man, he cheated death by an Iranian firing squad by sacrificing one of six look-alike celestial personalities. 
 Today, however, this globe-trotting collector's most visible achievement is a museum housed in a former nail salon, two floors below the Fine Art of Hair Replacement.
At Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, the cramped gallery, papered in royal-blue damask, carries the name the collector preferred for himself, Dr. Dahesh. (The word means "inspiring wonder" or "astounding" in Arabic.) And the five-year-old Dahesh Museum is trying mightily to live up to its name by lifting itself from obscurity.
Some city guidebooks label it a "jewel box," and certainly it is one of New York's more unconventional museums. As it tries to distance itself from the spiritual roots of its founder (and his assorted personalities), the Dahesh Museum has amassed an endowment of more than $30 million, putting it in a class with art-world heavyweights like the Guggenheim Museum. It is also expanding its collection of 2,700 artworks and striving to stake out a more visible location with a bid to buy the former Hartford Gallery of Modern Art, a nine-story building at 2 Columbus Circle designed by Edward Durell Stone.
Most exotic of all is its quaint practice from bygone days: It doesn't charge admission.
The Dahesh Museum's mission is to shape a thoroughly mainstream and secular institution from its exotic beginnings as the whim of a passionate collector with a fondness for the supernatural and for the Rodney Dangerfields of high art.
The museum's core is Dr. Dahesh's personal collection of more than 2,000 19th- and 20th-century academic paintings created by students and teachers under a rigid training system at European academies. These bucolic landscapes and historical scenes are rendered in a realistic style that for years was scorned and overshadowed by Impressionism.
In much the same way, the new museum has faced scorn and suspicion because of the unconventional background of its founder, a self-taught art aficionado who dropped out of school at age 11. The museum strenuously distances itself from any religious connections, avoiding discussions of miracles and referring to Dr. Dahesh as a "philosopher."
"We admire him as an art collector and a connoisseur and a person who had the foresight to see that this academic art had value," said the museum's director, John David Farmer, whose own early training incorporated disdain for the kind of academic paintings he is now eager to buy at greatly increased prices. "When I was in art school," he added, "we didn't even look at this stuff."
Not surprisingly, the museum's cautious stance on its intellectual founder has stirred grumbling among Daheshist followers, who have no central organization to track their numbers, estimated by some devotees in the thousands.
But there is really not much they can do beyond complaining that Dr. Dahesh's image has been air-brushed of religious overtones. That is because Dr. Dahesh's legal heirs, the members of the Zahid family, command the rights to shape his legacy through ownership of his artworks, book collection and the copyrights to his writings.
"I could care less about all the materialistic things, like the art and museum and books," said one Daheshist, Mounir Murad, owner of a Virginia electronic-imaging company and author of a self-published book, "Daheshism and the Journey of Life." "My main concern is that there is a spiritual mission, and they've been shoving it under a carpet. Anything that would tie the museum to a spiritual mission is taboo."
The Zahids, a wealthy Saudi family with severed roots in Lebanon, inherited 2,000 artworks when Dr. Dahesh died in Greenwich, Conn., where the Zahids live. Longtime friends of Dr. Dahesh, the Zahids helped move the collection out of Lebanon during the civil war in 1975. Later they established the museum and nurtured a separate publishing company in Manhattan to produce and distribute Dr. Dahesh's writings. The museum says that a few of the paintings are still pocked from bullets that struck them while they were hanging in Dr. Dahesh's cluttered Beirut home, which functioned as a private salon.
Amira Zahid, a lawyer and one of five Zahid relatives who serve on the Dahesh Museum's seven-member board, said that as a girl she recalled sitting in the salon and listening to the conversations of Dr. Dahesh and his supporters. She said that Dr. Dahesh had wanted to create a museum in Lebanon. But when the family members inherited his estate years later, they preferred Manhattan because "New York is a challenge, and if we can make it in New York City we can make it everywhere," she said. "We are very serious about this."
With the multimillion-dollar inheritance from Dr. Dahesh, Ms. Zahid said that her mother, Mervat, proposed to her the idea of starting a museum with little more direction than, "You figure it out." The Dahesh Museum was incorporated in 1987 and formally opened in January 1995 with that seed money, the younger Ms. Zahid said.
The endowment has grown from $6.4 million in 1989 to more than $30 million in stock investments, which have increased over the years with regular contributions from Zahid family members. Last year alone, Amira Zahid donated $59,000 in cash and stocks valued at more than $2 million. The Zahids have also been active in acquiring new works for the museum, participating and bidding in auctions.
The endowment has helped nurture the Dahesh Museum's ambitions. Currently, with just 2,500 square feet of gallery space, the museum can offer only condensed exhibitions of Dr. Dahesh's collections of works by artists like Rosa Bonheur and Adolphe William Bouguereau, or loan exhibitions like its current one, "In the Footsteps of Goethe."
But the museum is determined to break out of its confines. In May it submitted a second, sweetened bid for the former Hartford Gallery building. Its earlier bid was rejected, as was a proposal from the developer Donald Trump, apparently because the amount, which the museum declined to disclose, was deemed unsatisfactory. An official with the Economic Development Commission said that the Dahesh Museum's second bid was still under review.
With a successful bid, the museum predicts that it could reopen in about 18 months at Columbus Circle, which would have a sizable impact on its annual attendance of about 20,000 people.
"It's a museum with enormous potential that can't be realized because it's ridiculously small," said Robert Rosenblum, a professor of fine arts at New York University and a curator of the Guggenheim exhibition "1900: Art at the Crossroads." "Everything depends on what's going to happen. If they're still cramped in this little space, they can't do much."
"They have an exceptional director and an excellent staff," he said. "Their background is a little bit like the problem of lots of other museums that have transcended the character of their founders. When you think of Albert C. Barnes and the Barnes Foundation -- he was a total lunatic. But with the money coming in, the personality of the founder is something that essentially gets buried, and what's relevant is the potential of the place."
The Dahesh Museum is one of very few institutions in the United States that exclusively promote 19th-century academic art. Polly Sartori, who oversees 19th-century paintings at Sotheby's in New York, said that the museum had also reassured collectors about the value of such works. "Collectors are very aware that when they go into major museums that most of the space is devoted to Impressionist paintings," she said.
Dr. Dahesh started collecting art in the 1930's, well before he faced persecution by the Lebanese authorities and temporary exile in 1944 for his religious beliefs. The key tenet of Daheshism is the universality of major religions and their embrace of the same core teachings and the same God. Miracles, Dr. Dahesh told some of his followers and his biographer, Salim Onbargi, "strengthen the bond of faith and belief in God."
No one is quite sure why Dr. Dahesh bought academic paintings, but the works were certainly more affordable than the Impressionist paintings that his friends said he also relished. Academic paintings sold for as little as $275 in the 1940's.
Followers like Fares Zaatar, who is completing a book about Dr. Dahesh, said that the collector amassed his acquisitions with help from supporters and earnings from the sales of his own books. The books, which offer spiritual lessons, include a 20-volume series about the global wanderings he undertook after he left Lebanon permanently in 1976.
"His extraordinary spiritual power enabled him to discern the great art," said Ghazi Brax, the editor of Dahesh Voice, a magazine for followers. "He was a genuine connoisseur. He believed in the power of great art in sublimating the instinctive drives and enhancing spiritual awakening."
Mr. Brax described the Zahid family as some of Dr. Dahesh's "favorite followers." His magazine is published by the Daheshist Publishing Company, whose president is listed as Amira Zahid's mother, Mervat.
But Amira Zahid is so careful about building a wall between the museum and religion that she declined to say whether she was a Daheshist. Mr. Farmer, the director of the museum, added that since the founding of the Dahesh Museum, the family had never espoused any religious views.
"I couldn't speak for my family," Ms. Zahid said. "I can only speak for myself. I have my own personal beliefs, but I don't think this is the forum to talk about it."
At the museum, nursing coffee from a cup emblazoned with Jules Breton's sketch "Le Gouter," she expressed frustration that the family had been scrutinized for years as if they were almost "criminals" because of suspicions about their motives.
"Dahesh is a person with many gifts, and so people can take from them what they want," Ms. Zahid said. "We're lucky to have known him, and this collection really is a gift from him to the city of New York."
"We are here to promote nothing but art," she said, adding, "Why can't we just accept the museum for what it is?"

For Richer, for Poorer

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
After working hard for many years, you and your husband have retired with a decent income from pensions and investments. Then, sadly, he dies. Is it fair that you should suddenly face higher tax bills, because your deductions have been cut in half and you are now in a higher tax bracket? In 1969 widows didn't think so.
Thanks in large part to their complaints, Congress decided to increase the deductions offered to single adults, and raise the incomes at which they entered higher tax brackets. Married couples in which the husband was the dominant earner -- the norm 30 years ago -- still paid lower taxes than they would have if unmarried, but their advantage was reduced. Nowadays, however, there are enough married couples with two comparable incomes that this tax break for widows is denounced as a "marriage tax," though even more couples receive a "marriage benefit." 
 The moral of this story is that the legislation Bill Clinton vetoed last week, which would have reduced the taxes of married couples, was not a clear move in the direction of "fairness." Widows, widowers and single people in general can justifiably claim to have been unfairly neglected -- especially since it turns out that most of the benefits would have gone to couples who already pay lower taxes than they would if they were unmarried. And the vetoed tax cut would -- surprise! -- also disproportionately help couples who are already very well off.
So is this just another example of trickle-down economics, of tax cuts for the affluent that are supposed to benefit the rest in some indirect way? No: it's worse than that.
You see, in the good old days conservatives used to argue that the really important thing was to reduce the marginal tax rate, the share of an additional dollar of income paid to Uncle Sam. If people got to keep more of any extra money they made, so the argument went, they would be motivated to work harder, save more, and so on. Of course, that also meant big tax cuts for the rich -- but increasing incentives was supposed to be the point of it all.
The bill eliminating the "marriage penalty," however, doesn't reduce marginal tax rates for its biggest beneficiaries. A married couple earning $100,000 a year would have gotten a tax break of around $1,700 -- seven times as much as the benefit for a couple with half their income -- but any additional money they earn would have been taxed at the same 28 percent rate as before. And because the marginal rate hasn't changed, the couple have no incentive to work harder, invest more, or any of those other good things that tax-cutters usually promise. So this isn't even supply-side economics; it's just a gift package for upper-middle-class couples.
Still, isn't it a good thing to encourage marriage, the bedrock of our society? Any tax expert could have told Congress that the really serious marriage penalty in our tax code involves the earned-income tax credit, which supplements the income of the working poor: when low-earning workers marry, their benefits are sharply reduced. Congress did vote a token increase in earned-income tax credit allowances, but not nearly enough to solve the problem. You might think that strengthening families trying to work their way out of poverty is more important than persuading affluent professionals not to live in sin. But I guess not.
I never thought that I would miss the days of the Laffer curve, when right-wingers used to say that lower taxes would mean higher revenue. But back then tax cuts were rationalized by ideas, however silly. These days the anti-tax movement seems driven only by a carefully selective sentimentality -- one that weeps for children of multimillionaires who don't get their full inheritance, but tells poor mothers to go out and get a job.
And it's a funny thing, but though the rationale for tax cuts seems to have changed, the distribution of the rewards -- who gets nothing, who gets the big benefits -- always ends up being the same. You might think that just once, for the sake of appearances, Congress would pass a law that provided more benefits (at least as a percentage of income) to those earning less than $50,000 a year than to those earning more than $150,000. But these guys are nothing if not consistent.

HEADLINE: Productivity of Workers Rose At 5.3% Rate in 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com 

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers increased sharply in the second quarter, pushing labor costs down, the government said yesterday. The report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates later this month.
The Labor Department said that worker productivity rose at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the latest quarter, higher than economists' expectations and nearly triple the revised rate of 1.9 percent for the first quarter. 
 With the gains in productivity, unit labor costs, a broad measure of how much businesses pay for unit of output, fell a surprising 0.1 percent in the second quarter, after rising 1.9 percent in the first quarter.
Productivity -- workers' output per hour -- has risen steeply in recent years as computer technology and other innovations have allowed businesses to press workers to do more tasks in the same amount of time. The productivity gains have also allowed businesses to absorb wage increases without raising the price of goods and services they produce, or to increase their profit margins.
Indeed, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in recent Congressional testimony that increased productivity was helping to restrain inflationary pressures, and that much of the gain in productivity could be nonreversible. Federal Reserve policy makers meet on interest rates on Aug. 22.
In a year-over-year comparison, productivity rose at a 5.1 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the biggest increase since the third quarter of 1983. And compared with the second quarter of 1999, unit labor costs fell 0.4 percent, the first year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 1984.
Hourly compensation rose 5.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with 3.9 percent in the first quarter. But adjusted for inflation, compensation rose only 1.6 percent against a flat reading in the first quarter.

HEADLINE: The Politics of Adulthood

BYLINE: By Jedediah Purdy; Jedediah Purdy, a student at Yale Law School, is the author of "For Common Things: Irony, Trust and Commitment in America Today."

 BODY:
America wants to grow up. Underneath the barbs and platitudes, that is the theme of this presidential campaign. Maybe it came out of polls. But probably not. It has the ring of an unexpected truth, the kind of thing a speechwriter, or even a candidate, sometimes intuits and finds a way to express.
The theme got under way with Bill Bradley's candidacy, which was about the idea that a prosperous America could afford to pursue higher goals through politics. Mr. Bradley proposed that self-interest left people cold in the end, and that economically comfortable voters were looking for ways to reduce poverty, create equality of opportunity and address racial division. We'd had our good times, and now was the time to act like adults. 
 The growing-up issue survived the Bradley campaign. Karenna Gore Schiff, a visible spokeswoman for her father, has made her trademark a call to her peers to surrender their "ironic detachment," the emblematic adolescent attitude, and dare to get passionate about presidential politics. Worldly wise indifference can be fun for a while, but no one knows better than a recent Harvard graduate, like Ms. Gore, that it's kid stuff.
George W. Bush has defused questions about his own maturity by appearing front and center in the campaign for national adulthood. His acceptance speech at the Republican Convention took over Mr. Bradley's theme wholesale. Governor Bush, who by several accounts finished his adolescence some 20 years after many of his peers, couched his "prosperity with a purpose" theme in an exhortation to his generation to prove itself, to "reclaim some essential values, to show we have grown up before we grew old."
His generation "tested limits" in its youth, he said, but is now coming to "a responsibility era." That phrase animated the final minutes of Mr. Bush's speech and captured his idea that individuals, religious organizations, corporations and presidents must temper their appetites and self-interest with a sense of duty to children, neighbors, the needy, the nation, the natural world. Everyone must begin acting like a grown-up.
Yesterday, Mr. Gore seemed to answer Mr. Bush's challenge by naming a running mate who is more associated with positions of moral responsibility than almost any other politician today. In fact, if there has been a criticism of Senator Joseph Lieberman this week, it is that he becomes sanctimonious about higher purposes.
The politics of adulthood is resonant for more than one reason. The most obvious is the adolescent behavior of the Clinton administration. These eight years have seen undisciplined appetites, ceaseless experiments with looks and attitudes, and a desperation to please that sometimes reverses itself into towering arrogance. People learn to expect these irritations from their children, but not from their leaders.
A deeper reason is the widespread perception that, indeed, prosperity is not enough. People who have provided for themselves and their families are looking for ways to contribute to larger communities, to give back and to put new meaning in their work. Others are noticing that, as the country's wealth increases, its inequalities grow more stark and unsettling. People worry that "They got rich and threw a lot of parties" is not history's highest benediction.
Many young voters take personal maturity and responsibility seriously. Children of divorce, now coming to adulthood in force, object to both hasty marriages and self-indulgent departures. Even anti-sweatshop activists and youthful union organizers read up on personal investment and build accounts for retirement, their children's education, or just security. Thirty years ago this would have seemed premature middle age. Today it has become common-sense behavior. It is always reassuring to hear politicians echo common sense.
Yet there is a risk for candidates in too loudly enunciating the politics of adulthood. Personal responsibility is as desirable in citizens and leaders as in friends and family. But the main work of politics is not to produce virtue, and personal virtue does not of itself produce good politics. Saying that corporations must be "responsible to leave the air and waters clean," as Mr. Bush did in his acceptance speech, is a reason to pass strong and efficient environmental laws, not a substitute for them.
Politics matters because government enables us to do things together that none of us could do alone: protect the environment, keep the workplace safe, guard public health, and address poverty and inequality on a national scale. Leading decent, successful lives may not, by itself, make a good society.
That is precisely why so many people now feel that prosperity is not enough. When politicians only urge us to lead better lives, and promise to do the same themselves, they may end up amplifying the discontent that they set out to solve.

HEADLINE: FirstEnergy Acquires GPU in $4.5 Billion Cash-Stock Deal

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
The FirstEnergy Corporation, an Ohio-based utility company, agreed yesterday to acquire GPU Inc. of Morristown, N.J., for $4.5 billion in cash and stock.
The acquisition would make FirstEnergy the sixth-largest energy concern in the United States, based on customers served. Its increased size and scale would also give it the potential to produce and distribute electricity more efficiently, industry analysts said. 
 The deal, approved by the boards of both companies, could save the combined company $150 million the first year, a FirstEnergy spokesman said.
FirstEnergy is based in Akron, Ohio, and primarily serves the Cleveland, Akron and Toledo markets and western Pennsylvania. GPU, best known for its past ownership of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, provides power to central and coastal New Jersey, as well as the northwestern part of the state and eastern and central Pennsylvania.
The deal allows FirstEnergy, which generates electricity, operates a transmission grid and servesclients, to double its customer base to about 4.3 million and to establish itself firmly on the East Coast. GPU, for its part, will receive a significant premium on its equity as part of the deal. FirstEnergy is offering $36.50 for each share of GPU common stock, which rose 75 cents yesterday, to $31.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
GPU, which divested itself of nearly all its power plants, would have access to FirstEnergy's power generation and would also be able to buy power more cheaply as part of a bigger company, changes that could translate into lower rates for its current customers in western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
Together with last week's announcement of a union between the FPL Group of Florida and Entergy, based in New Orleans, the FirstEnergy acquisition may signal the start of another round of consolidation in the electric utility industry, which was reshaped last year by more than two dozen mergers.
Share prices of many utilities have risen substantially since the start of the year, increasing the temptation for management to find buyers for their companies. Utilities also realize that in the wake of last year's mergers, bigger companies have more opportunities to cut costs, to market their electricity more aggressively and to negotiate better deals for the purchase of power.
"They need to be big to implement the most efficiencies and have the economies of scale," said Barry M. Abramson, senior utility analyst at PaineWebber.
Consumer advocates in New Jersey expressed guarded optimism over the sale of GPU. Blossom Peretz, the ratepayer advocate for the state of New Jersey, a position appointed by the governor, said rates charged by GPU and other New Jersey utilities were relatively high, but that GPU had built a solid reputation as a company that cooperates with customers and regulators. The state ratepayer's office said it wanted to find out if GPU would be able to buy cheaper energy as part of a larger company with better purchasing power. Ms. Peretz also said her office expected FirstEnergy to share with its customers any savings made from the merger.
"We're also concerned that none of the merger-related costs go to ratepayers," Ms. Peretz said, "and that there be no rate shocks due to the deal."
The market, however, had a negative reaction to the deal. When word of a possible acquisition leaked out Monday, most analysts downgraded their ratings of FirstEnergy, citing the burdens the company will have to take on in purchasing GPU. Both companies are growing at a rate of 4 percent to 5 percent a year, lagging behind many other utilities that show double-digit growth.
FirstEnergy, which has no current debt on the parent company level, will have to incur debt to make the acquisition. "Financing for the cash portion of the transaction is going to come from a combination of public debt and bank financing," said Richard Marsh, the chief financial officer of FirstEnergy, during a conference call with analysts.
Moreover, FirstEnergy will assume GPU's $7.4 billion in debt, which the latter acquired through a series of overseas investments that are faltering.
GPU entered the retail energy field in Australia at the height of the market, but sold its venture recently for a loss. It also bought into the British market at a time when industry observers felt that utilities would be hit by a rate cut -- which is what happened. And GPU sold its generation business before power generators began making hefty profits because of high demand.
Because it shed most of its generation capacity, GPU is also short of power in Pennsylvania, a gap that FirstEnergy, whose own capacity is stretched in summer, will have to address.
Shares of FirstEnergy closed down 0.3 percent, or 6.25 cents, closing at $25.3125 yesterday.

 BODY:
Sister M. Isolina Ferre, a Catholic nun from a wealthy family in Puerto Rico who was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Clinton last August for over half a century of charity and peacemaking, died on Thursday in her native city of Ponce. She was 85.
"Armed only with her faith, she taught gangs in New York City to solve their differences without violence," President Clinton said in a statement last week. "In Puerto Rico, her community service centers, the Centros Isolina Ferre, transformed ravaged neighborhoods by operating clinics and helping residents to empower themselves." 
 Sister Isolina won the Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the government can give a civilian, for establishing charitable centers in New York City and Appalachia, in addition to Puerto Rico.
A friend and fellow nun in Sister Isolina's order, the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity, said that Sister Isolina successfully mediated a conflict between warring Puerto Rican youth gangs in Brooklyn in the 1950's and 60's while she was the director of a Catholic charitable center there.
The friend said Sister Isolina's success as a peacemaker was the result of her interpersonal skills, her training in sociology at Fordham and the insights provided by her Puerto Rican heritage.
She also worked with Portuguese immigrants in New England and black youths in Brooklyn.
She won a Rockefeller Public Service Award in 1980 for her work in revitalizing communities and neighborhoods and organizing local groups to serve the unemployed, underskilled, delinquent, sick and handicapped.
Sister Isolina was born into a Puerto Rican family that owns two leading newspapers. Her brother, Luis, was a governor of Puerto Rico, and established the ruling New Progressive Party. She employed her family's influence in establishing charitable organizations.
In 1935, while on a trip to Havana, she decided to join the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity. She studied at St. Joseph College for Women and at Fordham University. Her work in Puerto Rico included founding a vocational school in Ponce.
She is survived by her brother.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Sex appeal still overpowers sports skill when it comes to the marketing of female athletes.

BYLINE: By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
THE lightning struck first in 1996, when the United States women's soccer team won the gold at the summer Olympic Games, a traditional generator of sports heroes. Then it happened again, a year ago. After a month of matches, the United States women's soccer team -- composed largely of Olympic athletes -- beat China in a spectacular finale and captured the 1999 Women's World Cup. Before, during and after, the nation watched, rapt, as it rarely had for any women's team sport. Players like Mia Hamm became media darlings, their names known to all. And Madison Avenue sat up and paid attention.
Or did it? 
 "With their great success on the field, it should have been a given that great commercial success would have come to all of these women," said Nova Lanktree, whose Lanktree Sports Celebrity Network in Chicago has been matching athletes and endorsers for 15 years. "But it hasn't."
One year after the triumph of Team USA and with the start of the 2000 summer Games only weeks away, prospects are indisputably better than they once were. But it seems that when it comes to women and product endorsements, sex still sells better than athletic prowess on the playing fields.
Exhibit A: Anna Kournikova, the pretty 19-year-old tennis player whose looks have earned her an estimated $11 million to $15 million in endorsement contracts despite a lackluster record on the professional circuit.
While Ms. Kournikova is only ranked 19th in the world, her earnings are about equal to those of the top-seeded player, Martina Hingis, who has won millions in tournament money. Ms. Kournikova, in fact, came in just behind Ms. Hingis in income among female athletes on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list. Indeed, her endorsement contracts put her ahead of more accomplished athletes like Monica Seles ($7.5 million in annual income) and Venus and Serena Williams ($5 million and $6 million, respectively).
Even Ms. Kournikova could not come close to earning what the men did, like Tiger Woods ($47 million), Michael Jordan ($40 million) and even the 70-year-old Arnold Palmer ($19 million).
Why?
Simple economics. "For an advertiser, the most important element is visibility," Ms. Lanktree said. "And in sports, women are just not as visible."
The problem is one of marketability, according to Ms. Lanktree, not sexism, Ms. Kournikova's obvious use of sex appeal to get endorsement contracts notwithstanding.
"There are not a lot of women's sports that are on par with respect to attendance and money," said Jackie Thomas, the director of women's marketing at Nike in Beaverton, Ore., which uses many female athletes to promote its footwear and athletic apparel.
"Endorsement payments are based on market value," Ms. Thomas said, "whether it's a man or a woman."
That does not mean, of course, that no woman athlete has achieved success in advertising on par with men, or that women cannot go beyond the sports clothing endorsements to which most have been limited in the past. Nike, for example, uses Ms. Hamm, the soccer player, to promote products that "transcend the gender line," as Ms. Thomas put it, and has in fact named one of the buildings on its Beaverton campus headquarters in her honor. And Gatorade, sold by Quaker Oats, recently introduced a campaign titled American Woman, with a television spot featuring Ms. Hamm; Chamique Holdsclaw, a star of the Women's National Basketball Association; the tennis legend Billie Jean King; and Marion Jones, the champion runner.
The Gatorade campaign is aimed at all consumers, not just women, as are other ads for Gatorade that feature male athletes like Derek Jeter, Peyton Manning and Mr. Jordan.
But that commercial is still the exception. Usually, advertisers who use female athletes do so because they are seeking to reach women. For instance, General Mills for its Multi-Grain Cheerios cereal just signed a three-year sponsorship deal with the Ladies Professional Golf Association because the market for the product is "women over 25," according to a General Mills spokesman, Greg Zimprich, who are a "perfect fit demographically" with the women's golf tour.
And then there is the ballyhooed case of Ms. Kournikova. She has endorsement contracts with Charles Schwab and Adidas, among others, and was the subject of a cover article in Sports Illustrated in June. The cheesecake layout accompanying the article led to criticism of her for perpetuating the stereotype of women as sex objects to the detriment of other female athletes who may be better at their sports but not as conventionally attractive.
But Ms. Kournikova has her defenders. "One of the beauties of being a woman today is that you can be a lot of different things," said Ms. Thomas at Nike, who said she believed that glamour was one of the many options that should be afforded to female athletes.
Nancy Lieberman-Cline, coach of the W.N.B.A. Detroit Shock and president of the nonprofit Women's Sports Foundation, agrees.
Though she called the Kournikova example an "isolated situation," Ms. Lieberman-Cline said that if "playing off her looks" is what Ms. Kournikova wants to do, she has the right to "project her image any way she wants."
Despite lingering inequalities, Ms. Lieberman-Cline said, things are "absolutely better than they were before." She ought to know: a member of the United States women's basketball team that won a silver medal at the 1976 Olympics, she was at the time one of only a few women athletes to obtain nationwide recognition and substantial product endorsements from companies like Johnson & Johnson and Jordache.
"In my day, it was Nancy or nothing," Ms. Lieberman-Cline said, adding: "That's really changed. Now I could rattle off the names of dozens of female athletes who are highly marketable."
"It's very empowering to be a woman in sports these days."

After Andersen War, Accountants Think Hard About Consulting

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Now that the Andersens are finally splitsville, are accountants going to forsake everything but the single life, limiting themselves to poring over a company's books and offering tax advice?
Not if they can help it. 
 A day after an arbitrator freed Andersen Consulting from Arthur Andersen, the tax and auditing firm, attention shifted to some of the other accounting and consulting marriages that are on the rocks. Though the world's largest accounting firms are eager to sell their existing consulting businesses for a variety of reasons, they will probably continue to offer a wide array of services -- unless regulators place new limits on them.
In the long run, "all the public accounting firms will be in consulting," predicted Robert K. Elliott, the chairman of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and a partner with KPMG.
Consulting has fueled much of the firms' growth over the last decade or so, said Jon McKenna, the executive editor of the Public Accounting Report. "It would be foolish to sell off a goose that golden," he said.
The international arbitrator brought in to settle the bitter Andersen dispute, which had dragged on for three years, essentially gave Andersen Consulting its freedom for a paltry $1 billion, although Arthur Andersen got the right to the Andersen name.
But the other firms moving toward split-ups expect to get a lot more than $1 billion given the high valuations on the consulting businesses. Ernst & Young sold its consulting unit earlier this year to Cap Gemini S.A. for some $11 billion, and KPMG plans to spin off the bulk of its consulting operations in an initial public offering that could raise nearly $3 billion. PricewaterhouseCoopers is also considering divesting itself of its consulting unit by the end of the year.
Selling at least a part of the business to another company or the public makes sense, according to Mr. Elliott. "I think it's driven by the economics," he said. Some firms are worried about the retirement needs of their partners, while others simply want to put the cash to other uses, offering stock to the partners or investing more in the traditional accounting side of the firm.
If money is why these firms are getting out, money may be the reason these firms get back into consulting, even after they sell off a large stake in their existing businesses. Arthur Andersen, for example, started another consulting business even after it decided to part ways with Andersen Consulting. "There's a natural desire to have consulting in one of these firms," said Kenneth A. Merchant, the dean of accounting at the University of Southern California.
What might change is the type of consulting these firms do. They may move away from management or information technology consulting to other areas that are either in demand or somehow related to their expertise in giving outsiders faith in the numbers and representations that companies make. "The challenge is what does business assurance mean," said Rocco J. Maggiotto, the global leader of markets and strategy for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
There is also some anxiety among these firms that the Securities and Exchange Commission might eventually give them little choice in the matter. Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., has expressed concern over the perception that auditor independence has been hindered by consulting services offered by the same firm, a perception strengthened when companies like Pinnacle Holdings and its auditor come under investigation for questions of independence, as happened yesterday. While accounting firms are already prohibited from offering some of those services, the S.E.C. is proposing to bar companies from using the same firm to provide both internal and outside audits and using a firm that provides information services consulting to them as their auditor.
Even if Mr. Levitt does not prevail, or reaches a compromise that allows many of the consulting services to still be offered, the need to reassure investors and clients of their independence may force firms to stay away from certain businesses. "Whether Levitt is there or not, they've opened the box up," said Tom Rodenhauser, an analyst with Consulting Information Services, who expects the relationship between accountants and consultants to fundamentally change to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
After the firms rid themselves of their consulting units and become smaller, there is also the possibility of futher consolidation, even as the firms once known as the Big Eight have shrunk to the Big Five. Without the consulting unit, Arthur Andersen has become a much smaller player, and Ernst and KPMG had once expressed interest in combining.

Dow Advances 109.88 on Easing of Inflation Worries

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks moved higher for the seventh consecutive session yesterday as tame inflation data drew investors back to interest-rate-sensitive shares, like retailers, at the expense of the technology sector.
But Microsoft rose 4 1/8, to 74 1/8, after the company introduced free software for electronic books. That was not enough, however, to counter pressure on the technology-heavy Nasdaq market from investors who cashed in on recent gains. 
 Lifting the broader market in early trading was news that nonfarm productivity jumped 5.3 percent in the second quarter, exceeding Wall Street's expectations for a 4.3 percent gain.
"Those numbers were really positive for the market," said Charles Payne, head analyst at an independent research firm, Wall Street Strategies. "Investors are not ready to get out of the market and whenever they get a little concerned, they jump back into the safer Dow stocks."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 109.88 points, or 1 percent, to 10,976.89, its highest close in more than three months. It finished at 11,125 on April 25.
Besides Microsoft, other big Dow gainers were two retailing names. Home Depot rose 2, to 57, and Wal-Mart added 2 1/2, to 57 1/2.
Another Dow component, Eastman Kodak, rose 2 3/8, to 60 1/2, after positive remarks on the company's United States film sales by Salomon Smith Barney.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 3.48 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,482.80.
The Nasdaq, meanwhile, shed 14.44 points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,848.55, after gaining more than 75 on Monday.
"The Nasdaq has had a hard time putting together back-to-back winning streaks," said Bryan Piskorowski at Prudential Securities.
Cisco Systems eased 3/4, to 65 1/2, ahead of its earnings, released after the close, which topped Wall Street's expectations.
In other economic news, second-quarter unit labor costs fell 0.1 percent, below Wall Street's estimate for a 0.6 percent gain. The numbers raised hopes that the Federal Reserve's policy committee, which meets on Aug. 22, will not have to lift interest rates to keep inflation in check. Higher productivity data lowers the risk of wage inflation because it is an indication that fewer employees can do more work.
"All the numbers to date have really indicated moderation of growth, and this does the same thing," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics.
Verizon Communications dropped 51 3/16, to 42 1/16, after the local telephone company posted higher, but disappointing, profits and trimmed its growth outlook for 2000. The company, formally known as Bell Atlantic, is in talks to settle a strike by union workers. It said it planned to merge its high-speed Internet access business with the NorthPoint Communications Group. NorthPoint fell 3/4, to 14 1/4.
Staples, the office products retailer, rose 2 1/4, to 17 9/16, after saying it would beat second-quarter profit estimates.
America Online Latin America rose 7/16, to 8 7/16, in the initial public offering of the venture between America Online and the Venezuelan media conglomerate Cisneros . The offering raised $200 million -- far below original expectations of $425 million. The shares of America Online advanced 1/2, to 53 3/8.
Active Power, an electrical equipment manufacturer, rose 35 3/4, to 52 3/4, in its initial public offering.

Cisco Sales Rise 61% in Quarter as Company Continues to Gain From Internet Growth

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Cisco Systems Inc. reported a 61 percent gain in sales for its fiscal fourth quarter today, as the company continued to be the leading supplier of the necessary hardware for the build-up of the Internet. It was the company's 10th consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth.
Excluding acquisition-related charges, Cisco earnings exceeded analysts' published estimates by a penny a share. 
 Separately, Cisco said its No. 2 executive, Donald J. Listwin, was resigning to lead an unnamed company in which Cisco is a minority shareholder. Mr. Listwin, whose title was executive vice president, is leaving after 10 years with the company, where he was responsible for Cisco's New World business strategy and led its service provider and consumer businesses as well as corporate marketing.
Cisco reported its results after the close of the market. Cisco shares closed at $65.50, down 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
For the quarter ended July 29, Cisco reported earnings of $796 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, up 32 percent compared with $605 million, or 8 cents a share, for the period a year earlier. Sales rose 61 percent to $5.72 billion, compared with $3.56 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.
Cisco said its pro forma net income, which excludes the effects of acquisition charges, payroll tax on stock option exercises and net gains realized on minority investments, was $1.20 billion, or 16 cents a diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, compared with $710 million, or 10 cents a share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, increases of 69 percent and 60 percent, respectively. Analysts had expected Cisco to earn 15 cents a share, according to First Call.
"The quarter, as expected, looks very strong," said Greg Geiling, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. Revenue growth of 61 percent year over year, and 16 percent over the immediately previous quarter, "are tremendous numbers for a company this size," he said. "And it looks like very balanced growth across all the business lines, which is just what you like to see."
During the quarter, Cisco completed the acquisitions of Atlantech Technologies Ltd., JetCell Inc., PentaCom Ltd., Qeyton Systems and Seagull Semiconductor Ltd. for a combined purchase price, including assumed liabilities, of approximately $1.39 billion, and took one-time charges of $461 million, or approximately 6 cents a share, on an after-tax basis, as write-offs of purchased in-process research and development. Additionally, Cisco completed the acquisitions of ArrowPoint Communications Inc., the InfoGear Technology Corporation and SightPath Inc., which were accounted for as poolings of interests.
"We predicted five years ago that we were in the midst of a second Industrial Revolution that would determine the prosperity of companies, countries, and individuals. Today, the Internet continues to drive the strongest U.S. economy in history," John Chambers, Cisco's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "We see no indications in the marketplace that the radical Internet business transformation in practices like customer service, supply-chain management, employee training, empowerment, and e-commerce that is taking place around the world today is slowing -- in fact, we believe it is accelerating globally."
But Mr. Chambers also said that Cisco is experiencing some of the problems that come with explosive growth. Particularly in new product areas, the company has been constrained by shortages of crucial components, and is taking steps to increase order volume with its major suppliers. Lead times on its own products reached what Mr. Chambers called "an undesirable peak" in June, but he added that he expected improvements in manufacturing management to return these times to normal by the end of the calendar year.
For the year, Cisco reported earnings of $2.67 billion, or 36 cents a diluted share, compared with $2.02 billion, or 29 cents a share, for fiscal 1999. Sales rose 55 percent, to $18.93 billion, compared with $12.17 billion for fiscal 1999.
Cisco's pro forma net income was $3.91 billion, or 53 cents a diluted share, for fiscal 2000, compared with pro forma net income of $2.52 billion or 36 cents a share for fiscal 1999, increases of 56 percent and 47 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: McCaffrey Voices Confidence in Mexico's Anti-Drug Efforts

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 8

 BODY:
In one of his last official visits here as the United States director of drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, praised the transition team of President-elect Vicente Fox and said he shared Mr. Fox's opposition to the American drug-certification program.
But General McCaffrey, who has long expressed misgivings about the program, said there was no chance that Congress would end it in the near future. "Zero," he said, to a question at a news briefing. At most, he said, the program might die a kind of natural death as the Organization of American States begins drawing up plans next year for multinational drug evaluation that would open all member governments' drug programs to scrutiny. 
 "I actually believe," General McCaffrey said, "that the certification process is slowly disappearing under the evidence that multinational cooperation better serves the interests of the American people than confrontation."
Under the program, created by Congress in the 1980's, the State Department evaluates other countries' interdiction efforts and can impose economic sanctions on countries that do receive certification. Most Latin American governments view the program as interventionist and lopsided, because it does not allow for scrutiny of American efforts to combat consumption.
General McCaffrey, who arrived on Monday for a series of meetings, including visits with Mr. Fox's chief security and law enforcement advisers, praised the president-elect for seeking greater cooperation among countries in the fight against drugs. He said he was confident that Mexico's efforts would not be weakened by Mr. Fox's plans to limit the military's role gradually.
General McCaffrey has long praised the Mexican military as a crucial element of the battle because of its successes in destroying marijuana crops and in confiscating drug shipments that travel through Mexico on the way to the United States. At least 60 percent of all cocaine that enters the United States is widely thought to pass through Mexico.
"My judgment is that President-elect Fox and this team that we are working with are pragmatists," General McCaffrey said to reporters at the United States Embassy. "They are determined to go down in history as Mexican patriots. I cannot believe they will do anything that doesn't make sense to them. They have got large new visions. And what we are going to do is listen to what they say and be supportive of their emerging strategies."
Soon after his election on July 2, Mr. Fox announced plans to reorganize the justice system to resemble United States agencies. At the same time, he announced plans to lobby Washington to end the drug-certification program. That will be among the topics to be discussed this month when Mr. Fox travels to the United States to meet President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and the Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush.
A member of Mr. Fox's transition team said even though ending certification seemed unlikely, Mexico was determined to stop it.

HEADLINE: New York: Phone Strike Epicenter

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Call it a New York state of mind.
Three days into the strike by more than 86,000 employees of the nation's largest local telephone company, spanning the region from Maine to Virginia, the most strident and sometimes violent front lines of the walkout have been in New York City and its suburbs. 
 Yesterday, the company, Verizon Communications, said it had reported 455 strike-related incidents of assault, harassment and vandalism to the police in 12 states and the District of Columbia -- with more than half of them in New York State.
The first two strike-related arrests were made in New York yesterday. And last evening, New York State Supreme Court Judge Louis York, in Manhattan, granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order, effective through next Monday, that bars picketers from preventing managers or replacement workers from entering their offices or carrying out work assignments.
The flare-ups, ranging from egg throwing to arson, have come amid a scorching spell of heat and humidity that descended on the New York metropolitan area on Sunday, shortening tempers just as the strike began. The weather may help explain why the city, which lately has prided itself on a steep drop in crime, was rocked on Sunday night by a wave of violence, including 20 shootings and 4 murders, that had nothing to do with the strike,
But experts say outbreaks along picket lines and evidence of strike-related vandalism in New York point to broader, farther-reaching factors in the nation's largest city and communications capital, where a rapid technological new-economy shift into nonunionized wireless and Internet communications jobs is running head on into a long tradition of union activism.
"This is the place where the unions will have their impact," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban studies and a telecommunications expert at New York University. "The density of the city means that a small disruption can have an enormous effect.'
Last night, the company declined to estimate how many of several thousand residential phone lines in New York City were still out of service because of vandalism that had occurred since the strike began early Sunday. Union leaders have denied member involvement in any network vandalism.
Mr. Moss said the unionized Verizon workers, many of them schooled in strike tactics through years of employment at AT&T and Nynex (which merged with Verizon's predecessor, Bell Atlantic in 1997), hold a particularly potent weapon in New York because of their knowledge of the intricacies the city's telecommunications wiring -- and because of the wide publicity they are assured if the network is disrupted.
"They know the infrastructure because they built it," he said. "And since this is the media capital of the world, you get more sympathy from other union workers than you would anywhere else."
That logic was apparently not lost yesterday on a striking Verizon worker, who gave his name only as Jerry, and who was involved in a confrontation outside a Verizon maintenance garage on King Street in the SoHo section of Manhattan. Accounts varied, but the incident resulted in a maintenance truck's being battered and stuck under a electronic gate that witnesses said had been lowered by strikers, who had access to the gate's remote control box. A nonunion Verizon contractor, who was in the truck, was not injured. No arrests were made.
"Every now and then it gets tense," said Jerry, a member of the Communication Workers of America. "But we know that a large majority of jobs in this industry will go wireless, and it is only the union that can give us a future."
Besides winning the court injunction, the company responded to union violence by increasing a $10,000 reward it began offering on Sunday for information leading to convictions for strike-related vandalism. The new bounty is $25,000.
"We certainly have evidence the our management workers have experienced abuse from the pickets, sometimes dangerously so," said Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman. Similar injunctions had been issued by state courts in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island on Monday, the company said.
In one of yesterday's arrests in New York, a picketing worker was charged with disorderly conduct outside Verizon's Manhattan headquarters at 6th Avenue and 42nd Street, after the police said he refused to remain behind a barricade.
In the other incident, the police department said a striking worker was charged with petty larceny after removing lug nuts from the wheels of a Verizon maintenance truck on West 15th Street.
Verizon said yesterday that it had received reports of 143 incidents of vandalism or harassment involving its employees or equipment within New York City since the strike began, and believed at least 115 might have involved criminal activity.
But a spokeswoman in Washington for the Communications Workers of America, Candice Johnson, said Verizon might be exaggerating the disruption caused by the strike.
