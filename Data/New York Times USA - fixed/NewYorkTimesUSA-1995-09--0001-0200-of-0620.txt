A U.S. Agency Issues Warning on Heart Drug
The United States Heart, Lung and Blood Institute said that a drug sold by Pfizer and Bayer to treat high blood pressure and heart disease should be used "with great caution, if at all," and that the safety of related drugs taken by millions of Americans was unclear.
The warning applied to large doses of the short-acting form of nifedipine, one of 10 drugs called calcium channel-blockers that are taken to control blood pressure and relieve angina pains. As a class, the drugs are the most widely prescribed in the nation. Pfizer and Bayer disputed a study on which the warning was based. [Page A1.]
 
US Air Shakes Up Pricing
US Air has radically changed its pricing for flights that connect major East Coast cities and Pittsburgh to most cities in northern and western New York State. While the new fare structure means savings and added flexibility for some fliers, some weekly commuters must pay fare increases of 75 percent. [D3.]
 
Income Up as Spending Dips
Consumer spending increased only two-tenths of 1 percent in July from June even though personal income surged seven-tenths of 1 percent, the fastest pace in six months. The weak spending increase, which analysts attributed to a rise in personal debt, provided fresh evidence that economic growth would be sluggish. [D2.]
 
A Ruling Against Life Partners
A Federal judge has ruled that Life Partners, a company that is the leader in the business of selling life insurance policies of terminally ill people, has been violating securities laws and must change its practices. [D3.]
 
Republic Talks With Brooklyn Bank
Republic New York was said by a person familiar with the negotiations to be holding preliminary talks about acquiring Brooklyn Bancorp, a savings-bank company. [D2.]
 
Dollar Falls on Profit Taking
The dollar fell against most leading currencies as traders took profits from Wednesday's jump in the dollar. It fell to 97.38 yen from 99.11 yen on Wednesday and to 1.4672 marks from 1.4781 marks. [D4.]
 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.64 percent, from 6.69 percent, bolstered by indications of a slowing economy. [D13.]
 
Insurance Regulation Faulted
A study of 278 members of insurance committees in 10 state legislatures found that nearly one in five members had ties to the industry. The study says such links often thwart effective regulation of the insurance industry. [D3.]
 
Risks in Implant Negotiations
Efforts to reshape the $4.25 billion settlement on breast implants may soon veer off on a new course, a risky one for both women claiming injuries from the devices and the companies that made them. News Analysis. [D3.]
 
Marketers Discover Ripken
The closer that Cal Ripken Jr., the Baltimore Orioles' shortstop, comes to breaking Lou Gehrig's major league record for consecutive games played, the better he looks to Madison Avenue as a pitchman. The streak is generating demand for Ripken from national marketers like General Mills, to appear on boxes of its Wheaties, and General Motors, to help promote the durability of Chevrolet trucks. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]
 
Insiders Sell; Lam Research Rises
When insiders sell lots of their company's stock, it often means the shares have peaked. But at Lam Research, insiders have been selling since the shares were at $30 and the stock is now at $60.25. Market Place. [D6.]

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE ISSUES;
The Elements of Peace: Money, Land and Justice

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Aug. 31

 BODY:
For the first time since the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction began in 1991, the way to an unlovely peace appears to be opening, but several extremely difficult issues remain.
The door to negotiation was opened over a fifth summer of war by several crucial developments: a new balance of power, inimical to the Serbs, rooted in the growing strength of the Croatian Army; a new wave of expulsions -- of Serbs from Croatia and Muslims from Serbian-held eastern Bosnia -- that virtually completed the slicing up of the former Yugoslavia into ethnically homogeneous zones; and the political victory, consummated this week after more than a year of maneuvering, of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia over a much weakened Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. 
 These internal developments were complemented by equally important changes in Western capitals and in the United Nations command in Bosnia that have made a resolution of the war more likely.
In Sarajevo, Lieut. Gen. Rupert Smith replaced Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose as commander of the United Nations forces in Bosnia and brought a complete change of style. General Smith pointed relentlessly to the fundamental contradiction of Western policy: The presence of United Nations peacekeepers in territory exposed to any NATO air strikes.
This patent roadblock to any coherent or effective approach had long served Western governments as a shield behind which to fudge their reluctance to take any action over the war in Bosnian. But by this month, with the removal of vulnerable peacekeepers, it had at last been cleared away.
In France, President Francois Mitterrand, a lifelong friend of the Serbs who was deeply hostile to any concerted military action against them, was replaced by Jacques Chirac, who has taken a different view of the war. President Chirac has now staked considerable political capital on ending the siege of Sarajevo.
In Washington, the growing threat of a withdrawal of United Nations troops (which would almost certainly require the dispatch of American soldiers to Bosnia) and of a lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia (which would divide the Western alliance) abruptly focused the energies of the Clinton Administration on leading the quest for peace.
The result, this month, was that the process was abruptly galvanized because the Yugoslav crisis has shown that the European Union -- a single market but a still-fragmented political and military power -- still needs American leadership.
That leadership, for the moment, appears to be in place. But as serious talks on a settlement look set to begin, tremendous obstacles stand in the way of peace. "We are getting into a room at last," Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American envoy, said today, "But the room is still dark."
Among the most difficult issues will be these:
EASTERN SLAVONIA Serbia remains committed to holding this oil-rich piece of Croatian territory that abuts Serbia. Its capture -- symbolized by the destruction of the town of Vukovar in 1991 -- involved an enormous expenditure of firepower.
Croatia wants the land back. The United States is proposing "freezing" the issue for three years, pending a final settlement.
SARAJEVO The Bosnian Serbs want part of the city as an ethnically pure Serbian zone. The Muslim-led Bosnian Government is deeply committed to preserving a single, undivided, multi-ethnic city under its control. It is also suspicious of Western proposals that the city come under United Nations control an an interim measure because this would suggest a surrender of sovereignty.
CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS The Bosnian Serbs want an independent state on the territory they control. The United States is offering self-rule and the possibility of a confederation with Serbia.
The Bosnian Government will almost certainly reject any settlement that does not preserve Bosnia as a single, independent state within its current borders, no matter what degree of autonomy the Serbs are given. Suggestions that the Serbs might ultimately be allowed to vote on secession from Bosnia will be rejected by the Government.
THE MAP The Bosnian Serbs want substantial changes in the current proposal for a division giving them 49 percent of the territory and the Muslims and Croats 51 percent. They want a wider corridor south of Brcko, the completion of the ethnic purification of Eastern Bosnia through control of Gorazde, and control of more cities and economic resources.
Strategically, they want the land to be coherent and self-sufficient, because they have an eye toward independence. The Bosnian Government is opposed to these changes.
WAR CRIMES Both Mr. Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, have been named as war criminals by the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. The Serbs will seek an amnesty. The Bosnian Government will resist this and demand that all criminals responsible for the eviction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in 1992 be prosecuted.
ECONOMIC MEASURES The Bosnian Government will want a huge international injection of funds for reconstruction and will almost certainly demand financial compensation from the Serbs for "ethnic cleansing."
Money will certainly play a central part if the Muslims, who have suffered the most and are still the most vulnerable, are to accept a peace that leaves them with real control over only a small part of Bosnia.
SANCTIONS Serbia and President Milosevic will press for a complete lifting of international economic sanctions as early as possible in the peace negotiations. Bosnia will want the sanctions maintained for as long as possible as a guarantee that Serbian promises -- such as the withdrawal from land they now hold in Bosnia -- are fulfilled. The Serbs will have to give up a third of the land they hold if they are to reduce their territory to 49 percent of Bosnia.
Some American politicians will seek to tie sanctions to other issues, including the status of Kosovo, whose ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia.

HEADLINE: Where Have All the Bosses Gone? Off on Fridays, All Summer Long

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
So where is everybody? The calendar clearly says today's a workday, yet the empty offices -- especially those corner offices -- say it's an undeclared national holiday.
As Labor Day approaches, deputies and assistants who spent the month concocting imaginative cover stories for their chiefs finally get to scoot out themselves. Today's result, especially in places like New York that have tempting escape routes to mountains and shores, will be the summer's most casual Friday. 
 Next week will bring the season's most detested Tuesday. But by the beginning of this past week, even the city's advertising and public relations wizards ran out of high-flying slogans and spins to disguise their own empty calendars. "Clients are already saying, 'I'll speak to you next week,' and it's only Tuesday," said Tracey Donner, a senior account executive at Edelman Public Relations Worldwide. "People have Labor Day-itis."
A lot of companies, like Mobil, Sara Lee and many advertising agencies, have given up on summer Friday afternoons altogether. Better to cut most employees loose, they figure, than to watch casual Fridays turn into unscheduled holidays.
But just as the pay and wealth advantages of top executives and others in prime positions have widened in recent years, economists say, many of them have gained more freedom to work when they want, where they want, how they want. They stand on the sunnier side of a yawning, spreading "getaway gap."
For this reward, as for so many others, the bosses have a defense: they may be out of the office, but no matter how verdant the setting, they are always working.
"I'm in the Rockies, the chief operating officer is in Martha's Vineyard, and everyone else is at work," Richard A. Shaffer, the principal of Technologic Partners, a newsletter publishing company in New York, gloated over his cellular phone last Friday afternoon. Sure, he's working too, he said, but his labors don't interfere with his morning hikes.
Aides left behind, stuck answering the phones, had better not forget to cover for their bosses.
"He's gone home for the day," an assistant to Jim Wiggins, a first vice president and director of corporate communications at Merrill Lynch in New York, said last Friday afternoon. Pause. "Well, not home. He's left for the day."
An aide to Preston Robert Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corporation, also in New York, was evidently more practiced. "He's out at meetings," she said last Friday. A moment later, she admitted that he was flying off early to a preseason game in Charlotte, N.C., for the New York Giants, which he partly owns.
Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation in Los Angeles, almost always takes Friday off or works from his home. "I have never found any resentment," he said.
Just ask Paul Vandeventer, his former executive vice president, as unresentful as can be. The boss works early in the morning, goes to charity events at night and often courts donors on weekends, he said. "No one felt any unfairness," Mr. Vandeventer agreed.
In Washington, however, complaining about unfairness is an official duty. "We're here and everyone else in Western civilization is on vacation," said Mary Ellen Glynn, a White House deputy press secretary, last Friday afternoon.
She was initially thrilled at having the run of the mansion. But only one reporter had stayed around, the venerable Helen Thomas of United Press International, and boredom set in. "Now it's changing from fun and excitement to surly," she said. The halls in the Old Executive Office Building were so empty, she added, "You could play golf there and not hit anybody."
Although no hard numbers show how likely today's executives are to take off in August or stretch their weekends, or how their employees carry on, several labor economists have stories or theories or both.
The most highly skilled and paid do work the longest hours, said Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin. "But when they want to go away they can go," he said. "And of course to get away you have to spend more money -- on second homes, vacations, the whole schmear."
You must also have an employer willing to buy you thousands of dollars of electronics or you must buy it yourself. "I'm up in Maine," said Janet L. Norwood, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. "But I've got a fax machine and I've got E-mail and a computer, so I don't have any problems." Since late June, Mrs. Norwood, the former director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has taken only two quick trips back to her office from her summer home in Liberty, Me.
Executives and senior employees like Mrs. Norwood can electronically delete the line between work and vacation. "Obviously I don't work as hard being away from the office," she said.
Woe to the underlings back at the shop who take too literally an absent boss's expressed desire to stay on top of things. "I call in and ask how things are going," one Texas television executive said last Friday morning, vacationing but wearing a pager on his shorts. "The problem is, they insist on telling me."
Manual laborers can't hammer, dig or drill by fax or phone, so even in Dallas -- on an afternoon when the temperature reached 97 -- most put in a full day. "I'd rather be hot than hungry," said John Forsthoffer in midafternoon, glancing down from the scaffolding where he was laying brick for a new strip of stores.
His bosses hardly needed to escape their air-conditioned offices on August Fridays, in his view. "They don't have to take off -- they don't do nothing nohow," he said, as the rest of his crew traded elbow jabs and chortled.
To keep those doing nothing entertained last Friday, the AMC Highland Park Village 4 movie house in Dallas more than doubled the normal afternoon concession and ushering staff. Most of the viewers were men. "They're escaping from work, they're eating naughty things, they're happy," said Patricia Nelson, the theater's manager. "They go to see 'Under Siege,' 'Batman' -- you know, boy movies that their wives won't want to see."
Many New York artists and art gallery owners insist that they go to the Hamptons and work. Who's left in town? "You've got her," said Marci Silverman at the James Goodman Gallery last Friday. With business expected to be slow, the gallery on East 57th Street repainted its walls last week. No wonder only a few customers peeked in.
On Wall Street, the normal cacophony on the trading desks became a muffled whimper that day from the few left staring at silent phones and the empty chairs of managing directors. "We're just sitting here," a Merrill Lynch trader said. "All afternoon, things just keep getting slower and slower and slower." And this week, even slower.
In Hollywood, the executive excuse is that nobody's reachable from early afternoon Friday on the other coast, so with the time difference why bother coming in and trying? "They're all in the Hamptons," said Terry Press, senior vice president for marketing at the Disney studios, speaking from a remote but unspecified location. "I never find anyone in the afternoons."
This week, as Labor Day approached, the studios fell silent and dark well before Friday. "In Hollywood, when it's a three-day weekend or a four-day weekend, they start checking out on Wednesday," Ms. Press said.
A few bosses, like Bill Schreiber, president of the Beer Drinkers of America in Sacramento, Calif., have duties that will keep them at work today. His group, which lobbies against higher beer taxes, is preparing for the holiday by working with the police on a designated-driver program called Party Smart.
Mr. Schreiber admits that as a newspaper reporter in California, he used to call up Orange County officials before a holiday, then report how much taxpayers were spending on those who had sneaked away. "It was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars," he said. "Boy, were they mad."
But cry not for Mr. Schreiber today. He took Monday and Tuesday off.
 
Chart/Drawings:
 
GOLF -- The Pelham Bay/Split Rock Golf Course in the Bronx is about 30 percent busier on Friday afternoon than on other weekdays.
 
BEACHES -- Attendance is up 14 percent at Jones Beach on Fridays in August.
 
COMMUTING -- Ridership is up 50 percent on New Jersey Transit buses on summer Fridays from noon to 4 p.m.
 
RESTAURANTS -- At The Four Seasons in New York, the Fridays are quiet, but the managing partner, Alex von Bidder, said, "What an opportunity for someone who wants to enjoy the best table and the best service in a quiet restaurant.
 At the restaurants Vong and Jo Jo, the owner-chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, said: "We have much more wine on a Friday lunch. It doesn't look like people are going to go anyplace after that."

HEADLINE: License Law At Fish Market Is Challenged

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
A lawyer for 24 companies at the Fulton Fish Market said yesterday that he would seek a court injunction to block New York City from determining who can and cannot work at the market.
Under a new law that goes into effect today, the city has the power to license companies and employees and ban them from the market on grounds that they have criminal backgrounds or that they are linked to crime groups. The Giuliani administration proposed the statute, saying it was needed to rid the market in lower Manhattan of corruption and exploitation by the Mafia. 
 Gerald J. McMahon, the lawyer for the 24 companies, said that within two weeks he would ask for an injunction in State Supreme Court to prevent the city from enforcing the law until the courts rule on its legality.
"The legislation discriminates against many people in the market on the basis that they are Italian-Americans and that in some unproved way they are therefore connected to Italian-American organized crime," Mr. McMahon said.
Randy M. Mastro, chief of staff for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said yesterday that all employees at the market would have to apply next week for clearance to work there and that they would be subject to background investigations. Mr. Mastro said that 54 wholesale seafood dealers had registered recently for permission to operate at the market and that they had turned over lists of their employees to the city.
About 800 people are regularly employed at the market, city officials said. As the nation's largest wholesale seafood market, it is vital to the city's economy, generating about $1 billion a year in sales, salaries and related businesses.

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
On Sunday, the DALAI LAMA, the exiled leader of Tibet, will arrive in Atlanta on the first leg of a trip that will also take him to Houston, Boston and Washington. The International Campaign for Tibet, based in Washington, is sponsoring the 10-day trip, during which the Nobel laureate hopes to enlist the help of Government leaders, business leaders and human rights groups in the nonviolent struggle against the Chinese presence in Tibet.
"If Tibetans raise arms against China, it will be suicidal for the Tibetans," said a spokesman, Thubten Samphel of the Office of Tibet, which represents the Dalai Lama in the United States. 
 In Atlanta, the Dalai Lama will meet with CORETTA SCOTT KING at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change and will speak at Emory University. In Houston, he will meet with people who are setting up businesses in China and, more recently, in Tibet, to urge them to employ Tibetans as well as Chinese workers.
"The Chinese government is encouraging foreign investment in Tibet, and this affects the population in Tibet, who are less skilled, and less hard-working than the Chinese," Mr. Samphel said. "He's going to advise Americans who plan to do business in Tibet that whatever business they do directly benefits the Tibetan people." If they set up a hotel, for example, the investors should employ and train Tibetan people, who have been left unemployed in the current economy, he said.
In Boston, the Dalai Lama will meet with Chinese scholars and dissidents, and in Washington he will talk with Government leaders. He will also have audiences for local Tibetan communities in Boston and Washington.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Rally Stalls as Traders Buy Back Yen in a Correction

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday after traders sold dollars and bought back some of the yen they had unloaded on Wednesday when Japan's banking crisis flared anew.
"The other day the whole world was selling yen and now we've seen a huge correction," said Debra Larsen, assistant vice president at Commerzbank. 
 The selloff took many traders by surprise. The dollar's recent strength seemed to be bolstered after the Japanese Government on Wednesday closed down a credit union and prepared a rescue package for a regional bank. Investors were seen as wary of the yen because of the potential impact of the growing banking crisis on Japan's financial markets. On Wednesday, the dollar rose as high as 99.25 yen -- its highest since Feb. 10.
Yesterday, however, currency traders took profits on the dollar's gains. Some traders also cited disappointment at the dollar's failure to breach the 100-yen level as another reason for the selling.
Much of the dollar's drop came in Asian trading. The selling intensified, traders said, when it became apparent that central banks would not jump in and halt the dollar's slide. Many market participants were forced to join in to avoid sustaining heavy losses.
"Once the dollar started to fall, it just sort of fed on itself," said John McCarthy, manager of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. "And the selling came in two waves: one in Asia and one in Europe."
When New York traders came in, they were somewhat wary of selling the dollar too aggressively amid fear the Federal Reserve would move to shore up the currency if it fell too far too fast.
"The perception that the central banks are committed to sustaining this dollar move is a powerful floor under us at this point," said Tim Fox, an economist at Credit Suisse.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 97.38 yen from 99.11 yen on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 1.4672 German marks from 1.4781 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5497 from $1.5452.
Despite the dollar's apparent correction from Wednesday's rally, the cuurency still has the potential to make a bid for 100 yen and 1.50 marks in the coming days, some traders said.
Many currency traders will look to today's United States employment report for August hoping that the report will confirm the view that the American economy is gradually gathering steam and that there is no reason for the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Gain Is Weak, Showing Caution

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Consumer spending increased only two-tenths of 1 percent in July from June even though personal income rose at the fastest pace in six months, the Commerce Department said today.
The weak increase in spending, which analysts attributed to a rapid rise in personal debt, provided fresh evidence that economic growth would be sluggish in coming months. "Consumers are showing a little more caution," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
 Indeed, spending on durable goods like cars, computers and kitchen appliances fell 1.8 percent in July, the department said. Also today, major chain stores reported disappointing back-to-school sales for August.
Consumers spent cautiously even as personal income surged seven-tenths of 1 percent in July. Hiring for the summer holidays by hotels, resorts and other companies in the service industry magnified the gain.
The figures were in line with expectations. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had expected, on average, the Commerce Department report to show a spending gain of three-tenths of 1 percent and an increase in personal income of five-tenths of 1 percent.
Disposable income, the money left over after taxes, increased six-tenths of 1 percent in July.
In line with the downturn in spending on big-ticket items, the Commerce Department said in a separate report today that factory orders fell 1.3 percent in July, a larger decline than analysts had expected, as stockpiles of unsold goods increased for the 10th consecutive month. In June, factory orders fell a revised one-tenth of 1 percent.
Although July's decline in factory orders was the largest since April and the fifth in six months, much of the drop was linked to the seasonal shutdown of auto plants for model change-overs, the department said. Orders for industrial equipment and primary metals also fell.
Excluding transportation goods, orders fell three-tenths of 1 percent in July.
The economy appears to be facing several months of slow growth. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, may slow further in coming months because household finances are under pressure from a steady increase in borrowing. "They've got to pay this off," said Richard Yamarone of Mountain Econometrics in Maplewood, N.J.
Today's spending report showed that consumers' interest payments to businesses, which are counted separately from overall spending, increased 1 percent during July. Consumer installment credit, led by large outstanding credit-card balances, has been rising for more than two years.
Slow job growth may be another drag on spending. The Labor Department said today that claims for unemployment benefits were unchanged last week from the prior week, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 349,000. On Friday, the department is expected to report that the economy added about 145,000 jobs in August, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg Business News.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Wheat Prices Soar on Extension Of European Union Export Ban

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wheat prices jumped yesterday after the European Union said it would suspend subsidized wheat exports for another month.
The development will effectively keep European grain off the world market until at least Oct. 12, which means nations in need will be more likely to buy from the United States. 
 Prospective buyers who had held back, awaiting the scheduled Sept. 14 return of European wheat to the global marketplace, may now step up and buy American grain, said Susan Leighty, a grain analyst with Prudential Securities.
On other commodity markets, corn and soybean prices also rose strongly. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 1.87 points, to 239.97, a new five-year high.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat for September delivery rose 16.75 cents, to $4.4925 a bushel, the highest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Aug. 1.
A European Union committee in Brussels suspended wheat export subsidies July 13 in hopes of lowering domestic prices by keeping more grain at home. Yesterday, the committee said that it had extended that suspension through Oct. 12.
Wheat prices have risen sharply this year in anticipation of dwindling stockpiles as a result of increased consumption and a smaller American crop. Both world stocks and American stocks of wheat will reach their lowest levels in at least 20 years by May 31, the end of the 1995-96 crop year, the Agriculture Department has forecast.
The Europeans may want to force world wheat prices higher so they can get more for their grain, said Dan Cekander of Fimat Futures USA Inc. in Chicago.
Corn and soybean prices rose strongly on forecasts for more hot, dry weather next week in the Midwest, which could reduce crop yields.
September corn rose 3.75 cents, to $2.955 a bushel, and September soybeans rose 7 cents, to $6.135 a bushel.

Slowdown Signs Lift Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday, bolstered by indications of a slowing economy and by technical factors.
Still, many market participants stayed near the sidelines, awaiting the release today of the employment report for August. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32 , to 103. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.64 percent, from 6.69 percent on Wednesday.
Bonds strengthened as several reports showed signs of a sluggish economy. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending in July rose only two-tenths of 1 percent. After adjusting for inflation, it was essentially flat.
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said that indicated "a slow start for consumer spending in the third quarter."
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said factory orders fell 1.3 percent in July, a larger decline than analysts had expected.
In addition, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its index of regional manufacturing activity was 49.3 in August, slightly lower than July's reading of 49.7, "demonstrating no improvement in business conditions in this crucial industrial sector of the country," Mr. Fine said.
The reports kept hopes alive that the Federal Reserve might make another cut in short-term interest rates this year.
Some buying in the afternoon was a result of several technical factors, Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said.
One had to do with end-of-the-month adjustments by money managers whose portfolios are tied to indexes. Another involved investors squaring their positions ahead of the employment report today.
Some investors holding short positions -- that is, betting that the bond prices will fall -- were buying to limit potential losses ahead of the release of the employment data.
"This market is currently in an extreme position," Mr. Alexy said. "And tomorrow those shorting the market may have nowhere to hide if the employment numbers are weaker than expected."
The employment data are not the only economic report scheduled to be released today. The National Association of Purchasing Management will issue its report for August, and the University of Michigan releases to subscribers its consumer sentiment index for August. And that will be followed by Columbia University's leading inflation index.
The analysis of much of the data, however, is likely to take place on Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. Today, the cash market for Treasury securities will close early, at 2 P.M.
In futures trading, the December bond contract, which held above the price-support level at 11120/32 , broke above the 11214/32 resistance level on end-of-month book-squaring and lifted prices of longer maturities in the cash market.
Yesterday, the bond contract closed at 11224/32 after moving in a range between 1131/32 and 11126/32 .
Elsewhere, the Treasury auctioned $18 billion of 20-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.58 percent. The bills are used to meet short-term borrowing needs beyond the money raised through the Government's regularly scheduled auctions. The 13-day cash management bill sold in May, the last time the Treasury sold these type of short-maturity bills, had an average rate of 5.85 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 20-day cash management bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.690
Discounted Rate . . . 5.58%
Coupon Yield . . . 5.69%

HEADLINE: In America;
Power to the Banks

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Bank executives tend to trip over one another in their haste to escape from areas like Harlem, and once gone they seldom look back. So people got a little overexcited recently when Chase Manhattan held an official opening day ceremony for the extravagantly named Chase Strivers Center at 251 West 135th Street.
Politicians were there to clap people on the back and declare to anyone who would listen that it was a great day. Chase executives distributed press releases proclaiming that the center would serve as an "economic anchor for Harlem." 
 According to the bank and local business officials, the Chase Strivers Center was the first new banking facility of any kind to be established in central Harlem in 38 years. That, they said, was cause for celebration.
Swell. But what exactly is this, uh, Strivers Center?
Are you ready? It is one 24-hour automatic teller machine. One.
And one telephone, which customers can use to ask about other Chase services. Just one.
The number of human tellers at the Chase Strivers Center is zero. But there is, at times, a human presence. For four hours each day a Chase credit officer is on the premises to help fill out applications for a mortgage or a loan.
That's it. That's what the excitement was about. Chase once bragged that "You have a friend at Chase Manhattan." At the Strivers Center, that friend can be hard to find.
Twelve days after the festivities for this single A.T.M., Chase Manhattan and the Chemical Banking Corporation announced that they would merge to create a banking behemoth with $297 billion in assets -- the biggest bank in the country.
"We are creating an absolute powerhouse," crowed the Chase chairman, Thomas G. Labrecque.
Mr. Labreque has the considerable benefit of viewing his powerhouse from the top. The view from the bottom is a different one altogether. Chase and Chemical plan to eliminate 12,000 jobs (about a third of them in metropolitan New York) and close 100 branches.
As this biggest of all American banks begins to enjoy the billions in savings it will realize from the merger, consumers should look out.
"The merger is obviously good for shareholders and obviously bad for consumers," said New York City Public Advocate Mark Green, who has been studying the banking system for several years. As banks have grown larger and more impersonal, the impact on consumers has been increasingly negative.
Banks are paying very low rates of interest, charging very high rates of interest, and imposing unconscionably high service fees on consumers. This is the way powerhouses do business. Banks earned record profits each of the last three years: $32.1 billion in 1992, $43.1 billion in 1993 and $44.7 billion last year.
Were any benefits passed on to consumers? Are you joking? A study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group found that in the past two years banks have increased most fees for consumer accounts at rates that are double the rise in the consumer price index. And the biggest banks, according to the report, imposed the biggest fee increases.
Mark Green has come up with similar findings. He noted that an increasing number of bank customers are paying more in fees than they earn in interest on their accounts. "Except for the problems of crime and security," he said, "it would make more sense for them economically to keep their money in a mattress than in a bank."
Those who have reason to cheer the merger of Chase and Chemical are the top executives, the big shareholders, the lawyers. They live for the most part in a comfortable and efficient world, where the dollar sign rules all and the absence of greed can be viewed as a sign of mental instability.
Low-level employees and customers of modest means are a nuisance to these types. From their perspective, a pleasant 30-second conversation between a teller and a customer over money being saved for an upcoming wedding is inefficient, and therefore not to be tolerated. They would like to see the customer wedded to an A.T.M. and they'd like to see the teller gone.
That's powerhouse banking -- banking as it ought to be.

HEADLINE: Mexico Bailout Needed U.S. Strings Attached

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Mexico: Who Was Right?" (Op-Ed, Aug. 25): Patrick J. Buchanan claims that recent United States-Mexico trade data show that both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Mexican bailout were not in the U.S. economy's best interest. His analysis misses the real story. 
 While Mr. Buchanan is right that most Nafta advocates overstated its potential benefits to the United States in terms of exports and job creation, it is premature to judge whether or not there might be long-term benefits.
Only in several years, when all tariff cuts and other trade-liberalizing provisions take full effect, can the impact of Nafta be assessed. Mr. Buchanan's conclusion is based on the large trade deficit we are now running with Mexico -- which reflects the aftermath of the peso collapse, and is unrelated to Nafta.
The biggest mistake of the bailout was the manner in which it was structured. A number of major conditions should have been tied to the aid package, which would have reduced the pain and suffering in Mexico and limited the adverse impact of the crisis on the United States economy.
In particular, the Administration should have insisted that Mexico take steps to reduce its large trade deficits with Japan, China and Western Europe, which made up most of Mexico's current-account deficit that caused the crisis in the first place. Without such a condition, most or all of the adjustment that the cheap peso and Mexico's recession would cause would be with the United States, because we are the closest and largest market.
This is precisely what has happened -- these other countries are still running relatively large surpluses with Mexico, while the United States will have nearly a $20 billion trade imbalance with Mexico this year.
In addition, the Clinton Administration should have insisted that Mexico take steps to prevent the outflow of capital of its own citizens, thus slowing the loss of its international reserves, and permit foreign investment in its oilfields in order to increase oil exports.
It is to be hoped that the Administration will insist on these conditions before additional aid is provided to Mexico.

Small-Business Boost<HE

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Patrick J. Buchanan's siren song against Mexico (Op-Ed, Aug. 25) is seductive, but he strikes the wrong chords. "Big Business" has had a presence in Mexico for a long time, and -- with or without Nafta -- has the resources to take advantage of Mexico's new open economy. It did not, and does not, need Nafta. 
 On the other hand, Nafta gave small companies like mine a real chance to compete in Mexico. It worked. We were able to increase our hiring and revenues by more than 200 percent.
Nafta had nothing to do with Mexico's financial crisis. Mr. Buchanan uses the International Monetary Fund report on Mexico's devaluation as proof that the American people were somehow had. The I.M.F. report itself misdiagnoses the galvanizing cause of the crisis by focusing only on a superficial symptom of the malady -- Mexican capital flight.
The devaluation was a confluence of many political and economic factors. Nevertheless, the I.M.F. report ignores the real trigger: the announcement by the Zapatistas, the guerrilla group pressing agrarian reform, that they had taken over 38 towns in southern Mexico. The announcement was false, but it did the damage. The "hot" money flew out of Mexico. Unable to sustain its meager reserves, the Mexican administration then devalued the peso.
Would-be Presidents like Patrick Buchanan who are running one-note campaigns based on bashing Mexico are poisoning our relationship with an important and strategic ally, and turning a best customer into no customer.

HEADLINE: Mexico Bailout Needed U.S. Strings Attached;
No 'Overblown' Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Mexico: Who Was Right?" (Op-Ed, Aug. 25), Patrick J. Buchanan states that a recent International Monetary Fund report suggests that the Mexican crisis was "overblown" and that "the world financial system was never in danger." The I.M.F.'s latest International Capital Markets report concludes just the opposite. 
 The report observes that there were significant contagion effects in the Western Hemisphere immediately after the Mexican crisis, and later in Asia in mid-January 1995. It concludes that the international financial package assembled at the end of January was essential both to limit the recessionary effects of the crisis on Mexico and to prevent the spread of the crisis to the rest of Latin America and other developing countries.

G.M. and Chrysler Have Best Month of Year
General Motors and Chrysler said their sales surged in August to the highest levels this year, leading to shortages of new vehicles at dealerships.
 G.M. said sales of cars and light trucks rose 7.1 percent in August, to 446,394, led by a strong month in its Chevrolet division and higher sales to fleets. Chrysler said total vehicle sales rose 4 percent, to 170,557, for the company's third consecutive monthly increase. [Page 37.]
 
Profit Outlook Lifts Stocks
Stocks rose on optimism that the economy was growing enough to keep profits healthy through the end of the year, and gains in auto shares overshadowed a slump in technology issues. The Dow industrials surged 36.98 points to 4,647.54, the biggest one-day advance and highest close since Aug. 14. The S.& P. 500 index rose 1.96, to 563.84. For the week, the Dow rose 46.14 points. [37.]
 
The dollar drifted lower against the German mark in languid trading after economic data failed to give a clear reading on the health of the United States economy. The dollar slipped to 1.4622 marks and edged up to 97.47 yen. [32.]
 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.61 percent, from 6.64 percent. Traders said investors bought after a weak manufacturing report suggested slow growth and a chance of further interest rate cuts.[36.]
 
Wireless Contract Awarded
A telephone consortium that includes Nynex and Bell Atlantic has awarded a $1 billion contract to AT&T and Motorola to supply the group with hardware and software for a wireless communications system, including base stations and switching equipment. [36.]
 
Rockefeller Center Dispute
Rockefeller Center Properties, the real estate investment trust that holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center, filed documents in bankruptcy court indicating that it would oppose a bid by Tishman Speyer Properties to buy the center. [35.]
 
Former B.C.C.I. Official Sought
The Manhattan District Attorney's office has requested that Britain extradite Syed Ziauddin Ali Akbar, the former treasurer of B.C.C.I. Mr. Akbar, who was due to be released from a British prison yesterday, is suspected of extorting $15 million from the bank in August 1988. [36.]
 
Thieves Take Old Newspapers
As the price of newsprint skyrocketed in the last year, discarded newspapers suddenly took on real value, and municipal recycling officials say they are plagued by scavengers who cruise curb-side recycling routes before city trucks do. A scavenger then sells the papers for as much as $400 for one night's haul to the same recycling processors that would otherwise have bought them from the city. The effect is to deprive local governments of large sums of money. [1.]
 
A Union Fight in Detroit
Detroit is convulsed by a seven-week-old strike at the city's two newspapers, The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press, by six unions. While members of other striking unions are generally standing firm, reporters, photographers and copy editors are crossing picket lines to return to work. Already, 124 Newspaper Guild members, or 45 percent of the 276 members at The Free Press, were said to have gone back to work. [5.]
 
Cotton Prices Up Again
Cotton prices advanced for a second consecutive session as traders grew concerned that deteriorating world and American crop conditions could lead to shortages. On the New York Cotton Exchange, cotton for December delivery, the active month, rose 1.9 cents, to 85.67 cents a pound. [32.]

Dollar Is Off Against the Mark On Mixed U.S. Economic Data

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower against the German mark in languid trading yesterday after economic data failed to give a clear reading on the health of the United States economy.
 Some additional light selling of the dollar came from traders who were adjusting their positions ahead of the Labor Day holiday on Monday. 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.4622 marks from 1.4672 marks on Thursday. The dollar edged up to 97.43 Japanese yen from 97.38 yen.
 In early trading in New York, the dollar shot up to a high of 1.4725 marks after the Labor Department reported a rise in nonfarm payrolls that was much larger than expected. The report that the number of nonfarm jobs grew by 249,000 in August after a meager gain of 6,000 in July was initially viewed as bullish for the dollar. The report indicated that the economy was picking up steam, and that the Federal Reserve would be unlikely to lower interest rates soon to stimulate growth.
 Lower rates generally bode ill for the dollar as they tend to diminish the attractiveness of dollar-based interest-paying securities.
 But traders quickly turned around and sold dollars after analysts took a closer look at the report and realized that it might not have shown quite as much economic strength as the payroll number implied.
 "The market was really quite disappointed," said Amy Smith, currency strategist at the consulting firm IDEA. "It was really a mixed bag."
 Traders said the dollar was also hurt by a strengthening in the mark and Swiss franc.
 The mark was particularly strong against the French franc, rising on speculation about further splits within the French Cabinet after last week's resignation of Finance Minister Alain Madelin, traders said.
 Traders also sold dollars for Swiss francs as concern about tensions in Bosnia fueled demand for Swiss currency.
 "Switzerland is a historically neutral country," said Kevin Harris, international economist at MCM Currency Watch. "If you want a place to go when other parts of Europe are in trouble, you go to the Swiss."
 The dollar fell to 1.1967 Swiss francs yesterday from 1.2032 francs on Thursday.
 Traders noted that the dollar's moves yesterday were exaggerated as trading was extremely light ahead of the holiday weekend.
 Some traders said the dollar might head up to 100 yen and 1.50 marks in the near future but it might still run into problems on its climb.

HEADLINE: 3 SIDES IN BALKANS AGREE TO MEETING TO DISCUSS PEACE

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Sept. 1

 BODY:
In what will be the first direct meeting of all three parties to the Balkan war in two years, the foreign ministers of Bosnia, Croatia and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation have agreed to meet in Geneva late next week to discuss a peace settlement.
The announcement of the meeting, made by the United States, came as NATO today suspended its air attacks on the Bosnian Serbs after a series of early-morning raids. The suspension, on the third consecutive day of the NATO onslaught, was ordered pending the result of talks between the commander of the United Nations forces in the former Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serb commander. 
 Late today, it appeared that these talks, specifically related to the Serbian siege of Sarajevo, had been unsuccessful and that the air strikes were therefore likely to resume on Saturday, United Nations officials said.
The United States brokered the agreement to hold a meeting of the three parties to the war. Even the agreement amounted to a breakthrough in that it has long been impossible to get the parties into the same room. But deeply divisive issues of territory, governance and justice that defeated previous attempts to reach peace remain.
Never before, however, has the United States been as energetically involved in the quest for a settlement, the warring sides so exhausted, or the ethnic purification that has characterized the dismemberment of Yugoslavia into separate nations so advanced.
"The purpose of the meeting will be to develop basic principles for a settlement as a foundation for intensive negotiations aimed at achieving a peace agreement," Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said in Washington. He added that the talks were in the best interests of the parties and that the United States would do "everything in its power" to assist them.
In Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke, whose shuttle diplomacy this week led to the accord on a meeting, said, "The toughest issue is land -- that is what the war was about."
 The Serbs, who hold close to 70 percent of Bosnia and an eastern sliver of Croatia after four years of fighting, will be asked to surrender some of that land -- a demand that will meet stiff resistance.
The war has been largely about the Serbian contention, often backed by the ruthless killing and eviction of non-Serb civilians, that the internal borders of Tito's Yugoslavia could not be turned into international borders because that would maroon many Serbs in the newly independent countries of Croatia and Bosnia.
Lieut. Gen. Bernard Janvier of France, the United Nations commander, today met Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, in the town of Mali Zvornik on the Yugoslav border with Bosnia to discuss NATO's demand that all Serbian guns be removed beyond 20 kilometers -- 12.5 miles -- of Sarajevo.
The meeting began badly, United Nations officials said, with a tirade from General Mladic against the NATO attacks and a demand that all NATO planes leave Bosnian skies before the discussions begin.
The tone later became more cordial, but in the end General Mladic refused to accept all the demands set by General Janvier for a permanent stop to the bombing. It was not clear which Western demands had proved unacceptable to the Serbs.
These demands are being interpreted with different nuances in different Western capitals .
In effect, the officials said, General Janvier is demanding an opening of Sarajevo airport and the opening of roads into the besieged city as well as the withdrawal of Serbian guns.
Under the terms of an agreement reached in July between the United Nations peacekeeping force and NATO, both General Janvier and Adm. Leighton W. Smith, the American commander of NATO's southern headquarters in Naples, have to agree to call off the air strikes.
Thus both France and the United States are directly involved in the decision on whether to turn today's "pause" in the air strikes into a permanent halt.
"The operation is ongoing," said Chris Gunness, a United Nations spokesman. "We'll wait to see the outcome of the talks, review the situation and look at Serb compliance with our demands."
Other Western officials said General Janvier had proposed to General Mladic that the Serbs be given four days to remove their heavy guns from the Sarajevo area. The removal would take place under NATO's air surveillance and United Nations observation on the ground.
The guns were supposed to be removed or handed over to the United Nations in February 1994, after a mortar attack on the Sarajevo market that killed 68 people led to a NATO ultimatum. But the demand was hedged at the last minute to avoid NATO air strikes.
In the end, it has taken a second attack on the Sarajevo market, in which 37 people were killed on Monday, and the slow resolution over the last 18 months of differences between the United Nations and NATO, to bring about a renewed and apparently firm request that the artillery be removed.
There are an estimated 300 artillery pieces ringing Sarajevo, of which perhaps 10 percent have been hit in the NATO bombardment, United Nations officials said today. These guns have killed more than 10,000 people, mainly civilians, in the Bosnian capital over the last three and a half years.
The seeming failure of today's meeting between General Janvier and General Mladic posed a delicate problem for Western governments. Several more days of bombing might in the end lead to a reaction from what has been a largely passive Bosnian Serb army. But any decision to call off the NATO assault before it is clear that Sarajevo has really been relieved after 40 months of siege will irk the Muslim-led Bosnian Government.
British and French artillery belonging to the Rapid Reaction Force on Mount Igman near Sarajevo continued today to pound Bosnian Serb positions, particularly the Serbs' main barracks at Lukavica southwest of the Bosnian capital.
Even as the military situation around Sarajevo remained unresolved, the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs began posturing ahead of the peace talks. Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, ruled out a confederation between the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia -- an arrangement now offered by the United States.
"A confederation with Serbia, with the aggressor, with people who committed genocide, will not happen," he said during a visit to Germany.
In Pale, the headquarters of the Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo, Radovan Karadzic, their leader, listed a number of towns he would never give up and insisted that the territory ultimately controlled by the Serbs be economically viable as an independent entity.
The American plan offers 51 percent of Bosnia to a Muslim-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs, thus obliging the Serbs to give up about a third of what they hold.
"The biggest single problem at the moment is Sarajevo," Mr. Holbrooke said in Belgrade. The Serbs want part of the capital, but the Bosnian Government insists it remain a single, multi-ethnic city.
All these problems were on the table more than two years ago when the parties met repeatedly to discuss a peace plan prepared by Lord Owen of Britain and Cyrus R. Vance of the United States. They have not gone away; indeed they have festered.
But the war has also taken a terrible toll, the military balance is now more even, and many politicians in the Balkans seem to see the American decision to take center stage in the Yugoslav crisis for the first time since it began as crucially important and potentially decisive.

Monitors Reported Safe
 MADRID, Sept. 1 (AP) -- The five European Union monitors reported killed in Bosnia shortly after NATO bombings began this week are alive and well but still in territory held by the Bosnian Serbs, a Spanish Government spokesman said today.
On Thursday, the official Bosnian Serb press agency, S.R.N.A., quoted a Serbian official as saying all five monitors were out of danger and had left Serbian-held land.
Spain has not yet spoken with the three Spaniards in the group, but a spokesman, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, said the Government had "sufficient information from reliable sources to allow us to say that our fellow citizens are safe and sound."
The five monitors were reported to be in the eastern town of Visegrad.

HEADLINE: Liberian Foes Sit Together To Govern

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Liberia's three principal militia leaders were formally seated today on a new six-member Council of State whose mandate is to govern the country and lead it to democratic elections next year.
The seating took place in a ceremony in downtown Monrovia, the capital, where huge crowds converged in the steaming streets, listening to the proceedings over the radio or trying to catch a glimpse of the men who ripped their country asunder during six years of civil war but have now pledged to work together in governing it. 
 The ceremony represented a major victory for a regional diplomatic and military effort led by Nigeria and Ghana, which persisted even after the United Nations, the United States and many other would-be brokers seemingly threw up their hands in frustration over what only recently appeared to be a hopeless conflict.
President Jerry J. Rawlings of Ghana, speaking as chairman of the Economic Community of West African States, borrowed John F. Kennedy's famous exhortation "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country" and called on Liberians to set aside their quarrels and rebuild their shattered country.
Like other speakers, Mr. Rawlings called upon the international community to provide Liberia with urgently needed aid to disarm thousands of fighters and restore the economy. But he warned the new leaders that their only hope of seeing this happen was to "keep the faith with the democratic program."
Of the many speakers, it was Wilton S. Sankowolo, the council's new chairman and one of its three civilian members, who best succeeded in tapping into the emotions of the crowd that pressed into the vermilion hall decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting, a reminder of the American origins of this country as a colony established by freed slaves in the early 19th century.
Dressed in a flowing white gown, Mr. Sankowolo, a former university professor and newspaper columnist, briefly turned the ceremony into the likes of a Baptist prayer meeting as he mentioned the suffering that he, like most Liberians, had experienced during the war.
"I know what it means to dodge bullets and rockets," he said. "I know what it means to be incarcerated or killed for belonging to this or that ethnic group, or making the bad mistake of working for the Government. I know what it means to live in the bushes, in refugee camps and displaced centers, going without food for days. I know what it means to walk up and down the streets of Monrovia in torn clothes and shoes."
At this point, the audience, which had been locked in the call-and-response cadence of his speech, answering each line with an "Amen" or a "Yes sir," broke out in tearful cheers.
"I wouldn't say that this caught the international community by surprise, but we are greatly encouraged," said Dane Smith, President Clinton's special envoy to Liberia, which has long had special political and economic ties with the United States.
Liberians were nearly unanimous in applauding the installation of the new Government, which marked the end of a civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people, or about 6 percent of the population. But many remain wary about having militia leaders take over the reins of the state.
Liberia's history encourages such skepticism. The country's civil war was started in 1989 by Charles G. Taylor, one of the newly seated members of the governing council, with an avowed goal of ending the dictatorship of Samuel K. Doe.
As a Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force intervened to halt Mr. Taylor's assault on Monrovia, his Libyan-backed army, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, splintered into a growing number of rival, ethnically based militias.
If most revolutions are said to devour their children, many here have noted that Mr. Doe's seizure of power in 1980 seems to have regurgitated his. He led a coup by young noncommissioned officers from a political elite historically drawn from the descendants of American slaves.
Like Mr. Taylor, who served as head of a government procurement agency, the other principal militia leaders and members of the new council, Alhaji Kromah and George E. Boley, were in Mr. Doe's Government. Mr. Sankowolo, the new council chairman, was once Mr. Doe's chief of Cabinet.
On the streets of Monrovia today, however, the mood was clearly one of rejoicing rather than introspection and analysis.
Joining Mr. Taylor on his trip to Monrovia from his longtime base in Gbarnga were scores of his security personnel and fighters who, like Mr. Taylor, had not set foot in the capital since the war began.
"It has been five years since I have been to Monrovia and, man, I am happy," said Col. Emil Taylor, a National Patriotic Front fighter. (He is not related to Charles Taylor.) "I once made it most of the way to town, but I ran into some people I knew who said that members of the Ulimo militia were all around, and since they knew me, they would kill me.
"Well this morning I saw one of my old Ulimo enemies, and he ran over to me and said, 'My man, I'm going to cut off your foot.' But then we just started laughing, and we had a beer together."

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Rise Despite Mixed Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended with solid gains yesterday in trading that was buffeted by data that gave a mixed reading of the economy.
Traders said there was a good amount of buying during the abbreviated trading session as investors, first driven to selling on a strong payroll report for August, came back to buy after a weak manufacturing report suggested slow growth and a chance of further interest rate cuts. 
 Bond futures trading, which influences the cash market, staged a strong short-covering rally by investors who had bet that prices would fall but but were forced to buy securities to limit their losses as the market firmed after early weakness. The price on the December bond futures contract shot up as high as 11318/32 , after trading as low as 11125/32 . In the cash market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32 , to 10315/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.61 percent, from 6.64 percent on Thursday. The market closed early yesterday, at 2 P.M., because of the Labor Day holiday weekend.
 Bond prices fell in early trading after the Labor Department released its employment data for August. The agency reported that payrolls rose by 249,000, far higher than market expectations. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, slipped to 5.6 percent, from 5.7 percent in July.
 But the apparent strength in the job market did not bother analysts and traders for long.
 Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for Technical Data in Boston, said: "Payroll numbers were stronger than economists expected, but the gain in August was partly the result of more and more schools opening earlier in the year.
 "And while the employment rate fell, it did so because the labor force shrank. The key areas of the economy where we wanted to see growth, growth was absent. There are signs that consumers are not spending."
 Treasury prices later rose, following a report from the National Association of Purchasing Management that was weaker than expected. The association said its index of business activity for August fell to 46.9 percent from 50.5 percent.
 The report indicated a reversal in August of the sharp increase that had been posted in July, noted Elliott Platt, director of research at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. He said the orders component of the purchasing managers' index was viewed with suspicion, given the weakness in the manufacturers' orders data.
 "That suspicion proved to be appropriate, as the orders component -- which is the largest component of the N.A.P.M. index -- experienced an extraordinarily sharp drop," Mr. Platt said, adding that the other components had declined, but to a lesser degree.
 Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, noted the complications in weighing the sum of the day's data.
 "Payroll headline numbers appeared to be strong, but after analyzing the data it was clear that payroll growth wasn't quite as buoyant as the headline number suggested," Mr. Fine said. "At the same time, however, there was no way one could categorize payroll growth as weak. But that was certainly not true when it came to the purchasing manager survey, which indicated clear-cut weakness in the industrial sector across the board."
 "After all is said and done," he added, "the mixed nature of all these numbers taken in concert indicates to me that while the economy is improving in the second half the improvement can only be described as moderate."
 Other data yesterday showed July construction spending up a strong 2 percent, to its highest level in two years.
 The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index in August showed a rise to 96.2, on a final basis, from 94.4 in July, people who had seen the report said. The index is provided only to subscribers. The index confirmed previous gauges showing consumer sentiment at a healthy level consistent with economic growth, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Hails Veterans of War in Pacific

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Sept. 1

 BODY:
From an airfield that was bombed in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Clinton today paid tribute to the Americans who fought and died half a century ago in the war in the Pacific with "acts of heroism that will never be surpassed."
Beginning a weekend of ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, the President stood in a Humvee at Wheeler Field here and reviewed the troops -- 7,000 members of the armed forces, standing at attention under a hazy blue sky. 
 But in a reminder that even now another war rages in Europe, Mr. Clinton's first words were of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and the announcement that representatives of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia -- after two days of NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb targets -- have agreed to new peace negotiations in Geneva next week.
"This is a positive step forward, but much remains to be done," the President said. "No one should doubt NATO's resolve to prevent the further slaughter of innocent civilians in Sarajevo, in the other safe areas in Bosnia."
Then, as the wind tousled his hair sent the flags of a military color guard crackling, Mr. Clinton remembered the veterans of World War II who served in the Pacific.
"The World War II generation truly saved the world," said the 49-year-old President, the first of the postwar generation to reach the White House. "Our security, our prosperity, our standing among other nations, all these are the legacies of the men and women, the heroes before us whom we honor today."
Thousands of spectators looked on from bleachers and folding chairs set up on the dusty parade grounds, and many of them were survivors of the grueling air, sea and jungle battles of the Pacific -- the conflict that the historian John Dower called the "war without mercy."
At Mr. Clinton's urging, the veterans, now in their 70's and 80's, stood up, white-haired and wizened, some on canes. And the President singled out Robert Bush, who doffed his white cap and saluted. As an 18-year-old Navy corpsman on Okinawa, where the last and deadliest battle of the war took place, Mr. Bush braved a barrage of artillery and mortar fire to give plasma to a wounded officer. For his heroism, which left him blind in one eye, Mr. Bush won the Medal of Honor.
Mr. Clinton's appearance began a weekend of pageantry, parades and commemorations in Honolulu and across the nation marking the 50th anniversary of the day President Harry S. Truman called V-J Day, for victory over Japan.
On that day, Sept. 2, 1945 -- just weeks after the United States ushered in the nuclear age by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- Gen. Douglas MacArthur formally accepted the Japanese surrender aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay, bringing an end to World War II and marking the final defeat of the Axis powers.
Pointing to the United States' emergence from the war as a prosperous superpower, Mr. Clinton planned to use the weekend to call on Americans to pull together like the World War II generation to face the new challenges fostered by economic and technological change.
"Now it is for us to be true to your legacy of courage and devotion," the President said today, "to follow your lead in finding strength in America's diversity and unity in America's purpose."
On Saturday, Mr. Clinton is to speak at a commemorative service at the National Cemetery of the Pacific, honor the Navy aboard the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson and observe a moment of silence at the Arizona Memorial for the sailors and marines killed on that battleship in the attack on Pearl Harbor. And on Sunday he is to attend a commemorative service, sharing a stage with the Apollo 13 astronaut James Lovell, prominent World War II veterans and an Iowa elementary school teacher whose grandfather was one of five brothers who died in the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942.
On Dec. 7, 1941 -- "a day which will live in infamy," President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared at a joint session of Congress the next day -- Japan propelled the United States into World War II with a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the major American naval base in the Pacific. The attack sunk or disabled 19 warships, including 6 battleships, destroyed about 150 aircraft and killed 2,403 soldiers, sailors and civilians.
The fighting ended on Aug. 14, 1945, when Japan accepted the Allies' demands of unconditional surrender, and the Japanese formally surrendered aboard the Missouri on Sept. 2.
In the 44 months between the United States' entrance into the war and Japan's surrender, the American armed forces drove Japan back from virtual control of the Pacific by winning hard-fought battles in jungles and swamps, in the air and on and under the sea. No battles were ever waged over greater distances and with longer supply lines than those in the Pacific. And the names of the battles still resonate in history: Bataan, Corregidor, Midway, Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Coral Sea, Leyte, Iwo Jima, Okinawa.
"Never before had the fight for freedom stretched across such a vast expanse of land and sea," Mr. Clinton said today. "And never before had the energies of the American people been so fully required or so fully joined."
He did not mention the use of atomic weapons, but he expressed appreciation for the apology extended last month by the Japanese Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, for Japan's aggression. Mr. Clinton said Americans appreciate "the recent powerful words." Japan was one of many nations to send delegations to the weekend ceremonies, and Japanese and American veterans of the war plan to dedicate a friendship plaque on Monday.
Fifty years ago, Mr. Clinton said, a Navy radio man aboard a ship in Tokyo Bay sent a letter to his son in Texas telling him not to see war as a great adventure. The President quoted the sailor as telling his son, "Take it from me, it's the most horrible thing ever done by man."
"Veterans of the Pacific, " Mr. Clinton added, "because you were willing to undergo the most horrible thing ever done by man, freedom is the order of the day in most of the world 50 years later."

Finding That Hard Work Doesn't Always Result in a Good Job

BYLINE: By David Gonzalez 

 BODY:
RICARDO FLORES spent a year mucking through piles of crumpled paper and broken glass, hoping to find a job at the bottom of it all.
 It's dirty work, but it beats going to the group home, which was the other option the 17-year-old high school dropout's father offered him. He chose a year of community service, cleaning up parks along with 15 other youths who graduated last night from Save a Generation, a Bronx-based program that blended boot-camp discipline, academics and counseling. They're proud to show society that even hard-rock kids raised on tough luck can do the right thing, go back to school and get back on track. 
 Now they're ready for a real job. The kind with benefits and vacations.
 But their pride is tempered by frustration, that despite keeping their end of the bargain, it's hard to find a job that doesn't require them to say, "Do fries go with that shake?"
 In the name of efficiency, Wall Street applauds a bank merger that may leave 12,000 people unemployed. And while teen-age joblessness has decreased in the first half of the year for the city, statewide adult unemployment jumped to 7.1 percent this month, its highest level in more than a year.
 Ricardo knows that it takes more to land a job than strong arms. He thinks that maybe he'll have to go to college, even though he'd rather have a construction job.
 "I'll take anything up," he said. "Contractor, lawyer or G-Y-N. Anything. No small stuff."

THE Rev. John Flynn was thinking big when he started Save a Generation a few years back, having decided that he had said the last rites too many times for people who weren't even old enough to be married. Walking through the streets of Crotona, he chatted with drug sellers and buyers and decided one thing would get them off the corner: Jobs.
 Silver-haired dreamer that he is, Father Flynn put together a program from existing opportunities, recruiting unemployed high school dropouts, mostly from the Bronx. For several months, youths attended a National Guard training program in Peekskill, breaking from the street culture and learning discipline. Back home, they would take jobs as Americorps volunteers, working 35 hours a week in the parks while earning a small salary and the promise of a $5,000 grant for college. Private donations increased their pay to $7 an hour, while 12 hours a week in classes and counseling improved their skills and confidence.
 But most of the youths who finished the rigorous program -- 10 dropped out -- have yet to land the jobs they had been working toward.
 Qiana Bing spent time walking down Fordham Road filling out job applications, but two months later she has yet to hear back.
 "It's not right," she said, taking a break from her park job. "This is harder than working in a store."
 Glenda Martinez decided to join the Air Force, partly because she could not afford to work and go to school at the same time.
 "The service gave me the best offer," she said.
 Jonathan Dwyer, Save a Generation's director, said there aren't enough jobs available, and that people may be reluctant to take a chance on youths who want to start over, despite some missteps in their pasts.
 "It's hard to find the entry-level jobs out there," Mr. Dwyer said. "With the mergers happening all over the place, these are economic times that seem to be benefiting the very few at the top and not worried about employing the many."

PERHAPS his training program could revise the lessons in skills training and add a course on the black arts of mergers. He is irked by the Rube Goldberg nature of the market: number crunchers push some computer buttons and rearrange spreadsheets that result in a deal that leaves some hapless family man walking down Flatbush Avenue scratching his head and wondering where his job went.
 "Jobs are not on the national agenda," Mr. Dwyer said. "It's not on the city agenda."
 But it is definitely on Russell Enmanuel's agenda, the sleek black one he carried at his side on appointments to learn about office work. A trip to an exchange floor was canceled when the other graduates failed to show. An earlier visit to a law office raised his hopes, but led to nothing.
 "They weren't offering any jobs," he said. "They said if they saw some openings they would look at our resumes. It felt like I didn't belong there. I wanted to belong."
 He is well dressed and eager. He knows computers. At 20, he knows he never wants to go back to flipping burgers for a living.
 The lunch crowd swept by him as he stood on the sunny corner of Liberty and Church Streets. He looked at them, loose ties and easy attitudes.
 "When am I going to have a chance to get a good job like this?" he said. "I'm told if you keep trying for the good ones, you find it sooner or later."
 He looked over to a Burger King restaurant on the corner.
 "That's not me. No more."
 He knows where he belongs.

HEADLINE: Reports Show Weakness In Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Despite a hefty expansion of August payrolls, the economic rebound has yet to gain momentum and the economy appears increasingly likely to need another round of interest rate cuts this fall, an array of Government and other data indicated today.
 The Labor Department's report on employment, wages and hours -- the first broad-based gauge of the economy's performance for the month -- showed that employers added 249,000 jobs, with a modest rise in factory workers ending a streak of four straight declines. 
 The unemployment rate, in the meantime, was essentially unchanged at 5.6 percent. A separate department survey found that both jobholders and the work force contracted.
 In addition, the Government index intended to predict the economy declined in July for the fifth time in six months, and corporate purchasing agents reported that factory activity dropped in August.
 Taken together, "these numbers come down pretty squarely on the side of ongoing sluggishness," said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist of Keycorp, a big Cleveland-based banking company. He said it was now a "virtual cinch" that the Federal Reserve would cut short-term interest rates at its policy meeting on Sept. 26. Others, however, said the Fed might defer action until November.
 After a yearlong series of increases, the central bank reversed direction in early July and made an initial cut after its drive to slow too-rapid growth late last year had taken hold firmly.
 The Clinton Administration responded cautiously to the employment report, which included declines in both the length of the workweek and in aggregate production.
 Based on what is known so far, the economy's growth will probably be "moderate" for the quarter that ends on Sept. 30, Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. This presumably means a pace faster than the spring quarter's 1.1 percent growth rate but short of the 2.5 to 3 percent pace beyond which most economists believe inflation would accelerate.
 The employment report seemed unusually challenging to its Wall Street interpreters. Initially, traders leaped to the conclusion that the expansion in payrolls of 249,000 jobs, which was surprisingly large, would inhibit further easing of monetary policy.
 But these fears waned as analysts digested the details of the report, which those at Merrill Lynch called "muddled, superficially stronger than expected but, on deeper analysis, fairly weak."
 A big factor in the swelling payrolls, which have risen an average of only 100,000 a month since March, was a 76,000 expansion for state and local governments. The department estimated that 40,000 of this rise reflected a growing trend for schools to reopen in August rather than in September, a phenomenon with which its process for seasonal adjustment has not kept pace.
 A downward revision cut July's job growth to 6,000, from the 55,000 initially reported, but this was exactly offset by an upward revision for June that transformed the gain for that month to 299,000 from 250,000.
 Some sectors did show improvement in August. Factories added 12,000 jobs after shedding 88,000 in July; the temporary help business rebounded by 44,000; there were sizable gains in health and social services, and employment in finance, insurance and real estate climbed 15,000, the biggest gain in more than a year.
 Jobs in the retail trade, however, were little changed, and construction was flat, the report also showed.
 Average hourly earnings, which had unnerved some analysts by surging 6 cents in both June and July, eased 2 cents last month, to $11.47. Average weekly earnings rose $2.98, to $394.57.
 The tally of households, on which the unemployment rate is based, showed 180,000 fewer jobs, but since the labor force shrank even more, by 307,000, the jobless rate edged down a tenth of a point, which the department considers statistically insignificant. The rate for Hispanic workers rose 1.1 points, to 9.9 percent.
 Geographically, the jobless rate edged up a tenth of a point in the Northeast, to 6.2 percent, and a tenth of a point in the West, to 6.9 percent. The rate eased by two-tenths of a point in the Midwest, to 4.5 percent, and by a tenth of a point in the South, to 5.5 percent.
 The decline in the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators amounted to two-tenths of 1 percent in July, erasing a June rise, which had been the only increase so far this year.
 "Both the leading indicators and the unemployment rate confirm that the slowdown is not over yet," said Gordon Richards, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.
 Another sign of decline came from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which said its manufacturing index fell for the third time in four months, to 46.9 in August from 50.5 in July. A reading below 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally declining.
 But in a bright spot among the reports released today, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose in July by 2 percent -- the strongest gain in two years -- with increases across the board for both private and Government projects.

HEADLINE: Video Keno Is In Doubt As a Judge Backs Trump

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
Lawyers for Donald Trump and New York State battled back and forth in court yesterday over the state's plans to introduce a keno-style lottery next week, leaving the game's future in question.
 Mr. Trump, who owns three casinos in Atlantic City, is fighting to stop the game, and a state supreme court justice in Manhattan issued a temporary restraining order yesterday preventing the state from introducing it on Wednesday as planned. The game, called Quick Draw, is to be played in bars, restaurants and other locations. 
 But the fight is far from over. The state quickly filed a notice of appeal yesterday, which automatically stayed the judge's order. In turn, Michael Armstrong, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said he would ask an appellate court on Tuesday to once again block the state from starting up Quick Draw.
 Mr. Trump contends Quick Draw is a form of casino gambling, similar to playing slot machines, and would require an amendment to the State Constitution. A measure authorizing the Quick Draw game was passed by the Legislature in June as a way of balancing the budget, and proponents say it will raise at least $82 million a year.
 To play the game, some 2,000 computer terminals are to be set up in bars, restaurants, bowling alleys and Off Track Betting parlors. Players will select 10 numbers on a card and bet on each card. Every five minutes, a central New York State Lottery computer will pick 20 numbers that will be flashed on video monitors in the Quick Draw locations.
 Acting Supreme Court Justice Louis B. York said yesterday that he needed time to consider the issues "in an unrushed fashion," and asked Assistant State Attorney General Kevin Lamberson if the state would consider delaying Quick Draw.
 Mr. Lamberson said that a delay would cause "the loss of good will, the loss of revenue and serious damage to the image of the game."
 Nonetheless, the judge issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the state from starting the game until he could begin studying the case -- after the Labor Day weekend. "I'd gladly give up a normal weekend," he said. "But if I do that this weekend, my wife is likely to divorce me."
 Afterward, Mr. Trump, who said he was "gratified" by the decision, called Quick Draw "this crack video game" that would destroy the economic and social fabric by luring people to gamble.
 Mr. Trump dismissed the idea that he had filed the suit to protect his casino interests and block casino gambling in New York.

HEADLINE: G.M. and Chrysler Registered A Sales Surge During August

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 1

 BODY:
General Motors and Chrysler said today that their sales surged in August to the highest levels this year, leading to shortages for new vehicles at dealerships.
 Sales picked up from a slowdown in July, helped by lower interest rates and higher sales to government and rental agency fleets, analysts said. 
 "My guess is that what we're seeing is the beginning of a stronger second half," said David Bradley, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities.
 The General Motors Corporation said sales of cars and light trucks rose 7.1 percent in August, to 446,394 from 416,825, led by a strong month in its Chevrolet division and higher sales to fleets.
 The Chrysler Corporation said total vehicle sales rose 4 percent, to 170,557 from 163,858, for the company's third consecutive monthly increase.
 Shares of the two companies were higher today on the New York Stock Exchange. G.M. shares rose $1.375, to $48.50, and shares of Chrysler gained 87.5 cents, to $54.675. Shares of the Ford Motor Company, which will report sales next week, rose 50 cents, to $31.25.
 Several Japanese auto makers also reported United States sales today. The American Honda Motor Company said vehicle sales rose 3.1 percent, to 87,728. But Mazda Motor of America said sales plunged 29 percent, to 23,453, and Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. said sales slipped 5 percent, to 14,810. Toyota Motor Sales USA will report sales Tuesday.
 At G.M., Chevrolet sales rose to 214,132 from 194,225. Sales of Chevrolet Cavaliers rose 74 percent from last year. Lumina and Monte Carlo sales were up 60 percent.
 As many factories shifted to new-model production this summer, supply was a problem at dealerships like Trader Bud's Westside Dodge in Columbus, Ohio, where new-vehicle sales slipped by 25 units, to 175, in August.
"At the beginning of the month, we had no Caravans, we had no Neons and we had no Stratuses," said the dealer's sales manager, Vince Frustaci. "We're going to need more product."
 For Detroit's auto makers, the sales results were a bright spot in a year of unmet expectations. Assuming a 4.5 percent sales increase for Ford, the annual selling rate will reach 15.6 million, according to the Luckey Consulting Group.
 That far exceeds the annual sales rate of 13.7 million in July -- typically the slowest month of the year -- and 15.2 million in June. Sales matched December's 15.6 million rate. In March 1994, the rate reached 15.8 million.
 Late last year, the industry was projecting sales of 16 million cars and trucks this year, well above last year's 15.1 million. As the economy slowed, those forecasts were revised downward. Detroit's major auto makers are now unofficially predicting light-vehicle sales of about 15 million.
 The auto makers are hoping that the decline in interest rates since the Federal Reserve pushed down short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July will help generate demand.
 At the same time, most auto makers continued to offer higher incentives, like cash rebates, to increase sales. Incentives represented an average of 14.8 percent of sticker price in August, compared with 14.5 percent in July and 6.8 percent in August 1994, according to CNW Marketing and Research, a consulting firm in Bandon, Ore.
 "Incentive programs brought a lot of people in," said Tim McCasland, a sales manager at Covert Buick in Austin, Tex. He said one popular program offered $1,500 cash back or 4.5 percent financing on Buick Riviera models.
 If Chrysler is a bellwether, consumers may not have as many bargains to choose from the rest of the year. The No. 3 auto maker, which led its competitors in raising incentives for most of the year, was the only one to lower discounts in August, said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities.
 Chrysler's per-vehicle incentive costs dropped to $850 from the $1,035 average in the second quarter, as the company cleared dealers' lots of 1995 mini-vans.

HEADLINE: New York State's Jobless Rate Jumps to 7.1%

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Employment levels in New York City, New York State and New Jersey were little changed in August, according to Federal data released yesterday. But the unemployment rate -- a measure of the number of people who have been unsuccessfully looking for jobs -- rose in New York State to more than 7 percent for the first time since April 1994.
 The monthly data showed that the unemployment rate rose in New York State to 7.1 percent in August from 6.2 percent in July, and fell in New Jersey to 6.6 percent in August from 6.8 percent in July. 
 Both states were among the four worst, in terms of unemployment, of the nation's 11 most populous. California, with August unemployment of 7.8 percent, was at the bottom, and Texas, with a rate of 6.7 percent, finished below New Jersey.
 Connecticut is not among the 11 states included in the monthly survey.
 Although the unemployment statistics provided little cause for cheer in the New York region, John L. Wieting, the New York regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statisics, said they reflected volatile factors that did not provide a reliable long-term gauge of the region's economy.
 One such factor is the large number of teen-agers who left their summer jobs in August and began looking for other employment during the school year. Since the unemployment rate is based on a household survey, and counts only those who say they are employed or looking for work, the responses of young people can skew the August results.
 "We get a churning of the market in the summer months," Mr. Wieting said. Before a more reliable gauge of the job market can be determined, he added, "we need to see how the numbers settle out in the fall."
 In New York City, the August unemployment rate rose to 8.3 percent from 7.8 percent. But unlike the 11 states, for which the Government applies a seasonal adjustment to account partly for factors like the changes in the teen-aged work force, no seasonal adjustment is provided for New York City, making data for the city more volatile.
 August employment levels, regarded as a more accurate measure of economic performance, fell slightly in New York State and New Jersey from July levels.
 The number of employed people in New York fell by 56,000, to slightly more than 8 million. The number of those employed in New Jersey fell by 33,000, to slightly fewer than 3.8 million.
 The Federal report found that the slight employment decline in New York State occurred entirely outside New York City, where employment rose in August. It said the city gained 32,000 jobs, to slightly fewer than 3 million.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Cotton Prices Gain as Traders See Shortages in U.S. and China

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Cotton prices advanced for a second consecutive session yesterday as traders grew concerned that deteriorating world and American crop conditions could lead to shortages.
 China and the United States are the world's largest cotton producers and both crops are having problems. Insect blight and a lack of rain has lowered yields in Texas and the Mississippi Delta, while flooding has seriously reduced supply in Asia, agronomists say. 
 "All things considered, you can see why the market is so on edge," said Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc.
 The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 1.25 points, to 241.22, the highest the index has been since October 1990.
 On the New York Cotton Exchange, cotton for December delivery, the active month, rose 1.9 cents, to 85.67 cents a pound
 An industry newsletter released yesterday predicted that the fall harvest in the United States would come in below the Agriculture Department's record estimate of 21.8 million bales largely because of continuing crop problems in the Mississippi Delta and Texas. Army beetworms, boll weevils, aphids and tobacco budworms have been especially bothersome this growing season, and crops in the Mississippi Delta and parts of the Southeast have gone weeks without appreciable rain.
 A different newsletter released earlier had indicated China's harvest might come in at 18.5 million 480-pound bales, a million lower than the latest Agriculture Department estimate. Disasters last year in Asia sent American cotton prices to highs not seen since the Civil War.
 Lumber prices tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange despite rising cash prices for the building material. Commission houses and local traders led the selling, which analysts attributed to profit taking after a strong week of gains.
 September lumber fell $5.20, to $282.50 for 1,000 board feet.
 Prices have rebounded in step with rising demand at lumber mills, prompted by increased construction and lower home-mortgage interest rates. But traders were leery of taking longer-term positions in light of losses suffered about this time last year, when prices began a steep decline that ended with the expiring September contract off $60 for 1,000 board feet.

HEADLINE: On a Weekend Roll, Rock Music Carves A Place in History

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Sept. 1

 BODY:
With pomp and feedback, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum was inaugurated today. For this civic ceremony, Jimi Hendrix played the national anthem and Bob Dylan was quoted with reverence. As a big red ribbon was cut by an assembly that included Little Richard and Yoko Ono, speakers blared the Rolling Stones' "It's Only Rock-and-Roll (but I Like It"). In a celebratory parade, a high school band marched to the tune of "Respect" and an Elvis puppet 16 feet tall swiveled down the street.
It took more than a decade of fund raising and $92 million in public and private contributions, but rock-and-roll now has the grandest institution in its history. "You are changing the map of America," Ms. Ono proclaimed. "You are changing the map of the world." 
 The parade and ribbon-cutting were the beginning of a weekend-long party that will include an all-star concert at Cleveland Stadium on Saturday night, to be telecast on HBO at 7:30. The concert, which is expected to last four to six hours, is planned as a larger version of the annual Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, which bring rock's elders together with those who have learned from them. Bruce Springsteen is expected to sing along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash will join John Mellencamp and dozens of other performers will pay tribute to their influences and sing duets with their heirs.
Around the city, rock became a costume party. At one downtown hotel, the staff was dressed as pop stars, with Madonna working the registration desk and Little Richard parking cars.
The Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a 150,000-square-foot building on the shore of Lake Erie, an assemblage of geometric shapes designed by I. M. Pei. It sets out to be both a tourist attraction and a scholarly resource. "Rock is an art form that has been with us now for over 40 years," said Dennis Barrie, the museum's director, as he inspected the exhibits on Thursday. "It has produced great musicians and great poets and has had an impact on everything from racial attitudes to clothing to drug use. It deserves to have its history and creators and perpetrators looked at."
In its planning stages, the museum faced skepticism not only from those who felt rock-and-roll was too frivolous for study, but from those who feared that institutionalizing rock would defuse its rebellious energy. "Museums should not have to be deadly," Mr. Barrie said. "We want to convey some of the energy and magic and attitudes of the art form. Having a museum doesn't rob the music of its future. It just preserves its past."
"Rock has always been trouble and has always been controversial," Mr. Barrie added. "This is not a sanitizing of rock-and-roll, and not a nostalgia trip without really looking at the issues."
The building includes a cylindrical theater and a rectangular one cantilevered over the lake; a tall box, and a wide-open entrance hall in the shape of a semi-pyramidal "glass tent," as Mr. Pei called it. Viewed from the lake side, it could be compared to a turntable with a jutting tone arm, though Mr. Pei preferred to describe the design as "forms in space."
The Hall of Fame itself is a hushed, darkened room at the top of a spiral staircase. Signatures of the 122 current members are etched into glass; monochrome video screens show the members' images and tidbits of information. But as Suzan Evans, the hall's executive director, explained, "The Hall of Fame is a permanent exhibit within the museum." The bulk of the museum is devoted to the complete history of rock, not just the accomplishments of the Hall of Famers, whose careers are required to date back at least 25 years.
The main exhibition area, about 75,000 square feet, is tucked into the embankment below street level, where visitors are greeted by a neon sign proclaiming "Roll Over Beethoven." Inside, film clips roll, video screens flicker and music plays everywhere through speakers and headphones. There are displays of flashy stage costumes and battered guitars, of handwritten lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Springsteen and high school yearbooks for Roy Orbison and Queen Latifah. A piece of Otis Redding's private airplane, which crashed in 1967, is on display; under a spotlight, rotating in a clear cylinder, is Michael Jackson's first glittering glove.
The museum's upper stories hold additional and larger objects, including the original control-room equipment from Sun Studios in Memphis, a chunk of Pink Floyd's stage set from "The Wall" and, suspended overhead, four hand-painted Trabant cars from U2's "Zoo TV" tour. The museum also holds a radio studio, a cafe, a gift shop and cash machines shaped like juke boxes.
What makes the museum different from a display of memorabilia at a Hard Rock Cafe, organizers say, is that the museum puts the objects in context. "The exhibitions have a lot of content and information," said Ileen Sheppard Gallagher, director of exhibition and collections management. "We have a narrative about each exhibit or artist, or timelines to set the stage properly. If you want it, it's there, and if you don't want it, you can just look at the most visual, impactful things. We have the same mandates as other museums: to collect, preserve and educate. But we're doing them in the context of rock-and-roll."
For Ohioans, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame is an investment in respect. Gov. George V. Voinovich calls it "an economic catalyst." In the past decade, Cleveland has rebuilt Gateway Stadium for sports, Playhouse Square for theater and Tower City as a retail complex. "The Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame gives Cleveland and northeastern Ohio an international dimension," said Mr. Voinovich, who was Mayor of Cleveland during the hall's planning stages and a prime mover in its construction.
He said a market analysis had estimated between 600,000 and 900,000 visitors to the hall each year, including 225,000 out-of-towners, bringing the city between $74 million and $96 million annually.
Cleveland was chosen as the site of the Hall of Fame in 1986, when city and state politicians and business leaders made a strong pitch to the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame Foundation. The nonprofit foundation had been started by music-business leaders in New York in 1983. Ahmet Ertegun, the co-chairman of the foundation and the chairman of Atlantic Records, said that the idea arose when he was approached in 1982 to help with a pay-per-view awards program. But he wanted something more lasting than a television show. "I would only do it as a nonprofit thing, a really dignified foundation that would recognize the talents of the pioneers who created this music," he said.
Mr. Ertegun approached other music-business veterans, including Jann Wenner, editor and publisher of Rolling Stone magazine, and Seymour Stein, now president of Elektra Entertainment. Initially, Mr. Ertegun had envisioned buying a brownstone in New York to house a hall of fame and a music reference archive. In 1986, the foundation began to present annual ceremonies, naming about a dozen musicians and backstage figures to the hall. Other cities began approaching the foundation; Cleveland collected more than 600,000 signatures on petitions. On May 5, 1986, Cleveland was named as the site.
The foundation commissioned Mr. Pei to design the building, then budgeted at $26 million, and a site was chosen across from Tower City. But little money was raised until 1989, when Cleveland provided $20 million in tax-exempt bonds, $9 million in state funds and $13 million in corporate and private donations. The site was changed to a larger one in 1990, and the design was revised. In 1993, after the foundation raised about $8 million from the recording business, the State of Ohio guaranteed a $39 million loan, to be repaid through a surcharge on museum admissions and a hotel and motel tax. Groundbreaking took place in June 1993.
Both the foundation and the Cleveland sponsors had been primarily concerned with building the museum, not with what would go inside. Although it had collected some Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix memorabilia, major curatorial efforts did not begin until Mr. Barrie, who had presented a controversial exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs when he was director of the Cincinnati Arts Center, was named as director in September 1993. Two months later Jim Henke, a former editor at Rolling Stone, became chief curator.
Mr. Henke and his staff began calling on musicians, surviving relatives, collectors and institutions (including Graceland, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Hard Rock Cafe) to glean artifacts. The museum's collections come exclusively from loans and donations. "I insisted on that policy," Mr. Wenner said. "I said, 'We can't afford to pay for anything, and if we start we're crazy.' Once we got involved in a game with Christie's and the collectors, it would never end."
The hall's more scholarly side is still in preparation. Its archive and research center will not open until next year. But in October it will hold a conference for elementary-school teachers. Robert Santelli, the hall's director of education, said he hoped to publish a journal, somewhere between academic pop-culture studies and the mainstream rock press.
Meanwhile, young music fans were bemused to see the older generation enshrining rock-and-roll's past. "Their parents didn't like the music they listened to, and now they've built a monument to it," said Elizabeth Hoskin, a 21-year-old college student watching the festivities. "Now our parents hate our music. Is that really going to change?"

WHO WILL RUN THE FROG HOSPITAL?
By Lorrie Moore. Warner, $11.99.
 A woman coming to the end of her 30's and possibly the end of her marriage looks back on the bond she and her best friend shared when they were both 15. Her story is "a sad, witty, disillusioned fairy tale," Caryn James said here last year, and Ms. Moore's "richest work yet."
 

DAISY BATES IN THE DESERT
By Julia Blackburn. Vintage Departures, $12.
 She was difficult and determined, an almost compulsive liar and a wandering soul who finally found peace only in the bleakest regions of Australia. Daisy Bates, an Irish self-taught anthropologist who lived among the aborigines from 1913 to 1934, was not an easy person to capture, but Julia Blackburn has given her substance by searching for herself among the fragments of her subject's life. She "has given us both a fascinating exercise in biography and a rare, intimate glimpse into the biographer's imagination," Linda Simon wrote in the Book Review in 1994. Vintage Departures has also reissued the account of a woman's more recent journey into the heart of Australia. TRACKS, by Robyn Davidson ($12), chronicles the author's traversal of 1,700 miles of her native country's outback, which she made in 1977, in the company of four camels and a dog. In 1981 Sarah Ferrell, writing in The New York Times, called Ms. Davidson "a lively stylist" whose "analyses of her states of mind . . . are both convincing and engrossing." Australia is just as powerful a presence in the work of Rodney Hall, whose YANDILLI TRILOGY (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16) takes place during the country's colonial era. "The Second Bridegroom," the first novel in the collection, is narrated by one of the slave laborers who tamed Australia's wilderness, a young British convict. In 1991 our reviewer, Judith Grossman, praised "the prodigal energy and ebullience of Mr. Hall's writing." In "The Grisly Wife" the storyteller is Catherine Byrne, an English missionary who came to Australia with her husband, an illiterate bootmaker and self-styled prophet. Hers is "a rich, wild" tale by "a thrillingly smart and juicy writer," Beverly Lowry said here in 1993. "Captivity Captive," based on a real turn-of-the-century murder case, features another tormented narrator, an octogenarian who was one of 10 abused children. His story is "harrowing and beautiful. . . . A book that makes demands on the reader's soul," Joyce Reiser Kornblatt said in the Book Review in 1988.
 
THE SHADOW OF THE PANTHER: Huey Newton and the Price of Black Power in America
By Hugh Pearson. Addison-Wesley, $14.
 In this study the bold leader of the Black Panther movement emerges as a brilliant strategist and a ruthless killer. The author analyzes the party's terrorist tactics and the role sympathetic whites played in its fame. Last year our reviewer, Bob Blauner, called the writing of the book "a courageous act," in which Mr. Pearson sometimes achieves "the excitement of a political thriller." In BLACK NATIONALISM: A Search for an Identity in America, by E. U. Essien-Udom (University of Chicago, $14.95), the Nation of Islam is portrayed as a movement that transcended purely political objectives by offering a sense of unity and purpose to poor blacks. Previously out of print, this 1962 book is "an excellent standard treatment of black nationalist belief," Michael Eric Dyson said in these pages in 1992.
 
THE GOOD HUSBAND
By Gail Godwin. Ballantine, $12.
 If behind every successful woman there is a man, he is probably like Francis Lake, who has supported his wife, Magda Danvers, in her scholarly efforts and must now see her through terminal cancer. In this novel Magda's demise and her marriage have a powerful impact on another couple grappling with tragedy. "Ms. Godwin has a remarkable capacity for the subtle presentation of real insight," Sara Maitland wrote here last year.
 
TALKING FROM 9 to 5. Women and Men in the Workplace: Language, Sex and Power
By Deborah Tannen. Avon, $12.50.
 A linguist analyzes speech patterns, showing that verbally assertive women do not reap the same rewards as verbally assertive men. This is "a book that everyone who has ever apologized needlessly, snapped at a subordinate or withered from lack of praise should surely read," Derek Bickerton said in these pages in 1994.
 
IN THE TIME OF THE BUTTERFLIES
By Julia Alvarez. Plume, $11.95.
This novel re-creates the lives of the deceased Mirabal sisters, three women murdered in 1960 by underlings of the Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. Another character is Dede, the surviving sister, and it is in her portrait "that we best understand the depths of Ms. Alvarez's despair and the authenticity of her effort," Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria wrote here last year.
 
SEX IN AMERICA: A Definitive Survey
By Robert T. Michael, John H. Gagnon, Edward O. Laumann and Gina Kolata. Warner, $12.99.
 This report is based on the most comprehensive study of sexual practices in the United States since Kinsey's. Interviewing 3,432 people in 1992, the National Opinion Research Center gathered data showing that we are much more monogamous and much less sexually active than is generally supposed. Written by sociologists (Mr. Gagnon and Mr. Laumann), an economist (Mr. Michael) and a reporter for The New York Times (Ms. Kolata), this book offers "a rich supply of examples to lend those conclusions flesh and bones," Paul Robinson said in the Book Review in 1994. Also reissued is SEXING THE MILLENNIUM: Women and the Sexual Revolution, by Linda Grant (Grove, $12), in which the author argues that the 1960's idea of eroticism was mostly men's; only in the future can we hope for sex devoid of sexism. Our reviewer was again Mr. Robinson, who observed last year, "Pleasure needs as many friends as it can get." LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: A Southern Escape

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE, Denver bureau chief of The Times, was Brazil bureau chief until July.

 BODY:
SAO PAULO, the largest city in the Southern Hemisphere, has become a powerful magnet for Americans, drawing business visitors to Brazil's economic center and tourists to Brazil's air hub. But after more than a week in this dreary, industrial metropolis, visitors traditionally have escaped to Rio de Janeiro, one hour north by air.
Now increasing numbers of Paulistas and foreigners are flying one hour south instead -- for a quiet stay in Florianopolis, the island capital of Santa Catarina State. 
 Virtually unknown to American tourists and barely mentioned in their guidebooks, Santa Catarina now rivals Rio as a destination for foreign tourists. During the last Southern Hemisphere summer, it drew 115,000 foreign visitors, roughly as many as Rio. With tidy towns, crime-free beaches, pleasant driving, five centuries of European settlement and a friendly population of Italian and German descendants, Santa Catarina is the gateway to Brazil's European corner.
Ask a sandy-haired native about Amazon deforestation, and his eyes will glaze over. Local people are more interested in talking about their new computer research parks.
Without samba or flash, the sedate charm of the region has won a wide following. Typically during Southern Hemisphere summers (from December through March), as many as 1 percent of neighboring Argentina's 35 million people migrated to Santa Catarina's 300 miles of beaches.
With no breaking news to draw us to Santa Catarina during five years in Brazil, my wife, Elizabeth, and I set aside a week in April 1994 to explore Brazil's little Europe, first by taxi, then by rented car. Addicts of the off-season, we discovered that southern Brazil's best weather, best prices and best beach conditions are in April and May, and again in September through November.
Florianopolis is positively suburban in the most agreeable sense. One of Brazil's smallest state capitals, this city of only 250,000 is split between the mainland and Santa Catarina Island. Two bridges, a graceful steel suspension span for pedestrians and cyclists and a reinforced concrete one for cars, link the "continente" with the island, the main tourist area. Stretching over 174 square miles, the island is slightly larger than Barbados. Not cold enough to stop palm trees from growing in city parks, the crisp subtropical climate clears the air and adds a luminosity not found in Brazil's humid tropics closer to the Equator.
Boasting the best natural harbor between Rio and Buenos Aires, Santa Catarina still shows signs of the 18th-century power struggle between Spain and Portugal. To defend their prize, the Portuguese started to populate the island with fishing families from the Azores in the 1720's. At the same time, colonial envoys built four forts to protect the island's two sheltered bays. But the defenses didn't work as planned. In 1777, a Spanish armada invaded and temporarily occupied the island.
TWO centuries later, rural parts of Santa Catarina island still maintain an Azorean air -- in red-tiled cottages, women sew white cotton lacework to sell to tourists while the men set out in high-prowed Portuguese boats, netting the day's catch for island restaurants.
In high season, beaches and forts echo again with Spanish, this time from the peaceful invasion of Argentine tourists. Brazil and Argentina are now bound together in a common market. Offering linguistic relief to Americans mystified by the soft, slurring sounds of Portuguese, southern Brazil is the only part of the country where travel agents, hotel receptionists and car-rental clerks often speak Spanish. In the interior of this state, older people are more likely to speak German.
Two planes fly on Saturday from Buenos Aires to Florianopolis, five on Sunday and one on weekdays. The island now has about 65 hotels and inns, largely clustered a half-hour's taxi ride from the airport on the northern end, where the ocean is the calmest. We stayed at the Costao do Santinho, a recently built resort hotel that discreetly dominates a quiet bay surrounded with green vegetation. Less expensive and separated from a beach by a cobblestone street is the island's pioneering resort hotel, Cabanas da Praia Mole.
With 42 beaches to explore on the island, some visitors may never leave the sand. But to visit island forts or remote villages populated by descendants of Azoreans, tour companies offer trips on "schooners," motor-powered coastal sloops that retain masts and booms largely as decoration. The best preserved of the forts, Santa Cruz on Anhatomirim Island at the mouth of the harbor, is now an ecological research station. On foot, we explored around the city's shaded, bustling main square -- a 19th-century palace that is now a state history museum, a puppet fair under a banyan tree and a handicrafts market in a restored, dockside customs house. A world away from Rio's wary tourism, elderly Argentine retirees casually carried cameras, taking snapshots without fear of thieves. The young, middle-class druggies sprawled on the cathedral steps didn't seem to disturb anyone.
For dinner, a local journalist and his wife took us to Capitao e Narbal, an informal seafood haunt hidden away on a side street of Lagoa da Conceicao, a village in the middle of the island. A chilled white wine from southern Brazil accompanied mussels with cream, a fresh seafood salad and a shrimp stew.
The next morning we rented a car to explore the countryside. With one of the world's highest traffic fatality rates, Brazil is generally a driver's nightmare: horses and pedestrians emerging from long grass to cross roads, trucks crawling along at night with their lights out, apparently to save the headlights.
But not in tidy Santa Catarina, the state that every two years smugly announces its election returns hours -- if not days -- before Brazil's 25 other states. With the exception of a dangerously crowded federal highway that runs from Florianopolis to Blumenau, driving in rural Santa Catarina and the neighboring state of Rio Grande do Sul was a pleasure, comparable to driving in Ireland.
After two hours of jousting with trucks and buses on that highway, going north from Florianopolis, we turned inland, following a river valley that looked like a miniature Rhine Valley. If Florianopolis seems faintly European in an unaffected way, Blumenau, with its oompah bands, half-timbered 1980's Bavarian architecture and waitresses in dirndls, is the capital of Brazil's ersatz Europe.
In a country with a populace largely of African-Latin stock, Blumenau has turned its Teutonic roots into a national selling point. When floods wiped out the city center 10 years ago, the mayor hit upon the idea of giving five-year real estate tax exemptions to businesses that rebuilt in the Bavarian style. To further jump-start the economy, a two-week Oktoberfest was started. Now it draws nearly a million people, making it one of the world's largest Oktoberfests after Munich's. Now, the town is trying to draw fewer, but more-monied beer drinkers.
"We are changing our advertising strategy to get more class A people," Adolfo Ern Filho, Blumenau's Oktoberfest organizer, bellowed over a German band belting out polka tunes at a beer hall restaurant, the Moinho do Vale. With a bottle of local Liebfraumilch on the table, dishes included kassler, eisbein, wieners and sauerkraut.
 Back in our Brazilian-made Volkswagen Gol, we returned to Florianopolis and then drove 75 miles south, down a quieter stretch of the federal highway, to Laguna.
A quiet resort town, Laguna offered two beaches with gentle surf, the hilltop Laguna Tourist hotel designed in 1960's modern, and lines of fishermen throwing lead-weighted nets to catch mullet, which are driven into an inlet by helpful dolphins every day. There are also a monument and a museum honoring a young local woman, Anita Ribeiro da Silva, who caught the eye of a passing revolutionary, Giuseppe Garibaldi. After practicing revolution in southern Brazil with mixed results, Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi set sail for Europe where they helped forge modern Italy.
ANOTHER monument in town marks Laguna's place in 15th-century history. On June 7, 1494, the kings of Spain and Portugal agreed to split the world in half, with Spain taking the part 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands and Portugal taking the part east of the line. Since Europe had yet to learn of the existence of Brazil, the Spaniards thought that they were giving up Africa and a lot of salt water. Soon they discovered that they had signed away a healthy slice of South America -- from the mouth of the Amazon to Laguna.
To celebrate the 500th anniversary of what is known as the Tordesillas Line, Laguna's mayor and local dignitaries gathered in June, 1994, at the intersection where a cement globe marks the line's southern terminus.
We then embarked west, on one of Brazil's prettiest drives -- a new highway that snakes its way up the mountains of Rio do Rastro. The road approaching the mountains crossed an undulating countryside of green hills, wooden cottages with parabolic antennas, cows in pastures studded with Brazilian pines and the occasional lean spire of a Lutheran church. After a police checkpoint, the road climbed more and more steeply, eventually forcing our valiant Gol to labor along in first gear, barely breaking 10 miles an hour. Frequent road turnouts allow engines to cool and drivers to appreciate the unfolding valley view.
 At the top, sweaters went on and the valley below disappeared into a boiling cauldron of cold mist. After a short drive across a table plain, we stopped at the first steakhouse, Churrascaria Cascata. Southern Brazil is cattle country -- the northernmost outpost of the gaucho culture of Argentina and Uruguay -- and the fare of the land is beef, usually served hot off the coals. From the steakhouse, a smooth, lightly traveled ribbon of road led over the mesa plain to Sao Joaquim. At 4,460 feet, Sao Joaquim is Brazil's highest town. But across this tropical land, it is better known as Brazil's coldest town. In the depths of winter -- July and August -- temperatures drop to the 40's. But when thermometers start plunging below 32 degrees, national television networks cover the big event: snow.
We rolled through Sao Joaquim without stopping, trying to cross the Rio Grande do Sul state line before nightfall. Dinnertime found us in the town of Garibaldi, seated at a table appropriately set with a red-and-green checkered tablecloth, and tasting the first of several local wines. While the reds tend to be fruity, Brazil's more expensive whites can be dry if adequately chilled.
Asked how many member families of the Aurora grape growing cooperative are of Italian origin, Jose A. Alberici Jr., the president, answered "99.5 percent." Long an in-house affair, Brazilian wines have improved in quality in recent years. In 1993, Marcus James, an Aurora brand, was the fastest growing brand of wine imported to the United States, surpassing several Italian labels. Aurora offers daily tours of its winery in Bento Goncalves. The calendar is studded with municipal grape and wine festivals.
After touring two wineries, Aurora and Forestier, we drove east to Gramado, another ethnic enclave, this time German. It is a place of clean-swept streets, a thriving chocolate industry and hydrangea shrubs everywhere. A highland retreat for the affluent of Porto Alegre, the state capital 80 miles away, the town's boutiques sell sweaters and hotels offer heated pools.
From our hotel, Laje de Pedra, a Brazilian version of a 1960's alpine family resort, a sweeping view extended over a pine-forested valley, broken occasionally by basalt outcroppings. Five miles away at Caracol Park in Canela, in a tableau that seemed lifted from a 19th-century naturalist painting, we gazed at a river that ran through a pine-cloaked gorge, then fell 420 feet into a rock basin. In the evening, we repaired to St. Hubertus, a traditional restaurant in Gramado's Black Lake district. With antlers over the mantelpiece, a crackling fire in the hearth, and a fondue bubbling under candlight on the table, it was a fitting close to an exploration of Brazil's little Europe.
 
Exploring Little Europe and cowboy country
 
Getting There
From Sao Paulo or Rio, Brazil's two largest ports of entry, there are several daily flights to the coastal state capitals of southern Brazil, Florianopolis and Porto Alegre. Before you go, you must get a visa and should consider a Brazil Air Pass. Only available outside Brazil, the pass is often a way to beat Brazil's exorbitant domestic fares.
Among many car rental agencies, Localiza, telephone (031) 800-2121, rents cars in Florianopolis, Blumenau and Gramado. Daily rate for mid-sized car (Escort, Uno Mille, Corsa or Gol) $75; 100 kilometers free, 28 cents a kilometer thereafter.
The dialing code for Brazil is 55; prices are calculated at .88 reals to the dollar.
 
Santa Catarina Island
By the shoulder of a bluff of coastal rainforest, the Costao do Santinho is a new, Mediterranean-style hotel that dominates a private crescent-shaped beach ideal for quiet strolls. 2505 Estrada Dom Joao Becker; telephone (048) 261-1000. Double rooms start at $90.
A veteran standby is Cabanas da Praia Mole, a resort hotel that is separated from the beach by a road. Families can choose from 60 rooms and 18 chalets. 2001 Estrada da Barra da Lagoa; (048) 232-0231. Doubles range from $124 to $140.
Tucked away on a side street of Lagoa da Conceicao, Restaurant Capitao e Narbal offers fresh seafood dinners in a relaxed setting decorated with hanging plants and fish nets. Favored by the residents, it is a way to avoid crowds of tourists. Dinner for two, with wine, costs about $35. Open only during the summer season, from November through April.
 
Blumenau
Blondes in dirndls, a plywood windmill, oompah bands perspiring in the subtropics, and the cavernous beerhall and sausage house at Restaurante Moinho do Vale, 66 Rua Paraguai, give visitors a glimpse of what Latin America would have been like if colonized by Bavarians. Loud, boisterous groups, many from tourist buses, crowd the long tables. Phone (0473) 26-3337. Sausages, beer, potatoes and cabbage for two: $22.
 
Laguna
Built at the time of the Alliance for Progress, the Laguna Tourist Hotel, on Praia do Gi, has retained many of the 1960's Jacqueline Kennedy-style furnishings. Although the beach is a bit of a hike, this hilltop hotel with parklike grounds offers sweeping views of the South Atlantic and of the fishing port of Laguna, once the southernmost limit to the Portuguese empire. (0486) 46-0022. 98 rooms with double at $79.
 
On the Road
When traveling through Brazil's Gaucho land, dining at a churrascaria is a must; ruddy cowboy waiters in baggy pants, boots and handlebar mustaches go from table to table with roast meat on three-foot skewers. After driving into the plateau above Laguna, Churrascaria Cascata, State Highway 438, kilometer 45; (0492) 321-23, offers all you can eat for $8 a person.
 
Rio Grande do Sul
In Garibaldi, the Casacurta is a family-run inn offering a neo-Victorian charm. 510 Rua Luis Rogerio Casacurta; (054) 262-2166. 12 rooms. Doubles $50 to $68.
Green-and-red-checked tablecloths prevail at the Choppin Restaurant on the town's main avenue, at 507 Independencia. A low-key establishment with a good local wine list, the Choppin offers pasta and beef; dinner for two with wine about $25.
 
Gramado
Overlooking a sylvan gorge outside the town of Gramado, Hotel Laje de Pedra offers a resort setting with one of the few heated pools in Brazil. Check the bill carefully. The cashier "mistakenly" tripled mine. Avenida Presidente Kennedy; (054) 282-1530. 250 rooms ranging from $120 to $180.
Downtown, within walking distance of the chocolate shops and sweater boutiques is the Hotel Serrano; the style is rustic alpine with pine walls and fireplaces. 84 rooms, with doubles ranging from $103 to $185.
Down the street from the hotel, a second-floor perch at Piccolo Paradiso allows the visitor to watch the world go by. A "fetucchine Piccolo Paradiso" with ham, mushrooms and green beans, chicken gratin, dessert and drinks for two: $27. 2455 Avenida Borges de Medeiros; (054) 286-1059.
For a romantic finale to a tour of Brazil's Little Europe, dinner could be at Saint Hubertus, a Swiss-style restaurant in Gramado's Black Lake district (Lago Negro). Reservations are a good idea as couples drive up from Porto Alegre, the state capital for a quiet dinner here. Fondue Bourguignon for two with 13 different sauces, $38. 974 Rua da Carriere; (054) 286-1273.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
The Rising Cost Of Taking a Trip

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
PEOPLE taking their vacations now will probably find that things cost more than they planned when they drafted their budget last spring, although rising prices at the filling station have apparently peaked.
Gasoline and diesel-fuel prices in June were 8 percent above those in June 1994, according to the Federal Consumer Price Index; but by July, these prices were only 3.1 percent above the year before. According to Patrick C. Jackman of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which prepares the index, filling-station prices follow by a few months the movement of crude-oil prices, and these have been declining. 
 The snapshot showing rising travel costs comes from an index prepared by the Travel Industry Association of America using a selection of the bases in the Government index. The overall travel price index for June, the most recent, showed an increase of 4.3 percent over June 1994, while the Consumer Price Index rose only 3 percent in the same period. The fuel price bulked large in the June travel cost rise; the association gives it greater weight in compiling the index because 80 percent of United States travelers go by automobile.
Fares for air travelers on this index also took a big jump in June, rising 4.8 percent from the May level, putting them 9.9 percent above June 1994, and air fares are continuing to rise, according to the Air Transport Association. Amtrak fares on short trips in the East have risen, too.
Hotel prices are also up. The Travel Industry Association reported that lodging prices between June 1994 and June 1995 rose 3.8 percent against the 3 percent cost-of-living rise. Prices of hotel rooms are at a record level, with the average at $65 a night, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn.
And while car-rental costs are not included in the index, the rental companies increased their fees by $5 a day across the board at the end of July, after failing to stick with an effort to return to mileage charges. Cruises, another travel component not in the industry index, are apparently an exception to the trend, with discounts widespread.
 
What the Figures Mean
 The increases have different causes, although emergence from a recession plays a role in all. Most analysts of the industry respond defensively when asked for reasons, saying that many prices had been flat for a long time. Amtrak is under pressure from Congress to stop losing money. The airlines are looking back at months of red ink. Hotel prices from 1986 to 1993 lagged behind the rise in the cost of living. But none of this history lessens the impact on travelers when prices start to pull ahead again.
Like all cost indexes, those on travel cannot be mixed and matched. The Travel Industry Association does not use discounted prices for air fares or hotel rooms, because its source, the Government index, does not. This means that the hotel costs reflected in these statistics are the advertised rates, not what people actually pay. Similarly, according to Bill Evans, the director of economic research for the association, the air fares are "usually" full coach fares, which are normally paid only by business travelers sent out of town at the last minute.
One company that analyzes travel costs, Topaz Enterprises in Portland, Ore., believes this is an out-of-date benchmark. "Nobody pays sticker price," said Elliott Troutman, president of Topaz. Like the Air Transport Association, Topaz deals with what is paid, rather than with the asking price. Mr. Troutman said, however, that his company's figures showed a 10 percent increase between June 1994 and June 1995 in the prices paid for air travel -- a figure not significantly different from the Travel Industry Association's 9.9 percent.
David A. Swierenga, the economist for the Air Transport Association, said the airlines' "yield" -- the price per passenger per mile -- reversed direction in April 1995, with an increase of .5 percent over April 1994; before that, it showed drops every month since the start of 1994. Travel Industry Association figures did not put air travel out of the minus column until May. Air Transport Association figures for June showed an increase of 2.2 percent over June 1994, and for July, an increase of 4.4 percent over the year before.
 
The Lodging Factor
 Lodging costs are a big component of the travel price index. According to Mark Lomano, executive vice president of Smith Travel Research, which specializes in this area, prices are rising because hotel building has slowed and occupancy rates have been increasing, meaning that consumers are now encountering sold-out nights. This has shifted the balance temporarily in the direction of the seller, he said.
Smith's figures show the average price paid for a hotel room in June at $65.41, as against $63.67 in June 1994, an increase of 4.4 percent. The travel association's figures for the advertised prices also showed the June 1994 price at $63 but put the June 1995 price at $68. The margin between the $68 advertised price and the $65 price actually paid shows the consumer's opportunities for bargaining, or at least for asking, "Is that the best price you have?"
Mr. Lomano said hotel rates had been rising for 18 months, most steeply in the last six or seven months. He said he expected the higher level to continue next year. "Then, in two or three years," he added, "more room supply will be built and the balance will shift again."
Mr. Troutman saw a similar picture in air fares. He said the reduction of capacity, through such steps as American Airlines' abandonment in June of its hub at RaleighDurham and all lines' ending of scheduled service to such cities as Trenton and Salem, Ore., and reduction of flights to other places, as well as the demise of several start-up airlines, was enabling lines to raise prices. "But if it becomes too lucrative," he said, "it will attract competitors and someone will figure out how to take advantage of the situation."
 
Excursion-Fare Cutback
 The most complex change is in Amtrak's short-haul fare structure. In May, the railroad abandoned round-trip excursion fares between New York and Washington and went to one-way fares only. It also extended the blackout period for the cheapest tickets. A year ago, the blackout time was Friday from noon to 7 P.M. Since May, the blackout period has been 11 A.M. to 11 P.M. on both Friday and Sunday.
Chuck Blitzer, media spokesman for the Northeast corridor, provided the following simple example: In August 1994, a round-trip New York-Washington ticket on a non-Metroliner train would have cost $92, and this would have been usable for any trip except one leaving between noon and 7 P.M. on Friday. This August, the cheapest unreserved round trip, made on two one-way tickets, would cost $102, an increase of nearly 11 percent, and it would be subject to the new blackout periods. A one-way ticket usable in the Sunday blackout would cost $67 unreserved and $73 reserved; a one-way ticket usable in either blackout would cost $75 unreserved and $83 reserved.
The one-way Metroliner price was $96 for August 1994, Mr. Blitzer said, and is $103 this year. A sharper picture: In 1994, a Metroliner round trip on a weekend was $118; this year it's $170.

HEADLINE: Appraising the Role of the Appraiser

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
APPRAISERS, whether independent or hired by a bank or other lender, are somewhat remote figures compared to the real estate agents, lenders and lawyers involved in home sales or home equity loans. But virtually every loan applicant will have to rely on an appraisal to set a value on the property against which the loan is to be made.
Despite a fleeting one-time appearance, the appraiser's function is central to the lender's decision to grant the loan, deny it or reduce it. Until recently the appraiser was unregulated and the borrower had little recourse from a lender's decision based on the appraisal. 
 A succession of changes in Federal law, coupled with the explosion of computer technology in the mortgage industry, have markedly altered the way that appraisals are done, and many in the real-estate business expect the changes to continue, and even accelerate.
"The appraisal profession will change even more over the next five years," said Kenneth Kerin, senior vice president of the National Association of Realtors in Chicago. "Realtors, insurance companies and accounting firms are dropping the appraisal side of their businesses because more data in computer models is doing a lot of the work to determine property value, and appraisers are continuing to drop out, not wanting to meet the cost and inconvenience of complying with licensing requirements."
Borrowers who own or are buying low- and mid-priced homes may be surprised to find that the worth of the property is judged simply by a "drive-by" appraisal, or a broker's opinion reached by surfing the multiple listings for similar homes in the area. Higher-priced homes, however, are required under the law to be fully appraised by a licensed practitioner.
That discrepancy has been the focus of appraisers' dissatisfaction with alterations in the new Federal law. In 1991 a home loan of $15,000 required a full appraisal, but since then the minimum has risen periodically to $50,000, $100,000, and, in 1994, to $250,000. Consequently the norm for homes below the $250,000 threshold is a drive-by or a broker's opinion, neither of which requires a licensed appraiser.
The intent was benign enough. Banking officials proposed the raises in the threshold of prices requiring appraisals as a means of keeping costs down for lender and borrower alike, and speeding up the mortgage process with less time-consuming appraisal procedures.
Appraisers, cut out of a substantial source of income, are understandably dismayed, but they say that their concern is more than self-interest. "What the law protects is the jumbo loan," said Matthew Smith, a partner at Smith & Salerno, a Mineola appraisal firm, referring to larger loans in general. "People at that economic level are educated consumers. They are going to have a full appraisal anyway. It's the hard-working blue-collar families making the biggest investment of their lives that are at risk of being denied mortgages or home equity loans because of inadequate appraisals."
Dominick S. Pompeo, head of Diversified Valuation Group, a real estate appraisal and consulting firm in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and chairman of the New York State Appraisal Board, estimates that "the law virtually exempts 95 percent of all residential properties from appraisal, and 84 percent of commercial real estate." The floor for fully appraised commercial property loans is $1 million.
Others in the real-estate business, while less sympathetic to the effects that the changes are having on appraisers themselves, raise other cautions. "I've been hearing a lot of whining from appraisers," said Gurdon Buck, a lawyer who specializes in real estate issues at the Hartford firm of Robinson & Cole. "When the appraisers got licensed they thought they would be in fat city, but Federal licensing standards are so high that they had to do a lot more work." The extra work necessary, Mr. Buck said, meant that appraisers started "charging rates that went through the roof."
"With the end of the high-rolling days of refinancing, when appraisers were flooded with business, and now the National Association of Realtors generating huge data bases of houses to draw from, and the banks playing fast and loose in a very competitive market for first mortgages and home equity loans, the independent appraiser is becoming a dinosaur," Mr. Buck continued. "Banks are using their in-house employes on straight salaries to do windshield appraisals that cost nothing."
While such appraisals may be skewed to meet the bank's wish to make a loan of a certain amount, Mr. Buck contended, they will not backfire unless the new owner defaults and the house is foreclosed on, or a few years down the road the new owner cannot sell because the house was overpriced and a sale may not cover the outstanding mortgage.
Until 1989 anyone could set up shop as an appraiser by having business cards printed. But during the S&L debacle of the 80's, the loss of $500 billion of publicly insured money on inflated prices of real estate brought the country and the government up short. In the Congressional hearings that followed, "as much as 50 percent of all losses were attributed to faulty or fraudulent appraisals," said Mr. Pompeo.
In attempting to avoid similar catastrophes in the future, Congress passed the Financial Institutions, Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, known as FIRREA, in 1989, setting standards for the appraisal industry for the first time since appraising began in the 1920's.
As a result appraisers are required to obtain state licenses or certifications based on the completion of 75 to 165 hours of course work in real estate evaluation, real estate law, environmental law, tax policy, disabilities law, and other subjects. Each state is required to create a mechanism for handling appraisal complaints, backed by the power to revoke an appraiser's license.
Since the law went into effect in 1991 there has been a sharp drop in the number of appraisers nationwide. Approximately 85,000 are registered with the appraisal subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council in Washington. While there was no way of counting heads before licensing, estimates by appraisers of the total number in the 80's ran up to 200,000.
MANY factors apart from the new regulations contributed to the decline, including the depressed housing market, the demise or merging of banks that employed appraisers, and the growth of electronic data sources that are replacing the experience and familiarity with the market that were appraisers' stock in trade. On the plus side for consumers, however, home buyers are paying less and sometimes nothing for simplified appraisals based on drive-bys or broker's opinions.
Typical of appraisers who have dropped out of the mainstream is Leonard Dahl, Citibank's chief Brooklyn appraiser for 13 years. A casualty of reorganization, he operates as an individual appraiser from the basement of his home. "Every year the business gets less and less because of cost-cutting by banks," he said.
In order to augment his income he works part time in a real estate office, where mortgage lenders frequently submit a $50 broker's opinion form to be filled out. "If the bank wants a drive-by evaluation, that's an extra $100," he said. "An on-site appraisal by a licensed appraiser, containing complete, up-to-date interior and exterior information is $275."
The less time-consuming -- and less expensive -- methods have their critics. David Bunton, executive vice president of the Appraisal Foundation, a federally authorized appraisal standards agency in Washington, is apprehensive that "lending practices are getting risky again. Lenders are highly competitive and they are less and less interested in making sure that the collateral covers the loan. The cost of a good appraisal is not enough to quibble over."
Richard Sorensen, president of the Appraisal Institute in Chicago, a 131-chapter organization with chapters in every state, said he embraces the new technology, "but only insofar as it helps members do a better job." "We are apprehensive," he says, "of the integrity of the data base, and the potential misuse of it. Data bases are more for tract-type subdivisions and condo units. Try to run something like a computerized application in Lake Forest [a luxurious Chicago suburb] or any suburb where there are no two homes alike, and it won't work."
While loan applicants who believe they have been treated unfairly can now complain to the state appraisal board or other designated agency, they may not be aware of that option and can wind up fighting it out with the lender, as Thomas Dambakly, a Brooklyn homeowner, did last April.
He had applied for a $10,000 home equity loan at Roosevelt Savings Bank and was turned down. "The bank," he said, "told me that the house was worth only $200,000." He had paid $243,000 for the single-family, 4-bedroom home in 1992. When he asked how that figure was reached he was told that it was based on comparable houses in the neighborhood, "only the comparables turned out to be two-family houses almost 10 blocks away," he said. "I'm in the Madison section, but the bank evaluated houses in Marine Park, an adjacent working-class neighborhood with smaller homes." No drive-by was done.
The bank offered to do an appraisal for $150, but Mr. Dambakly would not pay to have them "correct their own mistake," he said. The bank then accommodated him with a free, drive-by evaluation and eventually approved a $7,500 loan, based on the $180,000 mortgage he is carrying and the bank's loan to value ratio -- the loan amount divided by the appraised value or purchase price -- of 70 percent.
Officers of the bank would not comment on his complaint, but Walter Mullins, a senior vice president, said: "Real estate loans are our bread and butter. On loans of $7,500 to $10,000, using a house as collateral, we try to keep the cost down for the consumer by arriving at an evaluation through comparables in the multiple listings."
A borrower who is unhappy with the result, he explained, is offered a full appraisal at $250, and the loan will be granted if the appraisal comes in at a high enough number.
Changes affecting appraisals are emerging from another source. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, two quasi-public corporations -- which purchase about a third of the mortgages sold to the secondary market and sometimes resold to pools of investors, have designed programs to streamline the appraisal process at the point of loan origination while keeping it as accurate and fair as possible.
IN January of this year Freddie Mac introduced a service called the Loan Prospector. Using a nationwide data base from such credit repositories as TRW and Equifax, it has created a computer model for determining credit-worthiness of the borrower, and it can make an assessment of properties anywhere in its vast range of markets, providing detailed comparables.
"We also do drive-bys and complete inspections as needed," said Peter Maselli, a Freddie Mac vice president. "One of our objectives was to make the lending process fairer, more fact-based than traditional underwriting. Using a data base as opposed to human judgment can avoid influences by other forces, such as discrimination against minority individuals and red-lining."
Neal McGarity, spokesman for the agency, said, "A lender using our service can offer the Loan Prospector option to the borrower, priced at or below the prevailing rate and containing the complete packet of information," but the bank has no obligation to inform the customer about the program, nor can Freddie Mac do so, since it has no part in the customer-lender transaction. "You have to ask," said Mr. McGarity. So far few have.
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac's closest competitor in the secondary market, has a similar program called the Mornet-Plus Network. Last April it unveiled what it calls the Desk Top Originator and the Desk Top Underwriter, offering borrowers wide latitude in mortgage products at competitive prices and with appropriate appraisals, but it must also be accessed by the consumer through the lender.
Efforts are underway in many states to improve and tighten standards allowed by FIRREA. Connecticut has just passed a mandatory licensing law for all appraisers. Paul Pescatello, a lawyer at Shipman & Goodwin in Hartford and a lobbyist for the Connecticut Chapter of the Appraisal Institute, said, "This doesn't mean that a $75,000 home equity loan has to have a full appraisal, but the document must be signed by a licensed appraiser." The threat of license revocation is perceived as a strong motivation for fairness and accuracy.
"Mandatory licensing of all appraisers has been passed in 20 states," said Mr. Pompeo, "and is under consideration in 15 more, including New York."
But the prospects in New York and New Jersey are murky. In the last session of the Legislature the New York State Assembly voted for a mandatory licensing bill and reduction of the threshold to $75,000 for residences and $250,000 for commercial buildings. The Senate failed to vote.
"The banks were concerned about additional cost to the consumer," said John Conway, counsel for Senator Dean G. Skelo, Republican from Rockville Centre, L.I., who introduced the bill. It will come up again in both houses when the Legislature convenes in October, but Frank Sanzillo, an appraisers' lobbyist, sees little chance of passage "because the Secretary of State opposes it," he said.
"The Department of State did not feel that another layer of bureaucracy was the solution, when we are working to downsize government," said Marjorie Eilertson, department spokeswoman. "It's not that we've killed the bill -- we are instructing the licensing department to meet to explore solutions."
New Jersey is in a similar situation, with a proposed bill for mandatory licensing of appraisers not only for mortgages but for properties tied up in divorce or tax litigation that are currently exempt. "It passed the Assembly and sits in the Commerce Committee of the Senate," said Carmen Mistichelli, member of the New Jersey Appraisal Board.
Kevin Earl, former executive director of the New Jersey Board of Real Estate Appraisers, said "the Governor is not in favor of additional licensing, and pressure against it comes from the banking industry and lobbyists who are far more powerful and organized than the appraisal industry. Appraisers are widely diverse and have many professional societies that don't speak with one voice."
IN spite of the cost of full-time staff members, some of the larger banks find it useful to retain in-house appraisal staffs. People's Bank, headquartered in Bridgeport, has 21 staff appraisers and 20 independents on call. Writing about 10,000 mortgages a year, People's is one of the largest lenders in Connecticut.
"We are fully automated," said Linda Stetso, chief appraiser. "We target each appraiser to specific towns, so they are very knowledgeable about their area." The bank pays for the required education, and supplies laptop computers for access to multiple listings, and imaging cameras that transmit pictures electronically. "These are prohibitive expenses for an independent appraiser," said Ms. Stetso.
The cost of an average $250 appraisal multiplied by tens of thousands has many banks and mortgage bankers now relying on less-expensive independent appraisers, or on companies that handle appraisals shipped to them in bulk by lenders who get a good rate on volume.
U.S. Property Appraisals in Pittsburgh, founded eight years ago, is one of about a dozen companies around the country that do bulk appraisals. "We get bundles of up to 2,000 appraisals," said John Foehrenbach, executive vice president. "We can do them in-house or farm them out to local appraisers. Drive-bys cost $50; full appraisals can go up to $315, depending on what the client orders."
Most of the 4,000 lenders that the company deals with, he said, "are demanding ever-lower fees and faster turnarounds." He says that their customers are shopping around, applying to as many as five lenders at one time. "Whichever lender gets the answer first at the lowest cost, gets the loan," he said.
In fact, Robert Bartos, former president of the Appraisal Institute's Connecticut chapter, said he believed that "the industry will be obsolete in five years."
"There is," he said, "a tremendous underdemand for our services."

HEADLINE: Sea Gulls, Scourge of the Coastal Runways

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
IT'S "High Noon" at mid-morning at Groton-New London Airport. Onto the runway strides James Cowley, lean, erect, mustache flowing, shotgun cradled. He stares at the enemy, a small flock of sea gulls enjoying the sun reflecting off the macadam. The gulls stare back at him, fearless, unmoving. James Cowley raises the shotgun.
A shell bursts in the air above the gulls, with a flash of light, a big bang and then a series of smaller bangs. The gulls take to the air, flying as a unit down a short distance of runway, then settling back to resume doing what they do best: Staring at James Cowley. 
"Sometimes they don't move at all," said Officer Cowley. "After a while, they seem to like the noise. They look forward to it."
Thus starts another interesting day at the state airport that juts into Long Island Sound at Groton -- 410 acres bounded by water on three sides, two by Long Island Sound, the other by the Poquonnock River.
It is a very scenic place. It is also a very funny place in the sense of funny as a bit strange: a state-owned airport that also seems to be somewhat of a nature preserve, where airplanes and air birds co-exist in a delicate relationship overseen not only by the State Department of Transportation, which owns the airport, but also by other governmental agencies that are interested in what is going on there, animal-wise and bird-wise.
"We work with both the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Damage Control Division and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's Wildlife Division," said Airport Manager Gary S. Schmid, who has been in charge of the airport for less than a year but was very familiar with it long before that. Two decades ago, he was a pilot for Pilgrim Airlines, a commuter line that operated out of Groton-New London. Early on, he learned of the airport's reputation as a haven for animals and birds, many of which dropped in for lunch and then just stayed on.
The greenery around the airport has harbored fox, deer, coyotes, snowy owls, hawks, turkey vultures, great blue herons, osprey, Canada geese and, of course, sea gulls. For the past few years, it has not officially been spring at the airport until George and Gracie, a pair of ospreys, arrived to set up housekeeping. The advent of fall is heralded by their departure, sometimes with new little members of their family, to winter headquarters in South America.
The osprey family used to nest near the river but several years ago decided to change location, according to Justine Francese, the airport manager's secretary. The new homesite they picked was on the glideslope antenna, an electronic device that tells pilots their altitude. They piled on the branches for a nest, and the antenna shorted out. Each morning, the airport's maintenance crew would remove the branches. George and Gracie eventually got the picture, constructed a new nest off the runway area and have been living there peacefully since.
Most of the birds that make their homes at the airport, however, are not known individually by name but are called many names, all unprintable. These are the sea gulls and the Canada geese, birds that do not enjoy the best of images, particularly at an airport. Canada geese have been described as defecating machines and twice a year they visit the airport (which is on the Atlantic Flyway) during the migrating seasons. What they leave must be cleaned off runways lest planes, incoming and outgoing, slide all over the place.
In addition, 75 to 100 Canada geese are permanent guests at the airport, living there year-round and enjoying it. "There were no predators here and they had plenty of food and water," said Mr. Schmid.
But that has changed somewhat recently, he added. Several months ago, workers at the airport started to notice a coyote wandering around the grassy areas or trotting across a runway, joined later by Mrs. Coyote and eventually three pups. The geese population, particularly young geese, seemed to diminish somewhat. This circumstance, representing an alteration of the balance of nature, has not dismayed the humans at the airport. Fewer geese means less trouble.
Several years ago, a group of them crossing a runway got in the way of a commercial plane that was taking off. A dozen of the big birds were killed and the flight was aborted until repairs could be made. Since then workers at the airport have spent a lot of time shooing geese off the runways by any means possible: firing shotgun blanks at them, herding them by motor vehicle, yelling at them through bullhorns, or even over the public address system.
But if the geese are a big problem, the sea gulls and the oyster shells are a bigger problem. Gulls drop oysters on the hard runways, breaking them open, then scoop up the meat.They leave the jagged shells, threatening to blow out plane tires.
Richard E. Pealer, the former airport manager, traces the oyster-shell menace to Hurricane Gloria, which ripped into the Connecticut shore in September of 1985. The storm brought oyster beds in the Poquonnock River closer to the surface, Mr. Pealer theorized. That allowed gulls to snatch them up at low tide. In any case, since 1985 no human at the airport has needed a tide table. Low tide is when the gulls bombard the runways with oyster shells.
For years after Gloria, Mr. Pealer conducted a spirited and imaginative campaign against the gulls. Armed with a permit from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, he fired blanks at the birds and, when he felt the situation was becoming desperate, real shells.
He thought of getting a falconer to hunt the gulls but had no idea where to find a falconer. He also considered painting the outline of gulls along the sides of the runways in the belief that the real gulls would not drop shells near them because they do not like sharing meals. He dropped that idea because the painted gulls would be a distraction to pilots.
Finally, Mr. Pealer learned of a company in Minnesota that makes gull decoys for hunting and decoration and ordered a dozen of them, to place along the runways in the hope that the decoys would discourage the real gulls from using the same area. The gulls were not fooled.
When Mr. Pealer, a man with a good sense of humor, retired last year, it was with the knowledge that at best he had reached a standoff with the birds.
The standoff continues. Each morning, the maintenance crew goes out to sweep up oyster shells with a big snow broom, returning as many times as necessary during the day to remove new shells as they are dropped. Gulls and geese and all sorts of other wildlife are herded away with trucks, sirens, flashing lights, blank shells, yells -- anything to make them know they are in an off-limits area. "The other day, we were out there 10 times chasing the birds," said Officer Cowley.
Now Mr. Schmid, a native of Ohio who came to know southeastern Connecticut when he served aboard the atomic submarine Nautilus, has inherited the airport and its problems. It is a task he says he relishes. "This is where I started in aviation and it's a beautiful place," he said. "I love it here."
The airport has become less busy, however, than when he was piloting planes. In the mid-1980's, more than 40 daily commercial flights were recorded out of Groton-New London. Now the figure is down to five -- four to Philadelphia, one to Baltimore. Most of the business today is with private and corporate aircraft. And parking is free because a private contractor selected by the state to run the lot couldn't make money on it and departed.
But the outlook for the old airport, dating to the biplane age, is suddenly bright again, Mr. Schmid said. The reason is the economic jolt the region is experiencing in jobs from the massively successful Mashantucket Pequot casino, the anticipation of another casino to be opened by the Mohegan tribe, and the possibility of one or more theme parks and other spinoffs of the gambling dollar.
"I think this region has a future as a tourist destination area and I think this airport can be a tourist shuttle from Bradley Airport," Mr. Schmid said.
The old airport administration building, which looks like the set for a 1930's movie, is going to get a facelift starting in October, he said, including such marvelous advances as air-conditioning and telephones with buttons instead of rotary dials. He is all for that.
But he also wants to retain the charm of the airport, a place where private pilots can drop in by air, and other visitors by the winding road off Route 1, and spend some time enjoying a good meal at the terminal restaurant while savoring the views of Long Island Sound and the Poquonnock River and, of course, the birds. They may be problems at times, those birds, but they do bring a certain elan to the place.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Landmarks Group Has $1.5 Million for Facade Work;
Conservancy Seeks To Lend in Queens

 BODY:
People in Queens don't apply for the New York Landmarks Conservancy's preservation loans -- and nobody knows why.
Out of 63 low-interest loans granted by the Conservancy since the late 1980's, 23 have gone to residents of Manhattan, 35 to homeowners in Brooklyn, 2 to applicants in Staten Island and 3 to people in the Bronx. None have gone to residents of Queens. 
 So the Conservancy, which has $1.5 million to give out citywide, is targeting Queens: Ridgewood, Hunters Point, Jackson Heights, Richmond Hill, Steinway, Old Astoria, Kew Gardens and Sunnyside Gardens. If you don't live there, but have an older, architecturally interesting house, call the Conservancy anyway, said Peg Breen, the group's president. "We'll take a look at the house and run it by the S.H.P.O.," the State Historic Preservation Office, which determines eligibility for the National Register, she said. "All we need is for them to say: 'Yes, it looks like it's eligible.' "
One Brooklyn house that is benefiting from the program is at 135 St. Felix Street in the Brooklyn Academy of Music Historic District.
The owners, Lucille Smith and Charles Smith Jr., have received a $35,000 loan and are completing exterior renovations.
Interest rates on the loans vary, but seldom exceed 5 percent. "We want to make it do-able to fix your porch, fix your brownstone or rebuild your foundation," Ms. Breen said. "There are so many great houses in Queens that can be brought back."

Are Fares and Tolls Fair?

 BODY:
New York officials want to raise the tolls at Hudson River crossings and the fare on PATH trains, saying New Jerseyans aren't paying their fair share. Do you agree?
 
What About the Taxes We Pay to New York? 
 One infrequently mentioned item in this debacle is taxes. Because I work in New York City, my wife's income is used in figuring our New York State and City taxes, even though she doesn't earn a penny in New York State or New York City.
 The thought, therefore, of another toll increase is even more upsetting to me and everyone else in this situation. How much more are we to be bled?
JOEL D. REISER
West Caldwell
 
Ignoring All the Help New Jerseyans Provide
 As usual, politicians are assuming that the fares will increase, more money will be collected, and nothing else will change. This is the quintessential static analysis.
New York politicians, especially, ignore the millions of dollars in taxes that New Jersey commuters provide.
Also conveniently ignored is the boost to the local economy. All New York governors and New York City mayors have always stated that they want to keep the Wall Street district viable, but they never have a problem with making it harder for New Jersey residents to contribute to that viability.
Every time the border war escalates, the free flow of people and capital is inhibited. Why would anyone want to voluntarily work or play in New York City when, notwithstanding the rhetoric, all they really want is our money?
EDWARD J. ZOHN
Scotch Plains
 
The Tolls May Go Up, But the Service Doesn't
 It is no wonder that people are fleeing New York City. The increased fares and tolls in the past have not contributed to an increase in service, or even maintenance. New Jersey residents are weary of highway robbery.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Job Advice for 2005: Don't Be a Farmer, Play One on TV

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
THE next decade looks good for travel agents, private detectives and subway operators. But don't even think about becoming a butcher, watchmaker or ship fitter.
So says the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which periodically borrows a standard commercial computer model of the economy, massages the numbers a bit and then grinds out predictions of where the jobs will be. The 25 fastest-growing job categories to the year 2005, along with the 25 fastest-shrinking ones, are displayed here for your edification. 
 As a soothsayer, the bureau is distinctly fallible: too much, after all, turns on imponderables like the rate of military spending and the Federal Reserve's ability to keep the economy out of recession. Still, Uncle Sam's educated guesses offer some striking insights into the ways business is trying to squeeze more value from fewer dollars paid to labor.
As might be expected, virtually every unskilled or semiskilled job linked to manufacturing is a loser. Manufacturing output will continue to grow, said Ronald Kutscher, associate commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But productivity is rising more rapidly than demand, undermining employment in several categories, from tire makers to printers to a catch-all called "packing and filling machine operators."
By the same token, jobs most vulnerable to imports -- those requiring a lot of semiskilled labor to add value -- will likely be a drag on the market. It wasn't much fun being an American shoe or apparel worker in competition with Asian and Latin workers over the last decade, and it will probably be even less fun in the next.
But other predicted changes catch subtler trends. The number of child care workers, over all, is expected to rise by more than 60 percent by the year 2005, as more mothers with young children go back to work sooner.
The number of legal child care workers in private households, however, is expected to decline, as servants become an ever-less-affordable luxury. This seemingly paradoxical trend is mirrored in other personal services: private cooks and maids are apparently an endangered species, as demand shifts to restaurant cooks, bakers, manicurists, bellhops and laundry and dry-cleaning workers.
Technology and changing tastes produce a host of similar double plays. The number of farmers will continue to decline as agricultural productivity grows relentlessly, while the number of nursery-farm workers will increase with the demand for garden plants and specialized farm crops. The entertainment industry is booming, opening jobs for producers, directors, actors and amusement park attendants. Meanwhile, film projectionists are succumbing to the automation of multiplex theaters.
The aging of the population -- more specifically, the explosive growth in the number of Americans over the age of 80 -- is driving demand for home care aides, as well as the demand for most categories of health care workers. But the pattern of job growth will be powerfully influenced by efforts to contain medical costs: physical therapists, dental hygienists, medical secretaries, registered nurses, psychologists -- in short, anyone who can reduce the work load on high-priced physicians -- will be in demand.
What works for health care apparently works for the other expensive service that Americans cannot seem to do without but do not wish to pay for: legal representation. Legal secretaries and paralegals (lawyers' assistants) are both in the Top 25 job categories, but lawyers are conspicuously absent.
Perhaps most striking is the shuffle of jobs in industries dependent on electronics.
Hundreds of thousands of jobs will disappear in telecommunications and office work, as microprocessors and radio transmitters replace humans in directory assistance, switchboard operations, switching equipment maintenance, telephone and cable television wiring, bill posting, word processing and data entry.
Bank tellers might be on this list, as the efficiency-driven merger of the Chase and Chemical banks last week suggests. They probably escape the bottom 25 only because the shift toward automated teller machines has already decimated their ranks. On the other hand, lots of new jobs will be created to aid in computer design and repair, software innovation and computerized page layout for magazines and newspapers.
A caveat for those who would interpret the list as a guide to the best jobs: while rapid growth in openings means it will be relatively easy to find work in the top 25, many of these jobs will be anything but nifty.
After all, one reason so many are expected to be employed in service jobs like restaurant and home care is that the going wage rates will be low. Those with the talent, ambition and training will still be better off fighting for the prizes in the highly paid professions.

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

DATELINE: LEEDS, England

 BODY:
FOR Catholics, it's Lourdes. For bankers these days, it's Leeds.
Representatives of banks from around the world are making the pilgrimage to this industrial city in the north of England for a glimpse of what might be their stagnant industry's equivalent of a miraculous cure. 
 Here, in the shadow of a nuclear power plant, they find a sprawling hangar of a building that houses First Direct, a bank with half a million customers and not a single branch. Not only is First Direct the world's leading telephone-only bank; it is the fastest-growing bank in Britain. In just five years, it has signed up 2 percent of Britain's notoriously set-in-their-ways banking subjects, who call its rows of bankers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to pay bills, buy stock and arrange mortgages.
"Statistically, in Britain, people are more likely to change their wife than change their bank," said Peter Simpson, First Direct's commercial director. Yet with a combination of savvy marketing and distinctively better service than the average branch has to offer, he explained, "we're opening up 10,000 new accounts a month; that's like two or three new branches."
Now, the First Direct formula for winning affluent, and profitable, customers without the considerable cost of opening and operating new branches is being copied by banks around the world. Even in the United States, where banks are talking about offering services through the Internet, the relatively low-tech telephone -- combined with existing automated teller machine networks to supply cash -- appears to be the best way to lure customers into branchless banking.
Indeed, when Chase Manhattan and Chemical announced their $10 billion merger last week, their executives said they had no intention of using their new bulk to gobble up still more banks with still more branches. Even a huge regional bank like First Union of Charlotte, N.C., which recently bought First Fidelity of Newark for $5.4 billion, would need half a dozen more megadeals of that size to assemble a coast-to-coast network of branches. And, with the industry losing ground to competitors like mutual fund companies, bankers increasingly say those deals may never pay off.
"BRANCHES are becoming less and less significant in selling financial products," said Walter Shipley, Chemical's chief executive. "Not having branches could be an advantage as we leapfrog the physical delivery system."
Just two months ago, with First Direct as its model, Chase introduced a separate banking entity called Chase Direct. Chemical, meanwhile, has been testing a similar operation, called Chem Direct, with some customers who already choose to bank only by phone. After the merger, Mr. Shipley said, the combined bank will offer telephone banking services to its 25 million mortgage and credit card customers around the country.
By that time, two years from now, Chase will have a lot of competition in telephone banking. First Chicago has even taken the name First Direct, much to the chagrin of its namesake in Leeds, for a nationwide telephone banking service.
Several other banks, including First Union, the PNC Bank Corporation and Wachovia, have national aspirations, and many others are creating telephone-only banking services, modeled on First Direct, in their regions. Nonbanking companies like American Express are also starting direct-banking units to get into that business cheaply.
Of course, banks have been expanding the service they offer by telephone over the last decade. Many banks now offer information by touch-tone, and sometimes from live operators, 24 hours a day. Now, the banks say, these services have proven so popular that they are being forced to expand them to make sure that anything that can be done in a branch, short of getting cash or making a deposit, can be handled over the phone.
For consumers who are already used to buying everything from sweaters to sofa beds from mail-order catalogues, the ability to do all of their banking over the telephone may well be a welcome convenience, especially if the banks pass on some of their operational savings in the form of lower fees and higher savings rates.
But for those customers who are unwilling or afraid to trust their money to someone on the other end of the line, the rise of these telephone banks, and the branch closings sure to accompany it, are hardly causes for celebration.
For example, Huntington Bankshares of Columbus, Ohio, has doubled the number of full-service branches it plans to close by the end of next year, from 15 to 30, because of the success of Huntington Direct, one of the first American telephone banks. Ultimately, bank officials say they will be able to close at least half of Huntington's branches.
In New York, the news of the Chase-Chemical merger was greeted with concern by consumer advocates, who said the closing of branches would be another economic blow to some of the city's poorest neighborhoods.
BACK here in Leeds, though, First Direct is an effort to bridge that technology-personal service gap. What's most unusual about First Direct is not that it can transfer money or even open new accounts for people over the telephone. It's that it uses sophisticated technology to create a more personal relationships with its customers, and thus satisfy their needs and sell them more products.
On the average day in Leeds, a location chosen mainly for its low cost, 24,000 calls come into First Direct's two facilities, handled at peak times by 150 bankers. The larger and more recent building is a service-age factory floor in which the telephone bankers, computer programmers and even the chief executive, Kevin Newman, all work together under an arched silver roof.
On the walls are what appear to be sports stadium scoreboards, constantly flashing the number of customers on hold and how long they have been waiting. Posters show how many new credit cards and other products have been sold that month.
"Hello this is First Direct. How can I help?" Tim Grice, a telephone banker sitting in a pastel purple carrel says chipperly into his headset.
"I'd like the balance in my account," says a woman on the line.
After taking her account number and security password, Mr. Grice gives her the information and then arranges to pay 310.77 (about $460) to her credit card account at National Westminster Bank. Meanwhile, his computer screen is displaying all sorts of personal information about the customer. "No Adverse Risk" flashes at the top, indicating that the bank would be glad to loan her money.
Also displayed is the fact that she is a 30-year-old single renter with a job as a project manager, along with a list of all the bank's prior contacts with her.
"HAVE you read the information on the First Direct Visa we sent you?" Mr. Grice asks. "Our card has no fee and a lower interest rate than the card you are probably carrying." Mr. Grice knows that the NatWest account, whose bill the customer just paid, charges 23.5 percent a year, compared to First Direct's 22 percent, but British privacy rules prevent him from using information from her transaction to attempt a sale.
The customer says she will consider the card.
"I sent her a prepared application for the Visa today," Mr. Grice explains after the call. "Then next time we speak to her, we will follow up."
First Direct's computer allows it to create a virtual relationship with its customers, even though they may never speak to the same banker twice. The bankers try to make small talk with customers, but the virtual relationship aims to have substance as well as style.
Instead of randomly mailing out offers for products, such as car loans and mortgages, the bank asks customers to say when they are going to move, buy a car and so on, so it can send them information when they need it.
FIRST DIRECT was created in 1989 as a separate banking division by Midland Bank, Britain's third largest, which was facing declining market share and the depressing fact that a majority of its 2,000 branches were unprofitable.
From the beginning, First Direct tried to break out of the pack with disruptive advertising. For its start-up, the bank actually interrupted an Audi commercial on television (with the car company's permission) for a message that purported to be from the year 2010.
With this and other marketing gambits, the bank has been able to create a brand that appeals to the young affluent professionals who were spawned by the Thatcherite boom. The average First Direct customer is a 35-year-old professional man in a professional job. Nearly half of them live in the London area, compared to one-third of the British population.
A typical customer is Kevin Mochrie, who began banking with First Direct when he was working the night shift at a newspaper in Birmingham.
"Sometimes the only time I could pay my bills was 11 o'clock Sunday night," said Mr. Mochrie, now deputy editor of the Evening Advertiser in Swindon, west of London. "I really began to appreciate them when I moved and I could keep banking without changing anything."
Predictably, these tony customers are more profitable than those of most banks. The average balance is 10 times higher at First Direct than at Midland, while the overall costs are 61 percent less. Overall, First Direct makes money on 60 percent of its customers, compared to 40 percent at the average British bank.
First Direct turned a profit at the end of 1993, but it won't pay back Midland's start-up investment until the end of the decade. By that time, if current trends continue, First Direct could well have more than a million customers, 4 percent of the British market. If it does, the corporate market share of Midland, now a unit of the huge HSBC Banking Group, would approach 20 percent, nearly the level of the country's two largest banks, National Westminster and Barclays.
Of course, those two banks, and many smaller ones, have begun to react to First Direct and are developing telephone banking services of their own. Indeed, some insurance companies and even Richard Branson's Virgin empire are also getting into direct banking in Britain.
Will this work in the United States?
A lot of bankers think the time is right, despite several factors that make such an offering more difficult. For one, people may be shy of doing business with a bank that has no branches for hundreds of miles, even if they never intend to go into a branch.
Midland's name and its nationwide presence certainly reassured First Direct customers that they could use a branch if they needed one. Yet only two percent of First Direct customers actually saw a teller last year, mainly to withdraw more cash than the daily limit at automated teller machines.
IN Britain, however, people have less reason to deposit checks than they do in the United States, because the British electronic funds transfer system is more developed.
"I don't pretend that getting checking account customers won't be the hardest sell until I have a way to take deposits," said James Grant, a senior vice president of First Chicago in charged of its copycat First Direct. Yet he said the bank was encouraged to go ahead with the project in part because it has 27,000 customers who have moved away from Illinois who, without any special offers, still use their First Chicago checking accounts. And in the meantime, the bank is also offering products such as home equity loans and certificates of deposit that don't require as much use of branches.
Some American bankers are betting that by the time they get their telephone banking services up and running, similar electronic funds transfer facilities will develop. And others are figuring that they will have to open a handful of toehold branches in major cities, just as Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab do. And to lure customers to take the plunge into telephone services, bankers are working on offering direct banking services to members of various trade groups, clubs and frequent flier programs, gambits that have worked well selling credit cards.
Most of the banks that are active with telephone banking are also working to offer their services through personal computer programs or over the Internet. They figure that many customers would rather see information on their screens rather than just hearing it over the phone. But so far these on-line banking offerings have hardly attracted any customers.
"Cyberspace starts with the plain old simple telephone," Said Mr. Randle of Huntington. "And the customer is already there."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Peering Into the Murky Jobs Crystal Ball for 2015

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
WHAT should today's toddlers be thinking of doing when they are unable to drag out graduate school any longer and must enter the work force, say around 2015?
Although the Government predicts hot jobs 10 years into the future, there is little solid information on trends beyond 2005. There is, however, plenty of informed speculation by demographers and futurists. 
 Over all, they say, the jobs picture 15 to 20 years out will be shaped by the evolution of technology (and all manner of attempts to fend off its intrusions), along with two big population trends: the retirement of the baby boomers, who begin turning 65 in 2010, and the entry into the work force of the baby boom echo generation, Americans born since a sharp upturn in births in the 1980's.
The boomers' retirement will no doubt accelerate the demand during the next decade for more home care aides and other health workers. In addition, construction workers in the Sun Belt will prosper, predicted Jon Sargent, an economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, along with makers of every sort of elderly-friendly device, from big-button telephones to ergonomic wheelchairs.
Information technology is a growth field as far into the next century as nearly anyone can see. The explosion of the Internet may mean that anyone will be able to sell goods and services without the money for a retail store. By 2010 or 2015, computer literacy will be no more remarkable than "telephone literacy" today; nearly every skilled job will require it.
But the problem with anticipating specific job growth in computers is that technology reshapes itself as unpredictably as a hill of silicon.
For example, computer programmers are a hot category to 2005, the Government said. But in the next 10 to 20 years, predicted Paul Saffo, a computer industry analyst at the Institute for the Future, programming will become automated and programmers as outmoded as John Henry and his hammer and chisel.
"The real trick is staying skills relevant," he said. "If you bet on artificial intelligence in 1980, which was then a hot field, you either retrained or you're in another industry."
Future technologies that could become big include biotechnology, which some say is already overdue for greatness, and nanotechnology, the technique of building microscopic machines one molecule at a time.
Even as technology increasingly pervades peoples' lives, some prognosticators see the return of traditional artisanship as an antidote. "Baking bread will become a growth area," said Irma Zandl, a professional trend spotter, who also sees opportunities in high-quality coffee and specialty foods. "When you buy a freshly made coffee as opposed to, say, a soda, in a sense you're getting some of the soul of another human being," she said.
Watts Wacker, a futurist at Yankelovich Partners, a public opinion research firm, said the increasing demand for security guards in the next decade would only become greater. The ultimate corporate perk may be to live in a gated company town where one's employer provides private education, policing and all other services. He thinks there will also be personal-privacy consultants to work as gatekeepers of the vast computerized data about one's life, edit the barrage of incoming information and insure that individuals, in a world where most are self-employed, are paid.
Mr. Wacker also sees a boom in jobs related to environmental cleanup. "Forty percent of the world will live in polluted water," he said.
By 2025 or 2030, he sees current workplace trends in outsourcing, telecommuting and job hopping reaching their logical ends. People will work in four or five fields during a career, and they will join a company knowing that in five years it will be out of business. "You'll see a whole renaissance of the Jeffersonian approach to life," he said. "People will actually be engineers and historians and agrarians."
Well, maybe. In looking to the future, it may be wise to look back at the prognosticating of an earlier age. In 1976, a magazine enthusiastically called The Future! included an imaginary Help Wanted section from the year 2000. There were job openings for an offshore life style consultant, a genetic engineer and an exobiologist -- desperately needed to study alien life forms.
The lesson is that even over a quarter-century when the economy and society went through remarkable shifts, job categories didn't really change all that much.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
In 401(k)'s, It's Great To Be Young And Bold

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
YOUNG laborers are no slackers in the savings department, but they still have trouble taking a long view when investing their newfound money.
At age 29, Jennifer Shine-Hayward of Norfolk, Mass., has socked away $30,000 in the 401(k) retirement plan at Xerox, where she is an account executive. But when she reviewed her account statement earlier this year, it gave her a jolt. Ms. Shine-Hayward found that her investment gain for 1994 was only $150, or about half of a percent. "I would have earned more in a savings account or a money market fund," she said. 
 Alarmed, she sought help from her sister, Judy Shine, 38, a certified financial planner with Financially Speaking in Denver. The problem, said big sister, was not the tiny return, but the way progress was measured.
"Your time frame is not 1994," Ms. Shine recalled saying. "It is 30 years, and you cannot judge performance on one-year returns."
Never has that lesson been more apparent than this year. Anyone who looked at disappointing returns last year and said, " 'Stocks went down, I should get out,' " Ms. Shine noted, "would have missed out entirely on this year's run-up in the market."
A knee-jerk reaction to a year of poor performance can be particularly devastating for people in their 20's, who by all accounts will have to shoulder most of the financial burden for themselves in retirement. Stocks tend to be the most volatile of assets, meaning short-term losses are quite possible, but over the years they have been the only type of investment to outpace inflation and taxes significantly.
Young people seem to have gotten the message about the importance of saving for old age. In a survey conducted this year by Roper Starch Worldwide for Kemper Financial Services, 61 percent of respondents in their 20's said they or their spouses had started saving for retirement, disputing the common notion that the young generation is irresponsible.
More so than older workers, the 20's crowd is investing retirement money in stocks, too, but not as much as Ms. Shine and other financial advisers would like. The average balance in 401(k) accounts is $5,836 for people in their 20's, according to a recent study by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a benefits consulting firm. About 41 percent of that money is in domestic and foreign stocks, not including their own company's stock, compared with just 28 percent of all the money in 401(k) retirement plans. Most of the money in these plans belongs to people nearing retirement -- the average account for people 61 and older was $179,955 in the survey -- who tend toward more conservative investments as retirement nears.
Despite their progress, the youngest workers will probably come up short in retirement unless they take drastic steps. Watson Wyatt found that nearly 25 percent of people in their 20's have 80 percent or more of their 401(k) money in fixed-income funds, including bond funds and investment contracts that produce a fixed return, a return far lower than stocks historically.
 "Younger workers are still much too conservative with their retirement savings investments," said Sylvester Schieber, research director at Watson Wyatt. They should put most, and perhaps all, of their retirement money in stocks, he said.
A year ago, Ms. Shine-Hayward had her 401(k) money in a balanced mutual fund, which invests in a combination of stocks and bonds and cash. After much counseling from her sister, she put 90 percent of her money in the stock market, with a mix of blue-chip, growth and international mutual funds. That investment strategy could lead to a leisurely retirement if Ms. Shine-Hayward, who is expecting her first child in a few weeks, keeps putting away the maximum amount, just over $9,000 this year, in her 401(k) plan.
Making the switch to more aggressive investments was not easy, though. Ms. Shine said it took more than two weeks of long-distance conversations to convince her sister that the problem with her investment strategy was its conservatism, not its paltry return last year, when stocks and bonds were both weak performers. One reason her sister ultimately agreed to be more aggressive with her 401(k) money, the financial adviser said, was that several of their relatives are having a tough time in retirement.
"Jennifer asked me, 'How can you work all those years and have to struggle?' " Ms. Shine said. Saving aggressively and investing wisely, she said, will keep that from happening to you.

Autumn Agonies: Hello September

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
Will fall bring the fall?
The stock market's meteoric rise has slowed, with August becoming the first month of 1995 to show a drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. But indexes of smaller stocks were up nicely and have now risen for nine months. 
 Still, an eight-month string for the Dow is not bad. The last time we had a similar run, it ended with a small drop in June 1961. (For history buffs, the market was then almost six months from its peak, which saw a further rise of 7 percent. Then came a sharp correction, which lopped 27 percent off the Dow within another six months.)
Today's market looks more than a little speculative, dominated as it is by hot initial public offerings and by surging technology stocks, although some new issues have cooled and Microsoft has now gone more than six weeks without hitting a new high, the longest such stretch since January. Money continues to pour into the riskiest mutual funds, which respond by investing the cash as fast as they can. The market boom is probably safe so long as that public enthusiasm continues, and it is not clear what will end it. It is clear that a lot of investors could not care less about things like low dividend yields or high price-to-book-value ratios.
But there are certain patterns in stock market behavior that may be worth noting. Edward M. Saunders Jr., writing in the American Economic Review a couple of years ago, documented that the market does much better on sunny days in New York than on days when it rains or is heavily overcast. He speculated that people feel better, and buy more, when it's a nice day.
One implication of that, perhaps, is that a lot of rain can cause prices to be unreasonably depressed, providing a buying opportunity, while a string of sunny days might have the opposite effect. Last month was the driest August ever in New York.
Other patterns that recur are that Mondays tend to be worse for stocks than other days, and Septembers tend to be the worst months. Jeremy Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, offers a guess that those patterns, too, are related to investor psychology. On Mondays, he says, people are depressed about having to go back to work and having to pay the bills they ran up over the weekend. In September, people come back from August vacations feeling the same way, only more so.
In any case, the numbers are striking. Stock prices, of course, tend to go up more often than they go down. Since the end of 1914, when the Dow was redone, there have been 968 months, with the Dow up in 58 percent of them. But only 40 percent of the Septembers have shown increases. Every other month was up at least half the time. On average, the Dow falls almost 1 percent in September, much more than in any other month. And it has been getting worse. Over the last quarter century, September has seen 20 declines, for an average loss of 1.5 percent.
Through August, the Dow was up 20.2 percent, on its way to a great year. Since 1960, there have been only seven instances when the index rose at least 15 percent in the first seven months of the year -- in 1961, 1975, 1983, 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1991. Of those, only once, in 1983, did the Dow rise in September. That was when the market was nearing the beginning of a correction.
On the other hand, the Dow started this September with a big gain on Friday.
Have a nice month.

For Business, the Stakes Are High

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
WHILE the individual income tax is the target of the reformers, business taxes are sure to be included in any radical make-over.
In fact, the three most prominent plans all try to overcome one of the principal objections to the income tax: that it imposes a punishing double tax on investment by taxing profits and dividends once through the corporate profits tax and again through the personal income tax. 
 But while the plans have been advertised as a way to lighten the tax burden on business across the board, in fact the impact of the different plans on different businesses could vary tremendously. That's why, even though any new tax system at best is probably years away, hundreds of high-priced lobbyists are already lining up to influence the outcome. The stakes are so high that the nature of the overhaul could govern which businesses prosper and which suffer.
While there is little research on what would happen if a national sales tax replaces the income tax, analysts at Price Waterhouse found that two other major proposals would have drastically different effects on different industries. They are the flat tax offered by the House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, and the U.S.A. tax proposed by Senators Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia.
Compared with the corporate taxes paid in 1992, "we found that the services sector would be a large loser under both the flat tax and the U.S.A. tax, while the transportation, communications and utilities sectors would be a major winner under both tax proposals," said Shevetank Shah, a researcher at Price Waterhouse. "By contrast, the manufacturing sector wins under the U.S.A. tax but loses under the flat tax, while the trade sector loses under the U.S.A. tax and wins under the flat tax."
Here is a brief look at the business side of the three high-profile alternatives to the income tax.
 
The Flat Tax
 The flat tax breaks income into two pieces: wages would be taxed from individuals, just as they are now; earnings on invested capital would be taxed exclusively from businesses. To limit taxable income to just the portion that is consumed, business would be permitted to deduct the full cost of investments in the year they are made.
That makes the flat tax on business simple to compute. Gone are capital depreciation schedules, investment tax credits and the like. Businesses would be taxed on total revenues less expenditures for goods and services, labor, equipment and land. Interest would not be deductible from taxable revenues because it is part of the return to invested capital.
The Armey plan would save businesses time and effort but would not necessarily reduce their taxes. Indeed, otherwise healthy businesses that carry heavy debts -- airlines, for example -- may find themselves in deep financial trouble because they could no longer deduct interest from taxable income. By the same token, businesses that own large amounts of relatively new equipment when the flat tax takes effect would lose the right to deduct depreciation still in the pipeline from future tax liability.
"Mr. Armey understands the problem," said his spokesman, Doug Koopman. "We still have to work this out."
But working it out will not be easy. While interest rates should fall as corporate borrowing shrinks and eases the burden on some debt-ridden companies, others may be pressed into bankruptcy to reorganize their finances. The transition for depreciation would be equally problematic. If it is not fully "grandfathered," companies that had invested heavily in new equipment before the tax overhaul would, in effect, be punished for improving productivity.
But if lawmakers attempt to overcome this problem by permitting companies to carry over their current depreciation until it expires, the tax rate needed to collect the same revenue as today's system would have to be considerably higher than Mr. Armey is advertising.
To be fair to companies that invested in good faith under the current system and still allow the tax authorities to meet the revenue target would require a four percentage point increase in the 17 percent rate originally proposed, Roger Brinner, the executive director of DRI/McGraw-Hill, estimated.
"Transition," concluded Bill Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, "is the Achilles heel of radical tax reform."
 
The National Sales Tax
 Replacing the income tax with a point-of-sale national tax would seemingly be the simplest of all possible reforms. Under the retail sales levy sketched by Stephen Moore, an economist at the Cato Institute, business-to-business sales would be exempt; only goods and services for final consumption would be taxed -- at an 18 percent rate. The tax would be rebated on exports, much the way European countries rebate their "value-added" taxes, in a bid to help make American producers more competitive overseas. And the collection could be turned over to the states, nearly all of which already have sales taxes.
But many of the same transition problems as with the flat tax would arise, and no one can predict what the impact of adding such a hefty extra tab to every purchase would do to America's consumption-driven economy. Even Mr. Moore, while insisting that the enforcement problems would be "no worse than the problems of collecting corporate income taxes," acknowledges that a combination of Federal, state and local sales tax that might easily exceed 30 percent could present strong incentives to cheat.
And then there is the question of whether the sales tax would actually deliver on its promises.
One limit is conceptual. Rebates of taxes would not help exporters as a group, argued Paul Krugman, an economist at Stanford University, because the dollar would probably rise in value enough to cancel out much of the competitive advantage conferred by the tax break. The equation would be altered only if private savings increase substantially, allowing the export of economic resources that had previously been used for domestic consumption.
Another limit is political. An economically neutral sales tax would need to cover such goods and services as food, medical care, advertising and rent that today go largely untaxed. The legislative process could make mincemeat of the best-laid plans of economic theorists.
"The real test of tax reform," said Mr. Gale of Brookings, "is not what goes into the political meat grinder but what comes out."
A third stricture is economic. The retail sales tax, like other consumption taxes, is supposed to increase savings. But Eric Engen, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board, estimates that a pure consumption tax would increase savings by only 10 percent, far less than its boosters hope to achieve.
 
The U.S.A. Tax
 The Unlimited Savings Allowance tax is a hybrid consumption tax whose main selling points are the added incentive to thrift and its attempt to maintain the current modest rich-pay-more progressivity of the tax system. While the tax on individuals is no simpler than the current income tax, the tax on business is straightforward.
Businesses would pay an 11 percent European-style "value-added" tax collected at each stage of production. Wages and salaries would not be deductible expenses, nor would interest paid on borrowed capital. Like a national sales tax, the value-added tax would be rebated on exports.
Unlike any of the other proposals, the U.S.A. business tax would permit a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for Social Security and Medicare levies as part of a broader effort to integrate the payroll tax into a single system. That would remove one significant disincentive to hire workers, particularly lower wage workers.
One strength of the U.S.A. tax is that it pays attention to the problems of moving from one system to another. For instance, the U.S.A. tax grandfathers depreciation of investments made before the new system goes into effect.
And unlike the flat tax and the national sales tax, the U.S.A. tax attempts to avoid widening the gap between the rich and everyone else in American society. Overall, Mr. Gale said, "the U.S.A. tax is at least as progressive as the current income tax."

Searching for the Union Label In the Ideas of Workplace Books

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE 

 BODY:
YOU know you've either sold out or crashed through the envelope of middle age when you plan to spend Labor Day fixing posole for a crowd of country-house guests. Forget planting yourself in front of the stereo to listen over and over, in the manner of a "Louie, Louie" marathon, to Pete Seeger singing "Union Maid" ("There once was a union maid, who never was afraid, of goons and ginks and the company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid . . .") and "Talking Union" ("Take it easy boys, but take it"), occasionally throwing in the Marianne Faithfull cover of John Lennon's "Working Class Hero."
There are signs of life at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. There are unions attracting new members, especially in service industries that organized labor has traditionally ignored. There are young people drawn to careers as organizers. But even an optimist would be strained to say the movement is as robust as the lyrics to "Talking Union" or "Union Maid." 
 For more evidence, check the business book lists of publishers. Labor, per se, barely exists except at stalwarts like New York-based Basic Books, where Steven Fraser, author of a biography of the union leader Sidney Hillman, is an editor, and specialty academic houses like the ILR Press, the publishing arm of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University.
To see the light of print, a book about working conditions must fall under the rubric of "work," not labor. But so-called workplace books are more likely to offer ways to come to terms with the brave new employment arena than to challenge the status quo.
Among the current crop is solace for employees who have survived the latest management fads ("Our Emperors Have No Clothes," Alan Weiss). There is also guidance for breaking patterns that can affect work relationships ("Your Boss Is Not Your Mother," by Brian DesRoches); a plan to help crack the whip over the heads of workers ("The Invisible Assembly Line: Boosting White-Collar Productivity," by Daniel Stamp), and advice for the new, zero-mobility job market ("Beat the Odds: Career Buoyancy Tactics for Today's Turbulent Job Market," by Martin Yate).
One of the hottest new categories is counsel on how to keep yourself and others from going "postal" on the job ("Anger at Work" by Hendrie Weisinger and "Problem People at Work" by Marilyn Wheeler).
There is also an apocalyptic genre, which predicts huge structural change in the organization of work, and ranges from the quickly readable ("The End of Work" by Jeremy Rifkin) to the thoughtful and highly readable ("The Jobless Future," by William DiFazio and Stanley Aronowitz). The books in this genre give no comfort to anyone who likes to have a grip on the future. What we don't see are militant titles like "The Scales Fell From My Eyes: How the Middle Class Broke the Bonds of False Consciousness and Embraced Unionism."
Well, no matter. In bad times, it's best to hunker down to the basics, a course that may be followed painlessly with two new atlases of the American economy. "The New Field Guide to the U.S. Economy" (New Press, $12.95), by Nancy Folbre and the gang at the Center for Popular Economics, takes a broad, left-of-center view of the numbers necessary to understand the current state of the American economy. Ms. Folbre and crew include charts on the concentration of wealth, corporate political donations and the gap between worker pay and chief executive compensation, along with more familiar data on the flattening of wages, the decline of health care coverage and the declining participation of males in the labor force. The authors work hard not to sound too passionate, but the numbers speak for themselves.
In "The New Illustrated Guide to the American Economy" (AEI Press, $14.95), Herbert Stein and Murray Foss of the right-of-center Enterprise Institute offer a more traditional vision of the economy. Though the numbers aren't strictly comparable with those of Ms. Folbre's guide, the two books do not conflict in the details. As might be expected from the right brain of the party that has dominated American politics since 1980, the tone of the Stein-Foss book is more measured, less urgent.
The two books even agree at times in interpretation: both regard employee health care benefits as a government subsidy for some citizens at the expense of others.
These are possibly not the sort of books that most people will want to plunge into on the long last weekend of summer. We plan to curl up with something with a little more zing, a little more a la recherche du temps perdu: Edmund Wilson's "To the Finland Station." O.K., so maybe the revolution didn't work out, but at least we'll know what is to be done until the posole is ready.

Is B.I.D. Plan One Too Many?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Wally Shapiro, who has run a Red Hook warehouse for 41 years, supports a plan to create a business improvement district that would levy fees on businesses to pay for private security, sanitation and marketing. "The B.I.D. would give us services the city is supposed to supply, but doesn't have money to adequately provide," he said as he walked past the stacks of carpets, tungsten and potpourri he stores.
Damian Lubrano, who has watched the staff of his Barge Autobody shop on Coffey Street dwindle to 6 from 22, questioned what he would get for his money. "We have a good Sanitation Department and a good Police Department and they have always worked with us," said Mr. Lubrano, who was born and raised in Red Hook. "What business owner wants a new tax?" 
 The plan for a Red Hook Business Improvement District has exposed tensions between businesses and residents over how to share their isolated peninsula on the far side of the Gowanus Expressway.
It is not the only plan in the works for Red Hook. Noting that the neighborhood's population fell to 11,000 from 21,000 since 1950 as it lost waterfront jobs and industries, Community Board 6 released a broad urban renewal plan last year calling for new housing, a new high school, a waterfront museum and other economic development.
While the two plans are not mutually exclusive, disputes have arisen between businesses and residents over the sites of truck routes, new housing and the new high school. The City Planning Commission, which received the urban renewal plan enthusiastically this year, delayed its vote to give businesses a chance to weigh in on the proposals.
"I think a lot of people would like the businesses to go away and leave them with a nice waterfront community without trucks, without workmen sitting outside eating lunch," said Bette Stoltz, the executive director of the South Brooklyn Development Corporation, a business group that created the B.I.D. proposal with a grant from the state's Urban Development Corporation. "They would rather have an espresso place than a ball-bearing manufacturer."
Unlike many of the city's 33 business improvement districts, the one in Red Hook would focus on industrial businesses like manufacturers, warehouses, bakeries and distributors. A main retail strip, along Van Brunt Street, would be excluded. Ms. Stoltz said that stores there were reluctant to join the district and that many would have trouble paying the fee.
Supporters of both plans have held several meetings this summer to try to resolve their differences. "In a general sense, the plan and the B.I.D. are complementary documents," said Craig Hammerman, the district manager for Community Board 6. "They seek to accomplish the same goal: a stronger community, one that would be less impacted by a national recession." M.C.
 
BUDGET
A B.I.D.'s Bottom Line
 
The proposed Business Improvement District for Red Hook would include approximately 230 industrial businesses. Each would be assessed dues based on the size and value of its properties. This is what the dues would go toward:
Security $68,250 (increase private security patrol to 84 hours/week from 44)
Administration $52,100 (salary for 3 part-time staff members to run district and write grant proposals)
Sanitation and Maintenance $37,500 (clean illegally dumped trash, remove graffiti)
Marketing and Promotion $35,400 (banners, landscaped public spaces and brochures)
Contingency $16,750 (miscellaneous expenses and to cover members behind in their dues)
Total $210,000

The Next Wave In Mega-Retail: The Global Deli

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Sooner or later, it was bound to happen.
First came the invasion by the big suburban-style retailers like Home Depot, Toys 'R' Us, Pathmark, Bradlees, Staples, Herman's, Crate and Barrel, Tops, Sports Authority and Bed, Bath and Beyond. 
 Now comes the ultimate New York response. The mega-deli.
It runs a full city block -- enter on 34th Street and exit on 33d, if you wish. To tickle the taste buds of a gorgeous mosaic, its menu has a global stretch from pizza to fried plantains to sushi.
Formally known as Penn Plaza Deli and Restaurant, it opened in May in a vacant bank office on the east side of Eighth Avenue, opposite Penn Station and the main post office.
Unlike its claustrophobic ancestors with cramped aisles and cluttered shelves, the mega-deli has 6,000 square feet spacious aisles, multiple serving stations, wood and tile decor, piped-in music and large television sets. A blocklong counter with stools and adjacent tables seat 100.
"The variety is incredible, from Mongolian barbecue to whatever speciality you want," said David Morrison, who works nearby in publishing and comes for lunch.
Open 24 hours a day, Penn Plaza Deli has 50 workers and was two years in the planning, said Suk Hun Chung, its president. The site was picked for the nearby office buildings, 34th Street retail corridor and hub of commuter rail, subway and bus lines. Most customers are local workers, travelers and shoppers. Mr. Chung hopes for a boost when Kmart opens a store down the block on 34th.
The owners expanded on their experience at other delis to create the new format, said Chung Hoon Shin, the manager. He described the concept: "Have the best food and the biggest place. We have everything so you don't have to go to a lot of different places."
About the only customer they don't cater to is the indecisive diner, for whom the mega-deli would be tormenting. A ham and cheese sandwich or Japanese udon noodles? Maybe the Cajun grilled chicken, the smoked shrimp and crab salad, the rotisserie chicken or the ribs? There are separate stands for sushi, the charcoal grill, the big Mongolian cooking drum and the pastries, among other choices.Prices are moderate: $1.50 for a slice of pizza and daily lunch specials for $4 and $5.
The owners say business has been slow to build. But a sampling of customers gave positive reviews. "I love it," said Frank Jenkins of White Plains, who works in the insurance business. "I get off the train every morning and have breakfast here."
Larry Krizan, an economic development consultant from Albany waiting for an Amtrak train, wandered in for a snack.. "It's like everything in New York," he said. "It's big and busy and has lots of interesting choices." BRUCE LAMBERT

Of Industrial Things Past

BYLINE: By SARAH JAY 

 BODY:
BEFORE the coffee bars had spread to Bedford Avenue, before the artists had assembled their lofts and the musicians their recording studios, even before the Poles had founded their restaurants and the Italians their groceries -- before all that, there was industry in Williamsburg: metal spinners and bottling factories, food distributors and trucking companies.
Now, entire blocks of that industrial village stand barren and silent. Time stands still as a stone. 
 It is a stark and lonely landscape of broken images. A smokeless smokestack rising into the sky like a monument to itself. A fence dividing nothing from nothing. A steel girder protruding from a second floor window, testament to the pre-elevator era when hoisting was accomplished with ropes and pulleys and muscles. Two steps descending to a plot of shattered earth, with a pair of Corinthian columns supporting sooty air, a modern-day Roman ruin.
These are relics of an age when the whine and whir of factories filled the streets. And while commerce is far from dead, it has slowed considerably since its heyday in the 1950's. From 1969 to 1991, overall industrial employment fell by nearly two-thirds. Between 1989 and 1991, East Williamsburg alone suffered the loss of two-fifths of its trucking and warehouse jobs, two-thirds of car repair jobs and almost a quarter of its metal fabrication plant jobs.
It didn't help that most industrial buildings in Williamsburg were two-or-more stories high at a time when most businesses were seeking one-level, horizontally arranged structures. Or that manufacturers and distributors who like to be near interstate highways felt that the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, one of the oldest access highways in the country, was not up to the task. "Difficulty negotiating the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is a disincentive to locating industrial businesses in Brooklyn," said Eric Kober, a city planning official.
There are hints of a slight revival, he said, as solid waste companies consider setting up plants. Already, down by the once-open waterfront, a recycling warehouse now looms.
And the landscape continues to change. An abandoned gas station anchored to a triangular island disappears one day, nothing left but its gutted signpost. No one seems to have noticed or cared.

HEADLINE: Companies Merge; Families Break Up

BYLINE: By Lester C. Thurow; Lester C. Thurow is a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

 BODY:
No country without a revolution or a military defeat and subsequent occupation has ever experienced such a sharp a shift in the distribution of earnings as America has in the last generation. At no other time have median wages of American men fallen for more than two decades. Never before have a majority of American workers suffered real wage reductions while the per capita domestic product was advancing.
 So on Labor Day this year, as with a lot of Labor Days, most laborers don't have a lot to celebrate. The median real wage for full-time male workers has fallen from $34,048 in 1973 to $30,407 in 1993. 
 Wages of white men are falling slightly faster than those of black men, and the young have been clobbered: wages are down 25 percent for men 25 to 34 years of age. Median wages for women didn't start to fall until 1989, but are now falling for every group except college-educated women. The pace of decline seems to have doubled in 1994 and early 1995.
 The tide rose (the real per capita gross domestic product went up 29 percent between 1973 and 1993), but 80 percent of the boats sank. Among men, the top 20 percent of the labor force has been winning all of the country's wage increases for more than two decades.
 Adding to the frustrations, the old remedy for lower wages -- more education -- no longer works. True, wages of males with only a high-school education are falling faster than the pay of those with college degrees. But investing in a college education doesn't get one off the down escalator and onto an up escalator -- it merely slows one's descent.
 No one knows exactly how much of the decline can be traced to any particular cause, but we do know the set of causes that has been responsible.
 New production and distribution technologies require a much better-educated work force. If decisions are to be pushed down the corporate hierarchy, those at lower levels have to have skills and competency beyond what was required in the past.
 With our global economy, where anything can be made anywhere and sold everywhere, the supply of cheap, often well-educated labor in the third world is having a big effect on first-world wages. One month's wages for a Seattle software engineer gets the same company an equally good engineer in Bangalor, India, for a year. Ten million immigrants entered the United States during the last decade, competing for jobs and lowering wages.
 American companies are moving production overseas, using new technology to replace workers, engaging in mega-mergers such as this week's Chase-Chemical deal, and otherwise downsizing. Each year more than a half-million good jobs are eliminated by the nation's most prestigious companies. More new jobs are being generated in the service sector, but they come with lower wages and fewer fringe benefits.
 With the death of Communism and, later, market socialism as economic alternatives, capitalists have been able to employ more ruthless approaches to getting maximum profits without worrying about political pressure. "Survival of the fittest" capitalism is on the march.
 What economists call "efficiency wages" (a company paying higher salaries than the minimum it needs to pay, so that it gets a skilled, cooperative, loyal work force) are disappearing to be replaced by a different form of motivation -- the fear of losing one's job.
 Falling real wages have put the traditional American family into play, as the one-earner middle-class family becomes extinct. With children needing ever-more-costly educations for ever-longer periods of time, the cost of supporting a family is rising sharply just as earnings plunge.
 Thirty-two percent of all men between 25 and 34 years of age earn less than the amount necessary to keep a family of four above the poverty line. Mothers have to work longer hours if the family is to have its old standard of living.
 Children exist but no one takes care of them. Parents are spending 40 percent less time with their children than they did 30 years ago. More than two million children under the age of 13 have no adult supervision either before or after school. Paying for day care would use up all or most of a mother's wages.
 In the agricultural era, children had real economic value at a very early age, especially during planting and harvesting time. Parents knew that their children were their only pension system. For both parents and children the family was the social welfare net. One supported the family, and left it only reluctantly, since it was difficult to survive without it.
 Using the language of capitalism in today's economy, children have shifted from being "profit centers" to being "cost centers." To support them, parents have to be willing to make large economic sacrifices. Men have a strong economic incentive to bail out of family responsibilities since when they do so their real standard of living rises 73 percent -- although that of the family left behind falls 42 percent.
 Whether it is fathering a family without being willing to be a father, whether it is divorce and being unwilling to pay alimony or child support, or whether it is being an immigrant from the third world and after a time failing to send payments to the family back home, men all around the world are opting out. (The Japanese seems to be the only exception.)
 If mothers were willing to bail out, they too could have a higher standard of living. Often children would have a higher standard of living in foster care.
 People support the family less because it is now much less necessary to their personal economic survival. People do not work as a family. Often they seldom see each other, given conflicting work and education schedules. Students who use college loans owe their parents less. Living thousands of miles apart, families lose track of one another. The family is no longer the social welfare system when one is disabled, old or sick, and it will not resume these duties even if the state were to withdraw.
 The traditional family is being destroyed not by misguided social welfare programs coming from Washington (although there are some Government initiatives that have undermined family structure) but by a modern economic system that is not congruent with "family values."
 Beside falling real wages, America's other economic problems pale into insignificance. The remedies lie in major public and private investments in research and development and in creating skilled workers to insure that tomorrow's high-wage, brain-power industries generate much of their employment in the United States.
 Yet if one looks at the weak policy proposals of both Democrats and Republicans, "it is a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."

HEADLINE: Word for Word / Military School;
Going Back to College To Study War Some More

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS thousands of students across the country get ready to return to school this week, thousands of the military's best and brightest are setting aside their fighter jets and battle tanks and hitting the books too. They're going to war college.
 The services run well-known undergraduate schools, like West Point, which provide about 15 percent of their newly minted officers. But the Pentagon also operates postgraduate schools for officers from eager young captains to battle-hardened colonels. 
 A soldier's performance in battle or in command is still crucial for winning promotions. But ever since Gen. Colin L. Powell, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put more emphasis on interservice war planning and operations, one of the hottest tickets for up-and-coming admirals and generals is at one of these military graduate schools.
 What are they learning? The following is a sampling from current course catalogues. ERIC SCHMITT
 
 
National War College, Washington, D.C.
 
Command Decision: Civilian Leadership in War -- Explores the nature of the personal relationships established between modern political leaders and their military lieutenants and the effect these relationships have had on the use of military power. Beginning with the American Civil War, students examine several such relationships to include (among others): Abraham Lincoln and U. S. Grant, Winston Churchill and Alan Brooke, and George Bush and Colin Powell.
 
Human Behavior in War and Combat -- Exposes students to some of the historically based literature on what motivates, for better or worse, human beings in war. Course materials and seminar discussions focus on the face of war and battle from the strategic to the tactical level to give an appreciation of the difficulty of both waging war and motivating individuals in combat.
 
 
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, Quantico, Va.
 
Civil War Week -- This course examines the national and military strategies of the North and South, and explores the strategic objectives of both belligerents. The focus is on leadership and command, while examining how operational and tactical commanders attempted to achieve their objectives. Highlighting the week are staff visits to Chancellorsville and Gettysburg.
 
Operations Other Than War -- The most likely form of military force commitment over the next decade. The course focuses upon the operational categories of operations other than war: insurgency/counterinsurgency, terrorism, peace missions and peacetime contingency operations.
 
 
Air War College, Montgomery, Ala.
 
Command and Conscience -- In a prudent and practical manner, this course will examine a variety of topics of immediate professional concern to the commander. How does today's commander, for example, resolve the tension inherent in the occasional clash of command responsibility and ethical imperative? To whom or to what does the leader owe the highest loyalty? To his superior? To the Constitution? To his religious/philosophical judgments? Which has priority, mission or men? If integrity is, as it must be, the heart of the officer corps, it must first be examined before it can be assimilated. This course inquires into the nature of military integrity.
 
United States-Russian Relations in the Post-Cold War Era -- The United States and Russia have come full circle from hostile superpower rivals and adversaries to professed "partners" and even "friends." Several issues of contention still remain: NATO expansion, Russian activity in neighboring Soviet successor states, crisis in the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and North Korea. It is still uncertain whether Russia will continue on a course of democratization, privatization and a pro-Western tradition. The course will examine the evolution of the United States-Russian relations focusing on traditional security issues, including arms control, proliferation and regional conflict, as well as a range of other areas presenting new opportunities and challenges in the post-Cold War era (economics and investment, space).
 
 
Army War College, Carlisle Barracks, Pa.
 
Creative Thinking -- This course is designed to provide a greater understanding of creative thinking and the creative process. The course will consist of a series of progressively more challenging projects designed to demonstrate and exercise various aspects of, and barriers to, problem-solving.
 
Political Violence & Terrorism: The Democratic Response -- This course analyzes how various societies respond to the diversity of challenges posed to democratic values, procedures and institutions by political violence and terrorism.
 
Computers for Colonels -- This course will expose students to current MS-DOS desktop computer instruction and provide general instruction in computer fundamentals. The student will become comfortable with computer hardware and will be exposed to practical exercises in modifications to secondary storage, expansion card installation and configuration of peripheral devices.
 
The American Way of War -- The course will treat America's wars and warriors from Bunker Hill to Desert Storm. Emphasis will be on how Americans have fought their wars, but the following will not be ignored: how and why the resort to war was adopted, the raising of forces and reactions to the effects of war.
 
 
Naval War College, Newport, R.I.
 
Ocean Laws and Policy for the Operational Commander -- This course focuses on the legal and policy environment in which the naval commander must operate at sea. It is designed to enable the student to better understand the legal and policy foundations upon which operational orders emanating from the National Command Authorities are premised. The navigation and overflight articles of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including those pertaining to innocent passage in the territorial sea and transit passage in international straits and archipelagic sea lanes, will be examined.
 
Faith and Force: Religion, War and Peace -- Religious beliefs affect our attitudes toward the world and our actions during times of crisis. This course focuses on the three great monotheistic religions of the Western world: Judaism, Islam and Christianity, as their teachings bear on such issues as war and peace, church and state, land and power.
 
Financial Planning for the Military Executive -- The senior military executive is often called upon to counsel subordinates on personal financial problems. Additionally, the senior executive must efficiently plan his own financial affairs as the demands of the job normally allow little time for personal business. The senior officer, however, rarely has the background or experience to accomplish these tasks. This survey course will cover the basic elements of financial planning for use by the individual and in counseling others.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Their Eyes on Labor's Shrinking Prize

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LABOR is back in Labor Day. Two Irish-Americans, both balding and born in the Bronx, both veteran colleagues of New York's labor wars, are out on the hustings, leafletting and glad-handing, and this weekend, they're all over the airwaves.
 John J. Sweeney, 61, and Thomas R. Donahue, 67, are dueling for the presidency of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and they are making quite a spectacle for an institution that normally abhors disclosure of internal dissent. Since its formation 40 years ago, its presidents always ran unopposed and were elected by acclamation. 
 "What we have for the first time in my professional lifetime of 25 years," said Richard W. Hurd, director of labor studies at Cornell University, "is a real open debate about the role of unions. It means that the defenders of the status quo no longer control the labor movement."

 
 
Loyal Lieutenant
 Not that unions wanted this. The last president brought it on, inadvertently. Lane Kirkland, 73 years old and president for 16 years, had intended to run for another two years. But Mr. Kirkland had become a symbol and, to his detractors, an agent, of labor's decline. Presidents of 11 of the federation's 80 member unions, including the richest and biggest, urged Mr. Donahue, Mr. Kirkland's loyal lieutenant throughout the 16 years as secretary-treasurer, to take him on.
 When Mr. Donahue demurred, the mutineers promised another challenger, and Mr. Kirkland gave up, retiring in August. Mr. Donahue was elected to fill out the last months of Mr. Kirkland's term and jumped into the campaign for the Oct. 26 election.
 But by then the mutineers had massed behind Mr. Sweeney, whose big Service Employees International Union is one of few that have managed to prosper and grow throughout the labor movement's decline.
 Both combatants say they hope the campaign might stir interest in the artifact that in the era of Samuel Gompers, Walter Reuther and John L. Lewis was known as Big Labor.
 After decades of withering decline that unions blamed on Republican lawmakers and anti-union businesses, the unions are allowing that they brought a lot of their misery upon themselves.
 Many need look no farther than their own members, like those in Decatur, Ill., America's most strike-bound city. The auto workers are striking the Caterpillar plant, the rubber workers are striking the Bridgestone-Firestone tire plant, and the paper workers have been locked out of the A.E. Staley corn sweetener plant. Many have been out for more than two years.
 Many of labor's hardest-won rights -- to reclaim a job after a strike, to a 40-hour, five-day week, to company-paid health benefits, even to a living wage -- are in jeopardy there. And management victories there would surely reinforce management everywhere. But strikers complain that members of nonstriking unions are crossing picket lines to help management keep managing.
 They complain, too, that they're running out of money. David Watts, leader of the Staley workers, whose union is among the poorest, says each worker is collecting only $60 a week in strike benefits. He says they lost their health benefits days after the lockout began.
 "We need maximum help right now," Mr. Watts says. "I am disgruntled by the bureaucracy of the A.F.L.-C.I.O."
 Unions these days fight just to hold onto what they've got. The great workplace gains of the last 100 years have been under assault since the 1960's, and with a vengeance since the start of the 1980's. "If you're not making dust," said Ron Carey, the former Long Island UPS driver who is president of the Teamsters, "You're eating it."
 In other times like these, unions made dust. Industry is swimming in profits. In a new report, the pro-union Economic Policy Institute says that corporate profits last year were the highest in 25 years and are looking even fatter this year. But the institute reports that the median wage of men has fallen one percent a year for the last six, and that women's wages have begun to slip, too.
 So where do the profits go? The institute says more and more are going to industry's stockholders. Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, says that a lot are going into investment in industry to make it more efficient, and that wage increases should soon follow. Business Week magazine says more are going to management. It says company chief executives now earn 53 times as much as a factory worker. In 1980 they earned 42 times as much.
 To make matters worse, according to a study by Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard, the gap between the best paid workers and the worst, which unions helped close, "has come full circle to what it was more than a half century ago."
 Since unions haven't been able to stop those trends, workers wonder, why join them? And they don't.
 About a quarter of all workers in the private sector belonged to unions in the 1950's. Today 11 percent belong, or no more, proportionately, than in the 1930's. When public employees, who have had growing union membership, are counted in, the total rises only to 15.5 percent of the nation's work force.

 
 
Merger Fever
 And while total union membership has registered some recent small gains -- amounting to about 3 percent over the last two years -- these have not kept pace with the growth in employment.
 It took a while, but these changes have begun to haunt the House of Labor. Proud old unions are seeking strength in a wave of mergers. Among them, the Steelworkers agreed this summer to take over the Rubberworkers and then agreed to join the Auto Workers and Machinists to form a two-million-member goliath. The Ladies' Garment Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers have just joined forces, and the Communications Workers are taking over the Newspaper Guild.
 But in themselves, mergers will have little effect on the operation of the federation and its 35-member, policy-making executive council, which takes positions on issues before Congress. It has been on the losing side of nearly every political battle, like its campaigns to stop the North American Free Trade Agreement and to forbid industry to fire workers who strike.
 Republican ascendancy is one reason, but another is that Labor, for the first time in its history, has no face. Unlike his immediate predecessor, George Meany, whose ferocious image became etched onto television screens as firmly as Mickey Mantle's, Mr. Kirkland distrusted the media. In periodic polls, the most recent in July, the union-funded Labor Research Association in New York found that 95 to 97 percent of the public could not name the person whose position made him the No. 1 spokesman for the nation's wage earners.
New voices that might ask uncomfortable questions within the council are rare because the union presidents tend to hold office until death or retirement. The federation's newspaper rarely reports bad news about a union, like corruption or the loss of a strike, or it scratches for silver lining in bad news, like the annual Government reports on membership figures.

 
 
Who's to Recruit?
 But in the last couple of years, a few presidents had begun to ask about the decline of member unions. One reason is that as industrial companies shrink, there's no one for the one-industry unions to recruit, and they dedicate their resources to protecting the jobs and pensions of their veteran workers.
 This campaign, however, has forced the labor movement to acknowledge a failure to tap the sole obvious source of new strength -- new members.
 "My brothers and sisters," Mr. Sweeney said in a speech before the race began, "the problem with the labor movement is that we are irrelevant to the vast majority of unorganized workers in the country."
 In the campaign, both he and Mr. Donahue are promising huge, ten-fold increases in spending to train organizers to recruit those workers. So no matter who wins, the election no one wanted is already bearing fruit.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
You're Fired! (But Your Stock Is Way Up)

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
NOTHING succeeds like unemployment, at least when it comes to stock prices.
 Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank got together last week and decided that they would slash employment by 12,000 people, leaving them with 63,000 employees. 
 That news, of 16 percent fewer workers, sent the value of the two bank stocks up 11 percent. Put those figures on a graph, draw a line, and the implication is obvious: Each canned worker increases the combined market value of the two banks' shares by about $216,000. If the banks got rid of all their workers, their share prices would go up another 53 percent.
 That is absurd, of course. Somebody has to be around to put cash in the ATM machines. And, besides, there were plenty of other reasons for Wall Street to love the Chemical-Chase deal, not least among them the expectation -- denied by the banks -- that the increased market power would enable the bank to charge higher fees for some services.
 Still, firing workers remains popular among investors. Wall Street is quite happy to believe that almost any big company can make more money by firing people.
 Times Mirror stock, for example, is up 69 percent since Mark Willes was hired away from General Mills to become president and chief executive of the media company, while the overall stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500, is up just 10 percent. Mr. Willes' principal contribution since then has been close down one money-losing newspaper -- New York Newsday -- and to cut back employment at other newspapers.
 All this seems reasonable, to some extent. Wall Street loves higher profits, and they can come in one of two ways. It's nice if a company can manage to sell more of whatever it makes, or sell it for higher prices. But almost every company is constantly trying to do that, and it is not easy for a chief executive to order an increase in revenues. It is a lot easier to command a reduction in costs, by slashing the payroll.
 It even works in high technology companies. Stratus Computer said last week that it will get rid of 500 workers, or 18 percent of its workforce. The stock of Stratus, which makes computers that are supposed to never crash, rose 9 percent.
 One might think that if too many companies do that, it would be bad for the overall economy, and thus for the stock market. After all, all those fired people are consumers, and they probably are going to buy less if their incomes vanish. But the economy has created enough jobs to offset that effect, at least until now.
 In fact, the overall stock market seems to do best when economic growth is far from robust. Last year, 1994, was the market's worst year since 1990, but it was the economy's best year, as measured by job growth, since 1984. Growth is much slower this year, and stocks are up a lot more. As it happens, 1984 was also a poor year for the stock market, even as it was a great year for jobs and economic growth.
 "There is competition for capital between the real economy and the financial economy," says David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. The real economy includes everything from new machinery and new manufacturing plants to new homes, but it does not include the financial markets. So when the real economy slows down -- when people aren't shelling out money to buy things -- the money thus freed up can slosh over into the financial economy, driving up prices for stocks and bonds.
 This is not really a new phenomenon. In the 1920's, to recall one painful example, economic growth had slowed, and parts of the country had run into economic problems, long before the stock market peaked in 1929. Some people figured there was no need to build a new plant when you could get rich a lot faster by simply speculating in stocks.
 There is, of course, a fine line there. Investors do not want a recession, let alone a depression, and if it was widely believed that one was coming, the stock market probably would suffer.
 But slow growth, with the expectation of faster growth someday, seems to be just what Wall Street wants. So for now, at least, there is no quicker way to get your stock price up than to announce plans to fire a lot of workers.

HEADLINE: Retailers Say the Special Olympics Was a Bust

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Sept. 2

 BODY:
For weeks, Chris Papanikolau prepared his Athenian Diner for the Special Olympics, one of the biggest events ever to take place in this city. Organizers predicted that the games would bring Connecticut hundreds of thousands of visitors and millions of dollars in spending, and Mr. Papanikolau expected business to boom. He increased staff and bought a month's worth of food.
But as the swarms of athletes, coaches, volunteers and spectators descended on the city for nine days in July, Mr. Papanikolau watched busloads of people speed by his restaurant without stopping. Business plummeted by one third. 
 Mr. Papanikolau and other retailers argue that the Special Olympics was an economic bust. Instead of attracting business, they say, it frightened customers away.
"They scared people with the advertising about traffic," Mr. Papanikolau said. "A lot of people took off. And then they were running buses which were picking people up and driving them straight to the games. People could never get out of the bus to spend money in the city."
Arthur R. Henick, the games' spokesman, said that "unsubstantiated fears" of traffic problems might have frightened spectators away.
When asked about the economic impact on the city, he said, "We always said that it would be a statewide impact."
New Haven, one of America's poorest cities, spent three years preparing to organize the games, the largest athletic event in the world in 1995. Local businesses donated between $5 million and $6 million to the event, which brought 7,000 mentally retarded athletes from 143 nations to compete in New Haven and six other communities. Banners festooned the city, and about 62,000 volunteers turned out.
Mr. Papanikolau's complaints are reflected in a survey by a city business newspaper, Business New Haven. The publication did a random poll of 82 retail businesses near sites where events were held and reported that 57 percent of respondents experienced a decline in business during the games. Fewer than 13 percent reported any substantial increase.
New Haven's Mayor, John DeStefano Jr., blamed a "fax-induced hysteria" for the low turnout, but said the rumor mill had inflated some retailers' expectations well beyond reason.

HEADLINE: Clinton Sees Lessons in the Postwar Era

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Fifty years after Japan formally surrendered to Gen. Douglas MacArthur on the deck of the battleship Missouri, President Clinton today urged Americans to regain the sense of national purpose that propelled the United States into its postwar period of economic expansion and world leadership.
On the second day of ceremonies marking the end of World War II, Mr. Clinton heralded the valor of the Americans who fought in what he called the "most destructive conflict in all human history." But he also touched on the ways that the war and the helping hand the nation extended to returning veterans changed the social and economic fabric of the country. 
 "In order to succeed, we must remain true to the spirit of that brilliant time," the President said in an address at the National Cemetery of the Pacific, where small American flags marked the graves of more than 33,000 servicemen and servicewomen.
"A time when our people cared for each other and sacrificed for others," he continued, "when our nation stood united in purpose and mighty in spirit as never before. A time when Americans forged the strength of their diversity into a community for victory and progress."
Mr. Clinton recalled how the G.I. Bill of Rights gave returning veterans previously unimagined access to post-secondary education and allowed them to buy their first homes. He spoke of how 16 million women kept the nation's assembly lines working in the war and how afterward the United States "would begin to integrate this extraordinary force into the economy and into our nation's military."
And he remembered the black Americans who had fought for their country in segregated units until, slowly after the war, the country recognized that "if people of different races could serve as brothers abroad in uniform, they could surely live as neighbors at home."
"You understood that you could together make the world a better place, and that you could not permit America again to withdraw from the world," Mr. Clinton said to the thousands of elderly veterans who had come to Hawaii to remember the war in a weekend of pageantry and commemoration.
Mr. Clinton's remarks were solemn and nonpolitical. But they laid the groundwork for a theme that he is expected to flesh out in California on Monday and Tuesday and throughout the fall's budget battles with the Republican Congress: a call for the country not to abandon programs like education and training that lend support to Americans as the G.I. Bill once did.
Mr. Clinton, the first President since World War II not to have served in the military, paid tribute to the five Presidents before him who served in the Pacific. He noted in particular President John F. Kennedy, who served on an ill-fated PT-109, and President George Bush, who was shot down as a pilot.
After he spoke, Mr. Clinton, visibly moved, laid a wreath at the cemetery accompanied by two veterans of World War II's Pacific campaign: 82-year-old Robert Allen, who was a prisoner of war in Manila, and 72-year-old Alfred Los Banos, who lost his legs during the Korean War and came to the President's side in a wheelchair.
The three remained together as the war dead were honored with a 21-gun salute, a rendition of taps and a fly-over. "There's so many people that I went to war with," Mr. Los Banos said afterward, "and as taps play, it's something that I look back on and I'm thankful to them for giving us this day. So when taps play, I always cry."
Later Mr. Clinton visited PearlHarbor, where 3,600 American servicemen were killed or wounded in the Japanese attack on Dec. 7, 1941. He visited the U.S.S. Carl Vinson and the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial.
Mr. Clinton did not serve in Vietnam, a war he opposed. And his relationship with the military has often been strained by his lack of service and by his move early in his Administration to allow homosexuals to serve in the armed forces. But his reception from veterans and active-duty personnel this weekend has been warm.
Today the President lingered at the National Cemetery long after the ceremonies had ended, shaking hands with elderly veterans, hugging one, signing an autograph for another. And on Friday, after reviewing troops at Wheeler Army Airfield, Mr. Clinton mingled with about 500 of the men and women who had marched, even posing for pictures wearing a camouflage fatigue hat. At several points the troops broke out in cheers. Someone even shouted, "Four more years."

HEADLINE: A Powerful Fund-Raiser Who Also Oversees State Contracts

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON and DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
Charles A. Gargano is hardly a household name to the average New Yorker. But to state business leaders who gave millions of dollars in political contributions to elect George E. Pataki Governor last fall and to many of those same business people now seeking multimillion-dollar contracts from the Pataki administration, Charles A. Gargano is a crucial name to know.
Mr. Gargano is the colorful, sometimes controversial, immensely successful chief fund-raiser who collected $14.5 million to finance Mr. Pataki's upset victory last fall and who continues to be chairman of $1,000-a-plate Republican fund-raising events. 
 Mr. Gargano is also the Commissioner of the State Department of Economic Development, a job he has held since February that gives him enormous leeway in handing out millions of dollars worth of contracts to businesses across New York.
At times these last seven months, it has been hard to know which Charles Gargano was sitting at the table -- the one asking state business leaders for money or the one giving them the taxpayers' money.
Mr. Gargano is not accused of violating any laws. But his dual roles raise ethical questions that even the Governor has acknowledged in recent weeks that his administration must handle more carefully.
A case in point is an intimate dinner that the Governor and Mr. Gargano attended on June 23 at the home of a construction company president in Lloyd Harbor on the prosperous North Shore of Long Island.
Officials of the company, A-J Contracting, make no bones about it: they have no state contracts, but they would be interested in landing some state business. And six days after that dinner, the company president, Jerome A. Gannon; his wife; the company's chairman, Charles Uribe, and Mr. Uribe's two daughters sent checks to Mr. Pataki's personal campaign fund totaling $100,000.
Then there is the case of the Pyramid Companies, a developer that had been trying unsuccessfully for 10 years to build a $250 million shopping center in Rockland County. In March, after a personal appeal from the Governor, a company executive made a $25,000 contribution to the Republican State Committee. Two months later, Mr. Gargano made phone calls to two state agencies and suddenly, the delays disappeared. A month after Mr. Gargano's helpful calls, the developer contributed $3,000 to Mr. Pataki.
For Mr. Pataki's young administration, where to draw the line on using officials to collect campaign money has been a nagging problem.
Last month, the Governor had to acknowledge that a mistake had been made when a member of the State Racing and Wagering Board and the chairman of New York Power Authority served as chairmen for a fund-raising day at Saratoga Race Course that collected contributions from people who do business with those offices. Mr. Pataki said it would not happen again.
In an interview, Mr. Gargano, who made his fortune in the private sector as a construction company executive, said he would follow Mr. Pataki's new edict and avoid serving on formal fund-raising committees in the future. But he defended his right to keep raising money for the Governor and others in an unofficial way.
"It is preposterous to suggest that I should relinquish all my rights as an American citizen to participate in the democratic system," he said. "As long as I know in my heart and my head that I'm fine about what I'm doing, that's fine with me."
In the Pyramid case, he said, he was unaware of the contribution and defended his intervention as a legitimate attempt to eliminate "bureaucratic red tape." As for the A-J Contracting dinner at Mr. Gannon's home, he sees no problem. "For me, there is no conflict," he said. "I was invited as a guest, and I went to the dinner, and that was it. Plain and simple. I've known Jerry Gannon for many years. He's a member of my country club."
Mr. Pataki also sees nothing improper in Mr. Gargano's activities. "No man in his position has been asked to step aside from activities that are proper, including attending fund-raising parties," said Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha.
 
Ethical Mine Field Over Fund Raising
 In many ways, Mr. Gargano personifies the ethical mine field confronting government officials who are involved in fund-raising. Those concerns were raised seven months ago at his confirmation hearing for the posts of Economic Development Commissioner and chairman of the Urban Development Corporation. The agencies provide assistance to businesses in a variety of forms, like contracts for training workers and loans and grants for expansion. Democrats expressed fear that Mr. Gargano might turn his $163 million budget into a political "slush fund."
If Mr. Gargano were a Federal official, he would not be permitted to do what he does, but state administrators are not prohibited from raising campaign funds. Mr. Gargano's activities have veered into the gray area where the interests of governing overlap with the realities of political finance.
Since taking his state posts, he has attended numerous parties similar to the A-J dinner as well as taken a more public role on occasion. In April, he was honorary chairman of a fund-raising dinner kicking off the Republican Presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. On June 1, he was honorary chairman of a $1,000-a-plate dinner at the Sheraton New York for the Republican State Committee. Both events were attended by people who could benefit by decisions made by Mr. Gargano.
Mr. Gargano, 60, describes himself as a Brooklyn boy who made good through hard work and innovation in the unglamorous world of heavy construction. Trained as an engineer, he spent most of his career at J. D. Posillico Inc., helping the company become a dominant construction company on Long Island.
But his rise to prominence has not been without brushes with scandal. In 1981, the Suffolk County District Attorney filed a $270 million civil racketeering suit accusing Posillico and five other companies of bid rigging on a $1 billion sewer project. Mr. Gargano's actions were not called into question. The company eventually settled by paying $315,000 without admitting wrongdoing.
Mr. Gargano emerged unscathed and went on to a career in government and political fund-raising.
When asked the key to Mr. Gargano's legendary success in raising money, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, his political patron, said: "People like him. He likes people. Charlie is a very warm person. And very effective." This success has fueled Mr. Gargano's aspirations. He has said privately he would like to be Commerce Secretary if Mr. Dole becomes President.
 
Under the Influence Of Senator D'Amato
 Mr. Gargano's government career began in 1981, when he was appointed a deputy administrator in the Federal Department of Transportation. It was in Washington that he came under the patronage of Mr. D'Amato, who had just been elected to the Senate.
When Mr. Gargano left the post in 1983, Mr. D'Amato helped him become New York director of the campaign to re-elect President Reagan. In 1986, Mr. Gargano helped raise a then-record in campaign funds for Mr. D'Amato's re-election. And in 1988, he was appointed Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago.
Mr. Gargano is proud of his diplomatic stint and still likes to be called Mr. Ambassador. But two people who served with him in the State Department said he seemed to spend about half his time on Long Island, an assertion Mr. Gargano denies.
What is undisputed is that he was not in Trinidad at the critical moment of his tenure. On July 27, 1990, when rebels seized the Prime Minister and killed more than 20 people in a coup attempt, Mr. Gargano was on Long Island. He said he had just started a vacation and returned to Trinidad immediately. The two officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Embassy did not know where to locate Mr. Gargano initially and that he was summoned to Washington and criticized when discovered at home.
Even while Ambassador, Mr. Gargano raised funds for a political committee with ties to Mr. D'Amato, according to state election records. Political fund-raising by Ambassadors, which is now barred, was then permitted on a limited basis.
After resigning as Ambassador in 1991, Mr. Gargano described himself as semiretired and resumed fund-raising for Senator D'Amato. Last year, when Mr. D'Amato threw his support to Mr. Pataki in the Governor's race, Mr. Gargano became the Republican candidate's finance chief, part of a contingent of D'Amato loyalists who helped defeat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
After the election, Mr. Pataki appointed Mr. Gargano to his state economic posts, despite Democratic complaints that his past as a fund-raiser would lead to conflicts with his state job. Those complaints seemed to come true when Mr. Gargano intervened for Pyramid.
For almost 10 years, the Syracuse-based developer had fought objections from local and state officials over its plans to build a huge mall near two landfills in West Nyack. There were environmental and traffic concerns.
In March, Pyramid's senior partner, Robert J. Congel, received a phone call from Mr. Pataki, soliciting contributions to pay for advertisements supporting his budget proposals in the General Assembly. Mr. Congel sent a check for $25,000 to the Republican State Committee.
Ms. Mucha, the Governor's spokeswoman, acknowledged that Mr. Pataki sought the money, but she said he never discussed Mr. Congel's project.
On May 2, Mr. Congel visited Mr. Gargano to discuss delays on the shopping center. Before the developer left his office, Mr. Gargano had telephoned John Daly, Commissioner of the State Transportation Department, and officials at the State Department of Environmental Conservation on his behalf. By May 17, the obstacles had disappeared, and Pyramid broke ground by June.
Mr. Congel said the $25,000 contribution and Mr. Gargano's intervention were "purely coincidental."
For his part, Mr. Gargano said: "This wasn't directly for Pyramid or Congel. This was for economic development. I was on the other side and was frustrated so many times with state, county and other agencies holding up projects and costing the business person a tremendous amount of money for no good reason except lazy bureaucrats using regulations."
Officials at the other state agencies said that Mr. Gargano had urged them to act quickly but that Pyramid received no special treatment.
"The danger here is that the 'for sale' sign is being distributed in New York Government," said State Senator Richard A. Dollinger, a Rochester Democrat.
 
Major Shareholder In Casino Operator
 Mr. Gargano has a mixed record as a businessman. He traded blocks of stock daily that often exceeded $250,000 while an Ambassador and said he wound up losing money. Some of his many real estate deals have been winners, but court records contain judgments against Mr. Gargano and various partners in other transactions.
One investment that raises questions about the intersection of his business interests with his state job is Mr. Gargano's position as a major stockholder and director of the Alpha Hospitality Corporation, a small New York City company that operates a riverboat casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
Alpha -- whose revenue and stock price have plummeted in recent months -- has been trying to negotiate a deal with the St. Regis Mohawks to open a casino on their reservation upstate. Three tribal leaders say that, when the tribe resisted, company representatives suggested that Mr. Gargano could help the Mohawks in a land dispute with the state.
"They were throwing around Charles Gargano's name," said John Loran, the head chief until June and an opponent of the Alpha proposal.
Stanley S. Tollman, Alpha's chairman, said Mr. Gargano's name may have come up in talks, but he denied using it and said he had not sought Mr. Gargano's help.
With the General Assembly approving the first step toward legalized gambling in New York, Mr. Gargano's stock and seat on the Alpha board pose potential new conflicts. He said selling the stock, for which he paid nearly $1 million, would make him lose half his investment. But he said he had asked his lawyers to draw up papers so he could resign from the board.
"Not that I am concerned about having a conflict, personally," Mr. Gargano said. "It's just so it doesn't give the appearance of one."

HEADLINE: Sacred to Russians, Not to U.S. Budget Cutters

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: KHUZHIR, Russia

 BODY:
Arching out of the vivid, azure blue of Lake Baikal, where it laps up against Olkhon Island, is one of Buddhism's holiest sites, the Shaman Rock. It is revered by the native Buryat people, and the Dalai Lama has also prayed here.
In the Soviet period, when most native traditions and religion itself were considered anti-state activities, the authorities built a dock directly under the Shaman Rock, where ships unloaded supplies and diesel oil for this small town of 1,500 and picked up the garbage. 
 Filthy, unsightly and sacrilegious, the dock has now been dismantled and the sacred beach, on this sacred lake, is being cleared of oil and rubbish. There is a project to beautify the walk to the rock for tourists, and to let them share in the terasun ceremony, involving a healthy gulp of the slightly psychedelic fermented sheep's whey. The whey also seems to go well with the local fish, a sort of salmon trout called omul.
The town is getting a simple system of wind and solar power that will give the residents more electricity than they have ever had before, and make regional plans to run an electric cable through the lake and a surrounding national park unnecessary.
The townspeople are preparing a zoning plan; moving the single gasoline station from the shore, where it pollutes protected waters; extending a log-built cultural museum; restoring native flora and fauna to the island and growing vegetables better suited to the climate.
All this is being done with the aid of the American taxpayer, through the United States Agency for International Development, in a project to promote sustainable and environmentally sound economic progress. The money involved on Olkhon, with its seven sub-projects, is less than $150,000 a year over four years.
But if Congress goes ahead with suggested cuts in foreign aid, it is projects like these, on Baikal, that are most likely to disappear.
Olkhon is the largest of 12 pilot projects in the Baikal region designed and run by the nonprofit Ecologically Sustainable Development Inc., or E.S.D., under a four-year, $3 million contract with the Agency for International Development that began in 1993. The larger effort is to create a sensible plan for resource and land management all around Lake Baikal, the world's largest lake by volume and source of about 20 percent of the earth's fresh water. The lake harbors more than 1,800 unique species of plant and animal life that have developed in its 25-million-year history.
Russians consider Lake Baikal the clear, clean heart of the world, an environmental treasure. But it is at risk from uncontrolled development in a period of weak government, official corruption and wild capitalism.
Working with local people and three regional Russian authorities, a task of great political delicacy, the E.S.D. project is seeking to preserve one of the world's wonders while trying to better the lives of the people here. The plan is to provide new ideas and training in activities that earn income and produce tax revenue, and then get out of the way. Ideally, these pilot projects will be copied elsewhere with local resources, directed by those Russians now working for and with E.S.D.
The group's other projects include developing "ecotourism," to allow visitors to experience Baikal without harming it, reclaiming polluted land, and restarting reindeer herding in mountainous areas, the indigenous form of animal husbandry. The Soviets made this impossible by their artificial demands for meat and milk quotas, which required herds of cows that had to live in the already overburdened valleys.
These efforts are an important sign of American interest in provincial Russia -- outside the rampant corruption and glitz of Moscow -- where the country's future is being formed. Even provincial government leaders grudgingly acknowledge the usefulness of the projects.
To George D. Davis, a forester and former executive director of the Wilderness Society who runs Ecologically Sustainable Development, the possibility that Congress will cut financing for the program is a stupid tragedy.
Mr. Davis, 52, developed a similar program in his native Adirondacks region in New York State and won a five-year MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1989 for his work. That allowed him to establish Ecologically Sustainable Development and feed his family.
After considerable publicity for wasting aid money in the first years of America's effort to assist Russia, the Agency for International Development has tried to do better lately at spending its smaller budget -- $250 million in fiscal year 1995.
But Mr. Davis has been told by agency administrators that prospective cuts -- the House wants to limit agency aid in Russia to $195 million -- will kill his kind of program, while big construction projects with huge overhead and little local training continue, because the cost of administering small projects is almost the same as that for large ones.
"We could produce bigger and more expensive projects," Mr. Davis said with annoyance. "But those are the ones that locals can't duplicate, because they can't afford it."
The American Ambassador to Russia, Thomas R. Pickering, who came to see the projects here, thinks that Congress will cut 20 to 30 percent from last year's aid totals. "We'll fight to keep every cent," he told somber E.S.D. workers.
Washington had planned to phase out most aid to Russia by 1998 in any case, Mr. Pickering said, "so if it phases out sooner, we can adjust." Still, he said, environmental aid should be part of a "base program" of aid to Russia even after 1998, and "Baikal is the epitome of Russia's environmental concerns."
Ecologically Sustainable Development employs just 11 full-time workers based in Elizabethtown, N.Y., has about 30 part-time employees and calls on 100 expert volunteers, but more to the point, it has 229 Russian employees, mostly part-time. The Americans pay Russian salaries the first year, but the contribution declines to a third over the four years of the grant, forcing local projects to become self-sustaining or die.
Along Baikal, the main environmental issues are air and water pollution from Soviet-built factories, like two big paper and pulp plants that pour 8.8 million cubic feet of waste water a day into the lake, and the rise in the level of the lake of a yard since the 1960's, largely due to a dam for a power plant. The extra water is the rough equivalent of 15 trillion two-liter bottles of Coca-Cola and has changed the lake in ways still little understood. The combination threatens Baikal, which has a 380-year recycling period, compared with about 10 years, for instance, in the Great Lakes.
Already, the number of omul in the lake is dropping, and not from overfishing, so that the one factory on Olkhon Island, a fish cannery that employs 200 people, mostly processes imported herring rather than omul.
The director of the factory, Vladimir Vinsak, 39, criticized Mr. Davis for not concentrating his efforts on fish. "Projects for energy and tourism are fine, but this island lives on fish," Mr. Vinsak said. "It's like the tail without the head. I'd like the program to begin with water and water resources."
Still, he said, the United States Government and Mr. Davis are helping where the Russian and regional governments had done little but talk. "It's right for the American side, but unpleasant for the Russian side," Mr. Vinsak said. "We're afraid only that the Government could stop any aid from foreign governments."
At Bolshoye Goloustnoye, a small, dying town of some 700 people, unemployment is about 70 percent, said Lyudmila Sagayeva, the Ecologically Sustainable Development director there. The village was founded 300 years ago to exploit the timbered hills, but the establishment of a national park in 1987 stopped logging and nearly killed the town.
Half the rough wooden buildings are empty; there has been a lot of vandalism and "a loss of hope," Mrs. Sagayeva said. The idea is to encourage employment in ecotourism, based on the lake, the older landmarks of the town and the surrounding forest.
Ecologically Sustainable Development has employed residents to reclaim the town's beach, which was used for many years as a log storage area. Others work with park rangers, some of them American volunteers, to build "interpretive" walking trails in the forest, with guides to its flora and fauna. A collapsing, austere wooden church from the last century is being restored, and the schoolhouse is now lighted with solar energy. Mrs. Sagayeva believes that the projects have restored a small measure of hope to the town.
"What pleases me most is the degree to which the Russians on the ground are running things," Mr. Davis said. "Not all 12 projects will go forward and spawn 800 others, but at least some will go on without any government assistance."
Sergei Shapkhayev, director of the Buryat/Baikal land-use program and head of the Buryat Republic's small Green Party, fears for Baikal generally. In the next century, he said, Baikal will be pressed hard by Russia's need for development and revenue, especially from unexploited forests and waters, and by its new, market-era chaos and corruption. Still, he said, the programs here can "try to soften the damage done to Lake Baikal and lay the foundation for better protection in the future."
With the free market, there are more competing companies and more lavish corruption. With privatization, there is by definition less Government control over land, which can now be bought and sold.
The influx of new people "with a totally different attitude toward nature" has diluted the ethnic balance of the lake's indigenous peoples, who "over the centuries have worked out ethical standards toward the land, and who are more conservative in their technologies," Mr. Shapkhayev said.
As an indication of these problems, a local boat owner spoke privately of a company he had formed with employees of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service, the domestic side of the former K.G.B., to buy lakefront land for a resort. The owner, perhaps boasting, said money was little problem, given the income from sales of diverted oil and timber, but he was looking for a Western partner.
Told of this conversation, Mr. Davis sighed. "This kind of work has such incredible peaks and valleys, sometimes twice a day," he said. "But there's so much need out there, and frankly, the cost is so low."

HEADLINE: Audit Agency For Mexico Is Proposed

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Promising to scale back his own authority and confront rampant Government corruption, President Ernesto Zedillo says he will support the creation of an independent agency to oversee public spending.
In his first state of the nation address, Mr. Zedillo said on Friday that he would soon propose a constitutional amendment to establish a comptroller's office under the legislature with an autonomous professional staff and wide powers to audit the federal Government. 
 "It would be a decisive step in the fight against impunity and corruption," he said. "We will be able to make great strides toward giving new life to the checks and balances among the branches of government."
Mr. Zedillo offered few details of the plan, and no explanation about what would become of the federal ministry that now audits the Government, largely in secret. But in a speech that otherwise generated little enthusiasm even among his supporters, the initiative was for the most part well received.
Answering critics who say he has done little to fulfill his promises to strengthen law enforcement, Mr. Zedillo outlined a new public security system that would coordinate the efforts of federal, state and local police forces. He also said he would propose organized crime legislation to use against drug traffickers.
Law enforcement officials have long complained that Mexican laws are inadequate in prosecuting the increasingly sophisticated mafias that transship most of South America's cocaine into the United States. In only a handful of cases have major drug traffickers been given long-term prison sentences, and even then, several have been able to maintain their criminal organizations while imprisoned.
After nine months in office and more than eight months of an economic crisis that has shattered his campaign promises of a new prosperity, Mr. Zedillo vowed again that the worst of Mexicans' suffering was behind them.
Many economists remain skeptical. But Mr. Zedillo promised that even though the economy had shrunk 5.8 percent in the first half of this year, it would begin to grow modestly in the coming months.
Government spending for the year is projected to be 10 percent less than in 1994, he said. But three-fourths of that money is to be disbursed in the second half of the year.
Along with increasing stability in the financial markets, a drop in interest rates and the sale of some Government assets, Mr. Zedillo said, the surge in spending should make for a noticeable recovery this year.
As much as its substance, his address was noted for its style.
In the past, the annual presidential report before the Congress was a spectacle of executive power. After speeches that droned on for hours and were sifted endlessly for clues to the leader's thinking, the President rode through the streets of Mexico City in an open car, showering in confetti distributed by his aides. Then he spent hours in what was called the hand-kissing: a greeting for hundreds of bureaucrats, diplomats and politicians.
Mr. Zedillo, who stands in most public opinion polls as the least popular new leader in Mexican memory, did not ask anyone to kiss his hand. He rode to Congress in a bus, and his aides considered it a victory that opposition legislators did not try to shout him down from the floor.
The text of the President's remarks was scrutinized as ever. The term he used most frequently, newspapers reported this morning, was "crisis."

HEADLINE: The Sad State of the Parties

 BODY:
Thomas Kean's decision not to run for the New Jersey Senate seat being vacated by Bill Bradley is at once sad and instructive. It is sad because he was a useful Republican Governor and in all likelihood would have been a useful senator. It is instructive for what it reveals about Washington, about the disheveled condition of our two major political parties and about the ferment affecting American politics in general.
 Mr. Kean's reasons for not seeking membership in the Senate broadly parallel Mr. Bradley's reasons for leaving it. Mr. Bradley said he was "disgusted with the politics of both parties" and their inability to find common ground. Mr. Kean, rather more passionately, said that Washington in general and Congress in particular had become uncivil, "mean-spirited" and relentlessly inhospitable to moderate voices like his own. 
 He did not single out his own party for special blame. But it was clear from the context of his remarks that the city he wants no part of is a city over which Bill and Hillary Clinton preside in theory and the Republicans preside in fact. These are people, he said, "who don't want my views down there" and who would quickly find ways to "marginalize" him with minor committee assignments.
 This is not without irony. Mr. Kean was a party star of the 1980's. He was much admired even among conservative Reaganites who did not always share his views, and he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the Republican convention that nominated George Bush in 1988. But by the next convention in 1992, a gathering dominated by the likes of Pat Buchanan, he had become a forlorn figure, trying without success to persuade the platform writers to include a few compassionate words in their plank on abortion. The right wing marginalized him then and there.
 Mr. Kean's decision signals unrest in the Republican Party in much the same way that Mr. Bradley's decision reaffirms the decay of the Democratic Party. The Democrats' problems have been widely chronicled. Three House Democrats and one Senate Democrat have already defected to the Republicans this year and more departures are anticipated. Bill Clinton has not greatly altered Washington's cozy culture or transformed his party. Even so, the President still has a reasonable chance for re-election, especially if Republican primary voters and convention delegates indulge their taste for candidates with the meanest vocabularies and narrowest positions.
 Despite its numerical strength, the G.O.P.'s Congressional wing does not seem particularly content, perhaps because of intramural strife over who ought to be President. Right-wing partisans are sore because Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole did not deliver on term limits and a balanced budget amendment. Silenced or disaffected moderates like Mr. Kean, meanwhile, are aghast at Mr. Gingrich's wholesale rejection of the Federal Government's historic obligation to provide relief for the poor and remedies for the shortcomings of the marketplace.
 In short, neither party can count on that vast, testy body of middle-class voters who tend to decide elections and who, right now, are worried about their economic prospects, cynical about sound-bite politics and frustrated with the ineffectiveness of government. They are madder at the Democrats than the Republicans, but their disgust is generalized enough to feed continual yearnings for a third party. That is why Ross Perot is still around, why Lowell Weicker thinks about the White House, why pundits (and Colin Powell's book publicists) keep touting a Powell candidacy.
 Kenneth Duberstein, Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, put the matter this way in an interview with a Times reporter: "People are clicking off politicians. In '92 they clicked off George Bush. In '94 they said they were clicking off Bill Clinton and the Democrats. The next channel we may turn to is an independent channel."
 Political parties, of course, are capable of astonishing change. Both parties have endured cycles of disintegration and resurrection. Perhaps the Republicans will find some way to include their Tom Keans. Perhaps the Democrats can build a strong new house. But there is no evidence that either is really trying. All we are hearing -- as Congress and the President return to work -- is that clicking sound, the sound of people channel-surfing through the political landscape.

The View From Taipei

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
The crisis simmering today between Taiwan and mainland China has replaced Korea as the powder keg voted most-likely-to-explode by Asian leaders. The man holding the fuse is Lee Teng-hui, President of Taiwan, father of Taiwan's democratic reform movement and the only person in the world whose receipt of an alumni award plaque from Cornell University almost triggered a war across the Straits of Taiwan.
 President Lee invited me over for an interview Friday in his office in downtown Taipei. The conversation left me both reassured and disquieted. It was reassuring because Mr. Lee is an unlikely fuse. A sober, owlish man, who weighed his words carefully, he evinced a strong grasp of the red lines that constrict Taiwan's behavior -- red lines he is certainly trying to push out but won't likely breach. It was disquieting, though, because, as he made clear, this is a plastic moment in relations between China and Taiwan, a time when new pressures are bending old constraints to the breaking point. The potential for miscalculation by Beijing or Taipei is enormous. 
 With that in mind, Mr. Lee, speaking in Mandarin, made two overarching points: First, he is not seeking internationally recognized independence for Taiwan -- a move that could easily spark a war. He is, though, seeking a higher profile for Taiwan on the world stage -- one that would be commensurate with its economic clout and freewheeling democracy but would still fall short of formal independence. Second, he signaled a strong desire to step back from the brink and resume the quiet dialogue that had been going on between Beijing and Taipei since 1987, but was broken off by Beijing in the wake of Mr. Lee's June visit to Cornell.
 Asked what his long-term goal was, Mr. Lee said: "It has always been and remains unification with the mainland. But unification must be achieved only when we can guarantee democracy, freedom and prosperity for all the peoples of a unified China. I have never talked about independence or permanent separation for Taiwan."
 The President suggested that in seeking a higher profile for Taiwan in international forums he was only acting on his people's natural desire for recognition of their remarkable achievements on this once-barren island, which is now one of the richest countries in the world. Thumping the coffee table, he fumed: "This is a democratic country. I have to do what people want me to do. This is a different world now. People cannot live in isolation. Any leader here must give some expression to the dignity of the country. We don't think this impairs our future goal of reunification."
 What would he tell President Clinton if he got the chance?
 "I would tell him I welcome the resumption of normal relations between the U.S. and Beijing, but no one should be allowed to manipulate this rapprochement against us. It is important not to make a strategic error and treat Taiwan as a province of [Communist China]. The U.S. still has the responsibility and the obligation to protect Taiwan based on the spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act."
 But the Taiwanese President went out of his way to extend an olive branch to China's President, Jiang Zemin, suggesting that their two countries settle their differences quietly, without the U.S.
 "You can see that they have criticized me so violently and I have not said a word," said Mr. Lee, speaking of Beijing's virulent propaganda attacks on him, which have only made him more popular at home. "I can assure you that we are going to deal with this problem with patience, reason and calm, not emotion. We are opening the door and waiting for them to come back to the table."
 Mr. Lee expressed his hope for a summit between himself and Mr. Jiang, and he seemed to hint that he might be flexible on the venue. Until now Taiwan has insisted on an international setting, while Beijing wants it in China.
 "Perhaps after the power shifting is sorted out in Beijing and the elections are over in Taiwan [in March] we could all consider the possibility of a meeting again," said Mr. Lee. "Jiang Zemin's position is very delicate right now, and so we need to wait for a quiet moment when things might be less sensitive."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Selig's Job Title Could Change Because of Brewers' Problems

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Cal Ripken won't be the only baseball figure to surpass a milestone this week. On Tuesday, the day Ripken ties Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game record, Bud Selig will surpass the tenure his predecessor, Fay Vincent, held as commissioner.
Selig is technically acting commissioner, but there's nothing make-believe about his $1.25 million salary, the highest ever paid a commissioner. 
 Vincent, who was elected commissioner after Bart Giamatti died, served 1,091 days, resigning under fire Sept. 7, 1992. Two days later, Selig was elected chairman of Major League Baseball's executive council, meaning he was the man in charge.
Despite some complaints within baseball and in Congress that an owner can't also be the commissioner, Selig has retained the position with firm backing from a vast majority of owners who like his consensus style of running the game (his critics would replace the first 'n' in running with an 'i').
A new commissioner, Selig and his fellow owners have decided, will not be named until they have a new labor agreement with the players. By the time that goal is reached, Selig, who has resisted overtures that he take the job on a permanent basis, may be in position to take it on permanently.
The reason is the sad economic state of his team, the Milwaukee Brewers. They are in serious trouble and will be in worse trouble if the Wisconsin Legislature rejects a plan for a new stadium that is the lifeline to the Brewers' future in Milwaukee.
The Legislature is scheduled to vote on the plan in two weeks. The proposed method of raising funds for the stadium is to increase by a tenth of a cent the sales tax in two counties that would benefit most from a new stadium -- Milwaukee and neighboring Waukesha.
Passage of the controversial plan already was questionable, but Gov. Tommy Thompson, in his zeal to boost the project, might have made chances of adoption worse. Touring the state last Wednesday on a motorcycle, the governor urged listeners at one stop, "All the taxes come from Waukesha and Milwaukee. Stick it to 'em."
His subsequent apologies did not undo the damage. Now it remains to be seen what the Legislature will do.
If the stadium plan fails, Selig will be faced with the very real prospect of taking or selling the Brewers elsewhere, a move the lifetime Milwaukee resident has not wanted to confront. His fellow shareholders have supported Selig's resolve to remain in Milwaukee, but even they may have to succumb to reality.
Selig, at 61 the youngest of the shareholders, owns 25 percent of the club. The rest of the ownership has been described as consisting mainly of people close to or past retirement age.
Lori Uihlein, in her early 70's and the widow of the former president of the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company, owns 18 percent. Charles Krause, 63, who has a consulting company, owns 20 percent. The Stearns family trust holds 15 percent. Everett Smith, 85, a financial backer of Selig, has an 8.5 percent share. The remaining 14.5 percent is divided among a few other people.
Selig won't talk about the possibility of moving or selling the Brewers. He always has believed in franchise stability, and some owners might cast a dubious eye on his desire to move his team, considering his longtime stance. But he would have strong arguments in support of a transfer: no prospect of a new stadium or increased revenues and the financial losses of recent years.
If that day comes, Selig could relinquish his ownership and his $450,000 salary as president and chief executive officer of the Brewers -- reduced voluntarily from $700,000 -- and remove the "acting" from his other title. His new employers would probably even give him another raise.
 
Members of the Board
 The third anniversary of Fay Vincent's ouster and Bud Selig's succession comes at a time when a major business transaction could bring Vincent back to baseball. He is a member of the board of directors of Time Warner Inc., which is in the process of negotiating the purchase of Turner Broadcasting, which owns the Atlanta Braves.
Turner, who would become vice chairman of Time Warner in the deal, and Vincent would be fellow board members. When Vincent became an embattled commissioner in 1992, Turner assured Vincent that he would support him. When the Braves voted, though, they voted against him.
One theory was that Stan Kasten, the Braves' president, and William Bartholomay, the board chairman, decided on their own to join the oust-Vincent forces. Turner, by that time, had stopped attending owners meetings.
Asked the other day about the vote, Kasten said, "That's not something I care to discuss."
As for the potential change in ownership of the Braves, Selig said: "It's too early to even think about that. I've talked to the Braves people quite a bit, but I don't have a comment because I haven't thought it through."
 
An Open-Checkbook Policy
 Perhaps he just doesn't want to detract from the event that will occur in Baltimore this week, but Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, is remarkably low-key about his team's underachieving season. He said "no changes are contemplated" at this moment but added, "That doesn't necessarily mean that won't change at the conclusion of the season."
The prevailing belief in Baltimore is that Angelos will make changes in the front office, replacing General Manager Roland Hemond and his assistant, Frank Robinson. He might have presaged the moves when he talked about "the inadequacies of the bullpen."
"They weren't expected," the owner said, "since the resources for bringing the bullpen up to a higher level were there but not utilized because it was thought the pitchers were there."
Translated, that means money was available to go out and get the best bullpen help available, but the front-office people didn't think such drastic steps would be necessary.
"We had an open checkbook policy; we were looking to win," Angelos said, speaking candidly of his willingness to spend, then explaining: "We have tremendous fan support. The kind of support we're getting, I feel obligated to produce a winner for the fans and I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary to win."
 
Distraction and Disharmony
 As if baseball hadn't done a poor enough job of making fans forget the labor war, some clubs have resurrected replacement baseball. An idea most general managers and managers abhorred when the owners created it last winter, it has cropped up periodically during the season when a club has summoned a replacement player from the minor leagues.
But the practice has reached a new plateau in recent weeks, first when the Houston Astros called up pitcher Craig McMurtry on Aug. 13 and then when the Los Angeles Dodgers promoted Mike Busch last Tuesday.
Some people believe the unwelcomed presence of McMurtry, who during his real career spent a week short of seven years in the majors, helped lead to the Astros' disastrous 11-game losing streak that began Aug. 17. Astros management doesn't believe it, but they'll never know for sure.
The Dodgers' players reacted in a most negative way when Busch arrived. The most startling aspect of the development was the reaction of Dodgers fans. They lustily cheered Busch and repeatedly booed Brett Butler, who served as the players' spokesman in their rejection of a player they called a scab. The Dodgers lost the first two games they played with Busch in their dugout.
"I have no reason to believe that games are won or lost because of the presence of a scab on the team," Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said. "That isn't the issue. That's just a convenient way of avoiding dealing with the merits of the situation."
And the merits are?
"All the people in Los Angeles can simultaneously stand up and cheer for a person," Orza said. "It doesn't make it right. It's not right to step over the backs of strikers to get a job."
Seventeen replacement players have spent time on 11 major league rosters this season. Kansas City and Milwaukee each have used four and nine other teams one each.
The Dodgers' use of Busch indicates a change of philosophy from the team unity the late Walter O'Malley practiced when he owned the club. After four players went against the large majority of Dodgers and voted against a strike authorization in spring training of 1972, O'Malley asked Marvin Miller who they were. Miller declined to say, but O'Malley subsequently learned their identities elsewhere and got rid of all four players.

HEADLINE: U.S. Embargo on Cuba Slows Pace of Reform;
Business Loses Big

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Richard Nuccio, the White House special adviser on Cuba, is dead wrong in stating (front page, Aug. 27) that American businesses are not losing out with respect to investment opportunities in Cuba, as the rest of the world opens its doors to trade and investment with the island nation. 
 Cuba is busy settling its debts and differences with all of Latin America, and has just been admitted to the newly formed Association of Caribbean States, some 15 countries including Haiti, the nations of Central America, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela that are committed to democratic principles, human rights and expansion of regional trade.
 Anyone visiting Cuba can't fail to notice vastly increased foreign investment in many parts of the economy. Life is still very rough for the average Cuban, but Cuba has definitely hit bottom economically and is moving forward.
 Although committed to Socialist principles, the Cuban Government is ready to do business.
 It is especially noteworthy that Israel, the only country in the world to support the United States embargo, is developing in Cuba what will be the world's largest citrus growing project.

HEADLINE: U.S. Embargo on Cuba Slows Pace of Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In your Aug. 27 front-page article on United States companies pressing President Clinton to lift the Cuba embargo, Richard Nuccio, the White House special adviser on Cuba, says the embargo is the only pressure that drives Cuba toward economic or political reform. Nothing could be further from the truth: the embargo inhibits economic and political reform. 
 Why haven't the Cuban people risen up against Fidel Castro and demanded political change? Any other government that had overseen such a disastrous collapse of its economy as has occurred in Cuba over the past five years would have been overthrown -- no matter how tight its security system. Cubans have not risen up against Mr. Castro because they are nationalists -- their ire against attempts by the United States Government to dictate Cuba's fate is greater than their unhappiness with their own Government.
 The embargo unites Cubans behind Fidel Castro. And the new legislation proposed by Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Dan Burton to tighten the embargo further merely gives another boost to Mr. Castro's popularity.
 As for economic reforms, they are taking place despite -- not because of -- the embargo. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Cuba was forced to open its economy to foreign investment. Instead of encouraging this process, the United States Government tried to thwart it by tightening the embargo in 1992 to include American subsidiaries overseas. Now the Helms-Burton legislation would further punish other countries that trade with Cuba.
 Aside from violating international law and being repudiated by all our allies, the bill defies all logic. You can't cut Cuba off from the world market and then turn around and condemn it for not opening up its economy.
 The Clinton Administration and Congress should be ashamed of their policy on Cuba. It certainly makes no sense for United States business. But more important, it harms the Cuban people by denying them even life-sustaining food and medicine simply because we don't like their Government. While appeals for lifting the embargo on humanitarian grounds have unfortunately fallen on deaf ears, it is to be hoped that appeals by United States businesses will prove more fruitful.

HEADLINE: MEETING OF WOMEN SAYS SURVEILLANCE BY CHINA MUST END

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: HUAIROU, China, Sept. 2

 BODY:
With the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women about to open, leaders of the parallel forum here delivered an ultimatum to their Chinese hosts today, warning that if security forces did not cease their intense surveillance of participants within 24 hours, they could close the forum down.
With nearly 30,000 women from around the world gathered here for a bonanza of networking and workshops, the demand by leaders of the Non-Governmental Organizations Forum on Women intensified a sense of crisis among United Nations and other officials that their long-planned conference could be ruined by unruly hosts. 
 Outrage over pervasive surveillance -- for a fourth day participants complained that they were aggressively filmed, followed and harassed -- came to a boil at a news conference where members of the forum's leadership committee issued their ultimatum.
"If they do not comply, we will go back to our constituencies and ask: Do you want to cancel, do you want to boycott, do you want to riot, or what?" said Salamo Fuliavi, a member of the committee. "If they say 'let's go home,' that's what it means."
Late tonight, the officer in charge of security here denied that the police had followed or conducted surveillance of any participant.
But concern over the often brazenly pushy behavior by security agents was echoed by senior members of the United States delegation to the United Nations conference, including Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, who said he thought the integrity of the meeting was being threatened.
"If they continue this, they are going to find themselves making the conference extremely difficult," Mr. Wirth said of the Chinese organizers. "They are meeting a lot of frustration and concern from people on how they are handling this."
With Hillary Rodham Clinton scheduled to arrive in Beijing early Tuesday, Mr. Wirth and other members of the United States delegation seemed eager to defuse the crisis. Mrs. Clinton is honorary chairwoman of the American delegation to the United Nations conference, which opens on Monday and runs through Sept. 15.
In Hawaii, Calvin Mitchell, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said White House officials are "obviously following the events carefully" and added, "At this point I am unaware of any change in her schedule."
Mrs. Clinton, who is leaving from Hawaii on Sunday, plans to address the United Nations conference in Beijing on Tuesday, then speak before the forum here later in the day on women's need for better health care, political rights and economic opportunity.
Until today, organizers of the forum, which is to continue until Friday, had tried to play down the practical difficulties they have encountered. Their public turnaround and ultimatum was a remarkable shift toward a head-on confrontation with their Chinese hosts.
Many participants at outdoor workshops held under white canvas tents on the 100-acre site said security agents routinely approached the meetings with video cameras and focused closely on their faces and note pads.
Surveillance was particularly heavy at a workshop this morning where exiled Tibetan women argued with Chinese-sponsored participants from the region over human rights and environmental conditions in Tibet. Other participants said that nearly every workshop they attended was under surveillance and that some meetings at hotels had been disrupted.
"We saw that there was a pattern of surveillance, both here at the workshops and in the hotels," said Irene Santiago, executive director of the forum. "We did not want the whole security apparatus there."
The authorities have sharply cut back transportation to and from the site of the forum in Huairou, which is about 35 miles from Beijing. And today they banned all taxis from the main United Nations conference site at the Asian Games Village in Beijing, a decision one security officer said was an effort to protect delegates from unreliable taxi drivers.
In Huairou, security officers have confiscated videotapes and printed material from workshops, and stopped translations of some speeches that touched on human rights.
Ms. Santiago said these actions clearly violated an agreement signed earlier this year between United Nations and Chinese organizers that specified, among other things, that there be no security presence on the forum site.
But it was not clear what action the leadership committee would take. With many participants no doubt reluctant to abandon the forum, and others exasperated by the behavior of the Chinese agents, Ms. Santiago was careful to say no decision would be made before noon on Sunday, when the committee's 19 members are scheduled to meet.
With a forum so deeply focused on free speech and free movement taking place in a country where political activity is so tightly controlled by Communist Party authorities, such a confrontation was perhaps inevitable.
"The Chinese have to understand that the idea of a U.N. conference is the free flow of ideas," said Melinda Kimble, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for international organizations.
Yet Chinese leaders are unused to allowing any kind of unscripted political gathering, concerned that open discussion might include direct criticism of Communist Party rule, a point of sensitivity that often seems to verge on paranoia.
The officer in charge of security here, Zhang Kemian, insisted that he had mobilized "a certain number of police officers" to guard against criminals but, in an apparent concession, he said he had reduced the number "now that security has been initially insured."
Mr. Zhang also asked for patience.
"Although Chinese police have accumulated experience in providing security services for large international sports and cultural events, it is the first time for them to cover an event as large as the current one," Mr. Zhang said, according to a report from the New China News Agency.
"It takes time for the police to adapt to the circumstances and improve their mode of work so as better to meet the requirements of large international conferences."
Most participants at the forum seemed eager to concentrate on the issues facing the conference, like violence against women, and expressed frustration with the distraction caused by the security agents.
"It's really ridiculous," said Marilyn Golden, of the Disabled Rights Education and Defense Fund in San Francisco. "But now that we've started to complain about access for the disabled, they've been increasing surveillance on us, too, coming up and taking pictures at our meetings."
Dorothy Q. Thomas, director of the women's rights project for Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, said a man who appeared to be a security agent leaned over her shoulder to film her notes at a workshop on human rights.
"We want to speak openly with Chinese women about conditions they encounter in this country," said Ms. Thomas. "But in an atmosphere like this, these women are terrified to come forward, and this is happening under the umbrella of the United Nations at a conference on the advancement of women's rights."
Repeating a charge that many other women voiced, Ms. Thomas said conditions at Huairou were the worst she had experienced at any of the many conferences she has attended.
"That the United Nations has allowed this to occur is appalling," she said.
Mr. Wirth, the Undersecretary of State, also laid responsibility for persuading the Chinese to cooperate squarely at the feet of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations Secretary General, whose staff announced that he would not attend the conference because he has the flu.
"It's very important that we have the U.N. at the highest level weighing in very heavily," said Mr. Wirth. "It's something that Boutros-Ghali must do with the Chinese."
Mr. Wirth said he had met with Mr. Boutros-Ghali's representative, Ismat Kittani, who said flaws in the agreement over logistics signed between the United Nations and the Chinese had caused the troubles. Efforts to reach Mr. Kittani were unsuccessful.
Mr. Wirth added that he had canceled plans to accompany Mrs. Clinton to Mongolia later in the week because of the likelihood that the conference would require constant, high-level attention.
Many of the men filming and harassing participants wore participants' passes. Ms. Santiago, the forum's executive director, said there was no way to tell how many of the 5,000 registered participants in the forum from China were actually working as security agents.
Another 23,500 participants from overseas have registered for the forum, and about 4,000 journalists are also attending.
Throughout the forum, women expressed frustration with the Chinese hosts.
"As you can see, they are really against human rights," said Afaf Mahfouz, a representative from the Congo. "We want to protect human rights."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
The Tax Code Heads Into the Operating Room

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
FLAT tax, consumption tax, value-added tax, national sales tax, unlimited savings allowance tax: The jargon is largely new, but the underlying politics are familiar. Many Americans loathe the personal income tax, and influential lawmakers are beating the bushes for a winning replacement.
While President Clinton has yet to offer his own ideas on what may well be a central issue in the 1996 campaign, just about every other important politician in Washington is backing one of the several tax overhaul plans floating around today. 
 These plans, Republican and Democratic alike, share a political imperative: They seek to soothe taxpayer anger by promising to make the tax code both simpler and fairer. But while the leading Democratic plan, sponsored by the House minority leader, Dick Gephardt, would retain the familiar income tax while seeking to simplify it, the three main Republican proposals would go much further, either eliminating the income tax altogether or utterly changing the way the Government collects money from its citizens. And as with most everything in Congress these days, it is the Republicans who are driving the debate.
Though their plans are quite different, they share a central premise: No longer would Americans be taxed on all that they earn -- from work, savings or investments. Instead, they would be taxed only on what they spend, which tends to place a proportionally greater burden on those least able to pay. Each plan's champion predicts lower interest rates and an economic windfall from encouraging Americans to invest more for the future and allowing them to keep more of the extra dollars they could earn by working harder and smarter.
The most visible of the new tax plans -- and the one with the greatest political momentum behind it -- is the flat tax, proposed by Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. The Government would tax salaries and benefits at a single low rate and eliminate all remaining itemized deductions, from mortgage interest to state and local taxes. Interest, dividends and capital gains would be tax free for individuals. After allowing for a generous personal exemption for each taxpayer, Mr. Armey contends that he could replace the current system with a single 20 percent rate, falling to 17 percent after two years. Others argue that the flat rate would have to be higher, at least 21 percent, and perhaps more.
A competing plan offered by Representative William Archer of Texas, the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee and advocated by Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is also a presidential candidate, would replace the income tax completely with a national sales tax, which would probably have to add about 18 percent to the price of all goods and services to collect as much revenue as the current system.
Two Senate barons, Pete Domenici, the New Mexico Republican, and the Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn, are offering yet another alternative. The plan, known as the U.S.A. Tax, would keep the familiar progressively higher step-by-step income tax rates and retain popular deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions. But it would provide an unlimited exemption for all savings and add a new limited deduction for outlays on education.
This week, Senator Bob Dole, the leading Republican candidate for President, is expected to join the debate by endorsing the concept of a flat tax, although it is unclear whether he will support any specific plan.
"The general approach now is, 'Don't bother me with the details -- we'll worry about that later,' " explained Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, a Democrat who was a principal architect of the major 1986 rewrite of the tax code that sharply lowered rates and eliminated many preferences for special interest groups.
The Republicans' proposals, to be sure, would address the public's continuing call for a still-simpler tax system that would eliminate many economic distortions caused by special tax advantages. And that alone should save tens, perhaps hundreds, of billions of dollars now wasted on recordkeeping, accountants and misdirected investments. Just as clearly, though, the plans would dramatically shuffle wealth and privilege in ways certain to delight some and infuriate others.
And those shifts raise troubling questions that many advocates of a thorough tax overhaul skate over lightly:
* Is it possible to reconcile the effort to boost growth and investment -- which inevitably would provide greater direct benefits to those affluent enough to save substantial sums -- with the public demand for fair treatment?
* Would eliminating the deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes -- currently worth more than a $80 billion a year to homeowners -- send the economy reeling into a recession? By one widely circulated estimate, that move alone would wipe out as much as $1.7 trillion in home equity by depressing real estate values on average by 15 percent.
* What would be the impact on consumer spending -- which accounts for more than three-fifths of overall economic activity -- of shifting to a tax system designed to promote savings at the expense of current consumption?
* How would charities, state and local governments, and a host of other entities that have come to depend on tax incentives respond to the loss of those provisions?
* And what would investors do once they could sell their stocks without worrying about capital gains and tax-free municipal bonds would no longer enjoy any tax advantage over Treasury bonds?
None of these questions is easy to answer. Even after decades of experience, there is no consensus among experts about the impact of the current tax system. And that makes sorting out the claims and counter claims of the various proposals all that much harder.
"If you don't know where you've been," says Joel Slemrod, director of the office of policy research at the University of Michigan, "it's hard to figure where you're going."
What follows is a rundown on the three most prominent alternatives to the income tax, each of which has friends in Washington and admirers among economists. None of the proposals is likely to be enacted without substantial modification and nothing is likely to happen until after next year's Presidential election.
 
Flat Tax
 Narrowly defined, this is simply a tax with a single bracket. But since the approach was outlined more than a decade ago by Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, economists at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, Calif., it has come to mean much more.
Under the plan sponsored by Mr. Armey, all taxes on labor income would be collected from individuals and all taxes on investment income would be paid by businesses. To many economists, the clean division of taxes between individuals and businesses is one of the plan's great virtues. To those who worry more about broad issues of tax equity, though, it is one of its greatest flaws.
The personal income tax would be transformed into a wage tax with absolutely no deductions. Mr. Armey proposed a 17 percent rate, although it questionable whether that would generate as much revenue as he claims. Roger Brinner, the executive director of DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting group, estimates that a 21 percent rate would be needed to replace the revenues from the current system. The Treasury says the rate might at least temporarily have to be as high as 24 percent.
Not all wages would be taxed. The latest version of the Armey plan calls for a generous untaxed "family allowance," so that a family of four would have to earn at least $31,400 in 1996 to owe any tax at all.
Taxpayers would not keep track of mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charity, medical expenditures or retirement accounts because the deductions would be eliminated. "Hundreds of thousands of pages of tax law, rules, guidelines, and decisions could be ripped up and thrown away," states Raymond Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival Foundation.
This would be no small feat. Mr. Slemrod estimates that it now costs 10 cents to collect a dollar through the income tax, a waste of tens of billions of dollars in taxpayers' time and outlays for enforcement.
But any such wholesale elimination of tax deductions would generate powerful political opposition. Costly medical expenses that are uninsured would no longer be deductible. Wealthy philanthropists would no longer see their generosity rewarded. And local politicians would scream about the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes, which would only add insult to injury to the loss they would suffer from no longer enjoying a tax-free borrowing advantage over Federal Government bonds.
Most important in political terms, the flat tax would almost inevitably cut the value of existing houses, so that its effects would spread far beyond the 30 million homeowners who currently claim the mortgage deduction. DRI/McGraw-Hill, which did research commissioned by the National Association of Realtors, estimated that average home values would drop 12 to 15 percent, even assuming that mortgage interest rates decline by 2 percentage points due to the broader economic effects of the tax change. The plunge would be much steeper if interest rates do not fall as much as predicted.
Advocates of the flat tax maintain that is an exaggeration. And Mr. Armey contends that the long run economic gains from his plan should outweigh any initial decline. "The American dream is not just about owning a home," Mr. Armey said. "It's about getting your kids out of it."
But getting that point across to a vast homeowning middle class woul not be easy.
That's one reason Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, another Republican Presidential campaigner, has proposed to retain at least a partial deduction for mortgages (only the interest on the first $100,000 would be deductible) and allow for charitable contributions up to $2,500. But those tokens may do little to defuse opposition from real estate agents and charities, while at least partially undermining the appealing simplicity at the heart of Mr. Armey's plan.
 
National Sales Tax
 All Americans understand that a trip to the store usually requires a tithe to the state at the checkout counter. Senator Lugar, as a key element of his Presidential campaign, hopes to exploit that familiarity by dropping the income tax in favor of a national sales tax. And although he has yet to put a formal plan on the table, Senator Lugar has a powerful ally in Mr. Archer, whose committee must originate all tax legislation and who says "the time has come to tear the income tax out by its roots."
The closest thing to a fleshed-out plan comes from Stephen Moore, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute. He proposes an 18 percent tax on retail sales of all goods and services. To avoid double taxation, purchases by businesses would be exempt -- much as they are today in the states.
To Mr. Moore, the biggest appeal of such an approach is that it would seem to put a stake through the heart of the government agency most Americans cannot escape: the I.R.S. The politics of tax reform is "driven by the civil liberties issue," he said. "Americans want Government out of their lives."
The I.R.S. would be abolished; states would be compensated for collecting the Federal sales tax on top of their own. To help compensate for the fact that sales taxes represent a disproportionate burden on the poor, every American would get an annual $900 check -- equivalent to an exemption for $5,000 of personal expenditures.
The impact of such a sales tax on all consumer goods and services would be almost identical to that of an integrated wage and business flat tax. And all consumption choices -- everything from purchases of food to the services of divorce lawyers -- would be treated identically.
A sales tax would shift the tax burden from the rich to the middle class, since affluent people save a much larger portion of their earnings. But Lawrence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University, explains that, at least initially, a new tax on consumption would constitute a big, one-time hit on accumulated wealth.
An easy way to think of it, he suggests, is in terms of purchasing power. An 18 percent sales tax would raise the prices of all final goods and services by 18 percent, and thus reduce the value of accumulated savings when they are spent by 18 percent.
One big catch to any universal sales tax is the practical problem of collecting the money. Imagine a department store selling sweaters for $20, plus 18 percent Federal tax plus 10 percent state and local tax. Then imagine the street peddler outside selling the same sweater without the 28 percent tax. "There is no way you can run a sales tax at that level without draconian enforcement," predicts Mr. Slemrod.
He suggests the obvious fix: a "value added tax" that collects revenue from every transaction in the purchasing chain from seed corn to corn flakes. But the V.A.T., while universally adopted in Europe and relied upon by nearly every advanced industrial state outside the United States, has never enjoyed political support here.
Other pitfalls could doom the sales tax or its value-added variant. It would be difficult to extend sales taxes to traditionally exempt areas such as rent, groceries and medical care. And the sales tax could be pecked to death with small exceptions: Would Congress be willing to tax kidney dialysis machines or Salvation Army uniforms?
 
U.S.A. Tax
 The simplicity and straightforward appeal of the flat tax and the sales tax, if not all their consequences, are obvious. Not so the Unlimited Savings Allowance or U.S.A. tax, a combination of a deductions-loaded personal income tax and a value-added tax collected by business.
But unlike the other radical alternatives to the income tax, it is a full blown legislative proposal, not a gleam in the eye of policy intellectuals. "The U.S.A. Tax is the only tax reform plan that is close to a living, breathing tax code," said Arthur Hall, a senior economist with the Tax Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington.
The U.S.A. tax starts with the familiar personal income tax. Wage and investment income, plus proceeds from insurance and annuities, are taxed at progressive rates ranging from 19 percent to 40 percent.
But the blow is softened by a fat standard exemption and host of new preferences. Not only would the deductions for mortgage interest and charity continue, it would also allow taxpayers to deduct net annual additions to savings accounts, mutual funds and the like. Education expenses could be partially deducted. And once tax liability is figured, taxpayers would get to take a credit equal to their share of the payroll tax for Social Security and Medicare. This effectively lowers the maximum tax rate on wages to 32 percent.
The U.S.A. Tax, while seeking to accomplish the same goal of encouraging thrift and long-term investment, lacks the simplicity of the previous two approaches. Rather than striving for neutrality among expenditures and income classes, it adds a new a preference for education and it taxes the incomes of people earning $500,000 at far higher rates than those earning $50,000. It would require taxpayers to continue to struggle with questions of defining personal income and verifying deductions.
But the U.S.A. tax plan does address an issue untouched by others by effectively eliminating the payroll tax, which many economists believe is a significant deterrent to employing unskilled workers. And it deals directly with the formidable problems of changing from one tax system to another that the other proposals ignore.
But where the flat tax appears to have grassroots appeal and the sales tax offers a direct assault on the I.R.S., the U.S.A. tax, argues Mr. Hall, is an "inside the Beltway" effort that does not enjoy much popular support outside Washington. While it would slaughter few sacred cows, it is also not likely to generate much passion among the tens of millions of Americans who see themselves as victims of the tax code.
 
 
 
Meanwhile, Business as Usual
FOR all the talk on Capitol Hill about simplifying taxes, Congress has done it again: passed a law that adds yet another line to Form 1040.
Drafts of the 1995 tax forms show a Line 53 in the "other taxes" section. It covers an obligation even the Internal Revenue Service acknowledges you'll probably ignore -- unless you're a politician or a prospect for the Cabinet.
After all those unpleasant surprises about the nannies and maids of public figures, including Gov. Pete Wilson of California and two of President Clinton's nominees for Attorney General, come next April there will be yet another schedule (H for household employment taxes) to be filled out, as well as six pages of instructions to study.
Individuals who employ a nanny, maid, gardener or other household servant and pay them more than $1,000 during 1995 are supposed to report any Federal income taxes withheld, as well as Social Security and Federal unemployment taxes, and pay those taxes when filing income tax returns.
These taxes are not deductible by the employer because they are for personal services, as opposed to a business expense. Half of the Social Security tax, and all of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act payments, come solely out of the employer's pocket.
The new law does not require individuals to withhold Federal income tax payments. Only if "your household's employee asks you to withhold Federal income tax and you agree" are Federal income taxes to be withheld and then paid by next April 15, according to the instructions.
This latest bit of "tax reform" replaces a rarely enforced law which required individuals to report payments of more than $50 made to servants in a 90-day period. The new law requires only annual filing when payments exceed $1,000 for the year.
"Basically the I.R.S. has swapped a form for reporting wages paid to household workers for a line on the 1040 and a new Form H that goes with your 1040," said Peter Berkery, Washington editor for the Research Institute of America, a tax news service.
Arthur Hall, senior economist at the Tax Foundation in Washington, said the added paperwork "is just indicative of the complexity of the tax law. As things get more and more complex there are more lines, more forms, more instructions. It's really not the fault of the I.R.S., but of the law."
The Tax Foundation estimates that Americans spend $200 billion a year filling out returns and otherwise complying with tax laws. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON
 The table referred imprecisely to the method of determining adjusted gross incomes in two examples. In calculating the adjusted gross incomes for the hypothetical taxpayers under the current law, "miscellaneous adjustments" were added to "other income" in the case of the family with $50,000; they were subtracted for the family with $300,000.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 10, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page table last Sunday with an article about proposed changes in the Federal tax code referred incorrectly to one proposal. The abbreviation in "U.S.A. Individual Income Tax" stands for unlimited savings allowance, not universal savings account.
A table with the continuation of the article, comparing potential effects of the proposals on the tax bills of several hypothetical taxpayers rendered some data incorrectly. Under the current income tax, the standard or itemized deduction for the family with no children and an adjusted gross income of $100,000 is $19,000, not $15,000. Under the flat-tax proposal, the total tax for the families with adjusted gross incomes of $50,000 and $300,000 would be $3,395 and $31,923, respectively, not $2,885 and $27,135.


GRAPHIC: The various alternatives to the current income tax would affect Americans very differently, depending on family circumstances. Two model families with similar incomes were created to determine how they would be affected by each of the major proposals. Tax rates for the examples are designed to generate about the same amount of revenue as under the curernt system.
 
MARRIED WITH CHILDREN
 
Adjusted gross income of $100,000
 
Young married couple, with two children
 
Just bought a new home and have a large mortgage
 
Receive $10,000 annually from investments and savings
 
EMPTY NESTERS
 
Adjusted gross income of $100,000
 
Older couple, with no children at home
 
Own home, with fully-paid mortgage
 
Receive $25,000 annually from investments and savings
 
CURRENT INCOME TAX
 
$8,276 -- Under the current system, this family falls into the 28 percent tax bracket. They receive a sizable deduction of $30,000 for mortgage interest and property taxes, along with other itemized deductions, which substantially reduces their tax liability.
 
$16,368 -- This family falls in the same 28 percent tax bracket. But because their home is paid for, and they have no children, their deductions and personal exemptions are smaller, which leaves them with much more taxable income.
 
FLAT TAX
Would eliminate all itemized deductions and tax all wages and benefits at a flat rate, calculated here at 20 percent.
 
$12,070 -- By eliminating all itemized deductions, particularly the deduction for interest on home loans, the flat tax would greatly increase the taxes on his family.
 
$10,960 -- This family fares very well under the flat tax because they have few deductions to lose and their income from investments and savings would no longer be taxed on the personal level.
 
U.S.A. INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX
Would keep many features of the current system but would exempt all savings and some educational expenses.
 
$8,992 -- Compared to the current system, the so-called universal savings account tax would only modestly increase the tax burden for this family.
 
$22,112 -- This family suffers the most under this proposal. The top tax rate is higher, and because they have few deductions, they end up paying much more.
 
NATIONAL SALES TAX
Would abolish the personal income tax and replace it with an 18 percent sales tax on nearly all goods and services.
 
$7,806 -- Because this family still spends a lot on its home, the tax on its other spending leaves it slightly better off.
 
$12,972 -- This family also does better under a national sales tax than under the current system. Its tax liability is still higher than that of the first family, but its tax burden is reduced more than theirs, too.

HEADLINE: Campaign '96

BYLINE: By Richard L. Berke; Richard L. Berke is the national political correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:
It's labor day weekend, when people tradition-ally just begin to grasp that a Presidential campaign is in the offing. But like it or not, the 1996 contest has been in full motion for months, and is about to burst into public consciousness.
 It may well be the longest, if not the most interminable, campaign anyone can remember, studded with pivotal events months before the customary snowy start in Iowa and New Hampshire. While the road to the White House always has dramatic twists, there will be even more this time around, thanks to tremendous changes in the primary schedule, a fitful electorate, a roster of sharp-tongued (if uninspiring) Republicans and the shadowboxing among independents. And don't forget the biggest question of all: Can the self-proclaimed Comeback Kid do it again? 
 Maybe events will unfold as forecast by those know-it-all prognosticators. Maybe Senator Bob Dole will glide to the G.O.P. nomination. Maybe President Clinton will not face a primary challenger. Maybe the Powells, the Perots and the Bradleys will chicken out.
 But Presidential campaigns never follow the script.
 "Every campaign is a door, and you don't know what's behind it when you kick it down," says James Carville, the Clinton strategist. "People are just going to find out how tough it is to run for President. And '96 is going to be the toughest of them all."
 To make it through, get to know C-Span, stop by the candidates' Internet Web sites and consider this early guide to an unusually long campaign season.
 
1995
Sept. 4
LABOR DAY
On this lazy weekend four years ago, Clinton had not yet declared his candidacy, voters were months away from even asking, "Ross who?" and President George Bush was tanned and relaxed on the 29th and final day of his vacation in Kennebunkport, Me. (Clinton is not repeating the mistake of leaving for too long; in August, he scheduled 17 days off.)
But these are fast times in Presidential politics, and the '96 race has been under way for months (years for the overeager, like Phil Gramm and Lamar Alexander). So, for the Republican hopefuls -- enticed by a weak incumbent, their party's staggering successes last year, the earlier primary dates and, to be sure, their own oversize egos -- this weekend is not so much
a kickoff as one more chance to squeeze hands at picnics in hamlets like Laconia, N.H., and Oskaloosa, Iowa, while straining to look natural in something other than a blue suit.
Although the contenders at the starting gate are not the most exciting bunch, they cannot be dubbed the "Seven Dwarfs," as were the Democratic hopefuls in 1988. For one thing, there are nine of them, give or take. Maybe the "Little Leaguers" would be more appropriate.
Here they come, in alphabetical order:
Lamar Alexander, former Governor of Tennessee. Perhaps best known for taking long walks in a red lumberjack shirt. Hopes there's a sudden yearning for a politician from outside Washington. Never mind that he worked in the Nixon White House, or was Bush's Secretary of Education. His biggest challenge, besides moving beyond the margin of error in the polls, is to convince G.O.P. voters that he's no moderate and can dish out red meat as lavishly as the others.
Patrick J. Buchanan, conservative talking head. No longer dismissed as a spoiler and has had a more successful summer than his opponents. But even a few extra percentage points doesn't mean much when you're 40 points behind Dole.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. The only candidate most Republican voters have heard of. His strategy: Say or do anything to preserve his lead all the way to the convention in San Diego. As he told prominent Republicans this summer, "I'm willing to be another Ronald Reagan if that's what you want."
Representative Bob Dornan of California. Enlivened early campaign events with his rabid far-right pitch. But don't count on him to last much longer. He says he may bow out by the end of October and seek re-election because Gingrich needs him in the House. "Newt comes up to me and says, 'Don't do that to me,' " Dornan recalls. (Translation: He'll get to the White House in his dreams.)
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. Impresses everyone with his fund-raising and organizational prowess and his ability to stick to his message of fiscal conservatism. Despite an impressive showing at the Iowa straw poll in August, he still needs to prove he didn't peak 18 months too soon. Even he raises the obvious: Is he too unappealing to be President?
Alan Keyes. Best orator of the bunch. He is not viewed as a serious contender, probably not even by himself. A former State Department official, this African-American may be satisfied to come out of the early going with improved ratings for his radio program.
Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana. His Howdy Doody mien is a yawner. Just ask the audience at Perot's United We Stand America conference in Dallas last month, where he devoted his speech to the important yet unriveting threat of the international proliferation of plutonium. Best shot is if country finds itself in a war and he can show off his foreign policy acumen. Or maybe his un-politician-like style will draw votes. The Paul Tsongas of 1996?
Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Most Republicans still scratch their heads over his notion that a pro-choice foe of the Christian Coalition can win. "Arlen, in a Republican primary, would come in some distance behind Hillary Clinton," says Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois, a leading abortion opponent.
Gov. Pete Wilson of California. Big problem: No one can figure out which state he would win before California. Bigger problem: He even lags behind Dole in California polls. But after all, this is Pete Wilson, Governor of the most populous state, the man Richard Nixon predicted would win the nomination. But then again, Nixon, hedging his bets, told Dole he would win.
 
Sept. 6
AN EXPANDING FIELD?
Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. -- he prefers the more proletarian "Steve" -- announces about now whether he will run in Republican primaries. Forbes, who is the head of his family's publishing empire, fancies himself a "pro-growth, pro-opportunity" Republican who wants a flat tax.
 He's articulate and well read -- and looking for a niche in the Republican Party as a thinking man's Perot. Forbes's biggest asset is not his knowledge of issues and surely not his lackluster speaking style but, well, his assets. Like Perot, Forbes can plow millions into the contest. The company's 727, called the Capitalist Tool, is at his disposal. Forbes's greatest contribution may be that he gives the Jack Kemp supply-side gold-standard crowd a horse to root for.
While Forbes weighed his decision, a poor man's millionaire, Morry Taylor of Grosse Pointe, Mich., declared. He, too, wants to buy his way into the primaries. Taylor, C.E.O. of Titan Wheel International Inc., which makes wheels and tires, tells voters that if they love Perot, they'll love him.
There's one more G.O.P. contender, Arthur Fletcher, a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. He doesn't have deep pockets, but he thinks someone needs to counter the other candidates' efforts to scrap affirmative action. Thus far, Fletcher -- the other African-American in the race -- has gone largely unnoticed.
 
Sept. 8
CHRISTIAN COALITION ROAD TO VICTORY CONFERENCE
Once again, Republican candidates will try to top one another in the "holier than the other choices" department as they display their pro-school-prayer, pro-family bona fides. Don't expect disagreement over issues at this event. The Goldwater-Rockefeller-style rancor is a thing of the past. Instead, the competition will be over who can pronounce the conservative dogmas most quickly -- and most convincingly.
This Washington event will have its share of political blood sport. Dole may try to impress upon the audience that his nomination is inevitable. Will the self-described happily married Lugar elaborate on his criticism of Dole, Gramm and Wilson for their divorces? See if Alexander tries to clarify his less-than-fervent opposition to abortion, or if Gramm attacks Hollywood (his investment two decades ago in the dubious film project "Beauty Queens" notwithstanding).
This might be the time for a contender to make a splash by pledging to pick an anti-abortion running mate, though at the risk of being pegged a panderer. Also look to see if Pat Robertson or Ralph Reed, who have not endorsed anyone, hint about their favorite.
 
Sept. 15
BOOK PRIMARY
Colin L. Powell's memoir, "My American Journey," may already be on sale. A book tour has never before served as the prelude for a White House run, but a race of some sort is already on between Powell and Gingrich. The central question is whether Powell's book will outsell Gingrich's "To Renew America," which catapulted to the top of The New York Times's best-seller list in July. "I'm glad it's coming out weeks after mine," Gingrich says.
The book tours explain why Gingrich and Powell have flirted so long about running for President. They get free publicity and can gauge interest in their candidacies -- not to mention sell a few books.
Watch Powell's carefully orchestrated public relations offensive, and see if he discloses any opinions. Word has it that despite his admiration of Reagan, Powell reveals in his book that he voted for J.F.K. and L.B.J. So will he let Barbara Walters in on whether he's a Democrat or a Republican?
People close to Powell say he wants to be President, and make history as the first black President. If he runs, it will most likely be as an independent. He's confident, they say, of reaching the 19 percent Perot threshold, but is not sure how much beyond that he could get.
Adding to the uncertainty, Powell, as a career military officer, is accustomed to structure; Presidential campaigns, particularly independent ones, are plan-as-you-go affairs. Besides, Powell knows that if he runs, he'll never be as popular as he is now.
Yet the media-assisted groundswell builds. "I'm not promoting his candidacy," says Tom Brokaw, the NBC anchorman. "But to have somebody come out of the military ranks -- that would certainly stir the blood." Now that Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey is toying with an independent bid, some in the press have concocted an even more stirring scenario: a Powell-Bradley "dream ticket."
(Or, how about Bradley-Powell?)
To that end, Bradley is jumping into the book derby. The yet-to-be-titled volume on his last two decades is due out in January.
Even Dan Quayle (who's playfully threatening to pop back into the race) is toiling on a new book about -- what else? -- values. And Perot is already hawking his latest, "Intensive Care: We Must Save Medicare and Medicaid Now."
The more the press ruminates over these aspiring author-politicos -- and their orchestrated indecisions over running -- the better for Dole. The distractions make it less likely that any of Dole's G.O.P. challengers will get noticed.
Who, for example, is eagerly anticipating, or has even heard of, "We Know What to Do," Lamar Alexander's book about his travels across America, which also appears in bookstores this month?
 
Sept. 17
ANNUAL HARKIN STEAK FRY
Forget the steak. See if Clinton gets seared. This big Democratic event on the Warren County fairgrounds in Indianola, Iowa, sponsored by Senator Tom Harkin, is the place to be to pick up rumblings of a challenge to the President. If there are bumper stickers that proclaim "Bradley '96," look out. And note the number of cars plastered with Clinton's name. (Of course, don't use that as the sole gauge of early enthusiasm for his re-election. Stickers may be a better sign of the quality of Clinton's advance work than anything else.) Clinton himself will be in Des Moines in October for the annual Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner.
 
Oct. 4
POPE ARRIVES IN UNITED STATES
Expect Clinton to meet with him, and G.O.P. hopefuls to insert themselves into a photo op. But candidates should anticipate tense moments. Pope John Paul II is not one to resist pressing his tough line against abortion at a time when Republicans are trying to play down the intraparty angst on the matter. No one is more outspoken on abortion than the Pope. Except for Buchanan, Dornan and Keyes.
 
Oct. 15
PUTTING THE CARDS ON THE TABLE
Candidates' third-quarter finance reports are due at the Federal Election Commission. See who is close to collecting the magic $20 million that some candidates boasted was necessary to wage a full-fledged primary campaign.
And just as important, who has already frittered away millions on large staffs and television time.
"It's a lot like poker," says Dave Carney, a New Hampshire strategist for Dole. "Now it's time to show your hands. It will be clearer who's bluffing and who's not."
Easy for him to say. As the front-runner and majority leader, Dole is a magnet for access-hungry Republicans. Likewise, cash is the least of Gramm's problems.
The biggest tests are for Wilson, who needs to prove his vaunted fund-raising skills at the Presidential level, and for Alexander, who must show the payoff for luring fat-cat Bush and Reagan fund-raisers.
Any camp that has not pulled in at least $15 million by now fails the expectations game.
But candidates with smaller reserves, like Specter, Lugar and Buchanan, are out to prove that the $20 million figure is all hype -- and was part of Gramm's early ploy to scare the Quayles and the Cheneys and the Kemps out of the race. These candidates believe that for the first time in modern Republican politics a cash-deficient campaign can win the nomination.
On the Democratic side, those curious about Jesse Jackson's White House intentions should check to see if he's paid off the remaining $150,000 debt from his 1988 campaign.
 
Nov. 7
OFF-YEAR ELECTION
The municipal elections will be enlivened by City Vote, a nonpartisan straw poll in which voters in more than 20 cities -- including Boston, Tucson, Newark and Spokane -- will be asked their preference for President. The most obvious beneficiary of this unofficial national urban primary is Jesse Jackson, who has made a career of campaigning in urban America. Don't believe the spin about the outcome of this month's Governors races in Louisiana, Kentucky and Mississippi as portending the outcome next November. These races have little significance beyond their borders.
 
Nov. 13
D.L.C.'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE
Watch, on this day at least, for Clinton to embrace the Democratic Leadership Council's agenda for welfare and economic reforms, insisting that he never abandoned the moderate group that helped kick off his last campaign. But will Al From, the group's chief agitator, give up on Clinton once and for all, discouraged by his cozying up to the party's liberal wing?
 
Nov. 15
DAY OF RECKONING?
The Government could hit the debt ceiling and run out of cash. Republicans will dare Clinton to go along with their huge spending cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and welfare or to use his rarely unsheathed veto pen -- thereby potentially shutting down the entire Government. This could be the showdown of the year in Congress. But no one knows which side wins. Clinton could reveal some spine by standing up to Republicans and thwarting the extremists, or he could be blamed for another outbreak of gridlock.
While the budgetary brinkmanship offers an intermission from the G.O.P. nominating derby, these battles could spill into the Presidential sweepstakes. Depending on the outcome, the Republicans might look harsh -- or heroic -- for making good on their promises to slash the budget. Yet if they fail to pass a budget that moves toward balance, they risk looking like weasels on their prime campaign promise.
The jockeying will also be played out within the G.O.P., where Dole and Gramm are vying to get more credit for delivering to conservatives. The early line is that Dole, as majority leader, can point to more concrete accomplishments. But Gramm, unburdened by having to wheedle and compromise, scores for staking the purest conservative positions.
 
Nov. 18
'PRESIDENCY III' STRAW POLL
Tom Slade, Florida Republican chairman, calls his party's straw poll in Orlando "the single most important event in American politics this year." Hyperbole aside, it should carry more weight than most of the dozens of straw polls being conducted. Some candidates have hired people to make blind calls to pack the event. Florida is taking on newfound importance because it is the most delegate-rich state in which no candidate has an obvious edge. Winning could give a candidate the perception that he's catching on. Larry King, not about to cede his position from 1992 as television's grand political pooh-bah of the candidate Q. and A., has all the contenders on an expanded version of his show the eve of the straw poll.
 
REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS MEET
The star of the Republican Governors Association meeting in Nashua, N.H., won't be any of the Presidential candidates but Gov. Stephen Merrill. For months, the contenders have been courting him for an endorsement, and unless he has already thrown his support to someone, the meeting here will allow him to savor the national spotlight.
Merrill's backing is critical because he is popular and has a seasoned organization in the state. He could make a big splash by endorsing this weekend. But he may want to get a better read on who's likely to win before he makes a move. Expect him to pick anyone but Gramm: Merrill is still steamed over the Texan's antics to win support in Arizona and Delaware, even as those states were threatening New Hampshire's cherished spot as the first primary state.
Alexander, in particular, hopes for a surprise endorsement to get him some attention. But Dole may be a safer choice. "I'm not trying to be coy, but I'm going to be with a conservative," Merrill says coyly. "And with a conservative who can win." So much for narrowing the possibilities. Keep your eyes open for back-room deals. Vice President Merrill?
 
Nov. 19
ONE MORE CHANCE
Missed out on the Merrill endorsement? There's still The Manchester Union Leader. Best bet is that the right-wing paper will endorse Buchanan, whose columns it published for years, and who got the nod in 1992. But Gramm has a fighting chance.
 
Dec. 15
DO-OR-DIE DEADLINE
Last chance for contenders to pony up $1,000 and sign a declaration of candidacy to get their names on New Hampshire's primary ballot.
In a rerun of the "waiting for Mario" scene four years ago, expect hopeful Republicans to wait, perhaps in vain, for Powell or Gingrich or their ideal candidate to enter the race. And Clinton will find out once and for all if Jackson, or another prominent Democrat, will compete in the primaries.
There are more potential surprises on the G.O.P. side. If Dole's lead in the polls has eroded by now because of fumbles or if people grow tired of him -- and his opponents aren't gaining steam -- leading Republicans (and the Limbaughs of the world) are likely to press for Gingrich. "There's not a lot of excitement out there," grouses Bill Bennett, the values maven and a former Secretary of Education. "We're in a revolutionary period in Congress, but we do not have a revolutionary in the race."
Just the entry line Gingrich wants to hear. Now that the deadline is upon him, can Gingrich resist the temptation and remain Speaker, the job he always wanted? Talk-radio hosts on both sides are panting for a Newt run. "I can have fun with Bob Dole," says Jim Hightower, a Democrat and Texas Agriculture Commissioner turned radio jock. "But Newt is manna from heaven."
Fat chance, Jim. Gingrich is well aware of the polls showing that even many G.O.P. primary voters (including his own wife) think he should stay put. His backers advance a more alluring scenario: that Gingrich is secretly hoping Clinton will be re-elected so he can stay King of the Hill and King of the Republicans, and position himself for the open White House contest in 2000.
But the Newt Presidential tease is not likely to end if he doesn't run. Count on him to float the prospect that if there's a brokered convention, in which the nominee is chosen in negotiations in San Diego, he will be available.
 
Dec. 19
WHO'S IN CHARGE?
Even if Clinton has announced his campaign team, see if he can stick with it. If Dick Morris, Clinton's consultant-of-the-moment, is still hot, others in the White House will be troubled, but it will be a sign of stability. Clinton should know better than to dally; Bush thought he didn't need to rev up his re-election effort until late in the game, and, well, it never really revved up.
But no matter who the faces are, something of a re-election strategy should have emerged by now. Count on Clinton to present himself as the only bulwark against Republican extremism. One reason Clinton has to demonize Republicans is that he does not dare run on some of the issues that were central to his campaign in 1992. Forget health care. And national service. And the notion that Government can do more to help you.
As Clinton struggles to find his message, look to see how the White House, the re-elect campaign and the Democratic National Committee vie for Clinton's attention. But as they compete over campaign strategy, they may be trumped by Hillary.
 
Dec. 23
WILD CARD!
In American politics, it is always necessary to expect the unexpected. Some real-life events inevitably intrude on every candidate's painstakingly plotted calendar. Be prepared for a bimbo eruption, a heart attack, a surprise withdrawal or more trouble with Bosnia, China or Iraq. And don't forget the long-awaited special counsel's Whitewater report. Will there be an unanticipated smoking gun (or maybe just a slightly warm gun with a smudged fingerprint)? If that doesn't make waves, there's always next month's publication of James Stewart's "Blood Sport," an examination of Whitewater.
Republicans will no doubt try to use the three W's against Clinton -- Whitewater, Waco and Women.
But Gary Hart advises his fellow Democrat not to look back: "He would be the first person to say: 'I'm not Winston Churchill. I'm Bill Clinton, and this is who I am. I am not being measured against God. I'll do the best I can and maybe that's better than Bob Dole.' "
Still, the Republicans are itching to get nasty. Alex Castellanos, Gramm's media adviser, is only half-kidding in saying that Clinton is "going to try to expand his lead on female voters, one woman at a time."

CHRISTMAS EVE
If grumpy lawmakers are still being serenaded with Christmas carols in the corridors of the Capitol, it means they are still unable to resolve thorny issues like the budget and Medicare. In that case, Dole risks being blamed for presiding over a do-nothing Senate -- even while his rivals were free to prowl the hamlets of New Hampshire, extolling the need to change the way Washington works. Meanwhile, Clinton remains by the Rose Garden, unmuddied by the discord up the street.

AD WARS
The first contest, the Iowa caucuses, is tentatively set for 45 days from now, and campaigns are now entitled to cheaper television advertising rates. With the rate change, the ad wars enter a more intense phase. Most campaigns are likely to stay on the air from now until the voting in Iowa.
As much as the experts talk about shorter attention spans and a restless electorate, don't count on that being reflected in the ads. Television ads are expected to drone on longer and have more beef. Ad campaigns will start earlier, with some mimicking Perot's successful 30-minute infomercials.
For the first time, Presidential campaigns will do battle in cyberspace. Watch for direct-mail solicitations to decline. Instead, campaigns are targeting donors and spreading their messages on their home pages. "We've had over 70,000 visits to our Internet site," says Mike Murphy, Alexander's chief strategist. "That's as big as some caucuses."

NEW YEAR'S DAY
The real world doesn't tune in to Presidential politics until the snow hits New Hampshire -- and sometimes not even then. Now, in the dead of winter, if you don't pay attention, you could miss the primaries. That's because the '96 nominating sweepstakes might be compared to a shotgun wedding or, as Rich Bond, a Dole adviser, less delicately puts it, "a Presidential quickie."
The point is: Expectations have been building for months, even years. But because so many states have moved up their primary dates, in an effort to make themselves more vital to the process, the whole enterprise could end up being a five-week blur of commercials, debates and meet-and-greets. Thus, what seems like the longest campaign may feature the shortest primary season.
There's no time for candidates to make mistakes (or, for that matter, to capitalize on the mistakes of others). No more time for campaign managers to stage phony focus groups to prove to the restless candidate that, yes, there is a groundswell for his candidacy. And no time to raise money; that's why everyone scrambled to stockpile as much as possible last year.
Since so many states are holding primaries in rapid succession, many on the same day, the campaign will be nationalized far earlier than ever before. With candidates having little time to stump in each state, let alone delve into local issues, don't expect major tussles like the past ones over the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire. Compounding the swift pace is that in delegate-dense states like Texas, New York and California, Republicans have winner-take-all primaries -- the victor reaps all the delegate spoils.
If the front-runner doesn't stumble, he could knock off his rivals fast. Just the same, if a dark horse takes off, he could be unstoppable. Gary Hart, for one, might have used his 1984 victory in New Hampshire against Walter Mondale to catapult himself to the Democratic nomination.
"Suppose Lamar Alexander wins New Hampshire," says Bill Schneider, a political analyst. "All of a sudden, he's on the national stage. The press hasn't examined him with care. There's no time for the voters to find out who he is. But he could sweep the primaries. Suddenly, he's nominated, and the Republicans don't know who he is."
They would find out but quick. There's nothing like a new face to get the press, and the Democrats, to pounce. They'll seize on everyone from the candidate's second-grade teacher to his date at the prom.
 
Jan. 13
IOWA DEBATES
The Des Moines Register holds one of the first major debates, or, more accurately, tear-down-the-front-runner sessions. If Dole is still ahead in the polls, his rivals will struggle for the No. 2 spot -- ridiculing him as a faux conservative and a compromiser too crotchety to be President. But it's hard for his opponents to set themselves apart because they are pronouncing essentially the same positions: cutting taxes, reducing Government and emphasizing family values. That may leave them little else other than personal attacks.
Dole has history on his side. Unlike the fratricide-prone Democrats, Republican primary voters are far more disciplined in coalescing around their front-runner. In every election since Eisenhower, the Republican nomination has been captured by an established party figure who had run before, had been nominated for President or Vice President or had served in one of those offices.
The trouble usually arises when the party is split between its heart and mind, when G.O.P. voters really want a particular candidate but end up throwing their allegiance behind another contender they think has a better chance of winning. Consider 1976: Many Republicans said their heart told them Reagan but their head told them Ford. And in 1992 in New Hampshire, many Republicans identified more with Buchanan even though they knew he did not have a shot against Bush. In both of those races, the fractured Republicans went on to defeat in November.
The challenge for Dole, then, is to head off a hearts-and-minds split and not let anyone else outflank him. It's a tricky situation because the nominee will ultimately have to attract swing voters who are more moderate.
But Dole's opponents predicate their campaigns on the belief that either Dole will falter or they will somehow capture the imaginations, and votes, of Republicans. "We refer to that as the Wile E. Coyote school of politics," says Nelson Warfield, Dole's spokesman. "They think that Dole's going to stumble and slip. But like the Road Runner, he keeps foiling them."
Rival camps spin all sorts of scenarios as to how Dole could collapse. His famed temper might rear itself again. Or his age could slow him down. Or voters might reject him for pandering to the right. The press, to be sure, will encourage a spirited competition. Gramm, for one, cites the news media's thirst for melodrama. "Let's face it," Gramm says, staring down a reporter. "You're going to help create this race. And in the end, this is going to be a nail biter. And if you want to look very clever, you ought to start saying, 'My political instinct tells me that Gramm, through sheer hard work and lots of good grass-roots activism, is going to win this race.' "
Indeed, Peter Jennings, the ABC anchorman, says his biggest fear is "the boredom factor" of a Dole-Clinton match-up. "The notion of doing Bob Dole again," he says,
"is very challenging to a political report." But don't count on the press to look to Gramm. Jennings, for one, dreams of a Powell, plus maybe a Perot, to liven up his broadcast. "I'd be delighted," he says. "We'd cover the hell out of it."

NATIONAL ISSUES CONVENTION
To find out what people really want from their elected officials, a representative sampling of 600 voters nationwide will gather at the University of Texas at Austin to question Presidential candidates in programs televised by the Public Broadcasting Service.
More important than eliciting answers from candidates, over four days these forums may put a face on the American voter of '96. The question can be boiled down to one of restlessness. Are voters as dissatisfied and dispirited with Clinton as the '94 election seemed to suggest? Or are they disappointed with what the Republicans have wrought, and willing to keep Clinton? Or are they still searching for another savior, an independent perhaps?

The Next Wave In Mega-Retail: The Global Deli

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Sooner or later, it was bound to happen.
First came the invasion by the big suburban-style retailers like Home Depot, Toys 'R' Us, Pathmark, Bradlees, Staples, Herman's, Crate and Barrel, Tops, Sports Authority and Bed, Bath and Beyond. 
 Now comes the ultimate New York response. The mega-deli.
It runs a full city block -- enter on 34th Street and exit on 33d, if you wish. To tickle the taste buds of a gorgeous mosaic, its menu has a global stretch from pizza to fried plantains to sushi.
Formally known as Penn Plaza Deli and Restaurant, it opened in May in a vacant bank office on the east side of Eighth Avenue, opposite Penn Station and the main post office.
Unlike its claustrophobic ancestors with cramped aisles and cluttered shelves, the mega-deli has 6,000 square feet spacious aisles, multiple serving stations, wood and tile decor, piped-in music and large television sets. A blocklong counter with stools and adjacent tables seat 100.
"The variety is incredible, from Mongolian barbecue to whatever speciality you want," said David Morrison, who works nearby in publishing and comes for lunch.
Open 24 hours a day, Penn Plaza Deli has 50 workers and was two years in the planning, said Suk Hun Chung, its president. The site was picked for the nearby office buildings, 34th Street retail corridor and hub of commuter rail, subway and bus lines. Most customers are local workers, travelers and shoppers. Mr. Chung hopes for a boost when Kmart opens a store down the block on 34th.
The owners expanded on their experience at other delis to create the new format, said Chung Hoon Shin, the manager. He described the concept: "Have the best food and the biggest place. We have everything so you don't have to go to a lot of different places."
About the only customer they don't cater to is the indecisive diner, for whom the mega-deli would be tormenting. A ham and cheese sandwich or Japanese udon noodles? Maybe the Cajun grilled chicken, the smoked shrimp and crab salad, the rotisserie chicken or the ribs? There are separate stands for sushi, the charcoal grill, the big Mongolian cooking drum and the pastries, among other choices.Prices are moderate: $1.50 for a slice of pizza and daily lunch specials for $4 and $5.
The owners say business has been slow to build. But a sampling of customers gave positive reviews. "I love it," said Frank Jenkins of White Plains, who works in the insurance business. "I get off the train every morning and have breakfast here."
Larry Krizan, an economic development consultant from Albany waiting for an Amtrak train, wandered in for a snack.. "It's like everything in New York," he said. "It's big and busy and has lots of interesting choices." BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
WHO WILL RUN THE FROG HOSPITAL? By Lorrie Moore. Warner, $11.99. 
A woman coming to the end of her 30's and possibly the end of her marriage looks back on the bond she and her best friend shared when they were both 15. Her story is "a sad, witty, disillusioned fairy tale," Caryn James said here last year, and Ms. Moore's "richest work yet."
 
DAISY BATES IN THE DESERT By Julia Blackburn. Vintage Departures, $12.
 She was difficult and determined, an almost compulsive liar and a wandering soul who finally found peace only in the bleakest regions of Australia. Daisy Bates, an Irish self-taught anthropologist who lived among the aborigines from 1913 to 1934, was not an easy person to capture, but Julia Blackburn has given her substance by searching for herself among the fragments of her subject's life. She "has given us both a fascinating exercise in biography and a rare, intimate glimpse into the biographer's imagination," Linda Simon wrote in the Book Review in 1994. Vintage Departures has also reissued the account of a woman's more recent journey into the heart of Australia. TRACKS, by Robyn Davidson ($12), chronicles the author's traversal of 1,700 miles of her native country's outback, which she made in 1977, in the company of four camels and a dog. In 1981 Sarah Ferrell, writing in The New York Times, called Ms. Davidson "a lively stylist" whose "analyses of her states of mind . . . are both convincing and engrossing." Australia is just as powerful a presence in the work of Rodney Hall, whose YANDILLI TRILOGY (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16) takes place during the country's colonial era. "The Second Bridegroom," the first novel in the collection, is narrated by one of the slave laborers who tamed Australia's wilderness, a young British convict. In 1991 our reviewer, Judith Grossman, praised "the prodigal energy and ebullience of Mr. Hall's writing." In "The Grisly Wife" the storyteller is Catherine Byrne, an English missionary who came to Australia with her husband, an illiterate bootmaker and self-styled prophet. Hers is "a rich, wild" tale by "a thrillingly smart and juicy writer," Beverly Lowry said here in 1993. "Captivity Captive," based on a real turn-of-the-century murder case, features another tormented narrator, an octogenarian who was one of 10 abused children. His story is "harrowing and beautiful. . . . A book that makes demands on the reader's soul," Joyce Reiser Kornblatt said in the Book Review in 1988.
THE SHADOW OF THE PANTHER: Huey Newton and the Price of Black Power in America By Hugh Pearson. Addison-Wesley, $14.
 In this study the bold leader of the Black Panther movement emerges as a brilliant strategist and a ruthless killer. The author analyzes the party's terrorist tactics and the role sympathetic whites played in its fame. Last year our reviewer, Bob Blauner, called the writing of the book "a courageous act," in which Mr. Pearson sometimes achieves "the excitement of a political thriller." In BLACK NATIONALISM: A Search for an Identity in America, by E. U. Essien-Udom (University of Chicago, $14.95), the Nation of Islam is portrayed as a movement that transcended purely political objectives by offering a sense of unity and purpose to poor blacks. Previously out of print, this 1962 book is "an excellent standard treatment of black nationalist belief," Michael Eric Dyson said in these pages in 1992.
 
THE GOOD HUSBAND By Gail Godwin. Ballantine, $12.
 If behind every successful woman there is a man, he is probably like Francis Lake, who has supported his wife, Magda Danvers, in her scholarly efforts and must now see her through terminal cancer. In this novel Magda's demise and her marriage have a powerful impact on another couple grappling with tragedy. "Ms. Godwin has a remarkable capacity for the subtle presentation of real insight," Sara Maitland wrote here last year.
TALKING FROM 9 to 5. Women and Men in the Workplace: Language, Sex and Power By Deborah Tannen. Avon, $12.50.
 A linguist analyzes speech patterns, showing that verbally assertive women do not reap the same rewards as verbally assertive men. This is "a book that everyone who has ever apologized needlessly, snapped at a subordinate or withered from lack of praise should surely read," Derek Bickerton said in these pages in 1994.
 
IN THE TIME OF THE BUTTERFLIES By Julia Alvarez. Plume, $11.95.
 This novel re-creates the lives of the deceased Mirabal sisters, three women murdered in 1960 by underlings of the Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. Another character is Dede, the surviving sister, and it is in her portrait "that we best understand the depths of Ms. Alvarez's despair and the authenticity of her effort," Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria wrote here last year.
SEX IN AMERICA: A Definitive Survey By Robert T. Michael, John H. Gagnon, Edward O. Laumann and Gina Kolata. Warner, $12.99.
 This report is based on the most comprehensive study of sexual practices in the United States since Kinsey's. Interviewing 3,432 people in 1992, the National Opinion Research Center gathered data showing that we are much more monogamous and much less sexually active than is generally supposed. Written by sociologists (Mr. Gagnon and Mr. Laumann), an economist (Mr. Michael) and a reporter for The New York Times (Ms. Kolata), this book offers "a rich supply of examples to lend those conclusions flesh and bones," Paul Robinson said in the Book Review in 1994. Also reissued is SEXING THE MILLENNIUM: Women and the Sexual Revolution, by Linda Grant (Grove, $12), in which the author argues that the 1960's idea of eroticism was mostly men's; only in the future can we hope for sex devoid of sexism. Our reviewer was again Mr. Robinson, who observed last year, "Pleasure needs as many friends as it can get." LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Words' Power, Not Special Effects

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
IT isn't every American summer stock production that luxuriates in rehearsing -- for three weeks, mind you -- on a London stage, the very same stage where the play at hand has been running for years.
But then nothing about "The Woman in Black," which opens a two-week run at the Westport Country Playhouse tomorrow, is going the stock way of summer theater. A spooky English thriller, a genre that's all but vanished from the American theater experience, the adaptation by Stephen Malatratt of a novel by Susan Hill, began its seventh year in June at the Fortune Theater in the West End. Before moving to the Fortune, the play ran more than six months in three other London playhouses. 
 Though the Westport engagement is the professional American premiere of a London hit that has built a considerable reputation as a tourist attraction, it is not the first attempt to import the play. Indeed, this is the 15th try for an American showing of "The Woman in Black." So it has been recorded in the diaries of the director, Robin Herford, who commissioned the play in the first place and has since staged touring companies in the English provinces as well as productions in Japan, Australia and Spain.
Those attempts involved big-time plans for Chicago and for New York. One came close. A 1993 Broadway production was in place, theater (the Music Box), cast (F. Murray Abraham and Robert Westenberg) and all. But $400,000 of the production's $1.5 million budget was not forthcoming three days before rehearsals were to begin.
Will "The Woman in Black" travel to New York this time around when production costs could exceed the numbers of two years ago? Mr. Herford and the Westport's stars, Roy Dotrice and Maxwell Caulfield, envision Off Broadway. (The Fortune has 450 seats.)
And "The Woman in Black" is essentially a small-scale two-character exercise in the power of theater to suggest, to transform and -- old hat as this may seem -- to tell a story through words rather than technological effects and exploding sets.
"We ask the audience to commit their imagination and emotion and they create the atmosphere, of an island reachable by a causeway that can only be approached at low tide," Mr. Herford said. "The audience prepares the stage with that setting, for all we actually have is a very bare space with remnants -- an old skip, an armchair, a clothes rack and a Brentwood chair. The rest is storytelling." (Skip is the British word for hamper.)
The background of that story involves a solicitor, Arthur Kipps, who was sent to a community on the Yorkshire coast in the dead of winter in order to attend the funeral of a client -- one mysterious and dreaded Mrs. Drablow who died at the age of 87.
Kipps was supposed to bring rationality to what Mr. Herford described as "an extremely complicated, creepy, frightening, odd, supernatural turn of events, filled with evasions and ghosts." All that happened 25 years ago.
In the play the solicitor is so obsessed with the eerie tale that he engages a young actor (Mr. Caulfield) to help him exorcise it. The actor reworks the story into a two-character play. The actor, played by Mr. Caulfield, takes the part of Kipps as a younger man, and Kipps himself, played by Mr. Dotrice, takes on six other roles.
Mr. Herford, Mr. Dotrice and Mr. Caulfield flew in from London last Sunday for an additional week of rehearsals. All assumed a "don't ask, we won't tell" position about the identity of the woman in black.
Is this, after all, more than a two-character play? "The atmospheric sound effects -- that's the third character," Mr. Caulfield answered cheekily. "And 110 light cues," Mr. Dotrice interjected.
But who is the woman in black? "That remains to be seen," Mr. Caulfield said. "The piece calls for actors to call on their art form -- and to fire the audience's imagination."
If any actor can weave the combined spell of stage art, artifice and illusion, it's Mr. Dotrice, once a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Among an array of roles, from classical to contemporary, Mr. Dotrice has proved to be a master of the transformation, having played Churchill, Lincoln, Chekhov and, most memorably, John Aubrey, in his one-man show, "Brief Lives."
"This piece is about theater," Mr. Dotrice said. "Kipps learns to be an actor by playing six parts." Both Mr. Caulfield and Mr. Dotrice have "designs" -- Mr. Caulfield's word -- on a New York run. "The play has a fantastic track record on the other side of the pond," Mr. Caulfield said. "And there's a bus load coming -- I think on the 11th -- I hope producers will be on it," Mr. Dotrice added.
Wary of the irrational economics of theater on and off Broadway and quite able to reel off the English hits that hadn't a ghost of a chance in New York, James B. McKenzie, the Westport Playhouse's veteran executive producer who sends out road companies the year round, said: "Sure, everybody's coming to Westport -- the Nederlanders, the Shuberts -- but New York is not my goal in life. "Everything's tougher there -- it's less fun, less rewarding. Of course if it works in New York, it's worth more on the road. Yet I'm open to deals from anyone with ideas and money -- from New York or from Timbuktu."

HEADLINE: ON THE TOWNS: FILM;
Offbeat and Arty in the Land of the Multiplex

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
FOR state-of-the-art brutality, follow the crowd to "Mortal Kombat." All the shootouts you can stand? Try queuing up for "Desperado." Look at other films high on the current box-office charts ("Dangerous Minds," "Waterworld," "Lord of Illusions"), and there's not an art-house title on the list.
To the moviegoing masses, the term "art-house fare" may sound like trade talk or conjure visions of the snob who goes to the cinema, not the movies. In New York City, showplaces for these offbeat films flourish, unintimidated by the multiplex (and some in multiplexity themselves). And if Albert Gabriel Nigrin, the director and curator of the New Jersey Film Festival, has his way, the state won't remain far behind as a serious center for non-mainstream films. 
 The festival, with screenings at several locations in New Brunswick, opens on Thursday with Martine Dugowson's "Mina Tannenbaum," the story of a 25-year friendship between two Jewish women in Paris. More than 60 films dating from 1927 to 1995, including 20 New Jersey premieres, are to be screened before the festival ends on Dec. 2. (Information and schedule: 908-932-8482.)
New Jersey has pockets of small alternative theaters -- among them the Lost Picture Show in Union, the Brook in Bound Brook and the Montgomery Cinemas in Rocky Hill -- with occasional short-lived connoisseur's series like Projected Images, in Hoboken, which opens Tuesday and runs through Nov. 15. But Mr. Nigrin's festival, which includes spring and summer series, represents the first sustained effort at year-round art-film programming in the state.
His expansive mission to perpetuate film as an art form has been evolving since 1983, when he was a graduate student in French literature at Rutgers University. "As a scholar and as a film buff, I always wanted to see films I could not see during the nascent stages of the video mall," he said. So, investing "$300 of my own money," he presented six films by the likes of Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir in a 250-seat hall at Rutgers.
"It was a slow growth, but always open to the public," Mr. Nigrin recalled. Series by series, the budget increased, from $1,000 to $3,000 to $5,000 to $8,000. In 1987, the university's media department became the first sponsor. By 1991, the idea of a festival -- "of seeing films with other people, as a gathering, as a community" -- was bandied about. By 1993, the series became a festival. with some films being shown at the State Theater in New Brunswick (capacity: 1,800). Mr. Nigrin says the restored Art Deco theater recalls the grandeur of movie palaces of old, "where you can lose yourself in the space."
In addition to running the festival, sponsored by the Rutgers Film Co-op and the New Jersey Media Arts Center, Mr. Nigrin, 37, is a lecturer in film at Rutgers. His programs include not just screenings, but also dialogues with film makers and workshops on legal and business aspects of motion picture production, distribution and other offshoots.
This fall's festival includes several theme series. One is titled "Thicker Than Blood: The Family Binds." No "Life With Father" here, but rather such unsettling family portraits as Terry Zwigoff's "Crumb," the much-praised documentary about the obsessions and dysfunctions of the clan and colleagues of the iconoclastic comic-strip artist Robert Crumb. "My Family: Mi Familia" tells the story of a Mexican family in Los Angeles from the 1920's to the 80's, directed by Mira Nair. Other series include "After the Fall: Films of the Post-Glasnost Era" and "Women's Works III."
The up-to-the-minute (Wayne Wang's "Smoke") coexists with old, established forms like film noir, from American ("The Naked Edge," from 1961, with Gary Cooper in his last performance) to Chinese ("The Day the Sun Turned Cold"). Classics encompass the silent (Lillian Gish in "The Wind," Buster Keaton in "College") and the raucously comic (the Marx Brothers). Homages to directors encompass Satyajit Ray, Luis Bunuel and John Sayles, with a nod to the young, independent spirits of Hal Hartley and Todd Haynes.
The art film, then, is "the one that doesn't make it to a multiplex of 10 or more theaters," Mr. Nigrin answered. "While most people go to mainstream movies to escape their existences, they go to an art-house film to probe it, to explore the plight of the species. The reason is existential, not escape. And someone wanted to make the film because of what it says, instead of what it will earn."
How to explain a night of Ed Wood films? It's Halloween, of course. The evening is to include a costume contest and an appearance by Dolores Fuller, an actress in such staples of the Wood canon as "Jail Bait," which is to be shown with "Bride of the Monster" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space" in a triple bill of "three of the worst films ever made."
"We debated long and hard about that, but these were the drive-in movies," Mr. Nigrin explained. "How do they play vis-a-vis today's films? What accounts for the Ed Wood cult? This is part of the historical context: the progression of early junk to present vanguard.
"Remember, the festival is not too intellectual, not too arty. We are here to celebrate film."
To Mr. Nigrin, it's above all a celebration of passion. "That is the bottom line, not the bank account. The risk is now out of the motion picture business. It is talked about as an industry, based on the safe bet, and a lot of people just don't agree. We champion films using intelligence and economy, so you can see Maximilian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave in 'Little Odessa.' Baby boomers will demand more than a reiteration of the same formula, the same trappings.
"Films can be more. Films can be art. And New Brunswick has become the mecca for filmgoers in New Jersey, a true cinematheque where you'll never see the Flintstones. Or the Brady Bunch."

HEADLINE: At Midyear, Office Market Holds Its Own

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
STEADY, but less spectacular than activity in 1994, is how commercial real estate brokers in Westchester assess leasing activity at midyear.
"No question, there has been an upkick in the market judging from the steady absorption of empty space," said Carl Austin, head of the 25-year-old brokerage company of Austin Corporate Properties in White Plains. Yet, on the minus side of the ledger, Mr. Austin warns that more corporate downsizing is still possible. 
 "Major corporations such as I.B.M. and Nynex are in the final throes of slimming down," he said, "and that will produce an upheaval in the market. This may be the last round of corporate downsizing, but like the hurricane, we will feel the ripples from it."
Nynex, which occupies several large buildings, will move some of its Westchester work force to New York City. And while International Business Machines has rebounded financially, there is no assurance that the company has finished downsizing in Westchester, said William V. Cuddy Jr., senior vice president of Rostenberg-Doern, a major independent brokerage concern in Purchase specializing in corporate real estate, in a midyear report issued by his company.
"Nevertheless there are positive signs that the recovery is on track," Mr. Cuddy said. "The office market held its own during the first half of 1995, with the vacancy rate countywide at 22.1 percent, which was essentially unchanged from the vacancy rate at the end of 1994."
During the first six months of the year, companies moving into Westchester or expanding their presence in the county included Abitibi Price, the Canada-based forest-products company, from Manhattan to Purchase, Heineken U.S.A. from Manhattan to 50 Main Street in downtown White Plains, Arthur J. Gallagher from downtown White Plains to Westchester Avenue and Paxar Corporation, one of the largest lease transactions in Westchester this year, moved to Corporate Park Drive in White Plains.
Paxar, a maker of merchandise labels and bar code tags primarily for the apparel and textile industries, is moving its corporate headquarters from Pearl River to 29,538 square feet of leased space, which is the entire third floor, at 105 Corporate Park Drive in White Plains, in a building owned by Eastridge Properties. "Paxar's move reaffirms Westchester's reputation as a prestige corporate headquarters location and shows that high-end corporate space continues to lease first," said John P. Hannigan of Rostenberg-Doern, who represented Paxar in the transaction.
In speaking of the move, Victor Hershaft, Paxar's president and chief operating officer, said:
"Our new headquarters provides us with an excellent access to major highways in Manhattan as well to the Westchester County Airport. We're looking forward to joining the Westchester business community."
At the Tarrytown Corporate Center, a 1.2-million-square-foot office complex on White Plains Road in Tarrytown, more than 150,000 square feet of new leases, expansions and renewals have been signed, said Jon L. Halpern, president and chief executive officer of Halpern Enterprises, the owner and manager the center.
"The level of leasing activity continues to outpace the rest of the Westchester office market at the Corporate Center," Mr. Halpern said. "Our occupancy rate is currently more than 95 percent."
Companies signing leases at the Tarrytown Corporate Center deal in financial services, insurance, fashion, marketing, consumer products, medical technology, computer software and electronics, Mr. Halpern said. The largest individual lease was signed by Citibank, for the renewal of 34,950 square feet of space for its telemarketing and retail training operation at the building at 580 White Plains Road. Philips Electronics North America also renewed its lease for 15,540 square feet in the same building.
The Liberty Mutual Insurance Company moved from Manhattan and Scarsdale into 21,489 square feet of space at 560 White Plains Road in the Tarrytown Conference Center. In addition, AIG Claim Service signed a lease last month for 24,128 square feet of office space at 660 White Plains Road, also in the Tarrytown center, in a joint venture of Halpern Enterprises and the Robert Martin Company of Elmsford.
Three important corporate moves that were announced in 1994 began to take shape during the first half this year. Mastercard International began moving its corporate headquarters from Manhattan to Purchase, and the Ciba Corporation broke ground for an office-laboratory in the Tarrytown Corporate Center in what is the only new construction activity in Westchester undertaken in the last four years. Ciba is moving its United States headquarters from Ardsley to Tarrytown.
The move by Ciba, Mr. Halpern said, has helped generate a great deal of interest in the Tarrytown office complex. "Ciba's given the center a major boost toward establishing the Tarrytown Corporate Center as a prime headquarters location in Westchester," he said.
Construction has also begun on the re-adaptation of the 23-year-old building at 104 Corporate Park Drive in White Plains, which will serve as headquarters for Malcolm Pirnie, an environmental engineering company. The owner of the building is the Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company of Des Moines.
"I think it is inspirational to see how committed Principal Mutual is to Westchester," Mr. Cuddy said. "Principal owns nine office buildings in the county and what they are doing with them makes great economic sense."
As a precursor to new construction, Mr. Cuddy pointed out, the challenge is to recycle vacant inventory for new use. "For instance," he said, "buildings such as Corporate Park Drive, which were built in 1972, are tried and true in good locations.
"They were successful in their first long life and they will be again; 104 Corporate Park Drive is being gutted completely, stripped to the core, and will be entirely reconstructed for Malcolm Pirnie's use."
Such re-adaptations, Mr. Cuddy said, are a trend in the industry. "Re-adaptations will continue until the next cycle of new construction activity begins," he said. "Today's effort is to control cost, and the efficient re-use of existing inventories -- not speculative building -- is what people are doing."
And just recently, the Crosswest Office Center, a 133,000-square-foot building in White Plains, became fully leased, said Patrick Colwell of CB Commercial Real Estate Group, the leasing agent for the property. State Farm Insurance, Mr. Colwell said, signed a lease for an additional 2,910 square feet, completing the leasing program at Crosswest and increasing State Farm's presence in the building by almost 70 percent.
The vacant space that came on the market as a result of overbuilding in the 80's, Mr. Austin said, is finally being absorbed. "It was a shock when the go-go years ended," he said. "However, what is heartening is that Westchester is still perceived by the general market as offering good value to tenants in well-priced, quality buildings."
Most of the large blocks of space are gone, Mr. Austin continued, and "the heart of the market, which is the midsize market for 15,000 square feet of space to 50,000 square feet of space, has rebounded."

HEADLINE: Era of Privatized County Services Begins

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
IN it first privatization of a department, Westchester has hired a nonprofit business group to do the work once performed by its Office of Commerce and Economic Development. The move is expected to save taxpayers $160,000 in the first 12 months and even more in succeeding years as the private group, the Westchester County Association, generates new sources of financing for economic development.
The county has decided to privatize some government services now in order to maintain its Aaa bond rating later on, said Neil J. De Luca, the deputy county executive. Officials are worried that if they fail to reduce the size of government, they will soon face unwieldy budget deficits. 
 Also, Government leaders are under increasing pressure from voters to cut costs, Mr. De Luca said.
"Everywhere we go," he said, "the electorate is saying 'No more taxes.' That being a given, we had no choice but to find a another way."
Westchester is also considering privatizing information services in the Office of General Services and security at the County Office Building, both in White Plains, and laundry and housekeeping at the Westchester County Medical Center and food services at the County Correctional Center, both in Valhalla. It has used a public-private partnership to build and manage garages at the County Airport and at the Medical Center.
"We're not looking to put people out of work per se," Mr. De Luca said, "but we are looking to get the same services for the least price, very much like the private sector does."
The Office of Economic Development, which had an annual operating budget of $300,000, was officially eliminated in June. While many have applauded the county's decision to begin cutting costs by privatizing that department, others said that it may have been a poor place to begin.
Critics have questioned whether a private organization will have the authority to arrange for tax abatements, road development or low-cost housing for companies moving to the county.
"The government simply has more clout," said Thomas J. Spitznas, an economist in Mount Vernon. "For some things, the public sector works better."
Even County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke was skeptical. "Personally, I don't like privatizing," he said, "but it was time to look at alternatives." By contrast, supporters of privatization point to success stories in nearby counties and say it is time Westchester followed suit. They note also that Gov. George E. Pataki is encouraging such ventures.
"It's happening all over," said Daniel Rodriguez, a spokesman for the New York State Housing Finance Agency, which supports public-private partnerships for affordable housing. "The corporate sector has prompted it. They've shown us what can be accomplished."
Kathy Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, said privatization has been used successfully for housing and is now being adopted for economic development.
"Increasingly, the No. 1 priority for local governments is to grow jobs, and they are reaching out to business groups to help them carry out aggressive strategies," Ms. Wylde said. In Dutchess County, a private nonprofit economic development corporation has been operating since 1978, but "really kicked into action" two years ago after International Business Machines laid off 20,000 workers in the area, said Cheri Newsheller Crossley, a spokeswoman for the corporation. The county pays half of the corporation's $500,000 yearly budget and a private marketing council raises most of the rest.
In Orange County, a public-private partnership for economic development was formed in 1986 with a yearly budget of $150,000. In the early years, the county was responsible for 75 percent of the budget, but now the partnership is almost self-supporting, said Michael J. DiTullo, its president and chief executive.
Orange County's contract with the private sector "allowed us to be very entrepreneurial, very market driven, because banks, utilities, developers and brokers have a vested interest in growth," Mr. DiTullo said.
Under the terms of Westchester's contract, the County Association -- a 45-year-old organization representing 800 businesses -- will be paid $140,000 a year to create what its president, Lawrence E. Dwyer, calls "a very aggressive office of economic development and a seamless system of servicing new businesses." The County Association will set up a new subsidiary, called the Westchester Economic Development Organization.
"We're not going to be some little government office," Mr. Dwyer said, explaining that his organization will be able to draw upon a broad base of resources. The County Association houses under its auspices an export assistance office, a 200-member world trade council and three quasi-private transit organizations.
"This is nothing new," Mr. Dwyer said, "it's being done all the time. We'll be approaching economic development not from a narrow perspective but from a macro point of view, by looking at the whole picture and all of the resources in the county."
But there have been some ruffled feelings in the business community since the county awarded the contract to the County Association and not the Westchester Business Partnership, another local business group. George J. Delaney, president of the Business Partnership -- its letterhead reads like a "Who's Who" in Westchester politics, business and government -- said "we have a power-packed board of directors" and would have been well suited to overseeing economic development.
George Frank, secretary-treasurer of the Construction Industry Foundation, a nonprofit group that contributes to the Business Partnership, issued a statement opposing the award of a contract to the County Association.
And Harold E. Vogt, president of the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce, said he believed the Business Partnership "operated on a higher plane."
But consultants and others in the business of privatizing said that if Westchester was to be successful in its new economic development venture, it must put aside differences and cooperate with the County Association.
"The worst possible scenario would be a turf battle," said James J. McGraw Jr., a senior partner with the Suddes Group in Columbus, Ohio, an economic development consulting organization that has been observing Westchester's moves to privatize. "That kind of friction could pull the whole thing down. It is important that they don't let egos get in the way."
Mr. O'Rourke said he chose the County Association to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The County Executive, who is chairman of the executive committee of the Business Partnership, said that organization, which has developed marketing campaigns for radio and television and is supported by membership contributions, could slant its economic development efforts "toward developers who are funding the organization."
Mr. Delaney denied that that would happen.
Mr. Vogt said the 3,000-member Westchester Chamber of Commerce had decided to stay out of the fray to avoid any conflicts of interest. He said that both the Business Partnership and the County Association could run into such conflicts. "The Chamber too saw the potential for a conflict, so we never even responded to the county's request for a proposal," he said.
Meanwhile, the Westchester Business Partnership will continue to receive $250,000 a year from the county under a four-year contract for its marketing efforts, Mr. O'Rourke said.
But some have warned against splitting the economic development functions between two organizations, with the Business Partnership continuing to handle marketing and the County Association taking over all other functions.
In Orange County, Mr. DiTullo said a separation of functions would be like "trying to run a train with the engine separated from the rest of the cars."
But William F. Plunkett Jr., a lawyer and chairman of the County Association's board of directors, said the two organizations would work closely together. "We are them, and they are us," he said. "We really are not separate, and this is not a rival endeavor."
The county, meanwhile, is looking to continue privatizing other government operations. It has consulted with chief executive officers of large companies, and Mr. De Luca said he expects savings of more than $20 million in several departments.
A contract to farm out laundry and housekeeping services at the Medical Center could save Westchester $3 million or more in a single year, he said. Also, Westchester has been paying security officers at the County Office Building $17 an hour. The low bid with the private sector for that function was for $7 an hour.
"We have to give the taxpayers the services they need, but at the absolutely least price," Mr. De Luca said.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
The Perpetual Man of the Hour

BYLINE: By ALAN BRINKLEY 

 BODY:
THE TRANSFORMATION OF Harry Truman from the hapless, unpopular leader he seemed during much of his Presidency to one of America's most beloved folk heroes began with the publication of one book and reached its apogee with the publication of another.
In 1974, little more than a year after Truman's death, Merle Miller published "Plain Speaking," an oral biography filled with spicy (and, many scholars now believe, largely apocryphal) stories of Truman's life and Presidency. It became a major best seller, inspired a popular one-man show (starring James Whitmore) and launched Truman's improving image into orbit. In 1991, David McCullough published his elegant, affectionate biography of Truman, which won a Pulitzer Prize and has now been adapted for an HBO movie. Unlike Mr. Miller's book, Mr. McCullough's was grounded in extensive research. But like Mr. Miller's, it became outstandingly popular and cemented, at least for now, Truman's iconic status in the American political memory. 
 It cannot be entirely accidental that these two important moments in the rehabilitation of Truman's reputation coincided with two of the bleakest moments in recent American politics. Mr. Miller's book appeared at the height of Watergate and just before the fall of Saigon. Mr. McCullough's appeared at a time of unparalleled public cynicism about politics, which has continued (and accelerated) to this day. The Truman of his admirers' imagination -- a flinty, honest, principled man who stuck to his guns and said what he thought; a politician who defied what we now assume are public life's norms -- is a figure who resonates with our discontent. He is an anti-politician for our anti-political age.
It is perhaps not entirely inappropriate then, although it is almost certainly unintentional, that the Harry Truman who appears in the HBO movie, which will have its premiere on Saturday at 8, looks and sounds less like Truman than like Ross Perot. Gary Sinise ("Forrest Gump," "Apollo 13") portrays Truman with a twang that sounds more Texan than Missourian, barks orders at everyone around him except his wife, played in a vaguely shrewish way by Diana Scarwid, and seems never to waver from a clear set of firm goals and rigid beliefs.
The movie, which was directed by Frank Pierson, begins with the famous 1948 whistle-stop campaign tour and closes with the rousing welcome Truman received on his return home to Kansas City after leaving the Presidency in 1953. In between, it weaves back and forth through revealing moments in his public and private life.
Remarkably for a man who spent more than 30 years in the thick of political battles, Truman emerges from this earnest film -- much more than he does from Mr. McCullough's book -- as a man almost wholly outside of, even somehow above, real politics. That, of course, is the image many Americans wish to embrace, and an image Mr. Perot has effectively embraced for himself. But it bears only a passing resemblance to the realities of Truman's career.
Truman's life was, in fact, both more and less impressive than his contemporary popular image suggests. Celebrated today as a simple man who raised himself to greatness, Truman was actually quite unsuccessful for the first 40 years of his life: a struggling farmer who hated farming; an aspiring haberdasher whose store quickly failed; a suitor to, and eventually husband of, a woman whose family held him in contempt; a man who, once married, lived unhappily in his mother-in-law's house and never had a home of his own until he moved into the White House.
What lifted Truman from obscurity was not his energy and intelligence, real as they were; it was his fortuitous relationship with the powerful Kansas City political boss Tom Pendergast, whose nephew Truman had met while serving in the Army in World War I. Pendergast, played appealingly in the film by Pat Hingle, arranged for Truman's election as an administrator in Jackson County, Mo., chose him to run for the United States Senate in 1934 and engineered his re-election six years later.
Truman operated largely independently of the machine (despite the contemptuous nickname his Senate colleagues bestowed on him, the "Senator from Pendergast"), but he was always loyal and, when necessary, obedient -- as the film suggests in a scene in which Truman, given a choice between maintaining ethical purity and building roads using Pendergast's contractors, chooses the roads.
Truman was a capable administrator and a capable Senator, but was rarely distinguished in either position. He had no clear or consistent public philosophy, other than a general sympathy for "ordinary people." His political successes were mostly the gifts of others, not achievements of his own.
SO WAS HIS ASCENT TO THE Presidency. In 1944, when a dying Franklin Roosevelt ran for a fourth term, Democratic leaders were looking desperately for a moderate, unthreatening candidate to replace Vice President Henry Wallace, whom many considered erratic and radical and too much a risk to remain in line for what seemed an increasingly likely succession. Truman had been a loyal but never conspicuous New Dealer in the 1930's. He had received much favorable publicity for his handling of a committee investigating war contracts, a committee that was diligent in uncovering fraud but that almost always deferred to the Administration when asked. He seemed safe and, if not brilliant, at least competent. In the summer of 1944, party bosses persuaded a reluctant Roosevelt to choose him as running mate, and an equally reluctant Truman to accept. Less than a year later, Truman was President.
Truman was not, in short, a man who stood outside politics. He was a product of the party system and an obedient servant of that system. Public office was, in fact, the only stable job he ever had. Perhaps that is why he so loved politics and so enjoyed the company of other politicians.
In the film, we see Truman receiving his summons to the White House after Roosevelt's death as he was having cocktails with the "Board of Education," the clubby group of insiders that Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn regularly assembled in his office in the Capitol. Later, one of Truman's many problems as President, unexplored by the film, grew out of his close association with old political friends (or "cronies," as his critics described them) from Missouri, who were not always as honest as he.
Despite the decisiveness and self-confidence of his posthumous image, Truman was often painfully insecure. Even as a United States Senator, he had a hard time thinking of himself as anyone important, anyone worth respecting; and he was always a little surprised when other people took him seriously. In 1937, for example, he wrote his wife, with a mixture of pride and amazement, of attending tea at the home of Louis Brandeis: "The Justice spent more time with me than any of his other guests. . . . It was a rather exclusive and brainy party. I didn't exactly belong but they made me think I did."
When he became President suddenly in 1945, he was extraordinarily naive about the demands of the job. In June 1945, two months after he took office, he wrote his wife, who had, characteristically, left him alone for several months while she stayed with her mother in Kansas City: "I'm getting better organized now. My office soon will be shaken down and so will my Cabinet when I've gotten State straightened out. . . . It won't be long until I can sit back and study the whole picture and tell 'em what is to be done in each department. When things come to that stage there'll be no more to this job than there was to running Jackson County and not any more worry."
It is hard not to sympathize with a man who became President at one of the most perilous moments of the 20th century knowing so little about his job. Proponents of term limits and other critics of today's Washington sometimes treat political inexperience as a virtue. For Truman, it was often a significant handicap. He had only the faintest idea what a President was supposed to do. He had no important allies in Washington. He had only the barest information about the issues before him. He had not even been told about the Government's most important secret: the construction of the atomic bomb. Into these untested hands fell some of the gravest decisions ever to face an American leader. Truman often did considerably better than his limited preparation would lead one to expect, but he did not always do well.
The dark counterpoint to Truman's refurbished reputation has long been his controversial decision to use atomic weapons against Japan in 1945. Truman always claimed that he had a choice between two terrible options: he could use the atomic bomb or he could sacrifice the lives of thousands of American soldiers in an invasion of Japan. Given those options, no American leader could have chosen differently. But were those the only options available to him? David McCullough and legions of Truman admirers argue that it was. (It was such arguments that helped derail the Smithsonian's proposed Enola Gay exhibit earlier this year.) But even many of Truman's contemporaries believed otherwise, just as many scholars do today.
The frequently cited official estimate that there would be up to a million American casualties in an invasion of Japan was dismissed by most military leaders at the time as absurdly high, although it has survived as part of the defense of Truman's decision. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Adm. William D. Leahy and others thought Japan was effectively defeated even before Hiroshima and considered the use of the bomb unnecessary -- and deplorable. There is reason to believe, although no way to prove, that factions within the Japanese Government working to end the war might have succeeded if given more time. Truman's quick, and many believe excessively hasty, decision may have foreclosed that possibility.
The HBO film, unlike Mr. McCullough's book, presents a cursory version of almost every argument for and against using the bomb, in the form of private conversations between Truman and his friends and aides. The film itself takes no clear position on the controversy; and in suggesting that Truman was later torn by doubts and regrets, it contradicts his consistent claim that he never lost a night's sleep over the decision.
There is, in short, much in Truman's record to suggest that his oft-vaunted strengths -- his forthrightness, his decisiveness, his belief in the power of common sense -- have been much exaggerated or, to the extent they were real, did not always serve him, or the world, well. A better case for Truman would rest not on his supposedly anti-political style and his Perot-like certitude, but on his ability to rely on knowledgeable, experienced people, his ability to compromise and his ability to learn.
And learn he did. Few Presidents have changed so much in office. Terrified to the point of near paralysis in April 1945, he soon developed an at least outward confidence in his abilities that had not always been visible in his earlier career. He overcame the racial prejudices he had inherited in Missouri and took some courageous positions on behalf of civil rights, including proposing the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction and integrating the armed forces. He stifled whatever remained of the Midwestern anti-Semitism he had at times unthinkingly embraced and became a great champion of Israel. And he helped create a new framework for foreign policy and a new American role in the world that, despite many flaws, survived with considerable success for more than 40 years.
The most celebrated event in Truman's career, however, is none of these decisions or achievements but his dramatic victory in the 1948 election. (That initially forlorn campaign is the HBO film's starting point; the night of his triumph becomes its climax.) For the first time in his life, Truman was running for office largely on his own, abandoned by factions of his party. And his surprising upset of the heavily favored Thomas E. Dewey almost immediately became a part of American folklore.
Many things contributed to Truman's unexpected triumph: Dewey's incompetence as a campaigner, Republican overconfidence that led to a low Republican turnout, the basic health of the economy at the dawn of the great postwar economic boom. But Truman himself was the crucial factor. The man whom Time magazine had dismissed in 1946 as "awkward, uninspired and above all mediocre," and whom a Republican Speaker of the House had called "the worst President in history," succeeded at last in making himself the dominant political figure in America.
AND HE DID SO NOT BY Rejecting party politics but by embracing it. For all the bluntness and seeming independence of Truman's "give 'em hell" style in 1948, his campaign was fundamentally and intensely partisan. It was a defense of the Democratic Party, a defense of government and an attack on self-interested elites who were, he said, trying to undo the great achievements of the New Deal. It was Dewey, not Truman, who tried to present himself in 1948 as the man above politics, the man who would take a broom to Washington and sweep it clean of special interests. Truman the politician defeated Dewey the anti-political technocrat.
If Truman was "one of our greatest Presidents," as the HBO film proclaims and as many Americans now believe, the case for his greatness rests only in part on his gritty, iconoclastic style. It rests, too, on his love for and skill at politics, his ability to draw on insiders and "elites" for advice, and his deep faith in the central institutions of politics and government: the party system, the Congress and the Presidency itself. Truman was an honest and appealing man. He was also a politician. He would want to be remembered as both.

HEADLINE: Look Who's Talking Health Care Reform Now

BYLINE: By PAUL STARR; Paul Starr, a sociology professor at Princeton University, is co-editor of The American Prospect magazine.

 BODY:
THIS FALL THE COUNTRY WILL BE Talking health care again -- or at least should be talking about it -- as Congress moves to change the principles on which Medicare and Medicaid were established 30 years ago. A writer with a taste for irony could scarcely conceive a better plot, and as one of those who wrote the Clinton plan, I confess it strikes me as more than ironic.
Two years ago, Republicans were denouncing the secrecy surrounding the President's health care task force. This summer, Republicans have been meeting "behind closed doors" on a Medicare proposal scheduled to be released later this month, only a few weeks before Congress votes on it, thereby avoiding independent analysis of the costs, mobilization by opponents and other inconvenient aspects of a long national debate. Two years ago, the Republicans rang alarms about the Clinton plan's emphasis on managed care. Now the Republicans' own plans for Medicare and Medicaid emphasize managed care. 
 But superficial similarities are deceiving. The reform plans of 1993 generally aimed to extend rights to health coverage and health care; the Republican proposals this year would retract rights that already exist. The debate two years ago reflected a widespread belief that the health care system needed reform. The Republicans, like many in the business world, now begin with the happy thought that the system is reforming itself and that Government needs to be more like the private sector.
The health care system is certainly going through profound change. Health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care are expanding rapidly. As managed care grows, demand for hospital care shrinks. Hospitals are merging, closing beds and cutting jobs; some new buildings stand vacant. H.M.O.'s are limiting specialty referrals and lucrative procedures; the incomes of specialists in some areas are dropping, and primary-care practitioners are in demand. In a stunning shift, once stubbornly independent physicians are selling their practices to hospitals and insurers or taking a fixed payment per enrolled patient and accepting the discipline of the corporation.
Partly as a result of these developments, health care seems less of a problem to employers. Companies that five years ago faced double-digit inflation in health benefits have seen costs go flat. The success of managed care in controlling costs confirms a key premise of the Clinton plan and other managed-competition proposals: substantial savings are feasible. The aim of reform, however, was not merely to hold down costs, but to give people better value for their money.
Whether that is happening is hard to say; there is no national index of the quality of care. The shift to managed care has disrupted many Americans' relationships with their doctors. Many employers have also cut costs simply by requiring their employees to pay a larger share of the bill, and some have stopped covering dependents. A big part of the problem has always been lack of coverage for millions of Americans. Now, declining employer-provided coverage has left more people uninsured -- nearly 41 million at any one time, up by 2 million in 1994.
Under the Clinton plan and other reform proposals, hospitals and specialists would also have borne the brunt of cost containment. For decades, hospitals had overbuilt and physicians had overspecialized; a correction, unavoidably painful, was coming. The changes taking place today, however, do not embody the values of progressive reform. The savings from rationalizing the system are not being applied to make it more inclusive. A new system of corporate health care is emerging without the new framework of rights and obligations that reform would have brought; corporate interests consequently have the field almost entirely to themselves.
Employers have no obligations to pay any share of health insurance or to offer their employees a range of choices. Insurers can still cherry-pick the healthy and shun the sick, and for the most part, they have no obligation to cover pre-existing conditions. They do not have to disclose to doctors, let alone patients, their rules for denying coverage, and when they refuse to approve a service or a provider, patients find their rights are limited.
And the root problem of health coverage remains unsolved. Employment-based health insurance is now in its second decade of steady decline, reflecting a broader decline of real wages and increasing reliance on contingent workers. If it weren't for the expansion of Medicaid during the 1980's, we would have 50 million uninsured now. During the rest of the 90's, employer-provided coverage is likely to decline further, and Medicaid will contract. Americans will then have even less security than they do now about affording health care when illness strikes.
Only by ignoring these realities is it possible to say that the private health system is reforming itself. The emerging health care marketplace, in fact, is likely to reduce access to care for the uninsured. Hospitals and clinics have traditionally shifted the cost of charity to insured patients, who have consequently paid a hidden "tax" in their bills. Managed-care plans, however, refuse to pay that tax; they demand discounts, and if one hospital refuses, the plans contract with another. The hospital and clinic that provides charity care now commits an economic sin: it risks making itself uncompetitive. During the national debate, opponents of reform often said lack of insurance didn't matter much because doctors and hospitals still took care of the uninsured. This was never entirely true -- the uninsured get less care -- but the emerging market makes our old Robin Hood system impossible to maintain.
The emerging market also isn't going to satisfy concerns about individual choice. About half the workers who receive coverage (including most insured employees in small businesses) have no choice among alternative health plans. In the old days, it hardly mattered that the employer picked the insurer since the plans pretty much covered all providers. But when employers now adopt managed care, they effectively choose doctors and hospitals for workers and their families. My employer doesn't determine where I shop, live or send my children to school. Why should my employer pick my health plan and my doctor? But, increasingly, that's how Americans get their health care -- and not through a system of unlimited free choice, which critics of reform often conjure up as if it described the present.
 UNFORTUNATELY, THE OLD SYSTEM OF unconstrained health insurance that covered almost all costs is gone. The Clinton plan would have shifted the choice of health plans from employers to families and required plans and providers to disclose information that would help people choose sensibly. The Clinton plan also sought to open up a wide menu of options at different prices, including fee-for-service plans. The irony is overwhelming. Many people who opposed reform because they believed it would restrict their choices now face a system that is becoming far more restrictive.
Perhaps nowhere is the irony greater than for Medicare. Many of the elderly also opposed reform for fear they would lose benefits and freedom of choice: "Don't let the Government get hold of my Medicare" was one beneficiary's much-reported plea to a Congressman. In fact, while adding prescription drug benefits, the Clinton plan did not fundamentally change the structure of Medicare.
Such a change is exactly the aim, however, of a Republican Congress now committed to cutting $270 billion from the program over seven years. A draft Republican proposal would encourage the elderly to join H.M.O.'s by charging them more for both Medicare and the supplementary (Medigap) plans they buy to cover out-of-pocket costs. Many Republicans want to cap Medicare expenditures but uncap provider charges. Those policies alone would make it impossible to assure that the elderly continue to receive Medicare's package of benefits. Instead of defined benefits, the elderly would get a fixed amount of money -- often described as a voucher -- which over time might not buy the insurance they now receive as an entitlement. Ending Medicare as we know it was not, I recall, a campaign slogan, but it is plainly where this policy is headed.
Ending Medicaid as we know it is an immediate prospect. Republicans want to replace Medicaid with block grants that would give states an average of 30 percent less money in the year 2002 than Medicaid would. Welfare is currently the basis on which many of the poor now qualify for Medicaid. The clear prospect is that many of the poor who lose eligibility for welfare would also lose eligibility for medical coverage.
The big losers would also include teaching hospitals and medical schools. They are being hit by what is technically known as a double whammy. First, the rise of managed care threatens their clinical revenues; managed-care plans use hospitals less but also shift patients to lower-cost institutions. Second, Republican budget plans would end subsidies for medical education that have come with Medicare hospital payments. During the debate over the Clinton plan, the medical schools and teaching hospitals clamored that they weren't being treated well enough. Actually, they did quite well, especially compared to the retrenchment they now face.
Budget plans come and go. The historic importance of what is happening is the shift in legal rights. Health care reform would have given Americans a right to coverage and a variety of other rights in relation to employers, insurers and health care providers. Converting Medicare into vouchers and Medicaid into block grants eliminates the legal rights to medical benefits that the elderly and some poor currently have.
This movement to eliminate rights is not a cautious version of reform; it is the opposite, reverse reform, a radical version of that. During the debate over the Clinton plan, many of its critics said that we should control costs and only then extend coverage to the uninsured. The thrust of policy now, however, is to cut costs by retracting rights to coverage.
There is still talk of legislation that would set some minimal Federal standards for health insurance, which might benefit people with pre-existing conditions. But there is no money, at least not in the current Congress, for extending coverage to the uninsured. In opinion polls, Americans keep saying that health care reform is a high priority. I cannot believe that reverse reform is what they have in mind.

HEADLINE: Take This Park and Love It

BYLINE: By JON BOWERMASTER; Jon Bowermaster's last article for the Magazine, "On Thin Ice, One Last Time," described Will Steger's attempt to become the first to cross the Arctic Ocean by dog sled in one season.

 BODY:
IT IS MARCH -- EARLY AUTUMN IN CHILE -- THE day after Douglas Tompkins's 52d birthday, which he spent quietly at his 25,000-acre ranch with friends and employees. He has returned to his "town" home in the southern city of Puerto Montt to the disheartening news that conservative politicians in Valparaiso have denounced him on the floor of the Legislature. As a result, he is spending his morning planning a week of meetings with ministers and politicians and an end-of-the-week news conference.
Between phone calls he pads around the house on Buin Street in a buttoned Scandinavian sweater, khakis and lamb's-wool slippers. Dark eyes sunk in his graying head, he moves his small, athletic body in a hurried shuffle. The house is light and airy, well crafted of blond woods and white paints. (A furniture maker is among his full-time employees.) A 12-foot-tall, Giacometti-like wood sculpture rises in the atrium. The walls are hanged with black-and-white photographs by Irving Penn and elegant color photos of big trees. Out back are a Japanese garden and a greenhouse. Every detail of the renovation of the 100-year-old house was carefully designed by Tompkins. At Esprit de Corp, the international fashion company he started with his then-wife, Susie, he was officially "President and C.E.O." but preferred the title "Image Director." 
 What has so aroused a handful of Chilean legislators, most of them conservatives, is that over the past five years the multimillionaire (his ex-wife bought him out of Esprit in 1990 for $125 million) ecophilanthropist has become the second largest private landowner in Chile. At a cost of $12 million, he has acquired 670,000 acres of pristine forest, mountains and rivers that cut the nation in two, stretching from the Argentine border to the Pacific Ocean. His intention is to turn the land into a park open to the public -- the largest private park in the world, he says -- and eventually to hand it over to Chile's national park system.
Tompkins, who first visited Chile when he was 17, later came to see the country as a perfect escape from the consumer culture he'd participated in but had grown to despise. It was also a place where he could put into practice his belief in "Deep Ecology," the environmental philosophy that holds, among other things, that the life of a tree is as valuable as that of a human. In the early 90's, he sold his Victorian house in San Francisco, put his money into several foundations that he established and departed for northern Patagonia. But once an entrepreneur always an entrepreneur; soon he was buying up all the native forest around, intent on keeping it out of the hands of developers.
Big wall maps display his current holdings, as well as a few tracts he is still negotiating for and a couple that he will never get. By one calculation, Tompkins already owns 78 percent of the remaining old-growth forest in Chile. The park -- which he has named Pumalin, the Spanish diminutive of puma -- would include the country's largest remaining virgin stands of the Chilean redwood, alerce, some of which are 4,000 years old.
Until recently he had proceeded quietly (his critics would say secretively), purchasing parcels big and small without explaining what he was doing, or why. With the Legislature now investigating his activities, his secretiveness, or arrogance, as one legislative critic puts it, has come back to haunt him. "It was never a secret," Tompkins protests. "We just wanted to have all the land locked up before we went public with our plans for the park."
In an oversight he would have cause to regret, Tompkins did not consult local power brokers about his plan. Instead, he did what he had always done before when facing a new challenge, whether it was kayaking a whitewater river or building a company: he simply plunged ahead, making himself an easy target for his critics -- a coalition of politicians, businessmen and the military in southern Chile who don't like that he's taken all that prime native forest out of play. They, in turn, are making the most of their last, best chance to scuttle the park.
While Tompkins has already amassed 670,000 of the 700,000 acres he planned to buy, the remaining 30,000 are critical. They are owned by the Universidad Catholica de Valparaiso, and divide his holdings neatly in half. By accusing Tompkins and his Deep Ecology Foundation of promoting population control in other parts of the world, his congressional foes have persuaded a handful of bishops to speak out against the project. Conservative legislators have raised national security concerns and pressured the university, which gets part of its financing from the Government, not to sell to Tompkins.
To assuage his critics, Tompkins has tried to emphasize that his goal is "ecology, nada mas." But in a country hellbent on development, where trees are being felled by the thousands every day and turned into wood chips to be shipped to Japan to be made into cardboard boxes, preservation is a divisive issue.
"Douglas's biggest problem is that he has become part of a soap opera, fed by envy, one of our great national pastimes," sighs Adriana Hoffman, a Chilean biologist.
TOMPKINS IS A CHARACTER, GRUFF AND charismatic, a man whom employees simultaneously love and hate. It's no surprise to his friends that Tompkins is in the middle of a growing controversy. Tenacious and obsessive, passionate and compulsive, arrogant and caustic are the words most often used to describe him. No one suggests he is ever subtle or modest. "I want to raise the consciousness of the world," he recently told a Chilean newsmagazine. In the mid-1980's, at the height of Esprit's success, he told another interviewer that he was obsessed with two things: "Moving in places where the ordinary human doesn't go" and achieving "world-class status."
His Chilean critics see him as an interloper. While he insists he's "doing a good deed," a growing number of powerful Chileans think he is making them look bad. Imagine if a Japanese mega-millionaire bought one-third of Montana, and then informed the local populace he was doing them a favor. Even if true, it's a hard truth to swallow.
"The country is divided into two and the guilty party is a North American who doesn't even live in this country," warned the conservative weekly Que Pasa. "His objective is, to say the least, dark, covering a vast territory from mountains to sea." The superintendent of Region 10 (one of 13 provinces in Chile), of which Tompkins owns one-fifth, keeps a thick file on the American atop his desk. The army keeps one, too: since his land shares a 44-mile border with Argentina, it sees him as a potential threat to Chile's national security.
A variety of rumors about his motivations don't make his task easier. "They're trying to demonize me and the project," Tompkins complains. The most popular is that he's securing lands for a "second Israel," though he's not Jewish. He has been accused of being a money launderer and a front for a powerful transnational logging company and a variety of new-age spiritual groups. It has been reported that he intends to replace all the cows in the region with buffaloes, and that he is preparing a place to store nuclear waste. "They just don't get it," sighs Tompkins. "Even though preserving natural places may seem ludicrous to most Chileans, I still believe it is the right thing to do."
Perhaps what bothers him most is the evidence that the powerful elite in Chile is simply not interested in preserving the country's native forests. As proof of Chile's pro-development stance, Tompkins points to another American operation, a logging company called Trillium, out of Bellingham, Wash. Trillium has bought nearly as much land as Tompkins has, 625,000 acres on Tierra del Fuego, with no questioning of its motives. "I don't see Trillium's chief executive, David Syre, facing the 'Spanish inquisition' like I am," says Tompkins. "Which seems odd to me. They want to cut down all the trees on their land. I want to preserve mine forever. And I'm the one threatened with being run out of the country."
Despite his sincere desire to save an enormous wilderness of trees, rivers, lakes and mountains, Tompkins doesn't always help his own cause. Even some of his friends think he should make more of an effort to get along, to befriend some of the elite who run Chile. But that is not his style. "Some people here in Chile think he is kind of naive, with all his ranting about how 'the system doesn't work,' " says a Santiago friend. "Here, we know the system doesn't work, that it's ultimately corrupt. That's a given. But talking about it all the time -- like you just figured it out -- makes him seem kind of . . . silly."
Moreover, Chile's view of environmental do-gooders is skewed by the country's incredible, post-Pinochet rush to development. Boasting the best economy in South America, Chile is slated to become the next signatory to the North American Free Trade Association. The new President, Eduardo Frei, the second elected since Pinochet stepped aside in 1989, has traveled around the world since his election, returning home just long enough to report how many millions of investment dollars have been promised by foreign nations. Few in his Government appear to be stepping back and looking at what this boom means for the future of the country's natural resources. Frei has gone so far as to say that no environmental cause will stand in the way of development. "He's an engineer," says Daniel Gonzalez, executive director of the Tompkins foundation that is buying the land, "certainly not an environmentalist."
In his more philosophical moments, Tompkins admits he expected too much and made some mistakes in his approach. "Look, every big project is criticized," he says. "That is part of the process. That is why we must be as transparent as possible. Naturally this makes our work harder, because we need to answer all these rumors. But every day people stop me on the street and thank me. Last week a taxi driver in Santiago recognized me from television and told me it was important to take care of what we have." While Tompkins has people who go into the bush and negotiate with farmers and fishermen, he often goes himself, by horseback or boat; he says he is willing to raise another $20 million to see the park become a reality.
Not everyone in the Government is a critic. Ricardo Lagos, regarded as a strong candidate to become Chile's next president, has announced that he agrees "100 percent" with Tompkins's project. A veteran legislator, Guido Girardi, president of the house committee on the environment, also takes Tompkins's side. "At enormous economic risk Douglas is doing something the Government should be doing -- preserving native forests."
TOMPKINS'S PREFERENCE IS FOR THE outdoors and the company of a handful of climbing and kayaking buddies. (His first business was the North Face Company, which he started when he was in his 20's.) Since his teens he has made first ascents and descents of dozens of mountains and rivers, from the Sierras to Antarctica. He first fell in love with Chile when he visited there as a teen-age ski bum trying to make the United States ski team; now he owns his own rivers, fjords, mountains and even volcanoes, and spends most of his days piloting one of his small planes or boats between a rustic ranch at Renihue and Puerto Montt. At Renihue there is no telephone or fax; communication is by radio only. Energy comes from an eight-kilowatt electrical plant; the kitchen is wood-fired, the gardens organic. On the property is a one-room schoolhouse he had built for the children of employees and neighbors.
The product of Mayflower-related stock, Tompkins grew up in Greenwich Village and Millbrook, N.Y.; his father owned a Manhattan antiques store. Kicked out of the Pomfret School in Connecticut, he never went to college, moving to California instead to climb and ski. He met Susie Russell in 1963. He was topping trees for a living near Lake Tahoe and she was working as a keno runner in Reno; he was hitchhiking, she picked him up; they were both 20. Married, they moved to San Francisco, where he borrowed $5,000 to start North Face, selling it a few years later for $50,000.
Esprit started out literally on Susie's kitchen table in 1968; by 1986 its worldwide sales had topped $1 billion. With Susie's designs and Doug's marketing savvy, Esprit was among the fastest-growing fashion and life-style companies in the world, a forerunner of such mega-successes as the Gap and the Limited.
Known as Little Utopia and Camp Esprit, the San Francisco-based company was a leader in developing neo-hippie perks, offering employees free language and aerobic and kayaking lessons, and sending them rafting in the foothills of the Himalayas. The company credo was "No Detail Is Small." Happy employees made for fat profits: along the way the boss acquired million-dollar collections of quilts and art, including paintings by Bacon, Picasso, Balthus, Botero and Hopper. As the company grew Tompkins perfected what was dubbed M.B.A. -- Management by Being Absent -- going off for months on climbing and kayaking adventures.
Ultimately he lost his passion for fashion about the same time the company took its first loss. He and Susie weren't getting along, and as they quarreled profits plummeted. In 1990, after several years of wrangling, she and three partners bought him out; the deal gave him $125 million plus 25 percent of Esprit Far East, and plenty of free time to devote to his new passion. Afterward Susie still opened Esprit meetings by urging, "Everybody take a minute and think about Doug, because we wouldn't be here without him." But when I call to ask if she's surprised by her former husband's current predicament, she does not return the call.
 ON A COOL NIGHT IN SANTIAGO, TOMPKINS IS preaching to the converted, 50 people gathered at Eco Centro, home to an umbrella group that coordinates Chile's environmental and social groups. Though most in the audience are on his side, they know him primarily from the headlines, and they have plenty of questions.
He responds in what the local media has dubbed his "precarious" Spanish. Dressed in a black cotton turtleneck, khakis and leather slip-ons, he takes questions for two and a half hours, gesturing with his hands when his Spanish fails. He has now done his slide-show song and dance four times for politicos in Valparaiso, and he's fed up with the endless meetings, the bureaucracy. "I've had it up to here," he says, chopping at his neck with his hand.
He has brought his slides tonight, two carousels. The first is made up of dramatic photographs of ugly clear-cuts in North America, from Tennessee, Idaho, Oregon, North Carolina, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The second starts out with recent pictures of logging in Chile -- lots of roads cut through pristine forests, aerials of stripped hills, vast piles of wood chips. These are followed by elegant photographs taken in and around Pumalin. Tall mountains, snow-covered peaks, deep, forested ravines, tall alerces, blue lakes and fjords, all untouched. It is a powerful display, dripping with exactly the kind of imagery Tompkins knows is his best weapon.
After his talk, in a moonlit courtyard, he elaborates on his vision. "Obviously the whole country can't be preserved, but this is a very special part. It is no good for agriculture or cattle. Sure you could cut the forests and sell the trees, but once cut the land would be good for nothing. It is one of the last virgin reservoirs of the world and I intend to see it preserved."
It has been eight years since Tompkins started to extricate himself from the business world and devote himself to ecology. One concern of critics and loyalists alike is that the current hassles will turn Tompkins off, and he'll walk away. After all, he fled the fashion business when it got "boring."
Is it fair to wonder if he might similarly tire of the endless Chilean bureaucracy and walk away from Pumalin? He insists not. "It's funny, because I thought they would be glad to have me here," he says. "But to many Chileans I guess what I'm trying to do must seem incomprehensible. Ultimately it doesn't matter what they think. I'm not going anywhere. This park will take the rest of my life."
 PERHAPS. BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THE park might not take the rest of his year. In July, the Chilean Government announced that it would purchase the 30,000-acre tract from Universidad Catholica de Valparaiso. Some weeks later, it reversed itself, instead appointing a commission to study the probable impact of the park. Tompkins, who fears the worst, says he will indeed abandon his dream if the Government buys the land. He would continue to seek sanctuary status for his land, but would keep his 670,000 acres private, off-limits to the public.
"The Government jumped right in there to muck everything up," he complains. "These far-right guys somehow talked the president into taking the decision to buy this piece of land. The reason they put forward -- national security -- is entirely stupid. We went to the minister of defense, and he admitted we presented no security problem."
Officially, the Government says it will make a park out of the land. If that's the case, contends Daniel Gonzalez of Tompkins's Fondacion de Educacion, Sciencia y Ecologia, trying to put an optimistic spin on the news, "they've saved us $2 million." But Tompkins doesn't believe they'll ever follow through. "They don't necessarily want to develop this piece of land or turn it into a park. All they want to do is break the initiative. They want to sour the atmosphere for other kinds of investment like this, on principle. Preservation is a bad word to them. This is not personal, it is ideological."
Belisario Velasco, the Government's chief spokesman on the issue, has called Tompkins paranoid and has denied that the purchase was intended to stop him.
Tompkins has spent the last several weeks on the telephone with local journalists, meeting any public officials he can, arguing that the Government has no good reason to spend taxpayer dollars on something he is prepared to buy -- and then give back to the people of Chile. But for now he's not feeling very optimistic.
"People tell us that once the president makes a decision he'll never back off. But we're holding the line. We're going to do whatever we can to make it hurt a little bit, without getting myself killed."

HEADLINE: Why Should We Adjust to Job Market Reality?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Leaky Boats on the Rising Tide" (Op-Ed, Aug. 29): Steven Rattner's suggestion that retraining plans and relocation vouchers will ease growing income inequality in the United States is contradicted by his own acknowledgment that even jobs requiring high skills are "at risk, since corporations are increasingly hiring educated workers overseas who will work for less." 
 The premise behind the Clinton Administration's retraining notions, endorsed by Mr. Rattner, is that government should help workers to "adjust" to new job market realities imposed by the corporate agenda. What's missing is any challenge to the agenda itself.
The last time social inequality reached such a dangerous pitch, inspired organizers developed a vibrant labor movement and a Democratic Party that counterpoised the prerogatives of private wealth with conceptions of the common weal.
The great danger is that this generation will lack the imagination to do anything but "adjust" to growing misery and squalor while hoping to join the small circle of winners whose wealth is compounding at unheard-of rates.

HEADLINE: Computers Beware! New Type of Virus Is Loose on the Net

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
A new and deceptively simple type of computer virus, one that can sneak past security devices by hitching rides on electronic mail and other common Internet files, is causing deep concern among computer security officials around the world.
Only one virus of the new type has been spotted, and so far there are no official reports of damage to corporate or private computer data. But that virus is in widespread circulation and has used up countless hours of productivity as workers try to eliminate the virus and improve computer security. 
 The new virus takes advantage of a trend to embed miniature programs, known in the industry and among computer enthusiasts as macros, in common data files like electronic mail or spreadsheets that can be sent over computer networks. Such documents are typically ignored by antivirus software and network hardware barriers, known as fire walls.
Computer viruses are small programs that are written deliberately to be spread from one computer to another, typically by hiding within a legitimate program that the computer executes, or runs, from a diskette. Of the estimated 6,000 viruses that have been identified to date, most are benign, and only a few hundred have been identified "in the wild," or in general circulation.
But some viruses are intended to be destructive. A few are intended to propagate rapidly, like cancer cells, eventually choking and shutting down a computer system. Others are more insidious, corrupting the data in a computer or on a computer network, or erasing all the data by reformatting the hard disk drive.
So far, the new virus is limited to word-processing documents made in the Microsoft Word program for Windows 95 and other operating systems. But the virus could easily be adapted to other types of documents, the experts said. The virus was first identified last month and has spread around the world via the Internet.
"By its design, it does not have a malicious payload," said Sarah Gordon, a computer-virus expert at Command Software Systems in Jupiter, Fla., who has examined the latest virus. "It would be fairly trivial, however, to modify the virus to cause damage."
The virus announces itself by flashing an innocuous message on the screen consisting of the numeral 1 and a click box, and later it makes it difficult for users to save their documents. Those who thoroughly examine the virus will see a message that says, "That's enough to prove my point." The author of the virus is unknown.
"At the moment, it doesn't deserve to be called an emergency," said Steven White, a virus expert at an I.B.M. research laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. Mr. White said antivirus software developed in recent weeks could easily detect and eradicate the rogue programs from most systems.
But Mr. White and other experts say the potential threat from future malicious forms of the virus is significant, especially as millions of people and thousands of businesses connect their computers to the Internet and other on-line networks.
"I think it will be an extraordinarily serious problem over the next few years," said Eric Schmidt, chief technical officer at Sun Microsystems Inc. "If you believe the theory that nearly all personal computers will be on corporate networks or on-line services in the next two or three years, then this is a problem that could touch all PC users worldwide."
"In other words," Mr. Schmidt said, "it could affect a couple of hundred million people."
Sandy Sparks, director of the Computer Incident Advisory Capability at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, which monitors computer security for all Government agencies, said viruses had a greater potential today to cause serious economic, political and social harm.
"Not only are the networks growing exponentially, but so is our dependence on them," Ms. Sparks said.
There are other factors of the new viruses that are cause for concern. For example, while earlier viruses typically were carried from computer to computer on infected diskettes, which meant it often took weeks or years to spread around the world, the new type of virus can travel around the world by the Internet in days, or even minutes.
Also, traditional viruses typically affect only specific computer operating systems. The new ones are "cross platform," so a single virus can affect many different types and brands of computers, regardless of the operating system software each one uses.
And in their efforts to make computers easier to use, software makers have developed point-and-click "icons" and "intelligent agents" that perform actions automatically. These icons and agents, which roam computer networks gathering information for the user, are particularly vulnerable to viruses.
"We're doing more and more things automatically, and that automatically gets us into trouble," said Ms. Sparks, the Government computer security expert.
The ability to gather and automatically execute files from the World Wide Web, an Internet service that is increasingly important to businesses hoping to conduct electronic commerce, is especially troublesome, the experts say.
New virus-making "tool kits" circulating in the computer underground make it easier for even novice computer users to write viruses. As a result, security agencies are identifying an average of three to five new viruses a day, as opposed to the older rate of three to five a month.
To be effective, antivirus programs must be updated frequently. Experts say many people installed antivirus programs several years ago, at the time of the highly publicized Michelangelo virus scare, and have not upgraded since then.
Adding to the worries is the fact that millions of new computer users are relatively unsophisticated in technology, and do not understand the basics of virus protection. Software makers, meanwhile, contend that adding robust virus-prevention technology to common programs would be expensive and add too much complexity for most users.
"I'm not at the point of being terribly worried, but I'm troubled," said Eugene Spafford, assistant professor of computer science at Purdue University and director of a national computer security task force. "I'm troubled by the presence of these viruses and the fact that there are products like the Microsoft Network or Microsoft Word that don't appear to have safety features built in."
On the positive side, Mr. Spafford and other experts said, antivirus software is getting more sophisticated all the time, awareness of the virus threat is growing, and the rapid switch away from the 15-year-old DOS operating system has rendered many older viruses extinct.
Also, researchers are trying to harness computer networks to work against computer viruses, even as the networks ease their spread. For inspiration, they are looking to the human immune system.
One project under way at I.B.M.'s Yorktown Heights center is actually called the automated immune system. It would function on computer networks in much the same way as the human autoimmune system does to challenge, and destroy, potentially harmful invaders.
"The intent of the system is to discover a never previously seen computer virus," Dr. White said, "and have that virus captured and automatically sent back by network to computers in our library. We could then determine how to detect and disinfect it, and send back an antivirus routine to the affected system."
Mr. Schmidt of Sun says that while the antivirus forces are getting better all the time, so are the virus writers.
"There are criminals in the world, and some of them are programmers," he said. "With computer networks, they have an amplifying effect that they've never had before. If I were a criminal with a gun, I might attack one person. But with a computer network, I can attack a million people at a time. It's like an atomic bomb."
To avert a potential disaster, Mr. Schmidt has enlisted three of the world's top computer security experts, including Tsutomo Shimomura, who tracked down the fugitive computer programmer Kevin Mitnick earlier this year; Dan Farmer, who wrote a program called Satan meant to find security flaws in any computer system linked to the Internet, and Whitfield Diffie, the co-author of one of the world's leading computer security programs.
Their mission is to try to break into Sun's own computer systems, to determine if they are vulnerable and how they can be protected.
Ms. Sparks and other experts said the new virus might actually turn out to be valuable if it caused wider discussion of computer security issues.
"We are, all of us, being drawn into the electronic world, and we can't stop it," Ms. Sparks said. "It's like being given a car without anyone telling you how to drive it, and you don't have a road map. We're driving blind, technically."

HEADLINE: U.S. Leads Japanese Into Information Age

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 3

 BODY:
When the Compaq Computer Corporation and the Dell Computer Corporation invaded the Japanese market three years ago with personal computers selling for half the price of the local varieties, rival Japanese companies braced for trouble: declining market share, falling profits, or worse.
But instead of killing the Japanese personal computer industry, the American onslaught liberated it. Prodded by what is known here as "Compaq shock," Japanese manufacturers have become fiercer competitors, cutting their prices drastically. The result has been a boom in sales that is benefiting the Japanese manufacturers as much as, if not more than, the Americans. 
 Moreover, the surge in sales is finally doing what no government industrial policy had been able to accomplish -- bringing Japan into the information age.
Like the cobbler's child who went barefoot, Japan has made relatively little use of personal computers, despite being a major manufacturer of the machines and their parts. The inefficiency of Japanese offices, with their stacks of paper and endless meetings, contrasts sharply with the legendary productivity of their factories. Only 23 percent of white-collar workers in this country had personal computers at the end of 1994, less than half the United States rate, according to International Data Corporation, a market research firm.
But by the end of this year the penetration rate in Japan should have increased to 29 percent. Installation of office networks and use of the Internet have climbed rapidly. Such developments promise to make Japan Inc. a lot more efficient.
The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company, for instance, cut the time it took to process a claim to about 4.5 seconds from 10 to 13 seconds by installing a network of 4,000 personal computers recently. The Toyota Motor Corporation will provide personal computers to all 25,000 of its desk workers by next year.
Despite a long-running recession, sales of personal computers in Japan climbed by a third in 1994 to 3.4 million machines, according to International Data. This year, industry officials expect sales to jump 50 percent, to five million units. American companies, which once complained about being locked out of the Japanese market, doubled their market share in 1994 to more than 30 percent, the market research firm said.
Leading the Americans was Apple Computer Inc., which surged to become the No. 2 personal computer vendor in Japan behind the dominant NEC Corporation. Apple's market share exceeded 15 percent, far higher than its average share of about 8 or 9 percent worldwide. International Business Machines, which has long been in Japan, was No. 3 with about a 10 percent share.
But because Japanese companies are increasingly competitive, it might be more difficult for American companies, including newcomers here like Gateway 2000 and Packard Bell Electronics Inc., to continue to make gains. And it remains to be seen whether Compaq and Dell , with 1994 Japanese market shares of 3.9 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively, will be able to make a transition from market catalysts to major players. Many executives here say Compaq's progress has slowed recently.
"The role of Compaq and Dell is over," said Kazufu Hotta, director of personal computer marketing operations for I.B.M. Japan, which has been increasing its shipments by 75 percent a year for the last three years. "They helped to open the market."
The American invasion is not the only reason for the surge in personal computer sales. Another reason is the desire of recession-plagued Japanese companies to cut costs by introducing computers and by replacing mainframes with smaller machines. The introduction of the Japanese version of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows 3.1 in 1993 made computers easier to use and the new Japanese Windows 95, due in November, is expected to spur the market further.
Nonetheless, the American invasion was a big factor. Japan's market had been divided into fiefs, with each manufacturer making machines incompatible with other brands. The NEC Corporation, by attracting developers of the most popular software, came to dominate the market with a share of more than 50 percent.
But the prices of computers remained roughly twice those in the United States and the latest technology was not introduced here until months after it appeared in the United States. "Competition was not based on processing power but on software availability," said Ikuo Nishioka, president of Intel Japan, a unit of the Intel Corporation.
Now, most Japanese companies -- except NEC -- have abandoned their unique designs and opted to create systems with the same I.B.M.-compatible design prevalent throughout the world. The pace of technological innovation has quickened and prices here are much closer to world levels.
One company hoping to take advantage of the changes is Fujitsu Ltd. In its last fiscal year, which ended March 31, Fujitsu sold about 450,000 machines in Japan, mostly of its own unique designs. But this year, it expects sales to triple to 1.3 million to 1.5 million units, although aggressive pricing is likely to keep the company from making much profit, if any. About 85 percent of the machines Fujitsu sells in Japan this year will be I.B.M.-compatible, said Tadayasu Sugita, a vice president. The remainder will use the old Fujitsu design.
But the benefits do not stop in Japan. With larger production volumes in its home market lowering its costs, and with its machines now adhering to the world standard, Fujitsu is now becoming more aggressive in markets outside Japan, where it has been an also-ran.
A turning point in the evolution of the Japanese computer industry came five years ago when I.B.M. developed an operating system known as DOS/V, which is essentially a Japanese version of Microsoft's MS-DOS. By using this operating system, Compaq, Dell and other American companies have been able to enter the Japanese market.
In the fall of 1992, Compaq introduced personal computers for about half the price of those sold by NEC. I.B.M., which was already in the Japanese market, cut its prices sharply. Dell entered the market a few months later with its trademark technique of telephone sales, which had not been used in Japan before.
Giant NEC at first pooh-poohed the American threat, saying the American machines were ill suited for the Japanese language and culture. But in the following two years, all the Japanese personal computer companies except NEC followed the Americans in adopting DOS/V, creating a unified standard powerful enough to challenge NEC.
The result: NEC's market share has been spiraling downward and may fall below 40 percent this year, according to market research firms.
NEC disputes that prediction and says its share remains above 50 percent. It summoned executives of computer retailers to its headquarters earlier this year to stress that point. "I was told not to say that share has been dropping," recalled Toshio Sugiura, manager of Laox Computer Kan, one of the largest computer stores in the Akihabara electronics district of Tokyo. "But fact is fact."
But even a decline in market share of 5 percent a year can be absorbed if the market is growing 50 percent a year. NEC expects its sales in Japan this fiscal year, which ends next March 31, to grow to 2.8 million machines from 1.8 million last year. And it slashed its prices so that in 1994, its average selling price was only 2.9 percent more than Compaq's, according to Steven Myers, analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
In July, NEC made another move to bolster its sales, agreeing to pay $170 million for a 20 percent stake in Packard Bell, which might distribute NEC's notebook computers in the United States.
One of its American competitors, Compaq, more than tripled its sales in Japan last year to about $369 million. But this year industry executives say Compaq's notebook computers and home computers are not doing as well as expected. The reason may be rooted in Japanese cultural attitudes about price.
Because Compaq broke into the market by offering low prices, it acquired a reputation as a maker of cheap products in a nation where consumers equate cost with quality.
"Especially in Japan, 'cheaper' is not such a good image," said Yoshisuke Ishiuchi, director of corporate strategy and communications for Compaq's Japanese subsidiary.

HEADLINE: Threat of Privatization Is Robbing Public Employees of Clout

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., Aug. 29

 BODY:
Months before their current contract troubles began, the fate of New Jersey Turnpike workers was apparently sealed when a committee convened by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman issued a report recommending that the state's toll roads be turned over to private operators.
Since that proposal in January, the union representing 1,500 toll collectors and maintenance workers has been sliding down a slippery slope -- losing one collective bargaining initiative after another, gaining little with a lackluster strike on July 4, agreeing to wage and benefit concessions, and most recently, facing a plan to replace some of its members with electronic toll collectors. 
 Organized labor has been losing power nationwide for years, but with voters pressing for lower taxes and smaller government, the lure of privatization means public employee unions are losing even more leverage as they attempt to bargain for wages and benefits.
The case of New Jersey's turnpike workers underscores a growing trend around the New York metropolitan region. In New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has used the threat of privatization in negotiations with sanitation workers, school custodians and school-bus drivers, who agreed to major modifications in their work rules to stave off private competition.
In New York State, a Department of Social Services memo has recommended privatizing services, consolidating units and laying off 400 workers over two years. Six major bargaining units representing state employees have agreed to salary freezes during the current fiscal year, and the state has laid off about 3,000 workers.
And in Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland and legislators from both parties have proposed selling a substantial interest in the state's lottery to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. Nine of ten arbitrated awards granting pay raises to state employees were overturned earlier this year to help make tax cuts possible. While renegotiating continues, one Connecticut union has already retreated and agreed to wipe out retroactive pay raises.
"Unions are being threatened that unless you meet what we can get from a private agency, then we won't reach an agreement,"said Elisa Riordan, an assistant to the vice president of District One of the Communications Workers of America. The union represents 34,000 New Jersey government employees who, like the turnpike workers, have been operating for two months without a contract.
Among those who have learned the bitter lessons of privatization were the Communication Workers, whose 334 members lost their jobs in July when Governor Whitman turned over 23 state motor vehicles offices to private contractors. About 70 of those employees were subsequently hired by the private firms, but at lower wages and with fewer benefits.
Hetty Rosenstein, executive vice president of C.W.A. Local 1037, which represented the Department of Motor Vehicles workers, said she sees "something very scary happening" in the way the job losses came about. "We tried reaching out" to state negotiators, she said, to try to reach an accommodation, to prevent privatization. "Our position was we would find a way to save them what they needed. But their negotiators weren't interested."
Frank Forst, the chief bargaining representative for the turnpike workers' union, Local 194 of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, said contract negotiators appointed by the Governor did not seem to care about reaching a settlement with his union either. "They came in intent on destroying the basis of our longstanding agreement," he said. "They gave us no respect. They didn't want a settlement."
The turnpike's executive director, Roger Nutt, said the turnpike authority is determined to cut its labor costs and expects to replace some of its work force with electronic toll collection machines within one to two years. Also, Mr. Nutt said, the authority has commissioned a $373,000 productivity analysis of the toll collection system, and privatization "is something we will seriously consider if the analysis concludes there are benefits to doing that."
In any case, Mr. Nutt said, the turnpike authority will seek further concessions including the elimination of a 25-year-old provision that prevents the state from laying off any turnpike workers. As Edward Gross, the turnpike authority's chief lawyer added, "I can't go back into the minds of people 25 years ago, but in today's economy, you can't guarantee anyone a job for life."
One turnpike maintenance worker, Wayne Herring, said he and his wife, who works in turnpike administration, are "willing to make some sacrifices" to help the state save money. "We're regular middle class," he said. "We're just doing what we have to do so that we can pay our mortgage and have a Ford Taurus in the driveway. But what good is it to have a contract if we have privatization hanging over our heads?"
As Mr. Forst sees it, the turnpike workers and other labor unions are falling victim not to the demands of the economy, but to a widespread devaluation of the labor that public service employees perform.
During a recent interview over lunch, he snatched an ink pen from his shirt pocket and began a slapdash sketch on a white paper placemat. Across the middle of the paper, he drew train tracks. On one side of the tracks, he drew several tiny houses, clustered together. On the other side, he drew a few larger houses, spaced comfortably apart. And on top of the paper, Mr. Forst sketched one huge house, perched alone on a hill.
"After the state's employees were organized in the 60's," he said as he pointed at his drawing, "higher wages and job security allowed them to move to the other side of the tracks. Then, some of them even did so well, they moved out to the house on the hill. Well, now there's a renunciation of these people and it's initiated a class war. The people who lived on the hill all along are saying to the newcomers 'move back across the tracks.' This is the story of the labor movement today."
The jobs that are eliminated and the wages that are cut by private employers -- all in the name of smaller government and lower taxes -- he said, "make the difference between achieving the American dream and maybe living in the house on the hill, or being limited to one side of the tracks."

NEW JERSEY
 
THE ADVERSARIES: Gov. Christine Todd Whitman versus the Communications Workers of America, representing 34,000 of the 65,000 unionized state workers.
 
THE ISSUES: The Governor wants to turn some state functions over to private contractors and wants union members to pay for part of their helath care if they do not join a managed-care plan.
 
THE STATE OF PLAY: Governor Whitman shifted 23 Division of Motor Vehicles offices to private hands, costing 334 ybuib hibs, She is still negotiating a new contract with the Communications Workers, which rejected settlements accepted by two smaller unions.
 
Besides the restrictions on health benefits, those new contracts provide for a two-year wage freeze and a flat cash bonus of about $1,000 per worker for each of the third and fourth years.
 
THE ADVERSARIES: The New Jersey Turnpike Authority versus the union that represents 1,500 toll collectors and maintenance workers.
 
THE ISSUES: Job security is the latest issue to stall negotiations for a new contract. Management wants to eliminate a contract provision that allows layoffs only as a result of an act of God.
 
THE STATE OF PLAY: The union offered to settle immediately or agree to a fact-finder's recommendation; management said no.
 
CONNECTICUT
 
THE ADVERSARIES: Gov. John G. Rowland versus 10 of the state's 30 unions covering 21,000 of 52,000 state workers.
 
THE ISSUES: Governor Rowland called for the State Senate to reject 10 arbitrated awards granting pay increases to state employees. Mr. Rowland said the state could not afford them, and they would make tax cuts impossible.
 
THE STATE OF PLAY: The State Senate overturned 9 of the 10 pay increases and sent them back for renegotiation. The State Police Union abandoned requests for retroactive pay increases for 1994 and 1995 in return for 3 percent raises in 1996 and 1997, no increase in 1998 and a 2 percent increase in 1999. The other contracts are in negotiation.
 
NEW YORK STATE
 
THE ADVERSARIES: Gov. George E. Pataki versus a variety of state employee unions in the state work force of 200,000.
 
THE ISSUES: The unions have been wary about what will happen to them if he pushes ahead with his vow to trim government.
 
THE STATE OF PLAY: Mr. Pataki settled contracts with 6 of 13 major bargaining units in his first 90 days in office. All salaries frozen for the current fiscal year, while promising raises and bonuses in future years.
There wree few major changes in benefits. The state budget includes about 3,000 layoffs, and cuts 4,700 more jobs through attrition and early retirement. With a $2.7 billion deficit expected next year, state workers are girding for the worst.
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
THE ADVERSARIES: Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani versus unions representing 200,000 municipal workers.
 
THE ISSUES: The Mayor had made labor concessions a major element of his campaign to restructure city government. But he has, in fact, been quite pragmatic at the negotiating table.
 
THE STATE OF PLAY: When talks with the city's 83 municipal unions ended earlier this year, all matched the pattern set by former Mayor David N. Dinkins, with wage and benefit increases of 8.25 percent over 39 months and no concessions. Only the sanitation contract had any explicit agreements on productivity. The Mayor dropped a proposal that union members pay part of their health insurance, instead accepting a package of $600 million in savings from the unions, largely through renegotiating health costs. The city's work force has been cut by 16,000, primarily by paying workers to leave voluntarily, without resorting to the layoffs he had threatened.
 
THE ADVERSARIES: Mayor Giuliani versus 6,000 unionized school bus drivers.
 
THE ISSUES: The Mayor initiallyu pushed for competitive bidding on school busing. The union threatened towalk off the job if it lost provisions that guarantee its members jobs regardless of which companies hold the busing contracts.
 
THE STATE OF PLAY: The union agreed to forgo a pay increase this year and to delay pension, health and welfare payments. The bus companies agreed to take less money and, for the first time, to accept advertising on their buses, with all revenue going to the schools. The city gave in on a job guarantees.

HEADLINE: Link of Interest Rates to Budget Cuts Opposed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Sept. 3

 BODY:
Politicians in Washington may hope that the Federal Reserve will quickly reduce short-term interest rates to reward efforts to balance the Federal budget. But the consensus among economists at the Fed's annual conference here this weekend was that such a move was neither likely nor wise.
 While top economists from around the world agreed that economic output in many countries would be slightly larger if the countries reduced their budget deficits, they argued that central banks should be slow to react to political promises of multiyear deficit-reduction programs. They said central banks should reduce interest rates only as budget deficits actually drop significantly. 
 Prof. John B. Taylor of Stanford University contended that if a country pursues the sort of seven-year budget-balancing effort now planned by Congressional Republicans, then the central bank should reduce short-term interest rates by no more than one-seventh of one percent each year for seven years, with each reduction dependent on a further drop in the deficit.
"These changes in monetary policy may appear remarkably small, and they would be nearly invisible compared to the typical fluctuations in interest rates during such a long transition period," he said in a paper presented at the conference, which was sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
Two professors, Laurence Ball of Johns Hopkins University and N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard University, suggested that an even smaller reduction in interest rates might be warranted in the United States.
While Federal Reserve officials did not discuss their interest rate policies here, Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, emphasized in his opening speech that deficit-reduction efforts in Western industrial democracies would have to be sustained to be effective.
"In assessing future risks, we must stress that today's actions and commitments are only the first step to fiscal reform that must be consolidated by future legislators," Mr. Greenspan said. "Indeed, the will and means to follow through are at least as important as the initial commitment to deficit reduction."
The seven-year Republican plan to balance the budget as well as the nine-year plan offered by President Clinton both require annual votes by Congress on whether to make progressively deeper cuts in spending. So the broad prescriptions of economists here would be for little reduction, if any, in interest rates this autumn in response to actions by the President or Congress.
Mr. Greenspan said that Mr. Taylor's paper "provides interesting insights into how monetary policy might adjust to a period of sustained fiscal consolidation." But the Fed chairman did not elaborate.
Interest rates might fall anyway if the Fed decides that it needs to stimulate the slowly growing American economy.
Historically, the argument among economists has been that a smaller deficit might brake short-term economic growth while accelerating long-term growth by insuring that more money is spent on productive private-sector investments. So a central bank might temporarily reduce interest rates to help the economy out of a temporary slowdown.
But Mr. Taylor argued that it was a mistake for a central bank to risk its credibility by lowering interest rates in response to deficit-reduction promises by politicians that might never be fulfilled.
The deficit-reduction efforts that have provoked such vigorous debate in Washington this year are tiny by the standards discussed by economists and foreign officials here this weekend. Finance Minister Goran Persson of Sweden won considerable admiration here when he described a shrinking of his country's budget deficit this year by an amount equal to 3.5 percent of the nation's economic output. By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office had estimated that the Republican budget targets adopted by Congress this summer would, if fully instituted, reduce the American budget deficit by $19 billion during the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, or a quarter of 1 percent of American economic output.
With the reduction, the American budget deficit would equal 2.3 percent of economic output, compared with 10 percent recently in Sweden.
Mr. Greenspan did allude to one possible effect of a lower budget deficit that might lead to reduced interest rates at some point. He said lower budget deficits tend to strengthen a country's currency, because international investors would perceive the country's economic prospects as improving and would want to buy stocks and bonds there.
Mr. Greenspan did not elaborate, but a stronger dollar in the United States would give the Federal Reserve more latitude to reduce interest rates. When the dollar is falling, high interest rates are needed to give investors a reason to keep their money here.
But several economists took issue with Mr. Greenspan's assessment of the link between a currency and a budget deficit. Martin Feldstein, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, noted that smaller deficits mean a government is borrowing less money. With less competition from government, borrowers would be able to pay lower interest rates, and lower interest rates in financial markets would mean less demand for the currency.

HEADLINE: Factories in New York City Prosper in Niches

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
New Yorkers often look at neighborhoods like Long Island City, Queens, and see only vacant warehouses and factories, idle piers and other fading remnants of the city's industrial past.
Few realize that a new plant on 38th Avenue produces fresh pita each day for the city's Greek diners and restaurants. Nor do they know that thousands of custom-made mannequins are churned out at a factory on 43d Avenue each year, just a few blocks from a company that assembles plastic teeth and jaws used to train dental students across the city. 
 "Most people tend to think that manufacturing is a thing of the past in the city," said Thomas P. Knierim, executive director of the Long Island City Business Development Corporation. "It's really incredible to see the wealth of products that are being produced here every day."
New York will never regain the industrial might it had just a generation ago when vast sugar refineries, breweries and paper mills dominated the streetscape of its industrial neighborhoods. But around the city -- particularly in Long Island City but also in neighborhoods like Red Hook, Brooklyn, and Flushing, Queens -- thousands of smaller plants and factories have survived and even prospered in a trend that may offer modest hope for the city's long-struggling manufacturing industries.
Experts say that many small manufacturers, new and old, have carved out niches within industries that feed the distinct and rapidly changing appetites of New Yorkers. Kronos Gyros Products Inc. provides pita for the city's Greek enclaves, Goldsmith Mannequins shapes customized mannequins for the garment industry, and Columbia Dentoform assembles fake teeth and jaws for dental students to sharpen their skills at schools like New York University.
From July 1994 to July 1995, the number of manufacturing jobs in New York rose modestly to 280,400, reversing a 19-year decline in the July figures, according to the State Department of Labor. The numbers come a year after a New York University study that said the 40-year exit of such jobs had finally come to a halt, in a shift that the study suggested was propelled by the emergence of specialized companies.
"It might be premature to speak of a complete turnaround," said Thomas Corban, a statistician with the Labor Department. "But it looks like manufacturing in New York City is holding its own."
While a number of businesses have profited from low-interest loans and other incentives provided through the city, many experts say manufacturing has been propelled by smart entrepreneurs willing to explore new markets. "It's a lot of intrepid manufacturers," said Richard Werber, the director of marketing for the Industrial Technology Assistance Corporation, a nonprofit group that helps companies obtain grants and other assistance.
Many of the businesses have been aided by other forces as well, including technological advances that make it possible to manufacture an assortment of products on smaller and smaller scales. And a lot of what New York's manufacturers make is still rather ordinary: scaffolding, sheet metal, staples, newspapers and magazines, belts, dresses, earrings and necklaces.
But a number of companies have prospered by tapping rapidly evolving markets that cater to the city's immigrants, artists, fashion designers and restaurateurs, among others. Every day, these companies produce quiches, Indian spices, French bread and fried vegetable chips, as well as theater costumes, mannequins, customized picture frames, false teeth, dyed ostrich feathers and CD-ROM's.
"New York's great advantage in manufacturing is product innovation," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. He wrote the study describing the city's shifting industrial base, which was financed by the State Urban Development Corporation and the Sloan Foundation.
"There's a constant search for the new products in New York because we have such an enormous market with very sophisticated tastes," Professor Moss added.
Nowhere is the changing face of manufacturing more evident than in Long Island City, the sprawling industrial heartland of New York, where nearly 50,000 workers arrive each morning to make things.
No single company can boast dominance in this scruffy neighborhood of cobblestone streets, squat warehouses and aging docks. Rather, it is the smaller companies that form Long Island City's industrial backbone, employing an average of 25 workers in factory spaces that are usually no more than 50,000 square feet.
Gone are the days when a manufacturing titan like the Silvercup Bakery churned out truckloads of bread at its plant on Queens Bridge Plaza. But Long Island City has Demetri Astin. He makes pita, and his story typifies the experience of today's New York industrialist.
An immigrant from Athens, Mr. Astin began his business, Kronos Gyros Products, about 14 years ago in a small factory with the modest aim of selling pita to New York's Greek diners and restaurants. But in a city with a constant craving for new tastes, the bread's popularity quickly spread beyond the Greek community.
"It took off," said Mr. Astin, who built a block-long plant on 38th Avenue a few years ago to keep up with the orders from his 2,000 customers.
"It's the same thing that happened with Goya," he added, referring to the company that made its name selling food to Hispanic customers. "Everyone uses their product now, not only the Hispanics."
These small businesses must contend with high taxes, crime and all the other problems that come with running a business in the city, and many owners say they have considered moving out of New York. But they have stayed largely because they feel they must be close to their New York customers. No fax machine or modem connection can match having the client right there in the plant as critical decisions are being made.
Just ask Mark Goldsmith, whose company, Goldsmith Mannequins, each year makes 8,000 of the figures that inhabit department store windows and aisles all over the city.
It's important for him to have the designers of stores like Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue nearby to help his staff decide whether, say, the skin tone and eye color of a line of mannequins are just right.
He recalled how designers from Giorgio Armani made frequent trips to the plant on 43d Avenue a few weeks ago as his sculptors and painters worked on 150 custom-tailored mannequins for the fashion-design firm.
The Armani designers would often bring along a few outfits, drape them on the working models and then offer one suggestion after another. "Those people must have been in here 20 times making changes," Mr. Goldsmith said.
But such are the burdens of dealing in a niche market. "We're like the people who make the Polynesian umbrellas that go in drinks," he said. "You don't think about it, but some factory somewhere is whipping those things out."
The same can be said about the production of fake teeth. It's a market that has been cornered by a small company called Columbia Dentoform, whose major clients include New York University and Columbia University.
Every week, the company gets special orders from professors of dentistry requesting new kinds of practice models to train their students: mouths that need root canals, bridgework, braces and the like. Company technicians even visit the schools to help install new models in classrooms.
"You get to know teeth after doing this for a few years," said Carlos Munoz, who molds about 2,800 molars, incisors and other teeth each day at the company's plant on 41st Avenue.
Many factory owners say New York offers another important asset to companies producing custom-tailored goods: a pool of experienced graphic artists, metalworkers, designers, sculptors, painters and other laborers with specialized skills.
New York's immigrant enclaves, for instance, are so chock-full of seasoned tailors that the Eaves & Brooks Costume Company has been placing want ads in the city's foreign-language papers for years.
"We're getting first-class cutters and tailors," said Guy Geoly, the vice president of the company, which makes costumes for Broadway shows, movie companies, circuses and ice shows at its plant on 41st Avenue near the foot of the Queensboro Bridge. These days, the tailors arrive with Russian accents.
"Where else are you going to get workers like this?" Mr. Geoly wondered. "Down South?"

HEADLINE: Black Businesses on the Internet: A Market That Was 'Invisible Until Now'

BYLINE: By STEPHEN C. MILLER 

 BODY:
William Jordan Jr., an electrical engineer, and his brother, Rodney, a software designer, wanted to test their concept of "the uncut black experience" -- blacks marketing to blacks and controlling the experience.
And what better way to do that than to use the Internet's World Wide Web? It offers small black businesses an inexpensive way to market goods and services to a vast audience of blacks and others. An estimated 10 million to 30 million people worldwide use the Internet. 
 With these advantages, a growing number of black entrepreneurs are counting on the Internet to help small businesses.
The Jordans are co-owners of the New Perspective Technologies Company, which markets Internet services to minority businesses and has offices in Norfolk, Va., and Washington. And now the company also operates Melanet, a name derived from "melanin," a brown or black pigment that colors the skin, hair or eyes. The 20 Melanet clients include a specialist book publisher and a funeral home. The Jordans say Melanet turned a profit three months after it was set up.
William Jordan says the low cost of Web pages makes the Internet more attractive and less risky to small businesses than to large corporations. "A large company might invest $1 million in putting up a Web site and will expect to get back $3 million," he explained. "A small firm might invest $500 for a presence on the Web and be happy with a return of $1,000."
Internet users are a sought-after market niche: they are well educated and likely to spend money for products on the Net. Forrester Research, a marketing research company in Cambridge, Mass., said revenue from sales of goods and services through interactive retail totaled $240 million last year and is expected to total $6.9 billion by the year 2000.
Many businesses that sell to black Internet users believe that the market is a multimillion-dollar niche. In a 1993 study, the Census Bureau said that 19 percent of the 22.8 million homes with computers were occupied by blacks.
The first company on Melanet was United Brothers and United Sisters Communications Systems Inc., a book publisher in Hampton, Va., that specializes in African and African-American themes. H. Khalif Khalifah, the chief executive, said that by using the service he was discovering "black professionals who have been invisible until now."
The Internet is also helping Mr. Khalifah build a global mailing list of potential customers. He culls the names from a list of Web-site visitors who fill out an electronic form for a free copy of "The Black Book Guide." The newsletter reports on the publishing and marketing of books with African and African-American themes.
It costs Mr. Khalifah only about $100 a month to maintain his Web page. "We've gotten inquiries from as far away as Holland and Japan," Mr. Khalifah said, "and these are people we would not have gotten before we were on the Internet."
Michael Tuyo, co-founder of Object Oriented Information Systems, or O2IS, a software and Internet consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., is equally sanguine about cybermarketing. O2IS operates Afrinet Central, a Web site offering minority business information.
Mr. Tuyo's company is an Internet provider, helping other companies connect directly to the Net. Most companies rent space on the systems of Internet providers and then sell advertising space.
Net Noir Inc., a media company based in San Francisco, started offering its Afrocentric Net Noir Online service on America Online on June 19.
Tony Brown, the host of "Tony Brown's Journal," the PBS public-affairs show, plans to provide Internet service later this summer with "Tony Brown on Line."
Mr. Brown says he is spending more than $1 million to set up his service in a fiercely competitive arena that is dominated by Internet powerhouses: Netcom, P.S.I. and the older commercial on-line services like Compuserve, Prodigy and America Online. He says the service can foster economic self-reliance in the black community, because technology can bring people together not only for commerce but also to come up with creative solutions to social problems.
Mr. Tuyo, too, has a social agenda. "I would like to see blacks become producers instead of consumers; it's time we provided the services," he said.
Not everyone believes cybermarketing is the best use of the Internet. "The Web should be used as an informational device," said Craig Settles, president of Successful Marketing Strategists, in Berkeley, Calif., one of the few companies dealing with cyberspace marketing strategies. "It's going to take time for people to become comfortable with shopping on line."

HEADLINE: Economics Sinks In At Gay Publications

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Debuts, departures and diversification are transforming the segment of the publishing industry devoted to gay and lesbian concerns, as the companies search for new ways to survive economically.
Because magazines and books play a crucial role in linking otherwise disparate homosexual communities, publishers have often put political and editorial missions ahead of financial strategies. As a result, many have gone under. 
 "The most radical thing we could do is put out a publication that actually supports itself," said Michael Goff, president and editor in chief of Out Publishing Inc. of Manhattan, whose flagship is Out magazine.
In its slick brassiness, Out is a far cry from the furtively published newsletters of the 1950's, but it is heir to the tradition of serving readers who find little of their own lives reflected in the general press.
"The gay and lesbian press not only reported on the community, it helped to create it," wrote Urvashi Vaid, in "Virtual Equality," her new book on the lesbian and gay political and cultural movement.
Perhaps the best-known publication is The Advocate, which began in 1967 as mimeographed sheet. Today, it is a glossy magazine that shares news racks with scores of other publications. The Mulryan/Nash advertising agency in New York tracks 128 newspapers and magazines aimed at gay men and lesbians, with a combined circulation estimated at 2.9 million.
But the publishing graveyard is also quite full. Troy Masters knows that well, having been the advertising director of Outweek, which closed in 1991, and the publisher of the weekly QW, which shut down in 1992.
That is why he began New York City's newest lesbian and gay newspaper, LGNY, without so much as an office. "We did the publication entirely electronically," he said. "All of us had modems hooked up and we worked from home."
LGNY, a tabloid sheet that costs $1.25, has published twice monthly since April. About 9,000 copies are being sold, said Mr. Masters, who is the publisher. And the staff has moved into an office, at 225 Lafayette Street. Mr. Masters would not discuss revenue, but said some issues had made money. Most advertisers are local merchants.
LGNY has a home page on the Internet (http://gravity.fly.net/ lgny), with articles, listings, a directory and a calendar of events. Out magazine jumped on line in June (http://www.out.com/) and soon plans to offer news, listings and guides from at least 15 publications across the country and in Canada, including The Washington Blade and Homo Xtra in New York.
This summer, Out began producing HRCF Quarterly for the Human Rights Campaign Fund, a national lesbian and gay political group. The company even lent its name to "Out Classics," a compact disk with works by gay composers.
"Any gay publications that have been successful have other areas of business," said Sarah Pettit, the editor of Out, which is three years old and claims a circulation of 100,000.
Until recently, The Advocate was on such shaky financial footing that it depended for survival on revenue from companion publications -- Advocate Classifieds, Advocate Men and Freshmen -- which contain sexually explicit material.
Now that has begun to change, thanks in part to the growing number of mainstream advertisements in The Advocate, which guarantees a minimum of 75,000 readers.
"It's finally turning a profit after 28 years," said Jeff Yarbrough, editor in chief of The Advocate and editorial director of the parent company, Liberation Publications Inc., based in Los Angeles. "We feel we're ready for the challenge of taking on new media enterprises."
The biggest step in this direction was the acquisition four months ago of Alyson Publications Inc., a Boston publishing house. The terms of the sale were not disclosed.
While Alyson is best known for the children's books "Heather Has Two Mommies" by Leslea Newman and "Daddy's Roommate" by Michael Willhoite, it has published books by and about gay black men, bisexuals, deaf people and teen-agers, as well as lesbian erotica and political histories -- about 250 titles in all. Sasha Alyson founded the house in 1980.
Mr. Yarbrough said the annual list of 20 titles would be more than doubled by 1997. The new editor in chief and associate publisher is Helen Eisenbach, a novelist and playwright who was executive editor of QW and a senior editor at NAL/Dutton. The first new hardcover title will be "Gays on the Right," edited by Richard L. Tafel.

HEADLINE: Soul-Searching on Labor Day

 BODY:
For at least two decades, it has been a ritual of Labor Day in America to point out the decline and fall of organized labor. The political downward spiral of unions is underscored this year by a Republican Congress vowing to undo job safety regulations and other hard-won achievements of workers. But Labor Day of 1995 also arrives with a rare opportunity for labor's renewal. The beginning in earnest of the 1996 Presidential election campaign comes just as labor's own leadership is engaging in an unusual bout of soul-searching.
Criticism of organized labor's past lethargy and parochialism is echoing through the fierce battle for the presidency of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which got under way after the retirement last month of the venerable but stolid Lane Kirkland. Reflecting the times of his long tenure, Mr. Kirkland often seemed more interested in cold war politics abroad than the erosion of union strength at home. Now his handpicked successor, Thomas Donahue, may well be swept from office by a vigorous challenge from an insurgent, John Sweeney. 
 Mr. Sweeney comes out of the service worker sector, a place that is more ethnically diverse and, more importantly, is growing in strength. But both he and Mr. Donahue are talking about the need for a younger leadership and greater efforts to organize workers. At a time of rising anxiety among American workers over job security and standards of living, union leaders argue -- not surprisingly -- that the solution to these problems is more unions.
The A.F.L-C.I.O.'s favorite statistic, for example, shows that living standards have declined at almost the same rate as the percentage of the American work force that is unionized. What this statistic ignores, though, is that unionized workers themselves have had to make wage and benefit concessions to avoid layoffs as company after company has downsized. Clearly the underlying problems cannot be addressed by organizing alone.
The 1996 Presidential election, which will intensify after this weekend's traditional political events, ought to be a forum on how technology and overseas competition are throwing Americans out of work and suppressing wages -- and on the best response to turn that decline around. So far, however, the Republican candidates are relying on the tired litany of blaming everything on taxes and government regulations. Some are doing even worse, stirring up trouble by telling workers that their problems will be solved if only the nation scraps affirmative action, beats up on the children of illegal immigrants or -- in the case of Patrick Buchanan -- walks away from free trade.
There is little doubt that the labor movement will line up with the Democrats once again, despite many workers' disappointment with Bill Clinton. Unions fought the White House on Nafta and lost. They fought shoulder to shoulder with the White House on health care and lost. But the President is right to repeat again and again that the only response to international competition and technological change is to invest in a trained and educated work force.
Labor Day is a good time to recognize that workers and companies must undertake together the task of finding solutions to the problems afflicting the work force. In their scramble to improve profits and productivity, businesses must take some responsibility for providing a climate of prosperity and security for their workers as well as shareholders, perhaps by helping to train and educate their employees to compete. On the political side, organized labor can play a constructive role in the coming campaign if it moves beyond its usual tactic of bartering for legislative tidbits and forces a debate on economic and social issues that a lot of the candidates would be happy to ignore.

HEADLINE: Helpful Corporate Pressure on Cuba

 BODY:
Frustrated as they watch foreign companies making deals with Cuba, American business executives have increased pressure on the Clinton Administration to end the American economic embargo. That is a healthy sign. Corporate pressure was a key element in the recent change in policy toward Vietnam.
Cuba does not loom large as a market for the United States. But for some businesses it could represent significant opportunities, and it is galling for these companies' executives to watch helplessly while corporations from Japan, Canada, Europe and other Latin American nations take advantage of Cuba's new openness. 
 American telecommunications companies have had to stand by while Grupo Domos, a Mexican corporation, recently signed a huge deal to overhaul Cuba's telephone system. Louisiana rice growers would love to recapture what was once their biggest export market. Otis Elevator fears that Japanese manufacturers will move in to replace Otis equipment installed throughout Havana before Fidel Castro took power.
Executives confronting Assistant Secretary of State Alexander Watson at a recent State Department briefing, however, received the worn, formulaic response: "This Administration will maintain the embargo until major democratic change takes place in Cuba."
The business people at the meeting were not mollified. They pointed out to Mr. Watson the inconsistency in Washington's stance towards other Communist countries, notably China and Vietnam, where trade has gone forward despite the presence of authoritarian governments. As Mr. Watson noted at the meeting, however, Cuba is a special case.
The primary reason is the influence of the Cuban exile community. The Cuban American National Foundation, which has worked tirelessly for the overthrow of Mr. Castro, contributes heavily to Congressional campaigns and sways a large bloc of voters in Florida. Few politicians, including Presidents, have chosen to tangle with so powerful a lobby.
But the unity of the exile community is beginning to crack. Its leaders' messianic insistence on deposing Mr. Castro has begun to alienate a younger generation and more recent arrivals from Cuba. In June, Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, a man with impeccable anti-Castro credentials -- he spent 22 years in a Cuban jail -- visited Havana and spent three hours talking with Mr. Castro. Mr. Gutierrez represents a new, moderate faction in the Cuban diaspora, a faction recognizing that many Cubans still support Mr. Castro.
Cuba has kept its commitments to the United States on immigration. With the end of the cold war, it poses no security threat to the United States. Yet the sanctions on Havana are tighter than those imposed on Iraq. Legislation now before Congress -- which President Clinton has sensibly threatened to veto -- would tighten sanctions even further.
The legislation has clearly alarmed many business people. Some of its provisions would threaten their subsidiaries in other countries that already do business with Cuba. If the executives are serious about changing Cuba policy, they need to help the Administration find the courage to take on the conservative exile lobby, and make their wishes known to Congress. They are on the right track.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Finally Reckoning With Rock History

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Sept. 3

 BODY:
Chuck Berry had the first word and the last at the Concert for the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum on Saturday night, nearly seven hours of rock oldies and tributes performed for the 60,000 people at Cleveland Stadium and those watching the live HBO telecast. At 2:15 A.M. Sunday, with Bruce Springsteen at his side, he sang, "It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it/Any old way you choose it." He was a living symbol of rock's heritage being honored and preserved; so is the Hall of Fame.
The concert, of songs by Hall of Fame members, was a show of rock unity. Pioneers from the 1950's (Little Richard, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis) and figures from the 1960's and 70's (James Brown, Robbie Robertson of the Band, the Kinks, Booker T and the MG's, Martha and the Vandellas, the Allman Brothers Band, George Clinton, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Jackson Browne) shared the bill, and sometimes the stage, with current hit makers (Melissa Etheridge, John Mellencamp, Jon Bon Jovi, Natalie Merchant, Slash) who played old songs. 
 There were glorious moments: Al Green singing Sam Cooke's "Change Is Gonna Come" and trying to top Aretha Franklin in a duet; John Fogerty belting his Creedence Clearwater Revival songs; Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen trading verses on "Forever Young"; Soul Asylum backing both Lou Reed in "Sweet Jane" and Iggy Pop in "Back Door Man." And there were embarrassing ones: Sheryl Crow singing Rolling Stones songs (by imitating Bonnie Raitt); Jackson Browne trying Bob Marley's "Redemption Song"; the Gin Blossoms attempting the Beatles' vocal harmonies in "Wait." For iconoclasm's sake, Chrissie Hynde, from Akron, led the Pretenders in "My City Was Gone," a song denouncing urban renewal in Ohio -- the kind of program that led to the construction of the $92 million Hall of Fame. But at the concert, music that has been the battle cry in generational warfare became, for the occasion, a link between eras.
The concert proved that "you can't lose it"; the museum decides how to choose it. The Hall of Fame, which requires careers dating back at least 25 years for inclusion, is only one exhibit in the larger museum, which presents rock artifacts and information from the pre-rock era to the present. At the summit is the Hall of Fame, a dark, quiet rotunda with illuminated signatures and a tone that hovers between reverential and funereal. But the remainder of the museum is a clamorous, eye-popping display that brings together artifacts and ephemera with films, video and multimedia computer data bases. Despite gaps and quirks, its inaugural installation is a promising start.
The museum has a message: that rock-and-roll is a liberating force, and that the ideas and emotions it reveals may be troublesome but must be reckoned with. Visitors are guided initially toward a film, "Mystery Train," that celebrates rock-and-roll as both a grand synthesis of American music -- blues, country, gospel, work songs, jazz -- and the antidote to 1950's suburban blandness. In another room, banks of video screens on opposite walls zoom through history, with Presidents and news events on one side, contemporaneous rock on the other. A 185-seat upstairs theater, which will double as a lecture hall, presents a 20-minute film, "Rock Is," that shows both exhilaration and self-destructive excesses, including drug use.
Evocative objects and documents are everywhere. Naturally, there are plenty of well-strummed guitars and flashy stage costumes, most of them contoured to extremely skinny bodies. The museum exhibits Buddy Holly's high school diploma, parts of Otis Redding's crashed airplane, U2's record-company rejection letters, a receipt for $5,000 from Col. Tom Parker to Sam Phillips for exclusive rights to Elvis Presley's career, and detailed notes from Aretha Franklin on how an album should be remixed.
Jim Morrison's mother provided material from his elementary-school years, including a block-lettered page reading "I Love You, Mother" -- which takes on resonance in the light of his Oedipal recitation in "The End" -- and report cards indicating his need for "a firm hand in the classroom." John Lennon's report card shows that one teacher considered him "hopeless," while a homemade magazine he drew as a child shows that his wry, sardonic humor was formed early. Handwritten lyrics from Jimi Hendrix, Mr. Berry, Mr. Springsteen, Neil Young, Paul Simon and the Ramones, among others, are reminders that rock is the work of people who scribble things down and fiddle with rough drafts.
Like most museums, the Hall of Fame is most self-assured when dealing with the distant past, where there is some historical consensus. On entering, visitors can read about important pre-rock performers from Hank Williams to the Platters to Ma Rainey. Touch-screen computer terminals link rock musicians to two influences each, with capsule biographies and audio and video clips; the Doors, for instance, hook up to Howlin' Wolf's blues and Kurt Weill's cabaret songs. But with rock's explosive growth, and its constant splintering, there's no single narrative for the museum to follow after the 1950's. "This isn't the complete story of rock-and-roll," said Jim Henke, the chief curator, "and I'm not trying to pretend it is."
From about 1960 onward, the museum goes channel surfing through rock history. This is very much a video-era museum. Its film clips are quick-cut montages, impressionistic rather than narrative; for more linear information gathering, visitors can use computer terminals to read biographies and hear songs.
Rock is an audible medium and a performance medium; like African masks, it is best appreciated while in motion. As a result, some of the hall's best material is intangible: a virtual museum of songs, images, voices. One extraordinary exhibit is a room holding old radios, headphones and computer terminals that allow visitors to hear disk jockeys (arranged by decade, region and city) from the 1930's to the 1990's, including, of course, Alan Freed in Cleveland.
There's a wall of blues, rhythm-and-blues and gospel memorabilia across from exhibits devoted to seven city styles: Memphis rockabilly, New Orleans rhythm-and-blues, San Francisco psychedelia, Motown soul, New York and London punk, Seattle grunge, New York hip-hop (which gets extremely sketchy treatment) and Jamaican reggae. The British Invasion and other scenes may get their chance later.
There's an exhibit on obsessive fans, including a sunburst of one collector's hundreds of autographed drumsticks; there's a display of one-hit wonders, explaining how they reached their brief moment of popularity. There are displays from the archives of Sun Records and Atlantic Records. (Although Atlantic's chairman, Ahmet Ertegun, started the nonprofit foundation that runs the museum, his label deserves its place in the museum for its role in rhythm-and-blues and rock.)
And there are wall cases and floor displays devoted to individuals or groups, including the Who, Elvis Presley, the Allman Brothers, Madonna and Michael Jackson (where the identifying label reads, "Collection of Michael Jackson, King of Pop," presumably a condition of the loan). For some reason, the Everly Brothers have two spaces.
The museum's larger exhibits raise questions of emphasis and omission. Its displays depend on its collection; its collection comes from gifts and loans, since its organizers did not want it to become a player in the memorabilia market. And its center of gravity is in 1960's and 70's rock bands led primarily by white singers and songwriters, the kind of music rock critics find easiest to discuss. "In the end, rock-and-roll comes down to the song," one wall label reads, a position that might be argued by fans of dance rhythms or people who just love the noise.
The emphasis is probably a combination of curatorial decisions and the contents of the collections. Because costumes and stage props are simply larger and more flamboyant than other materials, performers who have provided them have an edge. The Rolling Stones, who provided a historical survey of Jagger costumes, are extolled as rock's greatest touring band; the Grateful Dead, who were on the road constantly, turn up only in the San Francisco exhibit and in a memorial row of Jerry Garcia photographs. But the Dead were never as theatrical as the Stones.
There's a big floor display for Z. Z. Top's fuzzy drums and car-shaped bass guitar. Yet Bob Dylan, a far more important figure who has apparently not donated anything, is represented only by a few wall posters, and Van Morrison, another Hall of Fame member, appears entirely absent. All he does, however, is sing.
Because theatricality makes for eye-catching exhibits, the museum overemphasizes rock's connection with fashion. The designer Stephen Sprouse, who is the curator of the costume displays, is drawn to glitter and androgyny. A large exhibit that shows David Bowie and Iggy Pop as deities of a polysexual rock menagerie, includes costumes from such obscure groups as the Dopes and Psychotica.
But while the museum has plenty of sequins and spiked hair, it underestimates rock's T-shirted hordes, whose rebellious machismo led them to thrash-metal bands and gangster rap, the two styles that currently annoy teen-agers' parents and bear the brunt of anti-rock agitation. Neither has much presence in the museum, although earlier rebellions are celebrated.
Because it concentrates on songwriting by individual performers, the museum misses some other possibilities as well. It could examine rock's rhythmic evolution, which would make a fine display of dancing from twist to techno to mosh (glimpsed in the "Rock Is" film) while tracing the beat. It could, perhaps from its existing archives, cast an eye on music-business practices, including the art of the contract. It could look at evolving instrument and recording technology, from 12-string guitars to computers. It could dissect a song as an electronic collage as well as an artistic statement.
Still, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum has to start somewhere, and it succeeds in its main goal: to capture rock's energy and silliness as well as its serious social impact. Now that what Mick Jagger once called "the phantom temple of rock" has been built and organized, it can easily add a few new riffs.

HEADLINE: Why Should We Adjust to Job Market Reality?;
Women's 76 Percent

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Danielle Crittenden in "Yes, Motherhood Lowers Pay" (Op-Ed, Aug. 22) misunderstands both economics and biology in her effort to defend the inequality of working women as a product of genetic wiring. 
 Ms. Crittenden is mistaken to think that her $800 in income "contributed" to the gender gap in wages where women earn only 76 percent of men. The 76 percent figure applies only to full-time employees; if unemployed and underemployed women like her were added in, the gender gap would increase dramatically.
Nor is it true that women who don't have children have achieved equality; this particular subset of women who sacrifice family for a career still face the cumulative effects of discrimination down the road.
There is no biological imperative for women to be paid less than men. It is true that women who have children will probably suffer economically for a variety of reasons: Because child care in America is inadequate (although I know of no studies proving its "unhealthiness," as Ms. Crittenden claims), and because men are paid more than women, it is sometimes financially rational for women to stay home and raise children.
But these are issues to take up with Congress, not Nature. There is nothing in my genetic code that makes me care less about a child than a woman does. The difference is in cultural conditioning and economic opportunities.
Ms. Crittenden fails to see that discriminating against mothers is only a subset of discrimination against women. What we need are not more excuses for inequality, but a change in society's expectations of paternal responsibilities and a change in the routine discrimination women face, so that we can make sure motherhood is not incompatible with equal participation in the work force.

Redirect Peace Dividend

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Skilled Workers Watch Their Jobs Migrate Overseas" (front page, Aug. 28): America's skilled and professional workers are paying an enormous tax burden to defend multinational corporate interests abroad and to protect sea lanes and markets in Asia, freeing Asian countries to invest in education and infrastructure. 
 This wealth transfer has destroyed our industrial base and now threatens our technological superiority. When will the peace dividend be redirected to nurture the competitiveness of our work force?

Raise World Wages

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Leaky Boats on the Rising Tide" (Op-Ed, Aug. 29), Steven Rattner seems to be speaking to difficulties faced by a small percentage of young professionals, rather than average workers. 
 The trend of falling wages for the overwhelming majority of Americans will defy any job-training scheme. It does not stem from a "mismatch between the skills of the work force and the jobs that are available," as Mr. Rattner suggests, but from the huge surplus of labor in the world market. As long as labor is available worldwide at bargain-basement rates, most Americans can count on a combination of wage declines and job losses.
Policy prescriptions by European governments to keep wages from falling have worked, but at the cost of increased unemployment, a cure that is arguably worse than the disease, especially in the United States, where our social safety net has more holes. Any idea to keep wages from falling further in the United States will have to include an international component that raises wages in the developing world.

HEADLINE: Don't Let New York's Maritime Business Die

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 30 news article on questions about the maritime industry's future in New York City raises an important issue for Brooklyn and for the city. It is time for a reassessment of the mission of the Port Authority. However, to suggest that the city would be "better off if it let some or all of its commercial shipping business just die" is misguided, shortsighted and unwise, particularly with regard to Brooklyn's waterfront. 
 Brooklyn was at one time the national leader in maritime commerce and trade. Unfortunately, much of its working waterfront has been made obsolete. This condition is the result of a failure to respond to changes in shipping technology and the perpetual delay in providing direct rail freight access and a permanent rail freight float operation across New York Harbor to Brooklyn. However, a unified effort on the part of the Federal, state and city governments can reverse this condition and result in an expansion of the maritime industry.
One example of what a concerted effort can produce was demonstrated over the past year as Brooklyn's only major shipping terminal, the Red Hook Containerport, experienced an almost 100 percent increase in volume of cargo passing through the facility.
However, except for the Red Hook Containerport, the state, the city and the Port Authority have done little, if anything, over the past 15 years to maintain, develop or expand the infrastructure and the facilities necessary to restore maritime commerce and trade to Brooklyn.
Specifically, the 65th Street Rail Park in Bay Ridge must be completed. Reconstruction must be done on the Second Avenue Rail Line in Sunset Park.
These projects are critical for the cost-effective transfer of goods from the Brooklyn waterfront to the rest of the country. In addition, major improvements are needed at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park in order for that facility to meet its full potential.
With Brooklyn's natural deep-water facilities, and the completion of these infrastructure projects, Brooklyn can once again regain its status as the premier maritime center for the region.
Public agencies like the Port Authority and the New York City Economic Development Corporation must work with the maritime industry, labor and elected officials to develop a strategy for improving rail and highway connections as well as the construction of modern shipping facilities. These agencies should also undertake an aggressive marketing campaign to attract maritime commerce and trade back to Brooklyn and New York City.
The recent report on the role of the Port Authority, prepared by the New York City Department of City Planning, points out that the Port Authority has failed to provide adequate rail and freight access to the east side of the Hudson River. Moreover, the report says the Port Authority has used most of its resources to promote marine activities and infrastructure projects on the New Jersey side of the river, to the detriment of Brooklyn and New York City.
I have long had concerns about the direction the Port Authority should take in Brooklyn and the rest of the region. There is a tremendous need for a truly open dialogue among the Governors of New York and New Jersey, as well as the mayors, county executives and borough presidents within the New York-New Jersey Port District, in order to discuss the appropriate mission and role of the Port Authority.
I look forward to participating in that dialogue.

HEADLINE: Hoffa Opens Drive For Father's Post

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 4

 BODY:
James P. Hoffa formally announced today that he was running for the post his father once held: president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
"I run because I see a great union on the edge of financial collapse while an incumbent administration spends us into bankruptcy," Mr. Hoffa, a 54-year-old labor lawyer and executive assistant to the president of the Michigan teamsters' joint council, said before the start of Detroit's Labor Day parade. A crowd of several thousand interrupted with chants of "Hoffa, Hoffa, Hoffa." 
 Mr. Hoffa's father, James R. Hoffa, disappeared in Detroit in 1975 while trying to run again for the presidency of the teamsters. He had led the union in the late 1950's and early 60's before being convicted of mail fraud and jury tampering and being sent to prison in 1967. His 13-year prison sentence was commuted by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971.
The younger Mr. Hoffa wants to unseat Ron Carey as head of the 1.4-million-member teamsters union in 1996. It is only the second time the union's rank and file has selected a president. The first elected president was Mr. Carey, who ran in 1991 on a platform promising reform.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT REBUTS SOME G.O.P. THEMES ON ECONOMIC WOES

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Calif., Sept. 4

 BODY:
Directly challenging some of the Presidential campaign themes of California's Republican Governor, President Clinton today told a cheering crowd here that immigration, affirmative action and welfare were not responsible for the economic distress of the middle class.
In a day that strongly resembled a Labor Day campaign kickoff, in a state crucial to his re-election hopes, Mr. Clinton said the answers to stagnant wages lay instead with a higher minimum wage and more education and training programs for workers, two initiatives the White House has advocated against Republican opposition. And he reminded his listeners to remember their roots. 
 "We should never, ever permit ourselves to get into a position where we forget that almost everybody here came from somewhere else and that America is a set of ideas and values and convictions that makes us strong," the President said to cries of support from more than 10,000 people.
Mr. Clinton came to California, a state that has lagged much of the nation in economic recovery, to dedicate a new state university at Monterey Bay. The university is at the former site of Fort Ord, an Army post that was closed in 1994.
The President did not mention the state's Governor, Pete Wilson, by name. But he stepped squarely onto the turf of Mr. Wilson, who has based much of his campaign for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination on a crackdown on illegal immigration and an end to racial preference programs, as well as budget cutting and tough laws against career criminals.
Mr. Clinton noted that despite a thriving economy the median wage had dropped by 1 percent over the past 30 months. "In the next year or so, all of you are going to have to decide what you think the answer to this wage problem is," he said. "There are people who will tell you that the answer, the real reason middle class wages are stagnant, is that welfare people are taking all your money away or that we have too many immigrants, or that affirmative action is destroying opportunities for the middle class."
Mr. Clinton conceded that the country had too many illegal immigrants, that an overhaul of welfare was needed and that some affirmative action programs had to be changed. But, he said, "that's not the real reason for the middle class economic anxieties."
In a jab at Mr. Wilson, he said: "We've done what we could to close the borders and send people back. But you know what? This is a nation of immigrants. Most of us do not have ancestors who were born here."
Freshly sunburned and appearing rested after three weeks of vacation, Mr. Clinton also looked toward the confrontation looming with the Republican-dominated Congress over the budget. Advocating his own plan to balance the budget over 10 years, he said, "The decisions made in the next 60 to 90 days will determine what kind of country we're going to be in the 21st century."
Mr. Clinton carried California in 1992 with 46 percent of the vote, and he has marked its significance to his re-election chances by returning here 19 times since he became President. Yet another visit is planned in two weeks for fund-raising events in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Mr. Clinton spoke of a Japanese-American veteran with whom he had played golf in Hawaii, where he had gone over the weekend to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. The man, the President said, had fought for America although he had been placed in an internment camp and two of his brothers were in uniform in Japan. One of the atomic bombs dropped in Japan damaged the man's former home and his mother and youngest brother subsequently died of radiation poisoning.
"There's not another country in the world that could tell that story," the President said. "Why? Because people all over the world wanted to be part of what is America. And we should never forget that."
On affirmative action, the President said he opposed quotas and reverse discrimination. "But I am for making a conscious effort to bring the American people together," he added.
Despite his strong defense of immigrants today, Mr. Clinton has called for a crackdown on illegal immigration at the border. And he has endorsed a recommendation of a commission on immigration reform, headed by former Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas, that legal immigration into the United States be sharply reduced.
In an interview with The San Jose Mercury News given on his way to California, he said, "You can make a good case for a modest reduction of the quota on legal immigration."
Mr. Wilson was out of the state today, in Washington to hold fund-raisers and make speeches on the topic of welfare. The state's Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Gray Davis, attended the Monterey dedication as acting governor.
Asked later why the President had not criticized Mr. Wilson by name, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said, "It's still 1995." But the day had 1996 written all over it.
Mr. Clinton's decision to visit Monterey Bay, for example, highlighted the Federal Government's role in helping to convert some of California's many shuttered military bases to profitable new uses. When Fort Ord was shut in September 1994, nearly 17,000 jobs were lost, creating a local unemployment rate of 20 percent. The new college is part of a government-private sector plan to build back the local economy.
Later in the day, at a more partisan Labor Day picnic in Alameda County, the President announced the award of a $3.4 million Federal grant to a consortium seeking to build electric cars at the former Alameda Naval Air Station on San Francisco Bay.
And in Monterey he sought, candidate-style, to cast himself as a political outsider allied with the common folk rather than the occupant for nearly three years of the most powerful post in the nation.
"You couldn't run a family, a business, a university, a church, a civic organization; you couldn't run anything in this country the way people try to run politics in Washington, where talking is more important than doing," he said, drawing laughter and applause.
On Tuesday, the President plans to teach a history class at the Abraham Lincoln Middle School in Selma, Calif., before flying back to Washington.

HEADLINE: Stocks Down Again in Japan After Strong Gains in Europe

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
In Japan, stocks were lower in morning trading today after a sharp decline yesterday.
Earlier, stock markets in Europe ended with solid gains for the most part yesterday as many fund managers returned from summer vacations. 
 Financial markets were closed in the United States and Canada for Labor Day holidays. The absence of American participants dampened trading in many Asian and European markets, traders said.
In Tokyo, stocks tumbled before recovering in late morning trading today. At the midday recess, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 163.14 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 17,585.38.
Yesterday, the Nikkei fell 372.21 points, or 2.05 percent, dragged down by a selloff in the stocks of small companies that had recently led the market.
The morning decline today came as the dollar continued to strengthen against the Japanese yen. At midday, the dollar was trading at 98.16 yen, up from 97.43, its late quote in New York on Friday.
"The dollar is stronger, and speculative stocks are performing better," said Masayoshi Yano, general manager of equities at Nikko Securities in Tokyo. "But this week selling by corporations has increased."
In European currency trading yesterday, the dollar remained steady against the German mark.
"I think we could remain in this consolidative market for a few more weeks," said Stuart Frost, a currency market analyst with Natwest Markets in London. "The angle of the dollar's recent rise has been a steep one, and a lot of people bought at the top."
European stock markets were buoyed yesterday by Wall Street's strong gain on Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial average rose 36.98 points.
In London, stocks climbed back toward their record high set two weeks ago, but trading volume was thin. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading issues closed up 13.3 points, or about four-tenths of 1 percent, at 3,522.7.
Trading volumes were also thin on the German and French markets.
The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 17.24 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, at 2,250.33, and then rose to 2,263.08 in after-hours trading.
"Small orders hit a thin market and they managed to pull the entire market higher," one German broker said. "It is not as if a buying wave or frenzy had broken out."
Stocks in France were carried higher by a technical bounce that took the CAC-40 index back just above the psychologically important 1,900 level. The CAC-40 closed up 18.83 points, or 1 percent, at 1,900.52.

HEADLINE: Cooler Economy in Hawaii Makes a Paradise Look a Lot Like Other Cities

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Sept. 1

 BODY:
Randy Schoch, one of the best-known restaurateurs in Hawaii, first came to the islands 18 years ago to surf the wild waves of Oahu's North Shore, but stayed to ride the tide of Hawaiian prosperity that turned him into a millionaire by the time he was 32.
He had worked his way up from being a busboy in Honolulu to co-owner of Nick's Fishmarket, a celebrity hangout in the heart of Waikiki, and the fashionable Black Orchid restaurant. With his new-found wealth, he built a $1.8 million palace in paradise, at the top of Hawaii Loa Ridge, with a view that stretched from Koko Head to the cane fields of Ewa. 
 Today, after four years of recession, he is leaving the islands to take a job on the mainland. Through the depths of the recession, he watched as the number of tourists dwindled and the real estate market crashed to the sea floor. To keep afloat, he sold his BMW, the Black Orchid and his home in the mountains.
"I chased the market all the way down," said Mr. Schoch, who sold his home, taking a loss of $500,000. "Here I was driving a $60,000 BMW with a $1.8 million house, and I couldn't afford a refrigerator. I had to bring ice home from the restaurant so we could have milk for the kids."
Hawaii has an image as a paradise of balmy trade winds, where mangoes grow like weeds and bikinis dot the beaches while the rest of the country is shivering in thermal underwear. But for many residents who came for the good life, Hawaii has become paradise lost.
"Hawaii's time was in the 80's," said Wayne Hyna, a general contractor who has returned to being a carpenter since work began to dry up. "It's the greatest weather in the world, but you can't live off the weather."
After a decade of booming growth, the Hawaiian economy has stagnated -- a victim of dwindling tourism, shrinking investment and fading industries, like sugar cane.
Although not so severe as the economic downturns suffered in California and Texas, the recession here, which began in 1991, is the longest since Hawaii became a state, in 1959. Tourists still pack the streets in trendy Waikiki, but the unemployment rate has doubled in six years, to 5.3 percent, as have the number of bankruptcies.
Tourism has dropped for the first time in decades, going from a high of nearly 7 million visitors a year in 1990 to 6.5 million last year. The state's $629 million surplus six years ago has dwindled, even after $144 million in emergency budget cuts, to about $50 million.
The state has eliminated 600 jobs and is considering a $1 charge for checking out a best seller from a public library. Honolulu recently began charging tourists $5 to snorkel in the coral mazes at Hanauma Bay.
While Hawaii has begun a comeback this year, some residents say the sheen of paradise has been scuffed for good. It is a different Hawaii -- a place of humbled optimism and growing social ills that in some ways have made it indistinguishable from the mainland.
"We're sort of going through a midlife crisis," said Paul Brewbaker, chief economist for the Bank of Hawaii. "It was really a cool and mellow place when I was growing up here. But now it's just become like a lot of other places."
The mystique about Hawaii has always exceeded reality. Even two decades ago, many people found Hawaii to be a place of backbreaking work in the cane fields; many lived in company shacks, tucked far away from the high-rise hotels that were beginning to sprout across the islands. Work in the cities could be scarce, rents sky high and the cost of living among the highest in the nation.
Mr. Schoch, 38, remembered that when he first came to Honolulu in 1977, it was already a tough town.
"I mean, I couldn't even get a busboy job in this restaurant," he said as he sat in the dark art nouveau interior of Nick's Fishmarket on Kalakaua Avenue.
Mr. Schoch had grown up in Southern California, surfing at places like Huntington Beach. So when it came time for an adventure, it was natural to pick Hawaii.
"It was very exotic, and it had waves," he said.
Eventually, he got the busboy job, and in three years, he became the manager of Nick's, which led to becoming a partner. With his earnings, Mr. Schoch joined the thousands of people on the islands who rode a booming real estate wave fueled by Japanese investment.
Prices were rising so fast, he said, that he once bought a condominium for $700,000 and sold it a few months later for $875,000.
His biggest real estate investment was his $1.8 million, 5,500-square-foot house on Hawaii Loa Ridge. But just as construction was starting in 1991, the high-end real estate market was beginning to crash. Real estate investment by the Japanese plunged from a high of $2.3 billion in 1991 to $633 million the next year, according to state figures.
It took Mr. Schoch two years to sell his house.
In the past year, Mr. Schoch's restaurant business has recovered, he has bought a cheaper house in a nice neighborhood, and he has become a partner in another Honolulu restaurant. But he has still decided to take a job this month as an executive with Ruth's Chris Steak House in Scottsdale, Ariz.
"I have two successful businesses, I own my own home, but when I look at the future, I just don't see much of a future here," Mr. Schoch said. But he added that he would hold on to his Hawaii restaurants.
At its worst, in 1991, the Hawaiian economy shrank just four-tenths of 1 percent. But Mr. Brewbaker, of the Bank of Hawaii, pointed out that even that small decline had been a shock because of the decade that preceded it, when the economy kept growing above the national rate.
Still, Hawaii's troubles are relative. Although the unemployment rate and number of bankruptcies have doubled, those numbers are below the national average. Unlike other hard-hit states, Hawaii still has a budget surplus, even though it is much smaller.
"The problem is that this place is accustomed to growth," Mr. Brewbaker said. "It's a whole new era."
Mr. Brewbaker said Hawaii was changing fundamentally. Big industries like agriculture and the military are beginning to fade. And tourism, which now accounts for almost 30 percent of the economy, is not the booming industry it was, although it is beginning to improve as more visitors come from Asia.
The changes of the 1990's have turned parts of Honolulu into a tropical version of any other American city. Residents grumble about muggings in Ala Moana Park and homeless people on the beaches. Traffic on the Kamehameha Highway rivals that on the Santa Monica Freeway, and residents talk of a rat race. Honolulu, packed with minimalls and cheap apartment buildings, even looks a lot like Los Angeles.
A grim sign of the change is that for the young, life is harsher than it was for their parents.
For the last four years, 28-year-old Lisa Tanaka has worked three jobs to get ahead. Monday through Friday, she is at First Hawaiian Bank, working as a business development officer. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, she leaves the bank at 5 P.M. and heads to the Itoguruma restaurant in Waikiki to work as a waitress until midnight. On Sundays, she puts in a whole day at Sekiya's Restaurant & Delicatessen.
"It's worth it because I can get a little cash on the side," Ms. Tanaka said. "But I am tired."
With her three jobs, Ms. Tanaka brings in about $40,000 a year. Her fiance, Chad Kamibayashi, makes another $40,000. They have saved enough to buy a $233,000 two-bedroom condominium in Honolulu.
The recession has pushed some residents, particularly native Hawaiians, to the edge of the economy.
Michael Spencer worked for years as a disk jockey, but he has been making his living lately by selling a sticky sweet taro delicacy known as kulolo by the side of the road. He said many of his friends had already left the islands for greener pastures.
"Like everyone else, we're struggling to stay here," Mr. Spencer said. "It's outrageous here: $4.50 for a gallon of milk, $5 for a box of cornflakes, $1.50 for a gallon of gas."
Others who came to Hawaii in search of paradise have now turned their eyes farther west.
Mr. Hyna, who came to Hawaii in 1974 after serving in the Vietnam War, said it had become too hard and frustrating to live in paradise.
He said he would always love some things about Hawaii: the mountains and beaches, the weather and the friendliness. But he also said he had grown tired of the struggle.
After a vacation in New Zealand, he and his wife have sometimes thought about moving there in search of a new life.
"It's a laid-back place," he said. "There's no rat race, and the beauty of the place is just spectacular. It's absolutely gorgeous. It's paradise."

HEADLINE: Trucks' Popularity Undermining Gains In U.S. Fuel Savings

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Americans who might sneer at driving a gas-guzzling Cadillac are tickled to be seen in a Jeep, Range Rover or Chevy Suburban. But the enormous popularity of these light trucks is reversing the nation's impressive gains in fuel efficiency.
Because the Government sets a much looser standard for trucks -- including sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups -- they use far more fuel than cars. Light trucks get only 20 miles to a gallon of gasoline, on average, while cars get 28, according to the Department of Transportation. 
 And with trucks now accounting for 4 of 10 new passenger vehicles sold, the boom is dirtying the air and making the United States more dependent on oil.
As a result, the Clinton Administration is weighing the first significant increase in years in the mileage standard for trucks. Any new standard would take effect by April, for trucks that reach the showrooms in late 1997.
Yet an increase is by no means guaranteed. The Big Three auto companies -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- are scrambling to thwart it, and they have found a powerful ally in the House of Representatives, which recently voted to block the Government from taking such action.
The auto makers argue that Americans like their trucks sturdy and powerful, and that it would be too expensive to make engines for such vehicles burn less fuel. Further, the Big Three auto makers say, any stiffening in the regulations would hand a chunk of the light-truck market, which they dominate, to Japanese companies, which make more efficient truck engines.
"It scares us," said Michael J. Stanton, a lobbyist for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association.
 But energy-conservation groups and other critics say the auto companies have not even tried to improve the fuel efficiency of trucks. And, they point out, most Americans who drive light trucks do not use them for the kinds of activities that require Herculean shock absorbers and towing strength, even if they like to pretend they do. After all, the United States has not suddenly realized Jefferson's dream and become a nation of farmers; nor has it become a nation of off-road adventurers.
Instead, the auto companies' own research shows, it has become a nation of overprepared commuters, as millions of Americans use the rugged vehicles only to drive to work and haul youngsters and groceries.
 
Trucks Are to Blame As Fuel Rating Slips
 The impact of the growing popularity of light trucks has been striking. With cars and light trucks counted together, average fuel economy increased steadily among new vehicles from the 1979 model year until 1987, when it was 26.2 miles a gallon. Since then, as truck sales have surged, overall fuel economy has declined, to 24.8 miles a gallon in the 1995 model year, according to a Government estimate.
"Because of trucks, we've lost fuel efficiency in the fleet," said Robert E. Larson, associate director at the Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. "At the same time, everybody thinks we're getting better."
Because of improvements like front-wheel drive and lighter-weight materials, passenger cars are much more fuel efficient than they were in 1975 (although there are more cars traveling more miles). By contrast, light trucks in total are burning twice as much fuel as they were 20 years ago. And the United States is more dependent on foreign oil than it was then.
"It's utterly outrageous," said Daniel F. Becker, director of the global warming and energy program at the Sierra Club. Because of the lower standard for trucks, he said, "we have more pollution, more oil consumption and a higher trade deficit in oil."
Light trucks have sold so well because buyers, tempted by the auto makers and little concerned about the cost of gasoline, are substituting them for passenger cars. "The Montero. A Luxury Car Not Designed for the Idle Rich," reads an advertisement for a Mitsubishi sport utility vehicle. An ad for the Chrysler Town & Country mini-van crows, "It Has Leather in Places Luxury Cars Don't Even Have Places."
As trucks have crossed over, fancy rugs have replaced rubber floor mats; coffee-mug holders, compact disk players and outlets for telephones and computers have proliferated in once-spartan cockpits; neon yellows, pinks and greens have washed over traditional duller tones; once-jouncy rides have mellowed.
In a sure sign that Alan Alda has replaced Tom Joad in the driver's seat, Ford announced last month that the new model of its Ranger pickup will have not only a passenger-side air bag but also a switch to turn it off when the passenger is a child in a rear-facing child seat.
Niceties like cruise control, adjustable lumbar support, a tilt steering wheel and an in-dash three-disk CD player helped persuade Scott Domingue of Patterson, La., to trade in his Honda Accord for a Toyota 4Runner sport utility vehicle.
Those amenities, he said, more than made up for what he called the vehicle's only deficiency. "The mileage is horrible," he said -- averaging about 18 miles to the gallon. "I drive 100 miles a day and burn about two and a half tanks a week."
 
Double Standards On Mileage Ratings
 The domestication of light trucks has prompted more than a few people to wonder why the Government maintains separate fuel economy standards for them. "A Ford Taurus station wagon and a Ford Windstar mini-van with different fuel economy norms?" the trade weekly Automotive News editorialized last week. "Ridiculous!"
Mileage requirements are not the Government's only double standard on fuel economy. The so-called gas-guzzler tax, which is applied to cars with combined mileage ratings below 22.5 miles a gallon, does not affect light trucks at all.
Yet in another crucial area, safety, the Government now treats light trucks the same as cars.
At the heart of the fuel efficiency debate is the so-called "corporate average fuel economy" program, known as CAFE, which has its 20th anniversary this year. Congress created the program in response to the Arab oil embargo in the early 1970's, in hopes of reducing the country's dependence on foreign oil.
Under the program, the fuel economy of passenger vehicles produced by an auto company must meet, on average, certain standards. Congress set the standard for cars at 18 miles a gallon in 1978, mandating that it rise to 27.5 miles a gallon by 1985. While the car standard has not risen, the actual average fuel economy of cars has continued to improve, to 28.2 miles a gallon today.
In 1975, light trucks were a small fraction of the market -- burly, basic workhorses for farmers and contractors. Congress did not bother to set a mileage requirement for them, instead directing the Transportation Secretary to set the level each year.
The standard climbed from 14 miles a gallon in 1980 to 20.5 later in the 1980's, but it has all but stalled since. It is set to reach 20.7 miles a gallon over the next two years.
According to E.P.A. statistics, 20.7 miles a gallon was already the actual average fuel economy of light trucks in 1983. Today it is 20.4 miles a gallon. These numbers, based on laboratory tests, are likely to be higher than real-world results.
Even the longest production car in the United States, the barge-like Cadillac Fleetwood, has an E.P.A. rating of 17 miles a gallon in the city and 25 on the highway. And it has an eight-cylinder engine and rear-wheel drive.
By contrast, General Motors' biggest light truck, the four-wheel-drive Chevrolet Suburban, gets only 13 miles a gallon in the city and 15 on the highway, according to Chevy's estimate. Even the much smaller Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicle performs worse than the Cadillac, getting 16 miles a gallon in the city and 21 on the highway -- despite having a six-cylinder engine.
 
Tougher U.S. Rules May Benefit Japanese
 The auto companies say that making trucks more fuel efficient would weaken their appeal. Sure, an owner may use his truck mostly for commuting, said Dick Kinsey, manager of fuel economy planning and compliance at the Ford Motor Company. But, he added, "there is that weekend that he wants to go to the lumberyard and fill it full of plywood."
With gasoline costing less than Coca-Cola, Mr. Kinsey said, customers do not worry about fuel. "Our customers are demanding more performance," he said.
The Big Three say that strengthening the truck mileage standard would benefit the Japanese auto makers, just as they contend that strengthening the car standard did in the late 1970's. Then, the Japanese sold a higher proportion of fuel-efficient small cars, just as they now sell a higher proportion of fuel-efficient compact trucks.
As a result, as the Big Three scrambled to make more small cars in the 1980's, the Japanese were able to introduce larger cars that burned more fuel, while still meeting the Government averages. In the same way, they could now move into the full-size pickup and sport utility market -- as they have already begun to do -- while the need to meet the average could restrain Big Three truck production.
"CAFE is something we're pretty good at," said Bob Thomas, president of the Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A. "Our four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines are very efficient, so we would have no problem."
Publicly, the Big Three have long favored a steep gasoline tax in place of the fuel economy standards, although their critics have never believed they are sincere.
Critics say the auto companies could raise fuel efficiency at reasonable cost. Many truck engines have "1960's to 70's-vintage technology," said John M. DeCicco, a senior associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. By using turbochargers, multiple valves per cylinder and other available technology, he said, "you can meet the power needs with a smaller engine, and that improves efficiency."
 
House Acts to Bar Increase in Standard
 More than a year ago, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which runs the fuel economy program, suggested that it would raise the fuel economy standard for trucks, setting rules several years into the future to give the auto companies time to meet them. If they are imposed by next April, such rules would affect light trucks beginning with the 1998 model year.
The auto companies filed comments opposed to increases, and for months they have been nervously awaiting the agency's proposal.
The agency refuses to discuss its plans. But in July, in testimony before Congress, Barry Felrice, the agency's associate administrator for safety performance standards, said, "In light of the rapid growth in fuel consumption by light trucks, we believed that we should see what could reasonably be done to improve light-truck fuel economy in the long run."
Without endorsing the finding, Mr. Felrice noted that a 1992 National Academy of Sciences report projected a "technologically feasible" level of 26 to 28 miles a gallon by 2006.
Now Congress has stepped into the act. As part of the appropriations bill for the Transportation Department, the House of Representatives effectively forbade the traffic safety agency to raise fuel economy standards next year.
"Because the light-truck market now represents over 40 percent of total vehicle sales, and it is a segment which is dominated by domestic manufacturers, this action would be devastating to the nation's economy," Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican and the House majority whip, said in remarks submitted to the Congressional Record about raising the fuel economy standard.
The Senate did not pass the same restriction. It is not clear whether the Clinton Administration will act before a House-Senate conference on the bill this month.

HEADLINE: Dole Aims a Barrage at 'Intellectual Elites'

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Angling anew for the votes of the conservatives who dominate the Republican Presidential nominating process, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas contended today that elitist liberals were trying to undermine American values in the nation's schools and other cultural institutions.
"The keys to our unity are under attack from our Government and from intellectual elites who seem embarrassed by America," said Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, whose front-running Presidential campaign has recently lost some momentum. He spoke to the 77th national convention of the American Legion here. 
 Mr. Dole demanded an end to multilingual education, thereby edging himself into the growing immigration debate, which has become a major element in the campaign.
"Insisting that all our citizens are fluent in English is a welcoming act of inclusion, and insist we must," he said. "We need the glue of language to help hold us together. We must stop the practice of multilingual education as a means of instilling ethnic pride or as a therapy for low self-esteem or out of elitist guilt over a culture built on the traditions of the West."
Somewhat in the same vein, Mr. Dole also condemned history courses that heavily emphasize national shortcomings, particularly past treatment of minorities. In particular, he criticized the "sanitized" National History Standards proposed by a Federal study group, saying they "glorify other cultures" and are part of the Government's "war on traditional American values."
"They disparage America and disown the ideas and traditions of the West," he said.
The Senator said affirmative action programs constituted reverse discrimination that "no amount of tinkering" could correct, a political dig at President Clinton's contention that affirmative action needs only minor corrections.
"It was never supposed to be permanent," Mr. Dole said. "We know it has failed. Let's stop dividing Americans by race."
Then, repeating an earlier campaign assertion that won him considerable publicity a few months back, the Senator said the film, music, advertising and television industries too often were guilty of "marketing evil."
"It's not for the good," he said.
The Senator warned that for the nation to "return as a people to the original concept of what it means to be American," it would be necessary to debate subjects that "the arbiters of political correctness" would prefer not to discuss.
"Our diversity," he went on, "requires us to bind ourselves to the American idea in every way we can -- by speaking one language, taking pride in our true history and embracing the traditional American values that have guided us from the beginning."
The several thousand conventioneers in the city auditorium here, many of them, like Mr. Dole, decorated veterans who were wounded in World War II, responded with loud applause.
In his long career on Capitol Hill, Mr. Dole has been mostly a mainstream Republican ideologically, and he has built his career mostly on his ability to lead and legislate. But in recent months, in his third campaign for the Presidency, he has found it politically expedient not to play up his Capitol Hill skills and his moderate conservatism.
Instead, he has inclined hard to the right and the votes of the Republicans who dominate the nominating process, hardening his stand on gun control, finding fault with affirmative action and mass culture moguls and, in today's speech, throwing down still more red meat by taking on "elitist" educators.
The Senator's aides, acknowledging the slippage in his campaign after his poor showing in the Iowa straw poll two weeks ago, aggressively encouraged coverage of the speech here, saying it would deliberately touch only lightly on Labor Day and veteran matters despite the date and audience.
The aides said that come Tuesday in Chicago Mr. Dole would deliver another major speech, expounding on economic policy and offering some new thoughts on the American tax system.
Jauntily sporting a blue American Legion cap as he spoke today, Mr. Dole said the forces of elitism and political correctness had so infiltrated the nation's cultural life with their "shocking campaign" to "hijack and untie the strings of citizenship" that what once was good in the United States had become bad.
"What we see as opportunity, they see as oppression," he said. "Where we see a proud past, they see a legacy of shame. What we hold as moral truth, they call intolerance."
Any and all American institutions are "ripe for infection," he declared, even great museums.
"When the Smithsonian created a display to commemorate the anniversary of Hiroshima," he told his fellow veterans, "the message was that dropping the bomb was an act of American violence against Japanese culture. Veterans groups that complained were dismissed as 'special interests' who couldn't be objective."
He paused, letting that assertion sink in.
"Well," he said, finally resuming, "if you love this country so much you're willing to die for it, maybe you do belong to a 'special interest.' "

HEADLINE: Imported Pasta's Rising U.S. Sales Draw Complaints

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Italy's premier pasta makers have decided that America's growing appetite for Italian food is too good to pass up, so with promotional cries of "Eat! Eat!" they are shipping as much pasta as they can spare to the United States.
With pasta consumption in Italy stagnant and discount stores here pushing prices lower, the American strategy has paid off. By last year, shipments of Italian pasta to the United States had nearly doubled in four years, to $119 million, and Americans still aren't full. 
 The American pasta industry, though, has had enough. This spring, three of the largest makers -- the Hershey Foods Corporation, which sells Ronzoni pasta; Borden Inc., which sells the Prince and Creamette brands, and the Gooch Foods division of the Archer Daniels Midland Company, which makes the La Rosa and Martha Gooch lines -- filed a complaint with the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission against the Italians and several small Turkish pasta makers. The Americans argued that the foreign producers were using government subsidies at home to sell pasta in the United States at prices that were below cost.
American companies, including Borden, have occasionally imported Italian pasta themselves for its quality and low price, but they never reckoned with Americans being seduced by the mystique of Italian brands like De Cecco and La Molisana, or the three-pounds-for-a-dollar lure of Italian-sounding Turkish pasta brands like Luigi Vitelli.
The Commerce Department is expected to decide next month whether to impose tariffs to offset the European advantage. Lawyers for the big American pasta makers say the case represents a test of American trade law in the wake of the 1993 world trade agreement.
The law bars the United States from retaliating against companies that receive certain subsidies from foreign governments, including some intended to promote economic activity in less-developed regions.
Italy's pasta makers argue that subsidies of this kind are among the ones cited by the suit, which will test how stringently the Commerce Department intends to apply the law.
Italy's pasta makers say the complaint is more about the higher costs American pasta makers pay for advertising and for the American wheat they use, rather than about Italian or Turkish subsidies. Any American tariff, they say, will simply mean that American consumers will pay more for pasta.
Canada has already prohibited sale of imported pasta except for direct sales by the foreign manufacturer, effectively wiping out what had been a $20-million-a-year business for Canadian importers who brought in Italian pasta.
All this gives indigestion to Italy's pasta giants, like Barilla S.p.A., Italy's biggest pasta company, with 35 percent of the market.
"Our American prices are 23 percent above the market average," said Lamberto Prati, a spokesman for Barilla in Parma, Italy, which markets its product in America as a premium pasta. "How can that be dumping?"
Barilla has been branching out into other European countries and earlier this year set up an American subsidiary. In the spring, Barilla agreed with the Campbell Soup Company to sell pasta sauce in the United States and, as if to emphasize the importance of the American market, named Edwin L. Artzt, the former chief executive of the Procter & Gamble Company, to its board.
Paul C. Rosenthal, a Washington lawyer who represents the big American pasta makers, is unfazed. "If Barilla does not need to be subsidized," he said, "they should give up the subsidy portion."
The trade suit, he said, sought merely to eliminate unfair trade, so that "every company can have an unlimited share of the market."
For Italians, such a pasta war is not new. In the 1980's, the Reagan Administration imposed a 40 percent tariff on Italian pasta imports after the Commerce Department found that European wheat subsidies gave Italy an unfair advantage.
The European Union refunds to pasta makers the difference between the high price they pay for European wheat and lower world wheat prices. But Italy thought it had solved the problem in 1987, when Washington agreed to accept subsidies on roughly half the pasta imported from Italy. Rising wheat prices further defused the issue by causing the European refund to pasta makers to evaporate.
The Italians argue that the thrust of the latest legal action is aimed not so much at the likes of Barilla, but at the medium-priced brands sold by companies like De Cecco S.p.A. and La Molisana S.p.A., respectively the No. 1 and 2 Italian imports. With wheat prices at nearly $7.50 a bushel, compared with $4 in 1992, the European refund has shrunk to the equivalent of 4 cents a pound of pasta.
The suit by the American producers, said Peter Carolan, the president of La Pace Imports in Mendham, N.J., which sells La Molisana, is a tool to "get the market up" by raising prices for all types of pasta. "It's a subtle way of price-fixing," he said.
According to Mr. Carolan, who heads an industry committee fighting the suit, the American manufacturers are trying to push the price of pasta into the range of 99 cents to $1.09 a pound. The medium-priced imports now usually sell for 59 cents to 79 cents a pound.
Mr. Carolan said that big American pasta makers were being squeezed by competition from cheaper imports and the high prices for American durum wheat and mounting merchandising expenses. Last month, the National Pasta Association, which represents the American manufacturers, complained to the Clinton Administration about the price of American wheat, which is inflated partly by import restrictions on cheaper grain from countries like Canada, a leading supplier to the Italians.
Mr. Rosenthal, the lawyer bringing the complaint against the imported pasta, says the action is aimed, in essence, at what his side regards as unfair trade practices. But he acknowledged that "quite clearly we're hoping there will be price relief as a result; there is no question about that."
Even if Italy's export refund fell to 2 cents a pound of imported pasta, Mr. Rosenthal said, this could have a "significant effect on Italian imports."

HEADLINE: A Small Pasta Importer Takes On Big Competitors

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAWTHORNE, N.J., Aug. 31

 BODY:
What three big American pasta makers call unfair trade practices, Claudia Vitelli considers just good business -- and the only way a small company such as hers can get its products on the nation's grocery shelves.
The Vitelli-Elvea Company, which employs about 20 people in modest offices in this northern New Jersey suburb and at a warehouse in Linden, N.J., began importing pasta from a Turkish manufacturer, Maktas, in 1987 and marketing it under the brand name Luigi Vitelli, the great-grandfather of Ms. Vitelli's husband, Bruno. 
 Since then, the privately held company's sales have steadily grown. Ms. Vitelli, who runs Vitelli-Elvea with two partners, declined to disclose the company's earnings but said that for the fiscal year that ended today, it imported about two million cases, or 12,000 tons, of pasta, and had sales of about $12 million.
Now, though, Ms. Vitelli, the product of a Neapolitan family who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, faces legal action brought about by her competitors, the big American pasta manufacturers Hershey Foods, Borden and the Gooch Foods unit of Archer Daniels Midland.
In petitions filed in May with the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission, the big pasta makers asked for investigations into whether Vitelli-Elvea had benefited from dumping by the Turkish pasta industry or subsidies from the Turkish Government.
Ms. Vitelli says that her bigger rivals are trying to use their economic might to stifle competition from a much smaller company that through a sound idea and the willingness to take a risk, has managed to carve out a niche at the low end of the pasta market.
"They are bullies, and they are against the American spirit," she said. "I am going to fight. I will put every effort -- psychological, physical, financial -- into this."
To Ms. Vitelli, the legal fights are just the latest challenge to her company. One of her first obstacles, she recalled, was winning over retailers who had limited shelf space available and concerns about how quickly their customers would take to pasta made in Turkey. She said she had to give away 22,000 cases just to get her pasta on supermarket shelves.
But she can point to concrete results. At a Shop Rite in Jersey City recently, for example, Luigi Vitelli had nine varieties on the shelves.
Paul C. Rosenthal, a lawyer for the big American pasta makers, said Luigi Vitelli was selling its Turkish pasta for 63 percent less in the United States than the fair-market price in Turkey. His clients seek an offsetting tariff on the imports.
Mr. Rosenthal said it was doubtful that Ms. Vitelli was unaware of any subsidies received by the pasta's manufacturer, Maktas, or unaware that the Turkish company was dumping its pasta exports onto the American market -- that is, taking a loss in the hope of eventually raising prices.
If Maktas is being subsidized, Ms. Vitelli argued, those subsidies would be in accordance with what the world trade agreement permits. As for dumping, Ms. Vitelli said Maktas was aware that a Turkish product, regardless of the quality, could never compete in the American pasta market without offering a significant price advantage.
"The reason why our pasta is inexpensive is that it is made in a country where labor is still extremely cheap," Ms. Vitelli said, adding that workers in the Maktas plant made the equivalent of about $80 a month.
In a separate action, Hershey has sued Vitelli-Elvea in United States District Court in Harrisburg, Pa., contending that the Turkish pasta it sells does not use 100 percent durum semolina, as stated on the Luigi Vitelli package. In June, Judge Sylvia H. Rambo rejected Hershey's request for a preliminary injunction against the pasta's sale; a trial has not yet been scheduled.

HEADLINE: Congress Returning to Face Long List of G.O.P. Promises

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
The Congress everyone discusses in superlatives -- most sweeping, most radical, most impatient -- returns to town on Tuesday. This time, it faces a job almost beyond words.
With eight months gone and deadlines circling overhead like vultures, the Republican majorities in the House and Senate take up a list of commitments this week as incomplete as it is ambitious. Legislation to overhaul Medicare, marked for passage this fall, has yet to be introduced. Bills to trim Medicaid and disassemble the welfare system have barely moved out of the House. 
 Plans to cut taxes, perhaps by $245 billion over seven years, still exist mainly on paper. Deep cuts in farm subsidies and scores of other politically incendiary programs, from public broadcasting to heating assistance for the poor, face several floor votes before final passage.
Many in this Congress want to achieve them all by year's end, in one fell swoop. Even more daunting, most are vital to achieving the Republicans' ultimate goal: a 1996 budget that takes the first step toward erasing the Federal deficit in seven years.
The great question is whether that goal, the most sweeping, radical and ambitious of all, will also prove the most elusive. No one expects an answer by the time the law supposedly requires it: Oct. 1, the day the new fiscal year begins and the old year's spending authority peters out. Too much remains undone.
"The Republicans bit off more than any Congress has ever bitten off," said Robert Reischauer, the Brookings Institution scholar who most recently ran the Congressional Budget Office. "The battle of the budget really is going to last through most of December -- and in some scenarios, I can see it going into January and February."
By itself, delay is not fatal. This Congress promised a great deal, and by many measures it is slowly delivering: about half of Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract With America has reached votes in both the House and Senate as promised, although only 2 of its 12 measures have been signed into law.
Both chambers have voted in historic fashion to rewrite the 61-year-old law governing competition in communications, and they are well on the way toward overhauling banking laws that have escaped modernization for decades. Both chambers excised $16.3 billion from the current fiscal year, an unheard-of act.
But the fiscal issues ahead are more difficult. Many, like controlling the cost of Medicare, touch exposed political nerves, and most have no easy answers. Republicans will be under crushing pressure; their majorities are slim, and their hopes for the Presidency and continued control of Congress may rest on the public's judgment of their success.
Nor can they expect help. Democrats recall that they had to pass President Clinton's first deficit-cutting budget in 1993 without a single Republican vote, and suffered for it in the 1994 midterm elections.
For survivors, this is payback time. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, for example, are sitting on their hands as the one-vote Republican majority gropes toward consensus on issues like welfare reform and tax policy.
The Senate will leap into its work on Tuesday, taking up a military spending bill and re-opening debate on a stalled version of the welfare bill that the House passed months ago. The House plans to immediately open hearings on Medicare, hoping -- like the Senate -- to produce some cost-cutting plan for consideration by late this month.
Much more remains to be done, and the time to do it is short:
*The House and the Senate have agreed on a final version of only one of the 13 spending bills, totaling about $600 billion, that finance the Federal bureaucracy and the military, and the White House has threatened to veto it. Twelve more spending bills must go to the White House; Mr. Clinton already warns he may veto six of them.
The two sides have until Oct. 1 either to reach accords on all 13 bills or allot money to run them temporarily; after that, any agency lacking a legally approved budget must shut down. Most experts expect many agencies to do just that, at least for a while, until the White House and Congress have made their rhetorical points and begin cutting spending deals.
*The House and Senate must write and pass separate versions of legislation covering the remainder of the budget, mostly tax reduction and major benefit programs like welfare, farm subsidies, Medicaid and Medicare. Most are likely to be hugely controversial, but the spending reductions in them are critical to Republican hopes of achieving a balanced budget by 2002.
Most will later be folded into a single "reconciliation" bill in each chamber, then melded into a final version that will go to the President. He is considered all but certain to veto it, setting the stage for either negotiations or a political standoff that could last into the 1996 election season.
*The Government is expected to reach its debt ceiling -- in effect, its credit limit -- some time in October, and to run out of petty cash by mid-November, when a $22 billion payment on Treasury notes falls due.
Only Congress can raise the debt ceiling, allowing the Government to borrow more money to meet its obligations. Some Republicans may seek to attach reconciliation legislation to the debt ceiling measure, forcing Mr. Clinton to choose between accepting their fiscal dictates on the most sensitive parts of the budget or throwing the entire Government into default.
Other Republicans want the debt ceiling considered by itself, in order to attach other controversial social and fiscal measures to it. Still others hope to avoid a default scenario -- the "train wreck" that has become the capital's hoariest political cliche -- by offering the White House a temporary extension of the debt limit until after the 1996 elections.
Those are the flash points. How and whether they will ignite is an open question. "If anybody can tell you where we're going this fall, they're either a fool or they're lying," one budget expert on the Senate Republican staff said last month.
The motivations of the major powers in this debate are nevertheless obvious to outside experts and the participants themselves.
Congress's Democratic minority, most agree, not only opposes the Republican proposals on their merit, but also has every interest in seeing the new majority break its promise to shrink Government.
As for the Republicans: "Unity is breaking down in both houses, and between the houses, too," Stan Collender, the Federal budget expert for the accounting firm Price Waterhouse, said last month. "But the way it's happening is interesting."
People in Congress are thinking about their re-election for the first time, he said. And so Representative George Nethercutt of Washington, the Republican who deposed Speaker Thomas S. Foley last fall by depicting him as a pork-barrel politician, is becoming an ardent defender of farm subsidies in his agricultural district. And Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the Budget Committee chairman and a premier advocate of fiscal balance, labored last month against Republican cuts in Indian programs and in Energy Department projects that play important economic roles in his state.
Significantly, Mr. Gingrich has in recent weeks begun to emphasize that legislating is a two-sided affair, and that few deals as big and contentious as a Federal budget are struck without compromise.
A senior aide among Senate Republicans raised the same prospect in a recent interview, suggesting that the party may find it more prudent to strike a deal when public opposition to difficult spending cuts starts to mount and Mr. Clinton begins to rain vetoes that Republicans are unable to override.
"If we fail to produce a balanced budget, he wins in a big way," the aide said. "So for the political survival of Republicans in Congress, I think we have to produce it, somehow, and he has to veto it. And he will veto it.
"And at that point we can say, 'We had a plan,' and he can say, 'I saved the country,' and the morning after we can say, 'O.K., what can we do now?' " A lot, he said, is possible, including changes in the Republicans' budgets, economic assumptions, spending base lines and even the seven-year target for reaching fiscal balance.
But other Republican spines are stiffening. Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of New York, an advocate of a balanced budget, said that to Republican freshmen and others in the House, talk of concessions are no more than pipe dreams.
Of speculation that the deadline might be extended, Mr. Solomon said: "I don't think that's possible. We've got to stick it out with a seven-year time line." On the issue of temporarily extending the debt limit, he said: "The President had better understand that this Congress is not going to extend that unless we get some very, very reasonable compromises. You can swear by that. The House will not budge, and I'll be leading the fight."
Mr. Solomon may be right, and Congress and the White House may be in for a long and excruciating battle over control of the Federal purse. But one expert, Kenneth M. Duberstein, a Republican strategist and former White House chief of staff, said last week that the odds for compromise may be better than many believe. For one brief interlude, he said, moving toward a balanced budget is in the political interest of the people whose opinions count most: Government leaders.
Mr. Clinton, he said, desperately needs to shore up his image as a leader, something a budget agreement would accomplish. Mr. Gingrich needs bipartisan success on a big issue like the budget to dispel at last his image as a bomb thrower and backbencher. The Presidential hopes of Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, rest in part on his ability to get things done, even with Democrats.
"Dole, Gingrich and Clinton, each in his own fashion, need to demonstrate an ability to govern," he said. "I think there's a lining up of the moons here."

APPROPRIATIONS BILLS
 The House has passed 11 of the 13 spending bills that finance all Government operations except some major benefit programs, like Medicare and Social Security, and interest payments on the national debt. The Senate has passed seven. Both chambers must pass all of them, and then approve 13 House-Senate compromise versions before they can be sent to the President.
 Agencies must cease operations if their spending bills do not become law by Oct. 1, unless Congress and the President agree to finance them temporarily.
 
Through conference and ready for the President: Legislative branch, $2.2 billion
 
Passed by both chambers heading into House-Senate conferences (dollar figures from House bils): Transportation, $38.1 billion; Military construction, $11.2 billion; Energy and Water Development, $18.7 billion; Interior, $12 billion; Treasury, Postal Service and General Government, $23.2 billion.
 
Still before the Senate (dollare figures from House bills): VA-HUD-Independent agencies, $79.4 billion; Commerce, Justice and State, $27.2 billion; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, $61 billion; Foreign operations, $11.9 billion; Defense, $240 billion; Agriculture, $62.7 billion.
 
BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND OTHER REQUIRED SPENDING
 Major benefit programs like Medicare, Medicade, Social Security and farm subsidies are covered by separate legislation called a reconciliation bill. So are tax cuts. Republicans want to use the bill as a vehicle to restrain the growth of benefit spending and sharply cut taxes; President Clinton maintains that the Republicans are going too far on all fronts, and has threatened a veto.
 Unlike other spending bills, a veto of the reconciliation package would not shut benefit programs down, but instead would allow them to operate at their existing spending levels, which have long been set by other laws.
 Among the biggest measures that are likely to be folded into the recondiliation package:
 
Medicare: Republicans propose to spend about $8 billion less in 1996 than thier budget experts say would be spent under the program's existing guidelines; this is the first down-payment on their plan to slow Medicare spending by $280 billion over the next seven years. But Congress has yet to say how this first cut would be achieved. The White House, by comparison, proposes to reduce spending by about $3.3 billion below its 1996 projections.
 
Welfare: The House passed a bill in March to turn most welfare programs over to the states, giving them a lump sum of Federal money to spend on the poor as they see fit. The Senate debated similar legislation in August but failed to reach agreement. Debate could resume this month, but if the impasse remains, Republican leaders may attach their version to the reconciliation bill.
 
Tax cuts: All sides sharply disagree over how much to cut taxes. The House has approved $350 billion in tax breaks spread over seven years; the Senate wants no more than $170 billion. In June the two chambers split the difference, alloting $245 billion for tax cuts. But neither side regards that as final, and the true size and timing of any breaks will not be settled until at least September, and probably later.
 The White House proposed in June to cut taxes by $105 billion through 2002, about $4 billion of that in 1996.
 If Mr. Clinton rejects the reconciliation bill, as many anticipate, Congress could write a compromise version with White House officials. Or it could attach the bill as an amendment to the one piece of legislation that Mr. Clinton has little choice but to sign: a bill to raise the debt ceiling.
 
THE DEBT CEILING
 Though the Government may seem to run up deficits with abandon, it is authorized by law to carry only so much debt -- about $4.9 trillion, actually. When deficit spending hits that debt ceiling this fall, virtually the entire Government would grind to a halt unless Congress votes to raise the debt limit, thus autorizing the Goverment to sell more Treasury bonds to finance operations. Failure to raise the ceiling could cause the United States to default on its obligations, potentially touching off a global financial crisis.
 The Government will probalbly hit the debt ceiling in October, but it can continue to operate on a cash basis, spending tax revenue as it trickles in, for several weeks. Most experts believe the Treasury would run completely dry in November. (pg. D9)

HEADLINE: Sharp Rebound for U.S. Makers of Memory Chips

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Straight out of Boise State University, Steven R. Appleton joined a local memory-chip maker called Micron Technology Inc. in 1983. It soon seemed that he had chosen a dead-end career.
In the mid-1980's, the memory-chip business appeared to be lost forever to Japan. One major American semiconductor company after another, even Intel, the memory-chip pioneer, dropped out of the field, figuring that it would always be a poor business. 
 "Back then," recalled Mr. Appleton, who is now Micron's chairman, "it was just a matter of survival for us. "
The company, based in Boise, Idaho, is doing far more than surviving these days. For its 1995 fiscal year, which ended last week, analysts expect its profit to double, to more than $800 million, on sales of $2.8 billion. And Micron has become a Wall Street favorite, as investors have driven up its stock price fivefold since last fall.
Not bad for a company that was barely profitable as recently as three years ago. Indeed, companies like Micron and Texas Instruments have managed a remarkable American comeback in the market for memory chips. In doing so, they took advantage of a recession in Japan, American trade policy and the boom in personal computers, which more and more have a voracious appetite for memory.
Today, the American memory-chip makers are thriving -- a turnaround that has left experts shaking their heads in surprise and delight.
"In the early 1990's, I had written off memory chips for good as a commodity business," said David B. Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor and Intel director. "But now it's a very profitable market. It just goes to show that in fast-moving technology businesses, never say never."
Besides Japan's woes and Washington's trade advocacy, the unexpected turn of events is explained by the growth and broadening of the personal computer market -- as the machines increasingly go into homes and people use them to communicate, roam the Internet and play multimedia games.
"We're seeing the personal computer change into something far more than just a machine for crunching numbers and writing reports," said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, an analyst at the International Data Corporation, a research firm. "And all these new uses for the PC mean a greater demand for memory."
The latest new demand for computer memory is coming from Windows 95. Over the next year, millions of people are expected to buy the Microsoft Corporation's husky new operating system, with 11 million lines of code. And the new games, word processors and data base software made to run on Windows 95 are also big programs, brimming with new features and flashy graphics.
With too little memory, a machine runs these fancy new programs at a crawl or crashes altogether. The memory chips, known as D-RAM's (dynamic random access memory), hold the current work on a personal computer for quick access -- as opposed to the computer's hard disk, where software programs are permanently stored.
For many computer users, the decision to buy Windows 95 is soon followed by a realization that they need $200 or more in added memory. Some retailers are selling Windows 95 together with memory upgrades -- typically four megabytes, or four million bytes. (A byte is the amount of memory needed to store one character, like a letter or number.)
Though Microsoft officials say that Windows 95 will run on a personal computer with four megabytes, they recommend eight megabytes. Most computer experts, though, say that 16 megabytes of memory is preferable if one wants to run games, search the Internet and do other things that Windows 95 is intended to make easier. Yet most desktop computers sold as recently as last Christmas came with eight megabytes, and most notebook machines had four megabytes.
"The surge in demand was well under way before, but Windows 95 will force more people to buy more memory," said Daniel Klesken, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco.
Just how quickly the demand for memory is increasing among PC buyers is evident at the Dell Computer Corporation. The direct-mail marketer of computers, based in Austin, Tex., makes its PC's after orders are in hand. Every machine is made to order for each customer, and its customers tend to be somewhat more experienced users than the PC market as a whole.
By the end of last year, the computers sold by Dell had an average of 10 megabytes of memory. Today, the average is 16 megabytes, up from 14 megabytes two months ago. "The demand for memory just keeps creeping up steadily," said Michael Dell, the company's chairman.
To line up supplies of memory chips, Mr. Dell has just returned from a trip to Boise to meet with Micron, which is becoming an increasingly important supplier for Dell, along with Toshiba of Japan and Samsung of South Korea. "Steve Appleton and I have become friends real quickly," Mr. Dell said. "We need him and he needs us."
Theft is often a reliable indicator of demand, and there seems to be a brisk illegal traffic in memory chips. On Aug. 23, for example, the campus police at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sent a bulletin on the university's electronic-mail system to alert people of the "growing problem" of the "theft of computer memory chips."
The worldwide memory-chip market is expected to grow nearly 60 percent this year, to $37.1 billion, according to Robertson, Stephens. Next year, it estimates, it will expand 35 percent more, to $50 billion.
Steadily rising demand is one reason the memory-chip market is growing so much in dollar terms. Another reason is that the recession in Japan, starting in the early 1990's, forced the Japanese producers to pull back from a strategy of building more capacity to gain market share, with little or no regard for profit.
When the Japanese stopped building new chip factories, the South Koreans stepped in. Still, the let-up in Japan, combined with extremely strong demand, has meant that chip prices have held steady instead of dropping 30 percent annually as they had for years before.
"Prices haven't fallen in four years," said Brian Turner, owner of Chip Merchant, a San Diego retailer. "What I'm selling for $100 now would be selling for $30 if the traditional price declines had continued."
Not surprisingly, memory-chip factories are being built to try to cash in on the suddenly lucrative market. In addition to South Korea and Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and China are all building plants.
This year, 14 new factories are starting production, increasing supply of D-RAM's by 46 percent, Tom Thornhill of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco estimated.
In 1996, 16 more factories are expected to begin churning out chips. Yet with demand rising 70 percent a year, most analysts predict that memory chips will continue in short supply for the next couple of years.
In Boise, Micron has aggressive plans for growth. Since 1991, the company has doubled production. Next year, it intends to increase its chip-making capacity by 30 percent. Earlier this year, Micron announced that it would build a sprawling $1.3 billion chip factory in Lehi, Utah.
Over the years, Micron did benefit from anti-dumping cases brought by the United States Government against Japan and South Korea, and from the 1986 semiconductor agreement with Japan to give American chip makers greater access to the Japanese market.
But company strategies and economic shifts played a far greater role than Government policy. Micron, for example, has been an innovator in chip design, shrinking the size of its chips and making them easier to package for PC makers.
So when the competitive assault from Japan eased, Micron was positioned to be a winner, helping double the United States' share of the market to more than 20 percent since 1991. "There's no question that the U.S. has made a comeback," Mr. Appleton said. "But we suffered for years from competing against countries instead of companies, and there's still plenty of competition out there."

HEADLINE: Unions Open Drive to Recruit Immigrants

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
With a nod to the past and an eye to the future, leaders of labor unions in New York announced an organizing effort among the thousands of new immigrants now working for low wages and no benefits in supermarkets, factories and stores throughout the city.
"This will be an effort that has not been seen in this city since the 1960's, when the taxi drivers and public employees pushed for collective bargaining," said Brian McLaughlin, an Assemblyman from Queens who is also the president of the New York City Central Labor Council, an umbrella group of union locals chartered by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The council donated $250,000 to begin the campaign, which will first focus on a score of stores in upper Manhattan where it says Hispanic immigrants are paid $250 for 72-hour weeks. 
 "All you have to do is look around New York City and see the diversity of our work force and see the future of the New York City labor movement," he said. "We want to create the same opportunities for today's immigrant and minority laborers that the movement provided to immigrants and minorities 100 years ago."
The drive, which was announced at a breakfast before the city's Labor Day Parade, will provide for some 100 workers to be trained as organizers through the Harry Van Arsdale Jr. Center for Labor Studies at the State University of New York's Empire State College. The first group of people to be trained will work with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union in reaching out to employees of supermarkets and other food stores.
The drive comes at a time when organized labor's primary focus has been defending the rights and benefits of current members, rather than attracting new members. At the same time, thousands of immigrants -- legal and illegal -- have flooded the city, often working in businesses that skirt or flout labor laws.
Mark Perrone, a regional vice president for the food workers' union, said the organizing efforts had already resulted in one large store's increasing wages and benefits for some 250 workers. He said that many of the 3,000 other workers in the stores that are the focus of the campaign were paid in cash, with no taxes or social security withheld from their pay.
Labor Secretary Robert Reich told the audience at the breakfast that the Clinton Administration was intent on protecting workers and also supported an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25.
"Before I started fighting for the rights of labor, I used to be 6 foot 5," joked the diminutive Mr. Reich, whose head barely peeked above the podium. "This administration is going to continue to fight for working people until I completely vanish."
Some of that humor in the face of a tough fight, along with a vision of the multiethnic movement union officials have advocated, was evident along the Fifth Avenue parade route, as thousands of marchers clutching banners and balloons strode cheerfully under sunny skies. Huge trucks crept up the avenue blasting their horns to cheers from small but enthusiastic groups of onlookers. Dancing dragons heralded a contingent of Asian garment workers, while a salsa band rocked the crowd a few blocks away.
Christina Molina, a retired teacher from the Bronx, jumped up and down, clapping and waving to the floats that drifted past to the tune of "We Shall Not Be Moved."
"We wouldn't be able to be out here if it wasn't for all the benefits," she said. "We're just sorry that the labor force is like it is. Employees are easily replaced now. There's no loyalty. The loyalty we grew up with."
Inez Layne, a unionized garment worker, said she was pleased with the reaction from passers-by.
"We want to show them power in this city," she said. "We need to keep everything in America like it used to be."
As is his habit, John Cardinal O'Connor stood outside St. Patrick's Cathedral, beaming and waving to the marchers. He said it was important that people be reminded of the union's role as intermediary.
"Is the corporate structure the important thing or is it the right to negotiate?" he said. "I suggest we have informal, amiable meetings between business leaders and union leaders to see if we can come to an understanding of the importance of both."
In keeping with the spirit of the day, a few hundred garment workers split off from the parade to protest outside a Gap store on Lexington Avenue. They accused the clothing retailer of doing business with latin American contractors who employ children. A statement issued by the company said it had failed to substantiate those allegations, although union officials remained skeptical.
"In the global economy and global village, these companies have a responsibility to have a certain basic standard against child labor," said Jay Mazur, the president of UNITE, the garment workers' union. "Children belong in schools."
Along the parade route, David Eisenstadt helped serenade a police officer to the strains of the reggae song "One Love." A drummer who belongs to Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, Mr. Eisenstadt smiled when asked if he felt uncomfortable marching through the heart of a neighborhood that was home to countless corporate bosses.
"I think more of them are becoming interested in what happens to the working person," he said. " You need two people to make a living."
Larry Siegel, a banjo player who led the band, launched into "Don't Worry, Be Happy," insisting that he was there to celebrate, not complain.
"We're trying to preserve a living wage and the spirit of the union and not to be taken advantage of," he said. "That's the best we can do in 1995."

Mexican Stocks Rise on Vow by President

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY Sept. 4

 BODY:
Stocks soared to a nine-month high today as investors cheered President Ernesto Zedillo's pledge to increase spending to bolster the economy.
In the first day of trading since the President's state-of-the-nation address on Friday, the leading stock market index jumped 73.05 points, or 2.9 percent, to 2,590.04 -- its biggest one-day gain in two months. The rally occurred as financial markets in the United States were closed for Labor Day, reducing demand from foreign investors. 
 "Investors are expecting that as the President said in his first state-of-the-nation address, the recovery will be a priority in the next few months," said Esteban Rojas, an analyst with Arka Casa de Bolsa S.A.
Construction and cement companies, which stand to benefit from increased spending on public works projects, led the market's rally.
Trading on the stock exchange, although below the daily average for the last three months of 94 million shares, was still substantial, with 77.1 million shares changing hands.
The day's close of the stock market index was the highest since Nov. 30, when it closed at 2,591.34. The index has climbed 79 percent since reaching a 28-month low of 1,447.52 on Feb. 27.
Mexican financial markets were closed on Friday for the President's address.

Japan's Job Market Shocks Collegians

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 4

 BODY:
While most Americans observed Labor Day by taking the day off, more than 12,000 college students in Japan, who graduate next spring, packed into the giant Tokyo Dome sports stadium today with the anxious hope of landing jobs.
Hundreds lined up before dawn, some having traveled from distant cities by plane or train. Wearing their trademark "recruit suits" -- navy blue suits, white shirts, striped ties and black shoes -- they came for a huge job counseling program organized by the Ministry of Labor. 
 September brings the formal start of Japan's annual job-recruitment season. But after nearly five years of recession and "job shokku," or job shock, those entering the work force face the most forbidding season in years, and many have settled for jobs they would have once dismissed.
"I am looking for a job as a receptionist, a sales clerk -- it doesn't matter," said Takako Nakahara, who flew more than 500 miles from her two-year college in southern Japan for today's program .
"I got an interview with one company, a manufacturer of bathtubs, and I told them I really wanted to be a receptionist," Ms. Nakahara said. "But the prospects for me to get that job are low because many other people wanted it."
High school and college graduates -- especially women -- have borne the brunt of Japan's economic pain. Thanks in large part to the lifetime employment practices of most Japanese companies, the nation's official unemployment rate is only 3.2 percent -- a level Americans would consider a victory over joblessness.
But the reality behind the statistic is more grim, and it was on display today as students moved among the tables of more than 600 companies, including some of the country's largest. Because companies are loath to lay off workers, the primary tool for cutting labor costs has been to avoid hiring.
Even seniors from some of Japan's respected four-year universities were competing for jobs as sales clerks, secretaries, construction workers and entry-level bookkeepers.
With lifetime decisions hanging before them, almost everyone was serious -- even the small number of renegades who wore gray suits instead of blue. Everyone examined the information provided by each company -- its recruitment goals, academic standards, salary ranges and even its holiday schedule -- as if it were a racing form.
Most tried to select a handful of companies for interviews, and they were clear about which jobs were for which gender. Although gender-based discrimination is illegal in Japan and there were no signs saying "women need not apply," the difference in treatment between men and women was noticeable and ubiquitous.
"We are offering 10 positions for men and 5 for women," said Akihisa Hasuo, the personnel chief for Nisshim Fudosan, a small construction company. "For men, it's mainly salespeople and career-track jobs. For women, the jobs are for generally clerical. It doesn't mean women can only do clerical work, of course. Even if you're hired as a clerical person you can move on to other jobs."
If some executives were more discreet, both men and women had no misconceptions about where to look for jobs. Women moved almost exclusively to the tables of companies looking for clerical workers, secretaries and sales clerks. The men signed for interviews at companies offering career prospects in management, engineering, accounting and marketing.
"I am more fit for the clerical track," said Chika Naito, a senior majoring in Japanese literature at Showa Women's College. "I once thought of pursuing the career track, but this year those jobs are so difficult to get."
Ms. Naito said she wrote letters to 200 companies over the last year. So far, however, she has had no luck.
Tomoko Kusano, a senior at Kasei University in Tokyo, has the confident and forthright manner of an aspiring professional. But her efforts to find an entry-level job in accounting have not been encouraging.
"I got an interview at a chemical and construction company, but they had only one job to offer," she said. "They said they wanted both women and men, but they said they only wanted students in law, business or management and I come from the literature department."
Because of her academic weakness, Ms. Kusano doubled her course work during the last six months by going to a vocational school for training in accounting. But she said she had failed the entrance examination -- the first hurdle at many companies for winning an interview.
For many smaller companies, job shokku has allowed them to hire students who would have insisted on joining bigger and seemingly more prestigious companies a few years ago.
"Since the start of the year, we had inquiries from 10,000 students -- we couldn't even deal with it," said Mr. Hasuo of Nissham Fudosan, a company that builds condominiums.
A few women grumbled about the more limited opportunities they were given, but they were discreet. "Many companies claim to employ without regard to gender, but in practice certain numbers of them employ men only," said a woman who insisted on anonymity.
Young men did not have it easy either. That became clear listening to the representative of Sato Construction, who boasted that his company was "No. 1 in steel-reinforced concrete" and had built the Cinderella castle at Tokyo Disneyland.
Though Sato did have a few immediate white-collar openings, the company's representative told the men most of the jobs were at the construction sites.
"Five years after you join the company, you aim at being the team leader at a construction site," he said. "That's like being head of a small company, because you have to think about your costs and profits. After that, you aim at being head of a much bigger construction site, one with perhaps 200 workers. And after another five years, then you aim for an office job."
That sounded good enough for Yosuke Meguro, a senior in business management at Ishinomake Senshu University, a respected four-year college about 150 miles north of Tokyo. "I'm hoping to get a job in the second category, because I would like to have a good feel of construction," he said.
Of course, he added, "before we become team leaders, we will have to do some real physical work."

HEADLINE: Fireworks on Jerusalem's 3,000th Year

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 4

 BODY:
To the boisterous accompaniment of fireworks, dancers, laser beams, politics and controversy, the city of Jerusalem today began a 15-month celebration of the 3,000 years since King David wrested the hilltop town from the Jebusites and proclaimed it the capital of the Jewish people.
"United Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people and the capital of the state of Israel," Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared in opening ceremonies outside the Parliament. Mr. Rabin, who was born in Jerusalem and led the Israeli Army when the Old City was taken in the 1967 war, added: "United Jerusalem is ours! Jerusalem forever!" 
 But while Mr. Rabin also spoke of the 3,000 years as "a message of tolerance between religions and love between peoples," the grand party was boycotted by Palestinian Arabs and Western Europeans and criticized by many Israelis as a one-sided celebration of a city on which many faiths and people have claims. No major foreign government has recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and the Israelis and Palestinians have agreed to negotiate its status in the final round of their negotiations on Arab self-rule.
Palestinian Arabs, who comprise a quarter of Jerusalem's population and who seek East Jerusalem for their capital, refused any part in the "Jerusalem 3000" festival. A statement issued by the Palestinian Authority led by Yasir Arafat asserted that "the Israeli aim of these celebrations is to affirm that the city which was subjected to many forced changes over the past 28 years is a united Israeli city and that the only thing left is for the world to recognize this alleged unification."
Last month the European Union rejected Israel's invitation to sponsor cultural events on the grounds that the festival laid too exclusive an emphasis on Jerusalem as a Jewish and Israeli city.
The United States has made no statement on the festival, but Ambassador Martin Indyk was absent from the opening ceremonies. An embassy spokesman said protocol did not require the Ambassador to attend a cultural event.
The opening ceremonies also came under attack from Israeli members of the Peace Now movement, which champions peace with the Arabs. Leaders of Peace Now asserted that holding one opening-day ceremony on the original site of King David's Jerusalem, now outside the walled Old City, was a provocation to the Arabs, since part of the site is an Arab village called Silwan, where Jewish settlers forcibly seized several Arab houses four years ago with tacit endorsement and support from the Government.
Silwan has remained a source of friction, controversy and lawsuits ever since, and a symbol to the Palestinians of efforts by Israeli nationalists to elbow them out of Jerusalem. Peace Now leaders declared there was no place more appropriate to begin the celebrations than the "City of David," but the movement said the site was also "a powerful symbol that settlers are above the law and the Palestinians beneath it."
The brief opening ceremony at the City of David, which preceded the gala at the Parliament, was held under tight security in a tent next to an archeological excavation. About 300 Israeli dignitaries attended, including Mr. Rabin; Ehud Olmert, the Mayor of Jerusalem, and Teddy Kollek, his longtime predecessor.
Soldiers and policemen were perched on the roofs of nearby Arab homes, but the only evident demonstration was a Palestinian flag floated aloft by balloons.
Despite the controversies, the opening ceremonies gave a foretaste of what is scheduled to be an impressive schedule of events, ranging from concerts by the Berlin State Opera under Daniel Barenboim to a "King David's Feast" next March, at which 500 people will eat from specially made Rosenthal china at a 12-course kosher dinner made by 12 of the world's leading chefs.
Bright banners emblazoned with "3000" have been fluttering for weeks from every street light. At the stroke of 8 P.M., the sky over the Parliament and the Israel Museum exploded in fireworks prepared by Alberto Navarro of Seattle, while laser beams traced the night sky.
Among many other events scheduled during the next months are a night of Psalms on Mount Scopus and a huge parade on Oct. 11 with floats, bands and dancers from around the world. In November, Dutch botanists will plant thousands of bulbs in the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens. The final event will be a concert on Jan. 7, 1997.
Much of the controversy about "Jerusalem 3000" has been laid at the feet of Mayor Olmert, a member of the conservative Likud bloc. The idea for the festival, however, began with Mr. Kollek.
Mr. Kollek's initial idea, according to Yossi Tal-Gan, head of the festival, was "marketing Jerusalem to the wide world for touristic and economic reasons," adding, "He wanted to create a program and thus develop the city as a tourist attraction through Government and private investment."
But once talks opened with the Palestinians in 1993, and a Likud administration won the Mayor's office in 1994, the preparations became increasingly politicized. Once the decision was taken to include Jerusalem's status in the negotiations, any claim to the city by either side became an instant dispute.

Guerrilla Kills Israeli Settler
 JERUSALEM, Tuesday, Sept. 5 (Reuters) -- A Palestinian guerrilla stabbed an Israeli to death and wounded his wife at a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank early today, security sources said.
The attacker entered the Michmash settlement, near the Palestinian town of Ramallah, under cover of darkness. He fatally stabbed a settler who had gone outside after hearing a noise and then knifed the settler's wife, the sources said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

Truck Boom Erodes Gains From Fuel Savings
The boom in mini-vans, pickups and sport utility vehicles has had unwanted side effects: increased air pollution and a greater dependency on oil imports. That's because light trucks are far less fuel efficient than cars, getting an average of 20 miles to a gallon of gasoline, while cars average 28. 
 In response, the Clinton Administration is considering the first significant increase in years in the mileage standard for trucks. Auto makers plan to fight the move, but conservation groups and other critics say the companies have not even tried to improve the fuel efficiency of light trucks. [Page A1.]

The Next Big Trade Dispute: Pasta?
Italy's pasta makers are shipping as much as they can spare to the United States, a strategy paying off with steadily growing sales. But now they face complaints filed by three leading American pasta makers contending that the foreign producers use Government subsidies at home to sell pasta in the United States at prices below cost.

In Japan, September is the beginning of the annual job-recruitment season, and 12,000 college students packed a stadium in Tokyo yesterday for a job-counseling program.

After nearly five years of recession, many of those entering the work force are settling for jobs they would have once dismissed. [D2.]

Prudential Securities continues to be plagued by the limited partnerships it sold in the 1980's. Even as the firm saw a $110 million settlement with some investors receive a judge's preliminary approval, other investors sued the firm last week. The latest class-action suit contends that Prudential failed to meet the terms of a settlement reached three years ago involving two partnerships. [D6.]

HEADLINE: Battling Against Big Powerboats

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: HOPATCONG, N.J., Sept. 2

 BODY:
Tim Clancy was out fishing on Lake Hopatcong late the other night when his boat was almost run over by two sleek cigarette boats, one 30 feet long, the other 27 feet, he said. Both were cruising slowly. Mr. Clancy is convinced the operators saw him but did not care about his boat and fishing lines.
"As far as I'm concerned, they're both too big for a lake this size," he said. "It gets hairy out on the lake now, to the point of being dangerous." 
 Drayton Mook, 82 and a lifelong summer resident, has a different complaint. Increasingly in recent years, he says, cabin cruisers and outboards anchor in clusters off his handsome home in Byram Cove.
"One day this summer I counted 204 of them -- an all-time record," Mr. Mook said. The occupants swim, sun, socialize and party. But for Mr. Mook, the clusters become an obstacle course whenever he tries to steer his antique mahogany Chris Craft into his boathouse.
As summer draws to a close on Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey's biggest and busiest lake, an anti-boat chorus is strong and steady. All variety of powerboats whiz around the lake on summer weekends, and some residents contend that too many are too big and too powerful for a lake that is eight miles long and full of coves and islands. They complain that the biggest ones generate two- and three-foot waves that constantly pound into -- and eventually damage -- docks and seawalls, erode shorelines and make sailing and canoeing just about impossible.
"I've seen 32-foot boats out there," Marty Kane, president of the Lake Hopatcong Historical Society, said. "You expect to see that at Barnegat Bay or in the Hamptons, not on a small inland lake. There are no regulations on size. You could put the Queen Mary on the lake. We're not saying, 'Bring it back to canoes only.' But if everyone had a 16-footer, there wouldn't be any problems at all."
Few, if any, around the lake seriously promote the idea that boats longer than 16 feet must go. But a campaign is under way to create an agency to regulate boating on the lake and to charge boat owners fees to use it.
Clifford R. Lundin, the Mayor of Hopatcong, one of four communities on the lake, proposed the idea in mid-August at a symposium on the lake's future sponsored by the Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club. The club's members complain that bigger and bigger boats have ruined their tradition of weekend sailing.
Mr. Lundin seeks the creation of a strong, 12-member agency of residents to take charge of managing the lake. He says that 15 different state departments and agencies now have a regulatory say on the lake and that the state's oversight is fragmented, confused and indifferent.
"We're basically ignored by the state," Mayor Lundin said. "Its emphasis is on the Jersey Shore. All the dollars are aimed at the shore."
The board he proposes, the Lake Hopatcong Watershed Management District, would have the power to adopt and enforce boating regulations and to regulate the discharge of waste into the lake and the ground water in the lake's basin. It would also regulate storm-water runoff, businesses and all forms of construction on the shoreline.
The agency would replace a weak, 22-year-old advisory body, the Lake Hopatcong Regional Planning Board, that has no office, telephone or full-time paid staff.
The board's main accomplishment so far has been the annual "harvesting" of about two million pounds of weeds that would otherwise have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation, which erodes water quality. But the weeds are still fed by other nutrients in the lake, principally phosphorous, which comes from septic tank runoff and storm water, said Dr. Stephen Souza, the director of aquatic programs for Coastal Environment Services, a consulting firm in Princeton, and the water-quality adviser for the lake planning board.
Residents say another problem is that none of the Lake Hopatcong marinas have pumping stations to drain the portable toilets on cabin cruisers. Although there is no data on such discharge, some residents are convinced that the sewage ends up in the lake because of careless boaters.
Dr. Souza says the data on the lake's health is mixed. "There's been some improvement in the deepest part of the main body of the lake," he said. "But we have seen a decline in water quality in some coves and shallower parts."
Mayor Lundin says little headway will be made against the lake's problems without the creation of the management agency. But it would need approval of the three other towns on the lake and the state.
His proposal is modeled after the Lake George Park Commission, a powerful agency created by New York State in 1987 to protect water quality in Lake George. It has broad powers that include regulating the speed, noise and sanitary facilities of boats on the lake. Money for the commission comes from special registration fees on powerboats above 10 horsepower and sailboats over 18 feet, along with dock fees.
Mayor Lundin said the agency he proposes could employ a similar registration-fee system on Lake Hopatcong.
Some marina operators and boat owners frown on the idea of a management agency. One operator who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Lake Hopatcong can accommodate the boats on it now. The solution to the lake's problems, he said, is increasing the number of state police patrol boats to four from two and requiring that marinas have pumping stations for marine toilets.
"The lake doesn't belong to one person or people with lake-front homes," he said. "It belongs to all the people of New Jersey."
Marvin Haas of Wayne agreed as he docked his 25-foot cabin cruiser, Go For Broke, the other afternoon. "Last time I looked, this was a state lake," he said.
The lake is crowded with boats on many summer weekends, Mr. Haas said. "But we're also contributing to the local economy. We pay a good amount to dock here."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 6, 1995, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption yesterday about a dispute over the size and number of powerboats on Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey misattributed a quotation in some editions. As the article reported, it was a marina operator, speaking on condition of anonymity, who said, "The lake doesn't belong to one person or people with lakefront homes"; it was not Marvin Haas, the boat owner shown.

Boat owners, he added, are "also contributing to the local economy." (Photographs by Chris Maynard for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: 3 Nations to Resume Bargaining On the Naming of New Elements

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
AN international crisis of sorts involving the United States, Russia and Germany has been temporarily averted, and although some feathers remain badly ruffled, the parties have agreed to return to the peace table. There is now at least a chance that during the next two years they may be able reach an agreement on the disputed naming of a half dozen man-made elements.
 The substances in question, numbers 104 through 109 on the periodic table of chemical elements, were all created during the last two decades using nuclear accelerators. Only a few atoms of each of these elements were generated in any experiment, and all of them decay radioactively within a few seconds of their birth. They are of interest mainly to a small group of nuclear physicists and chemists probing the limits to which assemblages of protons and neutrons -- the nuclei of atoms -- can be pushed. 
The formal naming of these elements has little importance for science, chemists agree, but names have a great bearing on personal and institutional prestige and on the politics of the international nuclear community. In recent years, names have fueled a heated scientific squabble that came to a head late last year. Negotiators meeting in Britain last month hammered out a tentative compromise, but no final agreement is yet in sight.
 The tempest in a teapot began in March 1994, when the discoverers of Element 106 at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif, announced that they had named Element 106 seaborgium, in honor of Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, the former director of the laboratory. Dr. Seaborg, who was awarded the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, was a creator and co-discoverer of plutonium and nine other man-made elements.
 Element 106 was created and identified at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1974, and the discoverers of new elements are traditionally granted the right to name them. The name seaborgium, proposed by the Berkeley group, was promptly endorsed by the American Chemical Society, whose officials assumed that the name would be formally accepted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the world arbiter of chemical names.
 But the Americans were in for a surprise. On Aug. 31, 1994, an international panel of 20 chemists appointed by the international union's commission on nomenclature met in Hungary and drew up its own list of names. The American Chemical Society was stunned to learn that Dr. Seaborg's name had been expunged; instead of seaborgium, Element 106 was to be called rutherfordium, in honor of Ernest Rutherford, a New Zealand-born pioneer in atomic physics. (In the United States, chemists had already assigned the name rutherfordium to Element 104.)
 Another change by the international commission that infuriated the Berkeley scientists was the international union's decision to name Element 104 dubnium, in honor of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. The Berkeley group objected, not only because Americans had long used the name rutherfordium for Element 104, but because some of Dubna's claims to the discovery of new elements were said to be unsupported by adequate experimental evidence.
 The American Chemical Society also has an economic reason for objecting to the international union's slate of names. Names adopted by the American society have already been widely published in scientific journals, reference works and textbooks, and formal changes in American nomenclature would compel publishers to revise them.
 The main reason given by the international commission for striking Dr. Seaborg from the periodic table was that he was still alive. But Dr. Seaborg himself pointed out that both einsteinium and fermium (Elements 99 and 100, honoring Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi) were named while their namesakes were still alive. The names themselves, however, were classified secret at the time, since the elements were first identified as constituents of the debris of nuclear explosions.
 Albert Ghiorso, the scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory who designed much of the accelerator equipment used to discover many new elements, called the international group's names "outrageous," and the fight began.
 The quarrel reached the point that last month an ad hoc committee was convened, with representatives from Germany, Russia and the United States, the three nations responsible for creating all the new elements from Element 93 (neptunium) onward. The committee has reached a compromise, its members report, in which Element 106 would remain seaborgium, but Element 104 would become dubnium, and some other changes opposed by the Berkeley group would be adopted.
 Dr. David F. Eaton, a chemist at the Du Pont Company who serves as leader of the American delegation to the international union, said in an interview that his counterparts from Russia and Germany agreed during their recent deliberations to accept the name seaborgium for Element 106 "as a gesture of their high esteem for Dr. Seaborg," and with the hope that compromises could be reached on some other names.
 "I think that I.U.P.A.C.'s ruling that no element could be named after a living person was more a precedent of convenience than a substantive reason," Dr. Eaton said. "It was the Russians and Germans themselves who initiated the compromise meeting the three of us held, and I think they were very accommodating."
 But neither the American Chemical Society nor the Berkeley group is satisfied with the proposed compromise, he said, which in any case carries no formal weight with the international group. The nations of the world are far from agreed on names.
 "During the meetings last month," Dr. Eaton said, "I saw periodic tables published in Britain, the United States, Arabic countries and Russia, and none of them agreed on the names of Elements 101 through 109."
 However, as a result of the deliberations by the United States, Russian and German delegations, the international union's General Assembly, meeting in Guildford, England, announced that its original list of names had been changed from "definitive" to "provisional," a small victory for the Berkeley scientists. The international group also announced that it would entertain comments from interested chemists during the next five months, and these comments will be considered at the next meeting a year from now. A final meeting to resolve the naming is to take place in two years.
 Dr. Kiril I. Zamarayev of Russia, who heads the international group, reported progress in settling the dispute. But chemists familiar with the proceedings said that the battle lines had been changed and perhaps hardened by the new attitude of Germany, which no longer entirely supports the American slate. Late last year, the Germans discovered two new elements (Elements 110 and 111), neither of them yet involved in the nomenclature row. This, said a chemist, presumably entitles the discoverers, headed by Dr. Peter Armbruster at the Society for Heavy Ion Research accelerator laboratory at Darmstadt, to propose names for 110 and 111. By gaining naming rights to two new elements, he said, the Germans no longer feel impelled to support American objections to the international union's renaming of Elements 104 to 109, which include the change of a German name to a French name.
 The international group proposes that Element 105, now commonly called hahnium (for the German Otto Hahn, discoverer of nuclear fission), should be called joliotium, named for Frederic Joliot-Curie of France, a pioneer in nuclear physics.
 Element 108, which the German discoverers provisionally named hassium (for the Latin name of Hesse, a German province), would be renamed hahnium, under the international union's scheme.
 "It all seems like much ado about nothing," a chemist said, "but from a certain perspective, it matters a lot to a few people."

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise On Corporate Profit Outlook

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
A post-holiday rally drove some stock indexes to record highs yesterday, as investors bet that the economy would not slow enough to hamper the growth of corporate profits.
The rally was led by technology stocks, but automotive issues and other cyclical stocks also rose after announcements about strong August sales for General Motors and Chrysler eased concern that past interest-rate increases had stalled the economy and jeopardized this year's stock rally. 
 "Auto sales were pretty strong last month and that's giving some people encouragement," said Graham Tanaka, president of Tanaka Capital Management in New York. "The economy is in decent shape -- not too strong and not too weak."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.54 points, to 4,670.08, its third straight gain and the highest close since Aug. 9. Shares of International Paper, Boeing, G.M. and Alcoa -- companies whose profits swing with economic cycles -- rose the most.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.33 points, to a record 569.17, its seventh gain in the last eight sessions and its biggest rally since a jump of 6.11 points on July 12. The index has risen 1.8 percent in the last week. And the technology-laden Nasdaq index rose 19.83 points, to a record 1,039.30, led by Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Cisco Systems.
Among auto issues, Chrysler jumped 2 1/2, to 57 1/8; G.M. was up 3/4, to 49 1/4, and Ford Motor rose 1 1/8, to 32 3/8. On Friday, G.M. said sales of cars and light trucks rose 7.1 percent and Chrysler posted a 4 percent gain. The S.& P. auto index, which gained just 4.9 percent this year through Aug. 22, has since climbed 11 percent and closed up 7.12 points yesterday, to 244.34.
One of the declining stocks in the Dow industrials was I.B.M., down 1 5/8, to 101 1/8. Jerome B. York resigned as the company's chief financial officer to become vice chairman of Tracinda, the investment firm. The move by Mr. York, who was instrumental in the recent turnaround at I.B.M., ignited speculation that Tracinda would revive its failed bid for Chrysler.
Nearly two stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 333 million shares traded hands.
Other indexes also rose to records yesterday, including the Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks, which climbed 2.14 points, to 308.31, and the Wilshire 5,000 Index, comprising stocks on the New York, American and Nasdaq stock exchanges, up 51.81 points, to 5,674.11.
Paper industry stocks were among the gainers. Sherman Chao, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the advance came because investors were growing more confident that the economy would pick up steam later this year and drive demand for paper and the cardboard boxes used to ship goods. Some investors may be betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year, further stimulating the economy.
International Paper rose 2, to 84 1/2, while Weyerhaeuser climbed 1 3/8, to 47 1/2. Georgia-Pacific gained 1 3/4, to 92 1/4, and Champion International surged 2 1/8, to 59 3/8.
Among chemical stocks, the big gainers included Eastman Chemical, up 7/8, to 64 3/4; Rohm & Haas, up 1 5/8, to 61 5/8; and B. F. Goodrich, up 3/8, to 60 1/2.
Technology stocks gained ground because orders for software, computers and semiconductors remain strong, said Steven Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Company.
Yesterday, an Oracle executive said analysts' earnings estimates for the computer software company were too low. Oracle's shares rose 5, to 44 1/4.
"Techs should re-emerge as leaders of the market, though the gains won't be as homogeneous as the first part of the year," Mr. Goldman said.
Among the biggest technology gainers today were Dell Computer, up 5 1/2, to 80 3/4, and Micron Technology up 5, to 81 3/8. Microsoft gained 5 1/4, to 95, while Hewlett-Packard surged 4 3/4, to 83 1/8, and Intel rose 2 13/16, to 63 11/16. Cisco Systems was up 2 3/4, to 68 1/8.
Airline stocks rose after USAir said it expected to report a pretax profit for the third quarter and full year on stronger-than-anticipated traffic. USAir rose 1 3/4, to 9 3/4. The gains helped lift the Dow Jones transportation average 32.70 points, to a record 1,945.19.

HEADLINE: Cooperate, Dole Tells Clinton, Or Face Brawl With Congress

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 5

 BODY:
In one of his sharpest attacks yet on President Clinton, Senator Bob Dole warned today that the fall Congressional session would be a rough-and-tumble affair unless the White House joined with Republicans to balance the budget, cut taxes, eliminate bureaucracy and rework the welfare system.
Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader and current front-runner among Republican Presidential candidates, said Mr. Clinton could either climb on board the Republican legislative juggernaut or face all-out political warfare. 
 "If the President wants to join us in forging fundamental change in government, we'll welcome him to the conservative revolution," Mr. Dole said in a major speech to the Economic Club of Chicago.
"But he should know," Mr. Dole continued, "that we will never compromise away the mandate the American people gave us last November. This will not be an autumn of compromise. This fall we will win our fight for revolutionary change vote by vote, bill by bill."
In any event, Mr. Dole concluded, come next fall Republicans plan to "change the occupant of the White House."
Mr. Clinton did not immediately respond to the Dole challenge, which included a call for a total overhaul of the Federal tax code, with emphasis on sharply reduced rates, as well as adoption of a constitutional amendment to make enactment of new taxes much more difficult.
In past months, Mr. Clinton has said he would like to work with Republicans on Capitol Hill this fall, as long as their revolution does not cause undue hardship on the needy. Otherwise, he has warned, the Republican-controlled Congress can expect to contend with White House vetoes.
His tough talk notwithstanding, Mr. Dole did suggest one area of compromise today: Medicare. He said the program was too important to the nation's elderly and in too much financial trouble to be the subject of partisan debate.
"Let's agree to take Medicare out of the realm of politics," Mr. Dole proposed. "When Social Security was in trouble back in the early 1980's, both parties agreed the program was too important for playing politics. So we worked together to fix it. Medicare is no less important."
Mr. Dole's speech seemed intended in good part to reinforce the Senator's credentials with conservatives, who control the Republican nominating process and who sometimes see him as too moderate. Out on the campaign trail, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, at this point Mr. Dole's chief rival for the nomination, has been boasting that he is more conservative than Mr. Dole and therefore deserves the support of the Republican right.
The speech marked the end of Mr. Dole's Labor Day weekend tour through the Midwest, an event-packed swing designed to reinvigorate his campaign, which has been flagging a bit since his poor showing a couple of weeks back in an Iowa straw poll. In Indianapolis on Monday, for example, he grabbed bold headlines and network news coverage with a biting attack on "elitist liberals" and a demand for formal adoption of English as the nation's official language.
Mr. Dole told his Chicago business audience today that the country was on the threshold of a "fabulous future" but that the threshold would never be crossed if Mr. Clinton continued to embrace "the outdated economic mind-set of the 1930's."
"The only barrier preventing America from reaching her full potential is a failure of leadership and a failure of vision, not a failure of our people," the Senator asserted.
He went on to accuse the President of "zero-sum thinking" and said Mr. Clinton was guilty of encouraging "envy and class warfare."
"They always talk about attacking 'the rich' and hitting people they feel got a 'free ride,' " Mr. Dole said, sarcasm in his voice.
Then Mr. Dole laid out his own vision for a prosperous nation.
He proposed a much-simplified revenue system of vastly lower rates in which capital gains levies would be all but eliminated and a family of four earning $30,000 a year or less would pay almost no taxes.
The Senator's details were sketchy. But he said that once rates had been cut, the Internal Revenue Service should be sharply scaled back and the country should adopt a constitutional amendment requiring a three-fifths vote by each house of Congress to raise any new taxes.
"I will fight for a lower, fairer, flatter and simpler tax system," Mr. Dole promised. "Any fair system would not penalize but instead would reward people for working harder, investing wisely and saving more. End the I.R.S. as we know it."

HEADLINE: New York Fiscal Chaos Gives First-Day Jitters to Teachers

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
If the opening of New York City schools this week seems more chaotic than usual, consider the case of Karen Bloom, would-be teacher, who woke up yesterday unemployed, by midmorning was hired as a substitute at Public School 124 and by noon had landed a full-time teaching job at P.S. 111.
Yesterday, on the first day 65,000 New York City teachers returned from summer vacation, principals were still making last-minute staffing decisions after an angry summer of budget negotiations ended without resolving basic questions, like how many teachers the city will have, how large classes will be and which teachers will teach where. 
 At 8 A.M., Ms. Bloom, wearing high heels and a flowing dress, went to interview for a substituting job at a private school. At 9 A.M., she arrived at P.S. 124 in Chinatown, which, she thought, had offered her part-time work. Officials there told her that someone had given her the wrong information but that she could have a two-month substitute teaching job anyway. She took it, started cleaning her assigned room and called her fiance to say she would be home late.
He told her that she had a message from another school, P.S. 111 on West 53d Street. They had full-time work if she wanted it.
"So I boogied into a cab and came up here," she said at 2 P.M. yesterday, using a broom borrowed from one of her new colleagues to sweep out her fourth-floor room. "I'm so happy to have a job. Anywhere. Any grade."
Of course, the beginning of a new school year is always filled with chaos and some amount of uncertainty, and not just in New York City. On Long Island, where most schools were reopening yesterday or today, a number of districts face budget problems or looming labor disputes. In New Jersey's largest district, Newark, students will report on Monday to schools that have been taken over by the state. Connecticut, though, is already mostly past the first-day crises -- most schools there opened last week.
But in New York City, the nation's largest school district, the normal confusion has been amplified this year as the central Board of Education and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have battled over $230 million in budget cuts and taken turns blaming each other for delaying the decisions necessary to open the schools.
Even yesterday, more than 1,200 teachers, most of them unlicensed, still did not have assignments, and the board had not ruled out layoffs, which would require further shuffling of the teaching force during the first few weeks of school. High school students begin school today and junior high and elementary school students begin tomorrow.
"This year, we are facing a tough year because of budget cuts," said Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers. "I think there is going to be confusion -- there is always confusion. I think there is a bit more than usual, but it's not something that can't be overcome."
It is clear, though, that there will be fewer school secretaries, guidance counselors will be rare commodities and teachers will face more students in a classroom.
"Everyone is doing double duty," said Frieda Homer, the assistant principal at Thomas Jefferson High School in East New York, Brooklyn. "All administrative personnel have picked up obligations that are not part of their job situation."
She said her school lost staff through transfers, retirements, sabbaticals and excessing -- a domino-like provision of the contract in which a newer teacher loses a job at one school to make room for a more senior teacher. The first teacher can then bump a teacher in another school.
In spite of the confusion from the budget changes, teachers at schools throughout the city faced the new year with the same enthusiasm and trepidation that a new school year always inspires.
"I usually can't sleep the night before," said Nina Frankel, a pre-kindergarten teacher who has been teaching for 10 years at Public School 111. "The children line up in the playground at 8 o'clock in their new clothes and their new backpacks. It's very nice to see. It's very emotional."
The scenes of the first day back for teachers at P.S. 111 were not unlike those at any of the city's 1,000 or so schools, officials said. Teachers were moving furniture, putting up bright new trimming around bulletin boards, attending meetings about who would do cafeteria duty and placing new labels on baskets of blocks and other supplies they had bought for their classes during the summer.
Even though yesterday was officially their first day back, many of the teachers -- the principal, Robert Kinzelberg, estimated as many as 40 percent of them -- spent some time at the school last week to prepare their rooms for the new school year.
Millie Velazquez, a kindergarten teacher, was knee-deep in plastic blocks, stuffed red apples and cutouts from school catalogues as she organized her room.
Last week, she had come in to scrub down her room, which she divided into areas for music, science and the library and for what she called "pretend." In another corner was a table with sand that she had bought at Home Depot.
"I really want the first day to be special for them," Ms. Velazquez said of her kindergarten class.
But Ms. Velazquez, like many other teachers without city certification, said that when she came in loaded down with her new materials, she was still not sure whether she would have a job at P.S. 111.
"I guess I still don't know," she said, noting that she could lose her job to a more senior teacher if there are further staff reductions.
As Ms. Bloom, the new teacher, was sweeping out her room, other teachers came by to introduce themselves. Karen Rothstein stopped by to congratulate her for getting hired.
"Congratulations to you, too," Ms. Bloom said. Ms. Rothstein had only been hired a few minutes ago, too. She had been teaching at P.S. 126 but was told yesterday that she would no longer be needed.
"I went down to the district office," she said. "and I told them, 'I'm a great teacher and I have a lot of love to give these children, and I need a teaching job and I'm not leaving here until I get one' -- in a very friendly way, of course."
She was told to go to P.S. 111, where she was hired to teach fifth grade.
Ms. Bloom, who is 25, earned her master's degree in elementary education at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., and sent her resume to 30 New York City schools.
"This is my first job," she said happily, not even riled by the dead roach she found in her room. "I am beside myself."
Ms. Bloom was asked if she was going to begin teaching without an orientation to the school system, or even to the school.
She stopped sweeping a moment to think about that.
"Maybe they had an orientation this morning," she said. "But I don't know. I was in Chinatown."

HEADLINE: Death-Rate Rankings Shake New York Cardiac Surgeons

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
It was happening again, and Dr. Richard Dal Col could hardly believe it. An emergency cardiac patient, yet another "salvage case," was dead, this time before surgery could even begin. Enraged and frightened, Dr. Dal Col stormed from the operating room into the administrator's office of St. Peter's Hospital in Albany.
"We've got to do something!" he recalls shouting in his anger at the system. "They're going to pull my license if this continues." 
 A month later, when the New York State Health Department released its annual report card of cardiac surgery, one of the first of its kind in the nation, St. Peter's had the highest mortality rate of any hospital in the state. A year later, Dr. Dal Col had the worst record of any heart surgeon in the state -- the beginning of a period of anguish and self-doubt that has only eased as he has moved off the bottom of the list.
The year 1993, when the ranking was announced, was far better for Dr. Jeffrey Gold at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he enjoys life at the top of the list. Dr. Gold was No. 3 the year Dr. Dal Col was last of the 87 heart surgeons listed by name. In the 1995 report he is No. 1.
"How does it feel to be the Willie Mays of heart surgery?" he was asked by CBS. Last week, a man needing heart surgery called from upstate. "Doctor," he said, "I'm 47 years old, I have two young children, I want to live -- and I want the best."
The story of Dr. Gold and Dr. Dal Col illustrates how the elite world of New York cardiac surgeons has struggled to adjust to a new set of rules aimed at improving care. The changes have led to turmoil within the insular cardiac community, forcing at least 21 low-performing doctors out of heart surgery in New York. At the same time, doctors suspect that some high-risk surgical patients are pressured to go out of state.
In 1991, New York became the first state in the nation to release surgeon-specific death rates for coronary bypass surgery. Pennsylvania is the only other state that does so. New York health officials and many doctors say the system, though imperfect, has dramatically lowered the risks of undergoing a coronary bypass, the most common form of heart surgery. Statistics appear to support their claim: Over a recent four-year period, the mortality rate of bypass surgery in New York -- adjusted for severity of illness -- dropped from 4.17 deaths in 100 patients to 2.45. New York's actual mortality rate for bypass surgery in 1993, the most recent year available -- 2.71 deaths in 100 patients -- is the lowest reported rate in the nation. Only those deaths that occur in the hospital are counted.
Yet the cardiac report card, which is not done for any other medical specialty in New York, remains a subject of intense debate. There is a widespread, if unproven, belief among doctors that some of New York State's 133 heart surgeons are turning away severely ill patients for fear a death will hurt their rankings, even though the system makes adjustments for high-risk patients.
A study by doctors at the Cleveland Clinic, one of the nation's leading cardiac centers, found that in recent years the patients referred to Cleveland from New York were significantly sicker than the clinic's other patients -- and their numbers have increased. "They were exactly the kind of patients anyone would think twice about before operating," Dr. Nowa Omoigui, the main author of the study, said.
"There's a lot of talk that the sickest patients are going out of state," Barbara A. DeBuono, the New York State Health Commissioner, said. "The fact is that a person in cardiac arrest is not going to be flown to Ohio."
Dr. Omoigui points out that severely ill heart patients in western New York may simply more often be referred to Cleveland by doctors concerned about the high cardiac mortality rates reported at upstate hospitals in recent years.
Other criticism of the report centers on what is termed risk-factor inflation. Under the state system, doctors report patients' risk factors -- like age, the pumping capacity of the heart, previous heart attacks -- which are weighed so that doctors who take on severely ill patients are not unfairly penalized. In some cases, the death of a patient with many risk factors will count on a doctor's record as only half a mortality.
In a recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine, two researchers at the New York University Medical Center point out that after the report cards were made public, there were large jumps in reported risk factors in New York -- from 1.8 percent to 52.9 percent for chronic lung disease at one hospital, for example -- and argue that this "spurious" increase accounts for much of the decline in New York's risk-adjusted mortality rate.
State health officials, who have made their report available in libraries and on the Internet, dispute the article, saying that many doctors underreported risk factors in the early years of data collection and that the decline in the mortality rate is real.
Both Dr. Dal Col and Dr. Gold, like most heart surgeons in New York, support the report card, although with reservations. Their stories illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of the system, and how it has changed heart surgery in New York.
 
Dr. Dal Col
A Perfectionist Hurt by a Ranking
 Dr. Richard Dal Col is a gregarious, impassioned man with none of the self-importance associated with heart surgeons, although his wife, Kathy, describes him as a perfectionist. "I'm a nurse, and he used to remake the bed," she said.
Dr. Dal Col, 39, is doing much better these days. At his low point, he was listed with 13 deaths for 265 coronary bypass operations from 1990 to 1992, giving him an alarming risk-adjusted mortality rate of 7.4 percent. The New York State average at the time was 2.99 percent.
In 245 more recent bypasses in 1994 and 1995 tallied by the state, Dr. Dal Col has had no deaths. "I want to tell the next poor guy at the bottom of the list not to panic," he said.
Dr. Dal Col's problems began soon after he started practicing on his own in 1990. As a young surgeon at Albany Medical Center, where he trained in general surgery and cardiothoracic surgery, Dr. Dal Col says, he was getting many "heroic" emergency cases. "You earn your stripes by taking anything that comes," he said. This did not concern him until 1991, when Newsday successfully sued the state under the Freedom of Information Act for a list of cardiac surgeons and their mortality rates. A year earlier, health officials had for the first time released hospital death rates but resisted disclosing surgeon data.
When Newsday published the doctors' list, Dr. Dal Col had only 68 operations and a record that was among the state's worst. (When the state began releasing the surgeon data on its own the following year, it included only those doctors who had at least 200 cases, saying that fewer than that produced rates that were not statistically significant.) Concerned, the partners in Dr. Dal Col's practice decided he would be in a more "protected" position if he operated at St. Peter's, a community hospital that handled fewer crisis cases.
But by the time Dr. Dal Col got to St. Peter's in 1992, its cardiac program was booming. Records show that almost three-fourths of Dr. Dal Col's cases were emergencies or urgent, and that a distressing number of patients were dying -- usually not in the operating room, but a few days later. Given the high risk of these patients, Dr. Dal Col and St. Peter's should have fared reasonably well when the state reported their adjusted mortality rates. But when the hospital came out on the bottom that year, St. Peter's began working with the state to find out what was wrong.
Mark Chassin, the Health Commissioner at the time, said St. Peter's discovered that a small category of patients, the 1992 emergency bypass cases, had a mortality rate of 26 percent -- one in four were dying. The statewide average mortality for such patients was 7 percent.
Dr. Chassin says that the St. Peter's patients were found to be "appropriate candidates" for surgery but that doctors were moving them too quickly into the operating room. They did not stabilize them as much beforehand as doctors did at other New York hospitals. Nor did they use as often in these patients an intra-aortic balloon pump to increase blood flow through the coronary arteries before surgery.
St. Peter's revamped its care of these patients, and in 1993 had no mortalities among its emergency cases. Records show that Dr. Dal Col's mortality rate improved markedly that year, going from 7.4 percent to not quite 2 percent, even as he was taking the same percentage of high-risk cases.
"It's misleading to look at this as a surgeon's problem," Dr. Chassin said. "It really is a system problem."
Nonetheless, there have been problems with individuals. Of the poor-performing heart surgeons identified by the report in recent years, Dr. Chassin said some had such high mortality rates -- and such a low volume of cases -- that hospitals refused to allow the doctors back in their operating rooms for cardiac surgery, effectively forcing 21 doctors out of the specialty in New York. Dr. Chassin said some may now be practicing out of state.
Dr. Dal Col said the ranking never hurt his livelihood because he was in a large practice in a town where people knew him. "If I had been in New York, I'd be dead in the water," he said. He said he has never faced a malpractice suit after a patient's death.. Of the patients who died, he said, "all of them were people who I honestly feel would have died on anybody." His annual income, paid by his practice, has remained in the low to mid six figures. He and his wife have three children.
Still, the ranking changed his life. His wife remembers watching the local news one night and crying as they called her husband the worst surgeon in the state.
"Emotionally, and in terms of my maturation as a surgeon," Dr. Dal Col said, "this has been devastating."
 
Dr. Gold
Refusing Credit For a Top Rating
 It is 9:45 A.M., New York Hospital. Dr. Jeffrey Gold cut into the right atrium of a 35-year-old woman's heart and within minutes lifted out a plum-sized mass that looked like a cluster of clear fish eggs.
"What do you think of that?" he asked. His relaxed tone masked the fact that this was a life-threatening tumor, a myxoma. Five days earlier, a bit of it had broken off and traveled to the patient's brain, causing a major stroke. The patient, who has a 3-year-old daughter and lives in Westchester County, had no obvious prior symptoms.
The tumor removed, Dr. Gold spent the next half hour cutting out a piece of Gore-Tex fabric and fitting it over the hole the tumor left in the woman's heart, where it will remain.
"There is a craft to surgery," he said, making neat, careful stitches with polyurethane thread and admiring the woman's heart, an otherwise normal purple mass about the size of two fists. "Don't you think it's beautiful? The human body is a marvel."
Dr. Gold, 42, once did needlepoint on pillows to keep in practice for surgery, but they overtook his East Side apartment where he lives with his wife, an ophthalmologist, and two children. "I've been married for 22 years," he said. "That's a record in heart surgery." On weekdays, he leaves for the hospital at 6:30 A.M., returning at 10 P.M. or later. On Saturdays he works until 2 P.M., and on Sunday mornings he does hospital rounds.
Dr. Gold operates on diplomats, the owners of New York's most exclusive French restaurants and high-ranking Russians (although not Boris Yeltsin, as was reported in a gossip column). He makes $500,000 a year as an employee of Cornell Medical College; if he were in private practice he could make at least three times that. He is earnest and bookish and collects antique fountain pens to relax.
"Most cardiac surgeons collect Jaguars," he said.
Dr. Gold's risk-adjusted mortality rate in the current cardiac report is 0.22 percent, and he and New York Hospital, where he did his residency in general surgery, are known for taking very sick patients. "But there is nothing that separates me from the rest of the people on the list," Dr. Gold said, crediting his surgical team and the hospital for his good results.
And even though Dr. Gold is ranked at the top of the report, he has qualms about it. "I'm concerned about the predictability of it," he said. "I certainly would not use it as the sole way of selecting an institution or a surgeon."

HEADLINE: Colleges Ease Parents' Fears With Orientation Programs

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: HARRISONBURG, Va., Sept. 3

 BODY:
Parents of freshmen at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington get this advice from an administrator: After the fourth or fifth week of classes, mail your freshman a card that says $50 is enclosed so he or she can have a nice dinner with a friend.
"But don't put in the money," said the administrator, Richard H. Mullendore, associate vice chancellor for student affairs. "You'll hear from your student. Works every time." 
 Dr. Mullendore's advice is part of a two-day orientation the university holds every summer for families of new students. Such programs, rare 10 years ago, have become common as colleges have learned the value of winning over the people who usually pay the bills, and as more high school graduates have begun to put down deposits at several colleges and universities so they can continue shopping around during the summer.
"Students and parents are becoming more demanding," Dr. Mullendore said. "This is part of the consumerism movement in higher education. We have one student who went to four summer orientations before settling on us."
The orientations, which range from casual talks to sleepovers, are usually either free or carry a small charge. The programs, intended to help reduce parents' separation anxiety, try to prepare them for the fall by giving them and their children separate orientation schedules.
In a 1993 survey by the National Orientation Directors Association, 81 percent of the 548 colleges that responded had some kind of parent orientation, most of them started in the last decade. As a result of these programs, a lot of parents in cars with roof racks looked a little less lost as they pulled onto college campuses in recent weeks.
At the University of the Pacific, in Stockton, Calif., parents are treated to a wine tasting and barbecue at a nearby museum. At Bemidji State University in Minnesota, parents get homework -- a long questionnaire to fill out with their children.
Last year, Xavier University, a Jesuit institution with an enrollment of 6,800, began issuing a "Musketeer parent's card" to each family at its summer orientation. The cards, which have an 800 number for the Cincinnati university and spaces for the student's phone number and address, can be used for a 10 percent discount at the campus bookstore.
Adrian A. Schiess, Xavier's director of freshman programs, said the cards were designed to enhance the university's "service and satisfaction component."
One of the more elaborate programs is here in the Shenandoah Valley, at James Madison University, where parents are invited to spend a night in the dormitories. Theater students put on a skit advising parents not to turn their child's room into a den -- at least until after the student's first visit home.
"Dorm rooms haven't changed much in 30 years -- you get a closet, a dresser, a desk and a bed, all in a space the size of my sewing room," said Sheila Day, 50, a home economics teacher from Heuvelton, N.Y., whose son, Geoff, is a freshman at James Madison.
Other topics are new. The parents are told about procedures that may have been irrelevant in their youths, like calling for security escorts, and about issues that were not discussed, like date rape.
At James Madison, the 2,500 freshmen are divided among 11 two-day sessions in June and July. More than 90 percent of the freshmen have a relative attending the program, said Al Menard, the associate vice president for student affairs. Only 60 percent of the parents use the dorm rooms; the rest stay in motels.
The first impression is so important, Dr. Menard said, that parent orientation is considered part of the recruitment process. Students register for classes and can sign up for phones and checking accounts during the orientation.
While the parents take guided campus tours and receive information about courses and campus social life from a university vice president, the new students take placement tests, meet with their advisers and attend a roundtable discussion with upperclassmen.
During the summer session at Otterbein College in Westerville, Ohio, a psychologist coaches parents about coping with separation anxiety. An evening program called "Sex at 7:00? What Are You Teaching My Son/Daughter?" deals with acquaintance rape and introduces the college's peer-counseling program.
When students arrived at the University of Richmond last month, parents of new students were offered two days of meals and meetings, followed by an invitation to attend the university's chapel service on Sunday morning.
"Schools have become more and more aware that parents are a significant constituency," said Patricia C. Harwood, a dean at Richmond. "You don't all of a sudden become someone else because your daughter or son turns 18.
"We've found that both parents and students benefit from talking about the importance of letting go, and from thinking through this transition in the role of the parent to a support person."
Some young people are skeptical about the value of bringing their parents to campus.
Lisa R. Milliken graduated from James Madison in 1989 and was recently back on campus for an alumni field hockey game. "They should give you a kiss and take off," said Miss Milliken, now a 28-year-old high school teacher in Harrisonburg, said of parents. "What are they going to do next? Take them to their jobs? 'Honey, this is where you'll do your accounting work.' "
But for many parents, the orientation is a practical and psychological godsend. Mary Sue Miller, 49, flew to Harrisonburg from Livermore, Calif., rented a van and knew just where to go to help her daughter, Jennifer, move in.
"I'm not even going to come to parents' weekend this fall," Mrs. Miller said. "I've seen it all."
For some parents and students, orientation gave a taste of the homesickness to come. "Some kids hung around their parents," said Pamela S. Parmer, 39, of Lancaster, Pa., whose son, Jason, will be on the James Madison football team this fall. "You could tell it was going to be pretty traumatic."
Andrew Barry, 19, of Arlington, Va., a sophomore at James Madison, worked as a waiter at this summer's orientation, which he called "therapy for parents."
"You've got to get over it sometime, this parent thing," Mr. Barry said.
 
LETTING GO
 
This fall's parent orientation at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, included these tips compiled by the National Orientation Directors Association, a group of college orientation officials.
 
 --Don't ask your students if they're homesick.
 --Write (even if they don't write back).
 --Ask questions (but not too many).
 --Expect change (but not too much).
 --Don't worry (too much) about manic-depressive phone calls or letters.
 --Visit (but not too often).
 --Do not tell your students that 'these are the best years of their lives.'
 --Trust them.

HEADLINE: At a School, Clinton Campaigns for Education Spending

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: SELMA, Calif., Sept. 5

 BODY:
Seeking to return to Washington on the political offensive, President Clinton stumped today for education spending before a crowd of thousands gathered outside a middle school in California's farm country.
Mr. Clinton's appearance at Abraham Lincoln Middle School was one of many events the White House has planned to rally public support for the President's fiscal priorities as he and the Republican-controlled Congress move into the crucial months of their confrontation on the budget. 
 "Education is not supposed to be a partisan political football, and it should not be when Congress returns tomorrow," Mr. Clinton said today in his campaign-style rally before a crowd of parents, students and teachers. "We ought to stay on the side of education."
One placard pasted on a wall expressed just the political message Mr. Clinton was trying to send: "Clinton = Education."
Mr. Clinton and Republicans in Congress have sharp differences on issues like education spending, Medicare spending and tax cuts, and for two days Mr. Clinton has been trying to drum up support for his priorities in a state that will be crucial for his re-election hopes.
"When Congress comes back from their recess tomorrow," he said, "we will have 90 days of decisions about the budget, 90 days to choose what direction we're going to take."
So far only 1 of the 13 spending bills that finance the Federal Government has passed both houses, and Mr. Clinton has already issued half a dozen veto threats. In addition, Congress still has not shown how it plans to carry out some of its most controversial plans to scale back the costs of programs like Medicare, Medicaid and farm supports.
If the White House and Congress cannot agree on budget priorities and the spending bills, the result could be a partial shutdown of the Government. The effects of such a shutdown could well spill over into the 1996 Presidential race as voters decide whom to blame for stalled legislation in Washington.
In Chicago today, the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, the leading Republican Presidential contender, vowed not to compromise with the President on balancing the budget over seven years and cutting taxes by $245 billion. "We will fight to the end for fundamental conservative change," Mr. Dole said.
Although he did not mention Mr. Dole, Mr. Clinton told the California crowd: "There are some who say that there should be no compromise this autumn. But I say that good people of good will want us to find common ground, want us to find honorable compromise, want us to balance the budget and keep faith with the children of America and their educational needs."
Focusing particularly on education spending, Mr. Clinton plans to meet with chief executives from companies supporting his endangered Goals 2000 program, which provides Federal financing for state, community and school efforts to raise education standards. And next Monday he is planning a trip to Illinois to highlight a Federal education loan program, which Congress is seeking to scale back or eliminate.
Before the rally, Mr. Clinton gave a history lesson to 20 nervous and excited eighth graders who had been chosen by lottery to see the President. Speaking softly, his hands folded in front of him, Mr. Clinton, who was once a law professor, took them in 35 minutes from the Civil War and the battle to abolish slavery through the first and second World Wars and the end of the cold war.
Throughout his informal lesson, he stressed themes that he has repeated across two days in California -- that American success in the global economy will increasingly depend on education and that Americans need to bridge their racial and ethnic differences.
The students' questions for Mr. Clinton were all personal.
Erica Franco, 13, stumped Mr. Clinton when she asked what he planned to do after he left office.
"I don't know," he said. "I haven't thought about it much. Once in a while I think about it, but I haven't -- you know, if I stay healthy and I've been blessed with pretty good health, I hope I can continue to do some things that are useful for my country. I'm not much on just laying around."

HEADLINE: Streak Alive as Yankees Veto 13th Stadium Plan in a Year

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
The New York Yankees yesterday criticized the city's current proposal to keep the baseball team in the Bronx, increasing pressure on the Giuliani administration to present the team with more specific proposals for a new stadium elsewhere in New York City.
But Yankee officials, who criticized the city plan in a press release, went to great pains to say that while they intended to consider new stadium sites, they were not necessarily rejecting the Bronx or the stadium's current site. 
 "What is before us simply doesn't accomplish the objectives of the city and of the Yankees," said David Sussman, the Yankees' executive vice president and general counsel. "We are asking the city and the Economic Development Corporation to start in earnest, in an expedited way, looking at other sites the city has identified."
An expert hired by the Yankees to assess the city's latest proposal -- the 13th in the last year -- said in July that the planned improvements were inadequate and would not speed the flow of traffic to and from Yankee Stadium. City officials had asked for time to review the expert's report, and the Yankees' public statement yesterday was apparently intended to remind the city that it should respond as soon as possible.
George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the Yankees' principal owner, often cites heavy traffic, poor access to garages and inadequate parking as reasons for his dissatisfaction with Yankee Stadium. Mr. Steinbrenner was traveling to Tampa yesterday and could not be reached for comment, Mr. Sussman said.
"We are sorry that the Yankee organization did not find the administration's plan for a new Yankee Stadium acceptable," said Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson. "We are willing, however, to go back to the table and continue discussions, including exploring alternative sites for the stadium in New York City."
Mr. Sussman said the Yankees issued their statement yesterday in hopes of getting the city to make an acceptable proposal by the end of this year. He said the team must have plans either for renovation of the current stadium or for construction of a new one very soon because the Yankees' current 30-year lease with the city expires in 2002.
"Even if we were able to commence this project by year end, we would be under a very tight schedule," he said. "The time is now to make a determination and to proceed."
Mr. Sussman did not rule out the possibility that the Yankees might move to New Jersey. He said, however, that all questions about a site in New Jersey would have to be answered by Mr. Steinbrenner.
The Yankees have been squabbling with the city for two years about where the Yankees will play after 2002. The team has said it cannot stay where it is unless parking and road access to the stadium are vastly improved.
The city's latest proposal involved building three garages with 6,000 parking spaces next to the stadium and enlarging an existing one. It also proposed building a new bridge across the Harlem River and new ramps from the Major Deegan Expressway and 145th Street Bridge.
Although the additional garage space would provide the parking the Yankees said they required, Mr. Sussman said the team's expert felt the plan did not adequately address problems of getting cars to and from Yankee Stadium quickly.
Also, getting approval and money for the proposed Harlem River Bridge would be extremely difficult, since it would be built solely to take people to a stadium that operates only half the year, Mr. Sussman said.
Separately, the city has met recently with Mets' officials to discuss plans to build a new stadium near the site of Shea Stadium.

HEADLINE: After 7 Weeks, Detroit Newspaper Strike Takes a Violent Turn

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 5

 BODY:
With bargaining stalled, the seven-week standoff here between two newspapers and their striking unions has erupted into violence, as police battled pickets who were illegally blockading a printing plant late Saturday and again late Monday.
In Monday night's melee, police officers in riot gear fired pepper spray at pickets who pelted them with auto parts and swatted them with their signs. The demonstrators, on strike against The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press, dispersed about 2 A.M. today, permitting replacement workers to enter and leave the plant. 
 Eight pickets were arrested in the demonstration that began late Saturday and spilled into Sunday, and 23 were arrested Monday night and today. All were charged with unlawful assembly, inciting to riot, disorderly conduct or resisting arrest.
About 2,500 journalists, printers, truck drivers, maintenance workers and others, represented by six different unions, struck the newspapers on July 13. The business operations of the two newspapers are run under a joint venture, and since the strike began they have published a combined edition.
There is no sign of headway in the talks. Negotiators for one of the striking unions, the Newspaper Guild, met today with representatives of The Free Press but reported no progress. The Guild is battling an attempt by management to impose a merit raise system and to limit overtime, while the other unions are fighting over job security, control of the workplace and other issues.
The Free Press said last week that it would start replacing Guild members who did not return to work by today. "Our offer to bring everybody back is not possible anymore," said Heath J. Meriwether, the executive editor of The Free Press.
The 124 Guild members who crossed the picket lines at The Free Press before the ultimatum had been joined by only one other as of today. But he was a significant one: Mitch Albom, a sports columnist who is probably the newspaper's best known and most popular writer.
Mr. Albom began his column about the strike today with one word: "Enough." He wrote that he would remain a member of the Guild and "give much of what I earn to the people still on strike."
But, Mr. Albom said in an interview, "Newspapers are fire stations, they are police stations, and they should not be shut down."
Mr. Albom, who tried to broker an agreement that would return strikers to work during negotiations, said that he thought both sides in the dispute were wrong and that he did not want to be seen as supporting either. "I didn't want to be waved as a flag," he said.
The demonstration late Saturday by about 3,000 strikers and their supporters was planned by the unions. But Monday's more violent disruption was not, the unions said.
"You're dealing with forces that are very hard to control," said John Lippert, a striking Free Press labor reporter. "You've got people who are really on the brink of economic ruin."
The newspapers sought an injunction today to limit the number of pickets.
Monday night and early this morning, about 300 demonstrators tried to block the gates of the plant, in Sterling Heights just north of here. When 50 to 60 police officers, carrying shields, marched forward to clear a path, the pickets pushed them back.
Chief Thomas Derocha of the Sterling Heights Police Department said demonstrators began throwing half-pound pieces of steel used to make automobile steering columns, apparently stolen from a nearby plant.

HEADLINE: Race for Bridgeport Casino Is Down to 2 Big Operators

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The competition to develop a casino in Bridgeport narrowed today to two of the nation's most prominent gaming operators -- the Mashantucket Pequot Indians of Ledyard and Las Vegas-based Mirage Resorts Inc. -- as 10 other candidates dropped out, saying the stakes were too high.
In issuing a request for proposals for the casino in July, the state said it would only select a developer who could guarantee the state $610 million over the next three years, a sum many gaming analysts called unrealistic. To weed out less serious candidates, the state required that potential developers submit a $610 million letter of credit with their proposals, which were due today. 
 It is unclear whether either of the proposals will pass muster with the state. The sealed bids will not be opened until Wednesday.
Yet the Pequots' proposal has already raised doubts because it did not include a letter of credit. Instead, G. Michael Brown, the president of the tribe's Foxwoods Resort Casino, said the tribe would guarantee the state revenue by other means. Under a compact with the state, the casino is expected to provide the state more than $150 million this year in exchange for its monopoly on slot machines.
Richard D. Bronson, a director of Mirage Resorts, said his proposal did include the $610 million letter of credit, though it remained to be seen whether Mirage, which recently embarked upon substantial casino development projects in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, Nev., had the finances to begin a third in Bridgeport.
Still, at a news conference this afternoon, Gov. John G. Rowland called the two proposals "a tremendous response" and described the two candidates as "great developers with the creativity and capacity to develop a great facility."
"We presume they both are qualified," Governor Rowland said. "We hope to see a casino in Bridgeport in the very near future."
Casino opponents, however, saw the limited response as a sign that the project was not viable.
"The fact that there are only two developers out of all the United States and from around the world is indication that it is not economically feasible," said State Senator James T. Fleming, the Republican majority leader.
A casino in Bridgeport would be only an hour by train from New York City and could draw thousands of gamblers away from the casinos in Atlantic City as well as attracting others in New York who have never wagered.
But any developer other than the Pequots faces a major problem: insuring that the state will not lose any revenue as a result of the casino's being built. The state now receives 25 percent of the slot machine revenue from Foxwoods in return for the tribe's monopoly on slots, but the Pequots have said that the moment the Legislature approves another casino, they will stop the payments.
This means the new casino operator must be prepared to make payments from its line of credit to cover the lost revenue. The $610 million figure was arrived at because it equals the amount the Pequots are expected to pay the state in the next three years.
For most of the prospective developers, including Donald Trump and several major gaming companies, the $610 million was too steep.
Martin P. Boscaccy, vice president of gaming development at Harrah's Entertainment Inc., the nation's largest casino company, said that the $610 million letter was the reason Harrah's withdrew today.
"That is a tremendous amount of credit that you put at risk prior to finding out whether you're getting the license," Mr. Boscaccy said. It takes resources away from other projects the company could be pursuing and it costs a substantial amount in interest payments -- from $400,000 to $700,000 -- to maintain the credit line, he added.
Mr. Brown said he did not believe the tribe was obligated to present a letter of credit since it could guarantee the state would not be losing its monthly payments from Foxwoods slots. In addition to pledging to continue to provide 25 percent of the slot revenue while the new casino is being built, Mr. Brown said that the tribe would pay a 25 percent tax on the revenues from a temporary casino that would operate during the construction.
Once the new casino opened, the tribe would pay whichever was greater: the money from the Foxwoods slots or an agreed-upon tax on the gross win at the casino in Bridgeport.
Mr. Rowland said today that such a guarantee might be sufficient, though lawyers would need to review it.
Still, representatives of other developers said the Pequot proposal violated the terms set by the state. Indeed, two weeks ago, in response to written questions submitted by one developer, John Meskill, the state official overseeing the selection process, responded, "All proposers will be required to submit a letter of credit."
Asked whether the Pequots could offer an alternative, Mr. Meskill answered, "Should the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe submit a proposal, or participate in a proposal, it will be required to submit a letter of credit."

HEADLINE: Heileman Says It May Default On January Interest Payment

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The G. Heileman Brewing Company, burdened with debt as a result of a leveraged buyout by Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst last year, said today that it would probably default on an interest payment due on Jan. 31.
Heileman's situation suggested that for all the pledges by financiers to avoid repetition of the optimistic buyouts rampant in the late 1980's, some recent deals have been risky enough to blow apart even during flush economic times. 
 A default could damage the ability of Hicks, Muse -- one of the nation's largest and busiest buyout firms -- to raise money for future deals. Contrasting itself with New York rivals, Hicks, Muse, which is based here, has boasted of paying reasonable prices and borrowing conservatively.
Heileman, based in La Crosse, Wis., describes itself as the nation's leading regional brewer and the fifth largest over all, with sales last year of $874 million. Its brands include Lone Star, Colt 45 malt liquor, Old Style and Schmidt's.
Faced with shrinking sales in a heavily competitive beer market, Heileman had cut prices and lost money even before its heavy interest expenses. As of June 30, its long-term debt of $317 million overwhelmed its net worth of $34 million.
The company lost $6.3 million in the second quarter before interest expenses and $14.7 million after, in contrast to net earnings of $13.2 million in the second quarter last year. In its most recent quarterly statement, the company said it had failed to comply with earnings and financial ratios required by its lenders as of June 30, but that the lenders had granted waivers. Heileman said last month -- and repeated in today's statement -- that it was likely to cover its Sept. 30 payments.
Today, Heileman said that efforts to bail itself out by finding a new partner or purchaser had failed. Therefore, the company said it determined that it would "undertake a restructuring of the company's balance sheet in order to properly position Heileman from a financial point of view."
Roy Winnick, a spokesman for Heileman and Hicks, Muse, refused to elaborate or translate other than to deny that a bankruptcy filing loomed. "Absolutely not," he said. "Some sort of restructuring is necessary, and we're going to figure out the best way to do it."
Usually, lenders can force a company into bankruptcy if it violates loan provisions or defaults on a payment. Companies often try negotiating instead to stretch or avoid some debt payments. These talks usually become high-stakes games, with each side threatening abrupt action.
Hicks, Muse and its controlling partner, Thomas O. Hicks, now find themselves in an unusual and uncomfortable position. In a record with few blemishes, Hicks, Muse and a predecessor company have strung together successful deals, including the purchase of the companies making 7-Up and Dr Pepper.

HEADLINE: After the Meal, First the Check, Then the Police

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MASTIC, L.I., Sept. 5

 BODY:
In the last few weeks, Alessandro Nardone became a regular at Paisley's Eatery here, dropping by for dinner several nights a week and often bringing friends.
So when two police detectives stopped in on Sunday night with his picture, staff members were not only able to identify him, they were able to point him out at a table where he was treating 10 friends to dinner. 
 When the $330 check came and Mr. Nardone paid with a credit card in somebody else's name, the detectives charged him with credit card fraud.
"My guys waited for him to finish his meal," Lieut. Denis Caine of the Suffolk County police said. "They watched him sign the credit card receipt and then placed him under arrest."
Dining out was only one of the things that Mr. Nardone did with the American Express card, which was issued in the name of a man from Woodstock, Vt., the police said today. Over the last few weeks, Mr. Nardone, 38, an unemployed chef from Shirley, had charged more than $15,000 worth of goods on the card, including an air-conditioner, a typewriter and a living room set. The police also impounded his Lincoln Continental after determining that he had used the credit card to install a stereo and alarm system.
Mr. Nardone was arraigned today in First District Court in Yaphank on charges of forgery and criminal possession of a forged instrument. The police said he had a history of arrests in New York City on similar charges dating to 1982.
Tom Aufiero, the owner of Paisley's said today: "We knew this gentleman. Within the last month he had been coming in pretty regularly. He was a very loud guy. He got to know all the waitresses by name and liked the attention. He was very flamboyant."
The police said they began their investigation two weeks ago after the Vermont man called them. He said American Express had notified him that someone was running up large bills on his credit card, Lieutenant Caine said, "and he said, 'I don't have a card with you.' "
With the help of American Express, the police were able to track down Mr. Nardone to his home in Shirley. The police said they don't know how Mr. Nardone obtained the credit cards.
Mr. Nardone, who is being held on $25,000 bail, had told Mr. Aufiero that he owned a restaurant in the Hamptons. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Rise in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities gained yesterday for the fourth straight trading day, with the long maturities posting the biggest gains.
Since last Friday's economic reports suggested that growth was not fast enough to ignite inflation or to keep the Fed from lowering interest rates, the market has been pricing in a rate cut, even with the latest auto sales showing gains. Analysts say that the auto sales while good should not give rise to inflation. 
 The 30-year bond rose 18/32, to a price of 104 1/32 to yield 6.57 percent, in thin trading, down from 6.61 percent on Friday.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, head of the Economic Intelligence Company, a market research and analysis firm, said almost all of last week's flood of ecconomic data confirmed that the economy would grow solidly in the next several weeks.
"The upshot of all of these reports is a picture of an economy reviving steadily, but not about to explode upward as it did a year ago at this time," he said. "That's critical because it means that inflationary pressures will be nonexistent. There is absolutely no reason to expect inflation to rise above the current 3 percent. That means the Fedederal Reserve can and will lower interest rates again, but not until later this year."
In the futures market, which invariably influences the cash market, prices were mixed in light trading. The December bond contract tested 113 13/32 in the morning and rose to 113 14/32, but it was still below last Friday's high of 113 21/32.
Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research, Portland Ore., predicted the price of the December Treasury bond contract would go even higher. "This is the real thing, and the swing in price suggests a transition into another trading level, Ms. Mesch said. "You don't buck the move until you see the market begin to move sideways." In overnight trading before the opening of the New York market, the December contract low was 112 27/32, while in the New York session, the low was 112 30/32, with the high at 113 29/32. It closed at 113 26/32, at the top of the day's trading range.
Fed officials at the annual two-day economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., signaled their willingness to cut rates if Congress was able to reduce the budget deficit. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said short- and intermediate-term interest rates would fall if there are significant cuts in the budget deficit.
Traders note that there is little fresh news, and taking the market much higher will be difficult at best, with bond prices susceptible to investors taking profits after last week's gains. The light calendar of reports includes the weekly jobless claims on Thursday and second-quarter nonfarm productivity. On Friday the Fed will issue its report on July consumer installment credit. Analysts doubt there is anything in this calendar that would dissuade the Fed from lowering short-term interest rates again this year.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills, rates declined for the third consecutive week, reflecting traders' anticipation of another lowering of rates by the Fed.
The average discount rate for a three-month issue was 5.30 percent, down from 5.34 percent a week ago, while the average rate for a six-month bill was also 5.30 percent, down from 5.34 percent. The identical average rates for both of yesterday's issues suggest that the market is expecting a rate cut soon, analysts said. The last time the Fed reducted rates was early July, when it cut the target for the Federal funds rate it charges banks for overnight loans by 1/4 point, to 5 3/4 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.660	97.321	Discounted Rate	5.30%	5.30%	Coupon Yield	5.46%	5.54%	High Price	98.665	97.331	Discounted Rate	5.28%	5.28%	Coupon Yield	5.44%	5.51%	Low Price	98.660	97.321	Discounted Rate	5.30%	5.30%	Coupon Yield	5.46%	5.54%	Accepted at low price	75%	64%	Total applied for	$48,337,651	$49,642,501	Accepted	$12,065,120	$12,003,243	Noncompetitive	$1,427,600	$1,231,584	

Both issues are dated Sept. 7, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 7, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on March 7, 1996.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises but Then Retreats As Japan Doesn't Act on Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday after retreating from a surge in Asian trading fueled by speculation about a cut in Japanese interest rates.
Expectations for a cut in Japan's discount rate grew after the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, as well as Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura all said yesterday that the economic recovery had ground to a standstill. 
 One way to stimulate growth would be to cut the discount rate -- already at a historic low of 1 percent. Such a cut would hurt the yen by making deposits in Japan less attractive.
The dollar rose as high as 98.28 yen in Asian trading before falling back. In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 97.68 yen, up from 97.43 yen on Friday. The dollar slipped to 1.4621 German marks from 1.4622 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5577 from $1.5575.
Trading activity was quieter then usual yesterday after the Labor Day holiday in the United States, traders said.
Expectations of a cut in Japanese rates, said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, "will probably build as the week progresses and that should provide some help for the dollar."
But some traders were skeptical that another rate cut by Japan would be enough to drive the dollar higher.
"Rates are pretty darn low already," said Dave Glowacki, senior currency trader at the NBD Bank in Detroit. "With all this talk about it, a cut is probably somewhat built into the exchange rates already."
The strong yen -- which gained as much as 24 percent against the dollar earlier this year, before retreating in recent months -- made Japanese exports less competitive and helped to stifle the country's long-awaited economic rebound. The yen is still up 2 percent against the dollar this year.
Against the mark, the dollar was underpinned by speculation that Germany's 14-day securities repurchase rate, the country's key money-market rate, will drop again when the Bundesbank conducts its weekly money-market operations today.
The German central bank has cut the repo rate to 4.3 percent from 4.5 percent over the last four weeks. Traders said a further cut of 5 to 10 basis points was likely today. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. The Bundesbank cut two important short-term interest rates by half a point on Aug. 24.

HEADLINE: Congress Returns

 BODY:
Though the deadline can be extended, Congress is supposed to complete a budget this month by passing 13 spending bills for discretionary programs and a bill to change tax rates and entitlement programs. The Republicans have set out to use budget cuts to radically shrink Federal programs. How well they succeed will be determined by scores of votes that will take place over the next several weeks. Five of these votes stand out as vital in their own right and for what they signify about the Republican onslaught.
Welfare. Everyone wants to put able-bodied recipients to work. But no one knows how to institute that pleasant-sounding reform and still protect innocent children. The best course is to go slow with welfare-to-work requirements. Instead the Republicans want to end the 60-year-old entitlement program and provide block grants to the states. Some elements of the party, led by Senator Phil Gramm, want to go further, forbidding states to provide cash to teen-age mothers or others the G.O.P. deems unworthy. 
 Turning welfare over to the states is an unprincipled policy because fiscally strapped states will not, and probably could not, protect the poor in bad economic times. Congress could compromise on requirements to put able-bodied recipients to work. The danger is that the G.O.P. will overreach as an election-year ploy and a weak President will be too scared to wield a veto.
Medicare and Medicaid. The Republicans started off in the right direction on Medicare by proposing to give the elderly the choice of preserving Government medical insurance or buying a private policy from a qualified insurer. The idea is to drive costs down and quality up through market competition. But the Republicans have tarnished this sound idea by cutting Medicare by about 25 percent, leaving too little money for insurers to provide high-quality care. The Republicans ought to bend -- by spending more on Medicare and less on, say, corporate subsidies, which they have barely nicked.
The Republicans plan to cut Medicaid, the health insurance for poor people, by about 30 percent. They also propose turning the program over to the states to run without Federal help if Medicaid rolls rise. Without Federal help in bad times, states will be forced to cut benefits or eligibility.
Science and technology. The party of that high-tech junkie Newt Gingrich might have been expected to protect Federal subsidies for scientific research. Not so. Private markets do not produce enough research since individual companies cannot always reap the profit from their discoveries. The Republicans insulate the National Institutes of Health, but otherwise make huge cuts, after accounting for inflation, to most other science programs. These cuts are short-run gain for the budget and a long-run threat to economic growth.
Taxes. Congress should postpone tax cuts until it proves it can balance the budget without victimizing the needy or eviscerating public investment. But Congress has already decided to hand out over $200 billion in tax cuts over the next seven years. The Republicans take this bad idea and make it worse by proposing to eliminate a tax credit for low-paid workers. The Republicans also propose to cut taxes on profit from the sale of investments even if those investments were made before the tax cut was passed. In other words, the G.O.P. wants to raise taxes on the poor at the same time it hands windfall profit to investors for past decisions.
Education and training. The White House estimates that the Republican budget would whack three times more out of education and training programs next year than other discretionary programs. That makes no sense in an economy that cries out for well-trained workers. Sadly, the Republicans also want to eliminate President Clinton's worthy trademark, national service, which offers modest compensation for individuals who do community service.
Beyond these specific votes, the Republicans and the President are headed for a collision. The Republicans intend to pass bills the President has vowed to veto. Unable to override such vetoes, the Republicans would then attach their spending proposals to a bill that is needed to raise Federal borrowing to keep the Government running. Each side ought to be calculating whether it can reach compromises that shrink government, protect the poor and preserve public investments. Instead the two seem to be calculating which side can win the most votes by bringing government to a halt.

Don't Kick Sand at Taiwan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
During the 1950's Taiwan and China used to shell barren areas of each other's territory every day. It was a ritual that allowed both nations to demonstrate that they were carrying on the ideological struggle, but without any risks. In 1958 the two sides quietly reached a novel agreement to further routinize their conflict and save money: They would shell each other every other day. China would shell Taiwan Monday, Wednesday and Friday and Taiwan would shell China Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. On Sunday they rested.
It is the proven ability of China and Taiwan to reach such quiet, under-the-table arrangements when it suits their interests that leaves me feeling a glimmer of optimism that Beijing and Taipei will step back from the brink of their current crisis. 
 Be clear about one thing: The breakdown in Taiwan-China relations, which was precipitated by President Lee Teng-hui's June lecture at Cornell University -- the first visit by a Taiwanese President to the U.S. since 1949 -- was inevitable. It was inevitable because Taiwan today is like a man who has been quietly lifting weights and body-building in his basement for 40 years. He's now rippling with muscles and it was only a matter of time before his family was going to insist that he enter the Mr. Universe contest and show off those triceps to the world.
Who could blame them? Taiwan today has the second-largest reserves of foreign currency in the world, $90 billion. It has a computer manufacturing industry that is now the third-largest in the world, it has a per capita income that ranks 25th in the world and a G.N.P. that ranks 19th. It is also the fourth-largest investor in mainland China today, with $20 billion and rising. With those kinds of measurements there was simply no way Taiwan was going to continue with the old status quo that allowed it to flourish economically as long as it pretended to be a diplomatic nonentity. Talking to college students here, I was struck by how all of them had a story about some indignity they had been put through by foreign passport authorities whenever they traveled, and they simply were not going to take it the way their parents did -- especially now that their country is a democracy. That's why Mr. Lee's visit to Cornell was so popular, and so inevitable.
But besides being inevitable this crisis could prove healthy. China's harsh reaction -- two missile tests just 100 miles north of Taipei -- was unnerving to people here. The stock market plummeted to a 20-month low. Land prices sagged. It has provoked some healthy rethinking in Taiwan about just how far and how fast to come out of the basement.
As for Beijing, it should have noticed that its threatening actions produced the following stories in the local press: Japan announced that it was sharply increasing its spending on ballistic missile research a few days after the Chinese missile tests, while many Taiwanese companies announced that they were freezing plans to open new factories on the mainland -- both reminders that Beijing would pay a huge price, at home and abroad, if it ever tried to resolve its Taiwan problem by force.
This would seem to be an ideal moment for some quiet U.S. diplomacy. To Beijing, the message has to be that the U.S. has no intention of recognizing Taiwan as a separate, independent state from China. But Beijing should learn to wink a little more at Taiwan's natural desire to raise its profile a bit. If Taiwan's President were being invited to speak at a joint session of Congress, Beijing would be entitled to go berserk. But it was Cornell University. Cornell is not Congress. It was worth a protest by Beijing, but not a war.
To Taiwan the message has to be: "Yes, your politics and economics have changed in remarkable ways. But one thing has not changed: your geography. You are still a nation of 21 million people living next to 1.2 billion people who claim your country as part of their own. Do the math. If you want to assume a higher profile on the world stage you must do a better job of paving the way first with Beijing. We are not going to clean up your messes."
In 1987, Taiwan and Beijing began a quiet cross-straits dialogue that promoted stability and burgeoning economic exchanges. They need to get back to that dialogue and work out some new rules for a new era. Any two nations that could agree to shell each other every other day for 20 years can find a way out of this crisis as well.

HEADLINE: Arctic Refuge Drilling Won't Threaten Wildlife

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In Alaska, Nature Under Siege" (editorial, Aug. 28), opposing oil exploration and development in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, distorts the effect of such activity on wildlife resources and gives short shrift to legitimate concerns about United States economic security. 
 You cite Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's canard that tapping a small portion of the refuge's resources would be tantamount to "offering Yellowstone National Park for geothermal drilling."
The area in question -- the 1.5-million-acre coastal plain -- represents less than 8 percent of this vast refuge, and only a minute fraction of the coastal plain itself would be impacted by oil operations.
Moreover, contrary to your assertion that all manner of wildlife would be put "at risk" by oil development, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has reported that "the evidence generated during years of exploration and development at Prudhoe Bay indicates minimal impact on wildlife resources."
In assessing potential oil development in the refuge, the agency also concluded that "most adverse effects would be minimized or eliminated through carefully applied mitigation using the lessons learned and technology acquired from development at nearby Prudhoe Bay."
The United States Geological Survey said in the late 1980's that the refuge could contain as much as 17 billion barrels of oil and 34 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Although an oversupply of oil exists in world markets, increasing demand and declining United States production (or actions by foreign oil producers) could lead to tight supplies in a short time.
Without significant new discoveries and intensified development of existing reserves, our nation is likely to be dependent upon foreign sources for 60 percent of its demand by the year 2000.
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not Yellowstone. Nor is it Central Park, Boston Common or the Washington Mall. Such comparisons do little to educate Americans about the public-policy options facing Congress as it considers opening the refuge to responsible resource development.

HEADLINE: India Project in the Balance

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Sept. 5

 BODY:
In the next month, Rebecca P. Mark will learn whether she is to be remembered as the executive whose perseverance pushed through the largest- ever foreign investment in India, or as the most visible symbol of a corporate vision gone horribly wrong.
Ms. Mark, a 41-year-old Missouri native, heads an Enron Corporation subsidiary -- the Enron Development Corporation -- that has spent three years planning, and starting to build, the largest power plant India has ever seen. As one of the first American companies to explore the opportunities opened up by India's decision to scrap its socialist economic system, Enron was widely hailed as a groundbreaker for the billions of dollars in American investments India has said it needs to help break out of poverty. 
 But after more than 30 trips to put the project together, Ms. Mark was back in India last week fighting a last-ditch battle in talks in Bombay to save the $2.8 billion plant from being scrapped -- and to spare Houston-based Enron from going ahead with what could be one of the costliest compensation suits ever filed by an American company against a foreign government.
In August, five months after Enron began construction on a rocky headland on the Arabian Sea, a new government in Maharashtra state, based in Bombay, "repudiated" the contracts Enron had negotiated with the previous government and with the national Government in New Delhi. The new state leaders vowed not to pay Enron and its partners -- General Electric's GE Capital Corporation and Bechtel Inc. -- so much as a penny in compensation.
Enron's lawyers have already filed papers before an arbitration tribunal in London on a claim against Maharashtra state that company officials said would amount to at least $300 million, and possibly as much as $2 billion, so the Bombay talks took place in a tense and volatile atmosphere.
At stake is far more than this plant. When the Maharashtra politicians made Enron the whipping boy of their election campaign earlier this year, they caught a new wave of nationalist antipathy toward foreign companies that has its roots in the 17th century, when Britain's East India Company began using military force and political guile to establish a vast commercial empire.
Ms. Mark left for Houston on Friday after talks with two of the most powerful figures in the Maharashtra government, including Manohar Joshi, the chief minister, who told reporters only days before that "the Enron chapter is closed."
Both Maharashtra officials and Enron executives say the next few days could show whether the wary exchanges that took place have opened the way for the Enron contracts to be rewritten in ways that take account of some of Maharashtra's objections, as Enron executives have hinted they could be, or if the climate of distrust and xenophobia have proved too strong.
With the costs of keeping the project in mothballs running at $250,000 a day, by Enron's reckoning, Ms. Mark has said the company will have to make a final decision by October on whether the project can be saved. For now, Enron is hoping Maharashtra will accept its offer to renegotiate parts of the contract that involve fuel costs, as well as to take an Indian partner.
"Indians believe in reincarnation, so this too can reincarnate," Ms. Mark said in an interview in New Delhi before meeting with the Maharashtra leaders. "Our attitude is, let's try and make a bad situation better, not worse."
As matters stand, the surprise is that last week's discussions in Bombay took place at all, after Maharashtra's leaders vowed to "throw Enron into the sea" for reportedly padding the plant's costs by more than $700 million and reportedly paying bribes to get the project approved. Enron has vigorously denied both charges, and Maharashtra has failed to come forward with evidence.
How strong the nationalist tide will be is disputed among Indians, many of whom are strong backers of the market-based reforms introduced in 1991 by the Government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. At the center of those reforms has been the effort to draw foreign investment to help India pull itself out of poverty.
Although Western executives have beaten a path to India, and inundated the Government's Foreign Investment Review Board with proposals, the flow of investments has been disappointingly slow -- totaling, according to Indian Government figures, about $1.6 billion between 1991 and the end of 1994.
But for those in India who see the reforms as the only way India can begin catching up with other Asian nations, Enron has served a beacon for the future. The power project was not only by far the largest single foreign investment ever made here. From the start, Enron's commitment was seen by the Rao Government as a pump-primer for other American investments. It sent an official delegation to Houston in 1992 to stir Enron's interest in building a power plant, and gave preliminary clearances for the project within weeks of Ms. Mark's first visit here.
By earlier this year, investment proposals put up for New Delhi's approval by American companies accounted, in value, for nearly three-quarters of all foreign projects. When a delegation of American executives led by the United States Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, visited New Delhi, Bangalore and Bombay in January, the mood was like that of a college team on a victory roll. As Mr. Brown's aides ticked off the contracts being signed -- at one point, they counted more than $7 billion in trade and investment deals, including the Enron project -- one senior American official told the executives: "India is ours to lose!"
But already, the mood was beginning to sour. Groups that have traditionally resisted foreign influences in India -- left-wingers and political parties that draw support by stirring nationalist passions among the Hindus -- drew huge crowds into the streets of New Delhi and other cities in 1994 in protest against the new world trade agreement. The Rao Government ratified the pact in the face of angry claims that it was a scheme by wealthy nations to lock developing nations into poverty.
In a February election, the most powerful of the Hindu nationalist groups, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or Indian People's Party, teamed with a Bombay-based splinter group, the Shiv Sena, to win power in Maharashtra, ousting a Congress Party government that had been an enthusiastic supporter of the reforms. In the campaign, the Enron project was a major target.
Since the announcement canceling the project, protests against American investments, mostly led by the B.J.P., have gained momentum across the country. Demonstrations have been held in several cities against Pepsico and Coca-Cola. After crowds demonstrated against the first of 30 restaurants that Kentucky Fried Chicken plans to build in India, in Bangalore, city officials raided the restaurant, seized chicken samples, and announced that the samples contained dangerously high levels of monosodium glutamate, said by the Bangalore officials to be cancer-inducing.
The United States Ambassador to India, Frank G. Wisner, who has played a big role in encouraging American investments, has advised American companies to stay cool. But with the Rao Government saying little to help Enron -- Indian newspapers reported that Mr. Rao admonished his power minister, N.K.P. Salve, after he threatened publicly to "blow the B.J.P.-Shiv Sena combine to smithereens" over the Enron cancellation -- Mr. Wisner made a pointed appeal last week for support. "The invitation to invest needs Indian backers," he said in a speech in the central Indian city of Bhopal. "India's partners, past and present, need a strong signal that this is where they should be."
Among American executives in India, the hope is that the Enron flap will blow over. They point to statements by leaders of almost all the groups that have attacked Enron, including the B.J.P., saying they are not hostile to investments they judge to be in India's interests. All the same, these American executives say, there is a risk that attacks on Enron and other high-profile investments like Coca-Cola could carry over into the Indian general election next year, creating a momentum that parties like the B.J.P., which is expected to mount a strong challenge to Mr. Rao's Congress party, may find hard to reverse.
"The message from India now is not what it was a few months ago -- 'This is a country of 900 million people, with a middle class of 200 million people, so come and get it,' " an executive of a large American company that has invested heavily here said. "But the opposite isn't true either, because India won't simply disappear from the radar screen just because Enron went sour. But it's going to be a harder sell."
Meanwhile, Enron has become a symbol of broken hopes. At the project site at Dhabol, known to Indians mostly as a favorite spot for smugglers, the company has deflated a large plastic bubble, the first ever erected in India, that was to have been used to allow construction during summer monsoons. Most of the 2,000 Indians employed on the site have been laid off, leaving a skeleton crew headed by a handful of American engineers.
Among Enron's supporters in India, photographs of the deflated bubble have served as a powerful image of the damage India will have done to itself if the project is not revived. When the Rao Government invited Enron to build the plant, it did so against a background of crippling power shortages across the country. In Maharashtra, many plants have been forced to generate their own power, to work reduced hours, or to operate only at night.
Now, the Enron controversy has already stalled seven other fast-track power projects that were to have kick-started $100 billion in foreign investments.
One reason the Rao Government may have been reluctant to challenge Maharashtra directly over the Enron cancellation, diplomats say, is because another newly elected government, in the eastern state of Orissa, has demanded a full renegotiation of a contract for a plant that was to have been built by another American power company, AES Transpower of Arlington, Va.
In the only move it has made so far to help Enron, the Rao Government circulated a briefing paper among its members of Parliament in New Delhi last week rebutting Maharashtra's case against the project. Citing a battery of Power Ministry figures, the document said there was "basically nothing wrong" with the $2.8- billion cost of the plant, when compared with similar plants elsewhere.
The document noted that Maharashtra had produced no evidence to substantiate its charges of corruption by Enron, and even Mr. Joshi, the Maharashtra chief minister, has backed away from the allegations. Although kickbacks have been a pervasive feature of Indian business life for decades, Enron has said that the former Maharashtra government under Sharad Pawar, a Congress Party rival of Mr. Rao's, never asked for any illegal payments.
"We understand the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we will never expose our officers just to get a contract," said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman of Enron, who was reached by telephone during a vacation in Aspen, Colo. Enron's Indian critics, Mr. Lay said, "were all so convinced that a big project like this couldn't be put together without corruption, they just assumed there had been."
The denials have cut little ice with L. K. Advani, the national president of the B.J.P., the Hindu nationalist party that has sought to make political gains out of the controversy. Mr. Advani, expected to be the B.J.P.'s candidate for prime minister in the 1996 election, acknowledged during an interview a the party's New Delhi headquarters that he had no evidence that Enron had paid bribes. But he added, "The absence of evidence doesn't in any way prevent a political party from taking cognizance of what has become a widespread belief."

HEADLINE: Some Law Firms Practice Art for Art's Sake

BYLINE: By LISA ANDERSON 

 BODY:
During the 1980's, an art collection became the symbol that separated the in-vogue law firms from the unhip ones. Recession-provoked budget trimmings soon replaced the desire for cachet, and collecting dropped off. But it didn't go away.
Currently, more than 70 American law firms with collections ranging from 50 to 1,400 artworks have listed themselves in the International Directory of Corporate Art Collectors. 
 In some firms the offices have practically been turned into galleries. Most of the collections focus on contemporary artists, some of significance. The collection of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in Manhattan, for example, includes works by Ad Reinhardt, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine, Berenice Abbott, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Julian Schnabel, David Hockney and Robert Mapplethorpe. Weil, Gotshal & Manges, also in Manhattan, owns work by Claes Oldenburg, Jennifer Bartlett, William Wegman and Cindy Sherman.
Some of the lawyers involved have re-created themselves as curators who provide tours, lend artworks to museums and occasionally accept work from artists in lieu of legal fees.
"It is my passion," said Ed Abramson of Herrick, Feinstein, a firm that collects architectural artifacts from New York City, like the original 1913 copper finial from the Woolworth building, a 1924 brass elevator dial from the Roosevelt Hotel and one of the early ticket booths from the subway. "I take tender loving care of it."
Of course, many of these firms have seen their works increase substantially in value, though for the most part they were reluctant to divulge figures or discuss in detail the financial arrangements for buying and insuring the works. But James A. Dobkin, a partner at Arnold & Porter in Washington, said his firm's 225 works, which were worth $250,000 in 1978, are now valued at more than $1.5 million. And Gregg Thomas, a lawyer who heads the art committee at the Tampa, Fla., office of Holland & Knight, said his firm had allocated "a six-figure sum" to begin its collection in 1989.
Barry Sanders, a lawyer with Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles, said the firm's decision to buy 400 photographs, including works by Ansel Adams, Robert Doisneau, Elliott Erwitt and Henri Cartier-Bresson, was "price effective."
"We could get a lot of money for the prints," Mr. Sanders said, "because they're worth more than what we paid for them, but that's not why we went into collecting."
Indeed, most firms rejected any notion that the decision to buy was a business decision.
"It is really for the employees," said Mr. Dobkin, who oversees Arnold & Porter's collection, which includes works by Sam Gilliam and Gene Davis, and who has shown his own sculptures in 14 solo exhibitions. "We don't buy for investment."
Still, especially for firms that began collecting in the late 70's and early 80's, an art collection has become a valuable asset, particularly for a business that does not have many tangible assets.
Some firms say that collecting art is a way to support local artists or causes. When members of the art committee in the Tampa office of Holland & Knight found out that a local river was drying up and would soon disappear, they commissioned an artist to paint scenes along the river. The office has 91 contemporary paintings, photographs and sculptures by artists who live in Florida or whose works were inspired by the Florida landscape.
"People have forgotten how a lot of art was created," said Neale Albert, a partner in the New York office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. "Just going out and buying pieces isn't fun. I find it much more rewarding to get to know an artist and commission something, and when it is done, I feel I am a part of a process."
Mr. Neale commissioned the artist George Deem to paint "The Triumph of Art," based on Mantegna's masterpiece. Mr. Deem's work now hangs in a hallway. But buying art for the workplace often raises questions of taste.
"In some ways, it is like polite society," said Arthur Fleischer of the New York office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. "You don't discuss sex, religion or politics. You don't want to offend anyone."
A series of 12 prints in which the artist Martha Rofler placed images of Vietnam in the White House caused such a stir at the New York office of Weil, Gotshal & Manges that they were put in storage.
But firms have found that lawyers may become fond of works that at first offend them.
"You have to have a rule," said Carolyn Alexander, a consultant with Cooper Alexander, art dealers who helped partners at Weil, Gotshal & Manges assemble their collection of more than 400 paintings, drawings and photographs. "No one's complaints are answered for at least six months because by and large they do become attached to them."
Ms. Alexander recalled the complaints she received from a lawyer who did not like Richard Bosman's "High Tide, Low Tide," a colored woodcut print of what appear to be two rocks sitting on a beach. Some months after the piece had been moved, Ms. Alexander said, the lawyer came begging to get it back, asking, "Where are my rocks?"
To make their art more accessible, many firms have mounted museum-type placards identifying objects by artist, title and year of creation, in addition to providing catalogues that range from fancy productions to rudimentary photocopies.
Most firms with collections have consultants or art committees that often include members of the legal support staff as well as lawyers, to make selection more democratic. But some lawyers -- those who sit on museum boards, frequent galleries and auctions, and roam through artists' studios in their spare time -- prefer to work alone.
"Committees can't choose art," said Jack Combs of Warner, Norcross in Grand Rapids, Mich. "There are too many tastes. It really has to reside under one person."
In many instances, one lawyer is the impetus for beginning a firm's collection.
"What happens usually in these cases is that a partner takes a particular interest," said Barbara Toll, a consultant who helped lawyers start a collection at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz in Manhattan.
Even firms that have seen their collections increase in value find that the lawyers with great interest in the art are unwilling to part with it. And though there are Jasper Johnses and Schnabels hanging at many of these firms, financial reality has also driven lawyers to support a host of unknown, "emerging" artists.
"We don't have famous artists," Mr. Combs said. "These paintings are not particularly expensive. "We buy pieces for the enjoyment they bring to our lives."
It is this enjoyment that may be the most compelling reason to support a collection, said Mr. Sanders of Latham & Watkins.
"You live here," Mr. Sanders said. "You work a lot of hours in this business. It should be a place of beauty."

HEADLINE: Cuba Passes Law to Attract Greater Foreign Investment

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: HAVANA, Cuba, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Government officials said today that they expected a significant infusion of capital after passing a new foreign-investment law this week, but few observers, including the Cubans, are predicting a huge rush to invest in Cuba yet.
The law, approved by the National Assembly on Tuesday after more than a year of debate, allows foreign investors access to all economic sectors except defense, health care and education and to fully own their businesses in Cuba, either privately or in the form of public stock companies. Currently, most foreign ventures exist through associations with the Government and foreign companies are allowed less than 50 percent ownership. 
 The law also offers guarantees similar to those in other countries for transfer of capital and compensation for expropriations, and allows investors to own housing, offices and other buildings, although it does not address the question of land ownership. It also allows free trade zones and opens the door for Cuban exiles to invest.
The law still leaves the Cuban economy firmly in the hands of a Government that decries capitalism, but it formalizes an ideological shift forced by the dire need for capital after the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
Companies doing business in Cuba say the law legalizes changes already under way. The Cuban Government says 212 foreign-Cuban associations have already invested more than $2 billion in tourism, mining, transportation and other economic sectors, some under majority ownership. Some analysts noted that putting such a law on paper provides reassurance to investors that socialist Cuba is headed toward a more open economy.
"Cuba is changing, and the change is irreversible," said Jaime Pena Vera, director of international affairs for the Domos Group, the Mexican company invested in the Cuban telephone system and plans to build an industrial park near Havana's airport.
The law's broad terms, however, make it unclear how exactly it would be implemented. On Monday, President Fidel Castro told the National Assembly that he envisioned state majority ownership as the rule and 100 percent foreign ownership only in "exceptional cases."
At a news conference today, Ernesto Melendez, Cuba's Foreign Investment Minister, called the law an "instrument" to be used only for the economic and social development of the country and "anything that doesn't benefit that development will be excluded."
He said it was difficult to predict how much investment will now come in, but he expected a "significant" rise this year compared to the total so far, which he called modest.
Some experts noted that the law could have gone much further, saying that early discussions had included more free-market enticements. One debate focused on whether to allow foreign employers to hire their workers directly rather than through Government agencies, which was ultimately rejected. The new law also requires the Government to give case-by-case approval of each project.
Antonio Jorge, professor of economics and international relations at Florida International University in Miami, said the standard formula to attract foreign money calls for rapid privatization and a free-labor market, among other measures. He said the law in the end may be more political than economic.
"I think this is related to Castro's intention to obtain credit from international institutions and restructure his outstanding debt with Western countries," he said.
But John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, which disseminates information about the island to American businesses, said that the law goes further than many thought possible for Cuba and added that he saw it as a transitional tool for the gradual expansion of commercial opportunities. He said some American businessmen consider it a positive change that merits a review of the United States' trade ban against Cuba -- which many say excludes them from an attractive emerging market. At the same time, Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican and Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, have introduced legislation that would impose sanctions on foreign countries that trade with Cuba.
Among Cuba's leading investors are Mexico, in telecommunications, Spain, in tourism, and Canada, in the nickel industry. These and some 50 other countries with a commercial presence here see in Cuba a virgin market free of American competition as the country undertakes reforms that in recent years have included legalizing possession of dollars and authorizing some forms of self-employment and agricultural free markets.
There was unusually heated debate within the ruling Communist Party over some aspects of the legislation. One of the most controversial issues was the question of whether to prohibit investments by Cubans who left the island. Some Assembly deputies voiced opposition to accommodating exiles but most agreed that the Government still held a prerogative to deny entry to "enemies of the revolution" and that there was no need for wholesale discrimination against all Cubans who left.

HEADLINE: As High Schools Open, Mayor and Cortines Bicker

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
As New York City's 300,000 high school students returned to their classrooms yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines squared off yet again, blaming each other for the disarray marking the opening of the new school year.
The Chancellor, speaking at an impromptu news conference at Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, pointed the finger squarely at City Hall, saying the Mayor's aides had delayed talking to the board about school staffing problems, which in turn has left school superintendents scrambling to get teachers in classrooms. More than 1,000 teachers were still without assignments yesterday. 
 "We would not have had the confusion if together we had sat down three months ago," Mr. Cortines told reporters this morning in the school cafeteria.
Asked a few hours later about the Chancellor's remarks, Mr. Giuliani said the responsibility for any opening-day disruptions rested with the board, which threatened mass layoffs of teachers all summer long.
"I generally think the Board of Education drops the ball whenever they get a chance to," Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference. "I don't think they know how to catch a ball."
In spite of the rhetoric, the city's more than 170 high schools had what the Chancellor described as a relatively smooth opening, with no reports of violent incidents like those that marred past openings, including a shooting at Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn last year and a stabbing at Seward Park High the year before. The city's elementary and junior high schools open today.
Still, the usual opening-day tumult was heightened yesterday by the budgetary dispute that has lingered between the board and City Hall, as the board struggles to make the remaining $230 million in budget cuts ordered by the Giuliani administration.
An early retirement program -- the first in five years -- closed just last week, leaving high school principals throughout the system interviewing prospective replacement teachers yesterday, even after classes had begun. At William C. Bryant High School in Long Island City, Queens, the principal, Rose de Pinto, was still interviewing applicants at 3 P.M.
Teachers were grappling with class sizes that, in some cases, have ballooned to more than 35 pupils. And the students themselves were bemoaning the reduction in choices brought by the budget cuts, particularly in classes like physical education.
"In gym, they told us they weren't giving us bodybuilding, volleyball or basketball, just 'survey gym,' " said Ovel Ortiz, 16, a sophomore at Sheepshead Bay High School. "It's just everything combined together. It's boring."
The friction between the Mayor and the Chancellor, which has centered on the Mayor's bid for more control of the schools, started soon after Mr. Giuliani took office and culminated in Mr. Cortines's announcement in June that he would resign in October. Mr. Giuliani has since trained his sights on the board, arguing with it over the qualities of the next chancellor, the size of the school budget and whether the police should take over school security.
Mr. Cortines complained yesterday that the budget cuts absorbed by the schools had been inordinate, compared with other city departments.
"Yes, we do need safe streets," Mr. Cortines said. "Yes, we do need good hospitals. But unless you have a literate, educated society, there is not going to be the economic base."
Of the Mayor, the Chancellor said: "I think he has not looked at the good in this system."
Asked later if he would agree to cease his personal attacks on the Chancellor and the board president, Carol A. Gresser, Mr. Giuliani said, "I don't think we have to be precious about it." He added: "If youngsters are being victimized in schools, I'm going to get angry. And if the Board of Education is doing little or nothing about the fact that children are being beaten up in schools and being knifed in schools, and wants to continue with the incompetent way in which they've handled it, I'm going to get real angry."
Rosy Rivera, a senior at Sheepshead Bay High, said she saw the impact of the political bickering as soon as she stepped into school yesterday morning. After-school programs, she learned, had been eliminated because of budget cuts, as had most clubs.
"They're thinking about taking out the school store," she said. "It's different. It's changed. It's worse."

HEADLINE: For Baltimore Mayor, A Shaky Incumbency

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Sept. 3

 BODY:
When Kurt L. Schmoke became the first black to be elected Mayor of Baltimore, he seemed too good to be true for a once-vital smokestack city confronting the realities of a vanishing economic base. Educated at Yale, Harvard Law School and Oxford, with credentials as a local prosecutor and star high school quarterback, he was a local politician of instant national stature.
That was eight years ago. But when Mr. Schmoke stopped by the Southwest Senior Center in a struggling, racially mixed neighborhood here last week, few people greeted him with encouragement as he tries for a third term. Instead, they spoke up about filthy, crime-ravaged streets and abandoned buildings. 
 They were polite enough to Mr. Schmoke, who dutifully jotted their complaints in a notebook. But once the Mayor was out of earshot, some past supporters said they would not vote for him again -- and the primary is next week.
"All the money is leaving the city; what do we do?" asked Fannie Fitzgerald, 67, a retired nurse who said that as a black woman she was proud to support Mr. Schmoke four years ago but is too discouraged to vote at all this year. "There's an empty house next to mine. The bricks are falling down. It rains in there. And the drug dealers have taken over. This has been five years. What do we do?"
It is an all-too-familiar refrain for the 45-year-old Mr. Schmoke, who has lost the high hopes and good will that accompanied his arrival at City Hall. He is now in the toughest race of his career, facing a predicament that not even his detractors imagined in 1987: this predominately black city is threatening to throw out its black Mayor and elect a white one. An incumbent black mayor of a major black-majority American city has never been upset by a white opponent.
Voting patterns show that people tend to prefer candidates of their own religion or ethnic group. But the Baltimore contest may signal to politicians around the country that the more people feel dissatisfied with their own lives, the more likely they will be to disregard the background of the candidates and vote for whoever they think can do the most good.
"The era when it was a matter of racial pride to elect a black mayor is gone," said David A. Bositis, a senior researcher for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a group based in Washington that studies issues facing blacks.
In particular, Mr. Schmoke's difficulties might offer a taste of what awaits black mayors in increasingly hard-pressed cities like Cleveland and St. Louis.
Even if Mr. Schmoke manages to win the Democratic primary on Sept. 12 -- the latest polls show that he is in a virtual dead heat with the City Council president, Mary Pat Clarke -- his erosion of support demonstrates that with cities in such despair, it may not be enough for candidates to be black to draw black voters. The primary here is tantamount to a general election in November since 85 percent of Baltimore's registered voters are Democrats.
"The problem he has is it's not only whites that are fed up with what's happening in the city but blacks as well," said Frank A. DeFelippo, a political commentator here. "What's driving this campaign is the quality of life in Baltimore and whether it has deteriorated."
While prominent black politicians in Baltimore and in the state capital, Annapolis, are not deserting Mr. Schmoke entirely, many are no longer standing by him.
"There seems to be a lot more electricity associated with Clarke's campaign," said Parren J. Mitchell, a black politician and former member of the United States House who is staying neutral. "There's a perception that Schmoke is just not close to the people."
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York said the situation here reminded him of how Jewish voters had resisted backing Jewish candidates just because they are Jewish. "When Hugh Carey and Howard Samuels were running against one another for governor," Mr. Koch said of a New York campaign, "Hugh Carey carried the Jewish vote overwhelmingly because a judgment was made by the Jewish community that it was better to have someone far better who wasn't Jewish."
Mr. Schmoke's troubles in the nation's 14th-largest city, with a population of 700,000, are shared by many other mayors: jobs are down, crime and school dropout rates are up, and the pool of money from Washington is all but depleted. But some of Mr. Schmoke's difficulties reflect his approach. He is cerebral and often aloof in a city that grew accustomed to the 15-year reign of Mayor William Donald Schaefer, an eccentric but indefatigable cheerleader for the city who went on to serve two terms as Governor. Mr. Schaefer transformed Baltimore into a tourist destination with projects like Harborplace, his signature shopping complex at the once-dilapidated waterfront.
Mr. Schmoke, whose advisers say they have set out to shatter "the Schaefer myth," has little patience for the comparisons.
"I dramatically decreased the size of government, and part of that was reducing the P.R. apparatus in City Hall," the Mayor said in an interview. "It was a good government move, but it reduced the ability to portray an image week to week of the Mayor in action. And I paid a price for that."
The Mayor emphasizes his close relationships with Gov. Parris N. Glendening, a fellow Democrat, and with President Clinton, which helped the city win a $100 million grant to combat the urban decay. But those contacts do not impress The Baltimore Sun, which has backed Mr. Schmoke in the past but last week endorsed Mrs. Clarke and described the Mayor as "a sad disappointment even to many of the Mayor's most persistent admirers."
Mr. Schaefer, who was never an ally of either Mr. Schmoke or Mrs. Clarke, is also backing Mrs. Clarke. The persnickety former Mayor, who was known for prowling the streets hunting for potholes that needed attention, said he sometimes could not bear walking through his beloved Harborplace. "It's just sad," he said in an interview. "The Inner Harbor has been neglected. The neighborhoods have been neglected. The city's slipping."
Although Mr. Schmoke drew mostly negative national attention in 1988 for advocating the decriminalization of many drugs, his critics point more to local concerns. They say he has done little to address the loss of nearly 50,000 jobs from the city during his tenure. He has also been accused of surrounding himself with unimpressive appointees and of steering at least $2.4 million worth of the city's legal business to his two closest political advisers.
Most striking about Mr. Schmoke's campaign is that support from white voters is so thin that for the first time he has geared his campaign to blacks. His bumper stickers are red, black and green, the colors of the black liberation movement, and his slogan is "Makes Us Proud." The unmistakable appeal to blacks has infuriated some whites and even some blacks, who accuse Mr. Schmoke of stoking racial tensions.
"I'm not apologetic at all," Mr. Schmoke said. "For the majority population of this city, those colors have traditionally been symbols of pride and empowerment, not division."
But he went on to explain that he never relied on white voters, saying, "I've never gotten higher than 25 percent of the white vote."
Mr. Schmoke's appeal to blacks has put off some white voters and may make it difficult for him even to approach the 25 percent figure this time. After chatting with the Mayor at the Southwest Senior Center, Hazel Downey, a past supporter and a white, said she might go with Mrs. Clarke. "I hate to say it, but I think he is partial to the black areas," said Mrs. Downey, 76, a retired seamstress.
Mr. Bositis, the political researcher, compared Mr. Schmoke to Gen. Colin L. Powell, saying that if General Powell runs for President he may disappoint white voters who have projected their own views onto him.
While Mr. Schmoke is still counting on drawing the bulk of the black voters, who make up about 60 percent of the city's voting-age population, analysts say Mrs. Clarke could win if she picks off about 20 percent of that vote. "She's getting more blacks than he's getting whites, and I suspect that will hold," said J. Bradford Coker, whose company has conducted extensive polling on the campaign.
Mr. Coker said that more whites than blacks would probably defect from Mr. Schmoke but that if the Mayor lost 15 percent to 20 percent of the black vote he received four years ago, he could lose the election.
Mrs. Clarke's skills as an administrator have not been tested, and she is known for her impulsive streak. But the 54-year-old Mrs. Clarke, a former teacher, has been a popular and visible figure in white and black neighborhoods for years. She was a staunch opponent of Harborplace initially, but her frenetic, hands-on style is reminiscent of Mr. Schaefer. In addition, she seems more at ease in the black neighborhoods than the affable but reserved Mr. Schmoke, who with his preppy red suspenders looks as if he would fit in better in the ivy-covered buildings of Cambridge, Mass., than in gritty neighborhoods here with names like Pigtown.
During a walking tour of a mostly black community last week, Mrs. Clarke was greeted excitedly by dozens of residents as she bounded up and down the streets in white sneakers.
"You helped my brother get a job with the city -- he's been in it for nine years," said Carolyn Thomas, who is unemployed. "I remember when you came here and helped with the drug campaign."
Ms. Thomas, 40, said that she had voted for Mr. Schmoke four years ago but that "I feel we need a change." Pointing to boarded row houses, she added: "They've been that way for years. We need help."
Down the street, Robert Gant, 37, who is also unemployed, was even more derisive of Mr. Schmoke. "He hasn't done anything," he said. "Nothing's changed."
Mr. Schmoke dismisses his rival as shallow, a "feel-good, local version of Ronald Reagan" whose proposals would bankrupt the city.
But not breaking her stride as she was asked why she turned on Mr. Schmoke, whom she had supported when he first ran, Mrs. Clarke blurted: "Out of touch. Out of touch."

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 13.73 Points in Broad Advance Led by Airlines

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose yesterday, following through on broad advances in the two previous trading sessions.
"The idea that the Federal Reserve will reduce short-term interest rates this month is being kept alive," said Hugh A. Johnson, senior vice president of the First Albany Corporation. "The economy still appears to be laboring through a soft landing and may need a helping hand from the Fed." 
 Yesterday's report from the Commerce Department that wholesale inventories increased sharply while wholesale sales slid was cited by analysts as indicative of sluggish economic growth. Further evidence of sluggishness that might call for a rate cut came from the Johnson Redbook report that retail sales in the first week of September, a key period for back-to-school selling, increased only two-tenths of 1 percent.
Part of the market rally, moreover, was attributed to overseas buying interest. Cyclical companies whose earnings move in line with economic cycles were among the day's standouts.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 13.73 points, at 4,683.81, marking its fourth consecutive gain. In the broader market, records were set by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose a point to close at 570.17, and the Nasdaq composite index, which closed at 1,044.28, up 4.98 points.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange topped decliners by 1,315 to 918. Big Board volume increased to 369.5 million shares from 337.1 million shares on Tuesday.
Airline stocks showed increases yesterday, apparently on expectations that fares would be firm and cost-cutting would continue. AMR, the holding company for American Airlines, rose 3/8, to 75 1/8; UAL, the holding company for United Airlines, 2 3/4, to 162; Delta Air Lines, 7/8, to 77 5/8, and USAir, 7/8, to 10 5/8.
Chemical companies also rose, with traders foreseeing higher profitability if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. Du Pont closed at 67 1/4, up 1; Monsanto closed at 99 1/2, up 2, and Union Carbide closed at 37, up 1/2.
Some technology stocks moved higher, as the market sorted out those issues likely to maintain their huge first-half earnings gains. Among them were Texas Instruments, up 1 7/8, to 78 5/8; Compaq, up 1 1/4, to 50 5/8; Cisco Systems, up 1 3/8, to 69 1/2; and Dell Computer, up 4 1/2, to 85 1/4. Micron Technology enjoyed a gain of 5 7/8, to 87 1/4 after the Soundview Financial Group raised its earnings estimates for fiscal years 1996 and 1997.
The bond market was mixed yesterday, with the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond down 2/32and its yield unchanged at 6.57 percent. As a result, many utility stocks, which often follow bond prices, fell. Unicom, the parent company of Commonwealth Edison, fell 1/4, to 28 1/8; Central Hudson Gas and Electric, 1/8, to 27 7/8, and Public Service Enterprise, 3/8, to 26 7/8.
Some of the bank issues turned lower after the recent surge in that sector stemming from a rash of mergers. J. P. Morgan closed at 73 5/8,, down 1 5/8, and Wells Fargo closed at 85 1/2, down 1 1/8.
Merger news did affect stocks in other groups. Xylogics, a network-equipment manufacturer that agreed to be acquired by Bay Networks, surged 11 7/8, to 48 7/8. And Megatest, a semiconductor test systems producer that agreed to be purchased by Teradyne, jumped 8, to 32 1/4.
On the down side, Bandag fell 1 3/8, to 58 1/8, after announcing expectations that third-quarter net income would be 5 percent to 10 percent lower than a year earlier.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Are Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities turned mixed yesterday as investors consolidated recent gains, ending a four-day rally.
Trading was quiet as investors apparently waited for further evidence of slow economic growth and low inflation before commmitting more money. 
 The 30-year bond was down 2/32 , to a price of 10331/32 for a yield of 6.57 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's New York session.
The Treasury entered the market yesterday and saw good investor demand for its auction of $5 billion of 8-day cash management bills at an average rate of 5.65 percent, up from the 5.58 percent it got for a 20-day bill on Aug. 28. Cash-management bills are used to meet short-term borrowing needs beyond the money raised through the Government's regulary scheduled auctions.
Analysts say the outlook on new issue supply remains bright in the weeks ahead, meaning there is not likely to be an oversupply to weigh on prices.
In the futures market, which invariably influences the cash market, trading was choppy, bouncing higher after the Government reported a seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in July wholesale sales and a nine-tenths of 1 percent growth in inventories, suggesting struggling sales and slow growth. The drop in sales was the first decline since the 1 percent in March, and inventories saw their 13th straight monthly rise.
The December bond contract dropped to a session low of 11312/32 and was as high as 11328/32 , before ending at 11322/32 . Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst for Thomson Research, Portland, Ore, said the market was beginning to find the shorter maturities a bit pricey and might back off as a result.
Trading started on an upbeat note as the market reacted to comments from a Fed governor, Janet Yellen. In an interview with the Market News wire service late Tuesday, she expressed her encouragment by the inflation outlook, and said easing could conceivably be justified on that ground alone if growth does not accelerate unexpectedly.
Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, described the market as lethargic yesterday, with no real interest from small investors.
"The only place getting fair value and relative return on investment right now is the short end," Mr. Roden said. "Those who run balanced money portfolios, with cash in short maturities and cash in longer maturies are finding it tougher and tougher each day, he continued, and will soon have to decide how to deploy cash that is building up.
Yields of municipal securities were little changed yesterday, and the Bond Buyer's index of 40 various issues remained unchanged at 6.04 percent.
In the corporate debt market, the General Motors Corporation led three companies that raised $825 million.
The giant auto maker sold $500 million of 30-year bonds through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. Traders said the 7.40 percent debt was priced at 99.194, to yield 7.468 percent, or about 81 basis points above the 7 5/8 percent Treasury bond due Feb. 15, 2025. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The bonds, which are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service, A- by the Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company, and BBB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, are noncallable by the issuer through maturity.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
MCI Wins Mexican Long-Distance License

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 6

 BODY:
An aggressive joint venture between MCI Communications of the United States and Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest financial group, today became the first company to win a Government license to compete in Mexico's long-distance telephone market when the current monopoly ends on Jan. 1, 1997.
The Government is expected to grant concessions to several other new companies over the coming weeks in what is seen as the completion of longstanding promises to encourage open competition in the $4 billion long-distance market and improve Mexico's notoriously poor telephone service. 
 Other big American companies that have filed applications to enter the Mexican market in joint ventures with local partners include GTE, which has teamed up with Grupo Financiero Bancomer, this country's second-largest financial group; Bell Atlantic, which has joined with Iusacell, a Mexican cellular-phone company, and AT&T, which has entered into what is expected to be the dominant long-distance venture with Grupo Alfa, a large corporation in the northern city of Monterrey with interests in steel, prepared food and chemicals.
All three groups are expected to obtain Government approval.
By becoming the first to win approval, the Banamex-MCI venture gained certain advantages, including the ability to begin direct negotiations with Telefonos de Mexico, the current telephone monopoly, and to start construction of a national network. The venture, called Avantel, plans to spend $600 million over three years.
Still, Avantel will have to wait until 1997 to begin offering long-distance service. By that time, other companies are sure to have received permission to also enter the Mexican telecommunications market. While the market could triple in value over the next five years, last year's disastrous devaluation of the peso and the current recession have taken some of the shine off its possibilities.
"It was very logical that Banamex-MCI should get the first concession because they were one of the first ventures that was put together and they've had the most time to prepare their documents," said Jorge Sanchez, a telecommunications analyst at the Vector brokerage firm here. "Being first to hit the ground certainly gives them some advantages, but I think the market has already discounted most of them, and there probably will be no great impulse for the company."
There had been concern that the announcement would damage Telmex, as the monopoly is known, which accounts for about a quarter of the Mexican stock market's value. But investors had apparently taken the announcement into account. Telmex's American depository receipts closed in New York at $33.125, down 37.5 cents, and MCI was 75 cents lower, at $24.125. Banamex-Accival L shares were the big winners, gaining 3 percent in trading here.
In recent weeks, the Mexican Government has accelerated the pace with which it is opening the long distance market. Last Friday, the Communications and Transportation Ministry released details of how the free long-distance licenses were to be awarded. Under the guidelines, each company that applies has to prepare a five-year plan that outlines its investment and marketing strategy as well as its financing.
The Government said in the regulations that it would make decisions within 120 days of receiving the completed documents.
The next application to be granted is expected to be for a company named MarcaTel, a joint venture between IXC Communications and Westel of the United States, Radio Beep S.A. of Mexico and Teleglobe of Canada.
The chairman of MCI, Bert C. Roberts Jr., said in an interview here this afternoon that he expected to see as many as 25 companies or groups competing in Mexico's long-distance market in spite of the country's economic problems. A recession forces companies and families to look for ways to cut costs, and MCI, he said, "generally capitalizes in a situation like this."
Manuel Medina Mora, deputy president of Banamex, said Mexico's economic troubles had not weakened its ability to enter an unfamiliar new field like telecommunications. "As a result of the crisis," he said, Banamex is in "a relatively stronger position in the financial sector in Mexico, given the consolidation and given some of the problems that other banks are facing."

HEADLINE: A Fed Governor Sees Danger in Shift to a National Sales Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Switching from the income tax to a national sales or value-added tax would probably plunge the economy into a steep recession, a Federal Reserve Board member said today.
The prediction by one of the 12 Fed governors, Lawrence B. Lindsey, long an advocate of lower income tax rates, was a setback to the retail sales tax championed by Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, an aspirant for the Republican Presidential nomination. 
 It served to bolster the prospects among Republicans of the competing flat-tax proposal advocated by the House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, and endorsed in general terms by Senator Bob Dole, the leading Republican Presidential aspirant.
Mr. Lindsey was one of several prominent witnesses who testified today before a G.O.P.-sponsored commission headed by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp.
Mr. Lindsey, who was a White House economics official under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, argued that all the major alternatives to the income tax now under consideration would stimulate long-run economic growth and would thus be preferable to the existing tax system. But he pointed to the potential for big problems in any transition from the income tax to a sales or similar value-added tax that would impose levies directly on consumption.
As the day for switching systems approached, Mr. Lindsey said, individuals and businesses would have a great incentive to go on buying sprees to avoid the higher prices that would follow. But once the tax went into effect, he said, consumers would probably reduce spending to rebuild their savings.
"There would likely be a boom," he said, followed by "a bust during which demand was insufficient" to maintain the economy at its level before the boom.
He predicted "a period of protracted instability" and 'significant disruption" of the economy. And he said that a switch to a sales tax or value-added tax -- a European system that taxes goods and services at each level of production and distribution -- would also require a law allowing renegotiation of every labor and commercial contract, which "would be a very messy business."
A flat tax, which would eliminate most, if not all deductions, would also be disruptive to the economy, Mr. Lindsey acknowledged, but could be more easily managed.
The leading proposals advocated by Republicans fall into three categories. One is a flat tax on wages and business earnings with no tax on interest, dividends and capital gains. Another is a graduated income tax with a deduction for all savings. The third is to switch to either a sales tax or a value-added tax.
Mr. Kemp, who favors low tax rates, repeatedly questioned witnesses about the potential impact of the various proposals on economic growth. In an interview, he said he was convinced that a tax system could be designed that would dramatically improve the capacity of the American economy to grow faster without higher inflation.
He suggested that an overhaul of the tax system would be so beneficial that the economy, now generally considered capable of normal real growth of less than 3 percent a year or so, could reach an annual growth rate of 5 percent or more.
Most of the witnesses who testified before the Republican panel, the privately financed National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, favored a replacement for the current graduated income tax, with its complex rules and its array of exemptions and deductions.
But some warned that the housing market would be heavily damaged if the deductions for interest on home mortgages and property taxes were eliminated.
To avoid unfair comparisons, the Social Security and Medicare taxes paid on wages must be taken into account, other witnesses noted. Wayne D. Angell, chief economist at Bear, Stearns and a former Fed governor, pointed out that the current 15 percent income tax rate on modest wage earners, when combined with Social Security taxes paid by those employees and their employers, meant that at least 30 cents on each dollar of extra earnings was paid by or on behalf of most workers.

HEADLINE: New York Banks' Retreat From Poor Neighborhoods Hurts All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bob Herbert's "Power to the Banks" (column, Sept. 1), depicting the lack of banking services in New York City's poorer areas, is fine as far as it goes, but fails to examine the social and economic consequences or pose any pragmatic solutions to this dismal situation. 
 The Lower East Side, South Bronx, Bushwick and Harlem -- once and still the poorest areas of our city -- are littered with abandoned hulks of banks in which the wage-earning poor saved their money, millions-fold. Beyond these institutions' benefits to people who used them, the accumulated capital launched small businesses and built middle-class houses in the city and suburbs.
More important, banks provided lessons to the newly arrived and poor about capitalism and saving for the future. The retreat of banks from these areas -- often prompted by mergers such as the recent Chemical-Chase transaction -- has not only deprived individual citizens of accumulating the sort of capital that once enabled them to move into the middle class, but has irreparably damaged the economy of our urban areas and the nation as a whole.
This situation could be bettered were the New York City government to leverage its business with New York's banks. Billions of dollars are deposited each year in local banks, against which payroll and purchasing checks are drawn. While banks often maintain that, transaction by transaction, they lose money on these functions, the money thus deposited contributes mightily to the "float" available to the banks for short-term loans.
In addition, millions of dollars each year remain on deposit for substantial periods of time because of suppliers' lags in cashing checks, or because checks remain uncashed while employees are on vacation, have been terminated or have even died.
Were the city to require all banks with which it does business toprovide services to now-neglected areas, more would be gained than the ability of an individual to save for a wedding: the city itself and all of its citizens would benefit.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Hurdles are still high for women who want a career and a family.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WITH Labor Day just passed and Hillary Rodham Clinton in China to discuss the status of women around the world, it seems a good time to ask how educated American women trying to reconcile careers with family life are faring. The answer, gleaned from long-term survey data by Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, is not well.
The formal limits that prevented women from combining financially rewarding work with child-rearing are fading. But the practical constraints are proving very durable. Ms. Goldin found that even by a modest definition, just one middle-aged college-educated woman in six with children can claim career success today. 
 While sobering, the conclusion should hardly be surprising. Equality of opportunity, Ms. Goldin argues, is not sufficient to generate equality of result. That goal will remain elusive, she predicts, until offices become more friendly to mothers. And most of the accommodation, she suggests, will have to be by men.
The history of career-oriented women in the workplace is illuminating. Educated women of the turn-of-the-century decade -- the first generation to attend colleges in substantial numbers -- faced a stark choice between family and career. While four out of five women in that period had children, fully half the college graduates remained childless.
No wonder. Ms. Goldin notes that for 60 percent of the female college graduates, a career meant teaching in an elementary or secondary school. And during the 1920's and 1930's, most schools refused to hire married women -- and fired those with the temerity to marry while on the payroll.
Such bald discrimination against career women disappeared during World War II. After the war, far larger numbers of women went to college and a higher proportion of those who graduated married and had children. Just 17 percent of the postwar graduates reached the age of 44 without giving birth. But Ms. Goldin sees a dark lining in this silver cloud.
The trend, she surmises, was largely driven by the changing economic function of college for women. She calculates that relatively few of the new millions of female graduates ended up with jobs that actually compensated for their investment in higher education. Instead, college paid off as a marriage market, a place to meet good providers. College-educated married women often worked -- but typically only before their children were born and after they were well established in school. They rarely held jobs with career ladders.
None of this is much of a surprise. What is shocking, however, is that the experience of women in the early baby-boom generation -- the first to go to professional schools in numbers approaching that of men or to have access to fast-track jobs -- is not as different as you might have thought. Ms. Goldin looked at the experience of women graduates born between 1946 and 1956, relying on data from the National Longitudinal Survey, which tracks tens of thousands of Americans over their entire lives.
Ms. Goldin defines a successful "career" very modestly. Her standard of success requires simply that a person achieved average earnings better than the lowest 25 percent of college-educated men for two of the sample years (1987 and 1988). By definition, 75 percent of male college graduates achieved that status. Among women, 33 percent made the grade. But many of those were childless. Just 17 percent managed both a career and children.
Other definitions of a successful career only marginally brighten the picture. If the standard is lowered to include all college-educated mothers who were employed full time at any wage during 1985, 1987 and 1988, just 22 percent make the hurdle. Nor, for that matter, does a career seem to mesh well with a definition of family life that requires only a man on the premises: In 1985, 53 percent of women with careers were married, compared with 79 percent of the noncareer group.
What is going on here? Women, Ms. Goldinsays, now have a reasonable crack at landing good jobs. Indeed, the pay rates of comparably educated men and women at the starting gate are almost identical. But to stay on the fast track, women must be willing to act just like men: working long hours year after year while carrying what she labels "all the economic baggage of our parents."
Ms. Goldin has little enthusiasm for the northern European approach to easing the burden on career woman -- namely, government-subsidized day care. "I'm not in favor of taxing everyone to cover the cost of raising the children of parents with high incomes," she explains.
But in the American workplace and home, the private alternatives -- changing the demands of fast-track jobs to accommodate mothers or changing the responsibilities of men in child care -- don't seem to be happening. Men and women may now be equal, but apparently one sex remains more equal than the other.

HEADLINE: Lost Jobs, Found Directions

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
WHEN John and Carol Brooks lost their jobs three years ago in a downsizing move at I.B.M., to cut costs they gave up their four-bedroom home in a San Francisco suburb and moved to a smaller house outside Fort Worth. A mechanic recently told them that if they hoped to squeeze more miles from their nine-year-old Lincoln, they had better baby it.
Once, Mr. Brooks, 53, and his wife, 51, earned more than $150,000 together at the International Business Machines Corporation, but now they make less than half that. Yet, they say they do not resent the dizzying drop, because as a result of being shunted off the fast track -- two among the hundreds of thousands of workers displaced by job cuts in recent years -- their values have changed. 
 "I don't think we care about keeping up with the Joneses anymore," said Mrs. Brooks, a former quality manager who runs a small business sprucing up houses for sale. "Going to T.G.I. Friday's is just as good as going to a French restaurant. We don't miss it. In fact, I'm probably more peaceful now than I've been in memory."
The couple cite other changes: there is time to volunteer for their church; get-togethers with friends are now a focus of each week, and sex roles have loosened, with Mrs. Brooks managing the family money and Mr. Brooks doing more cooking and housework.
"We talk more about cosmic realities, I guess," said Mr. Brooks, a former systems designer at I.B.M. and now a struggling consultant. "How are we all linked together? I never gave these questions much thought five years ago. I was too damn busy."
The Brookses are not alone in finding that getting laid off in middle age and mid-career can trigger a reappraisal of bedrock values. Employment experts and psychologists say that while most laid-off white-collar workers strive to regrasp the same rung on the ladder of success, many rethink the ladder itself.
Interviews with former management-level employees around the country revealed that a significant number have experienced life changes, with implications for family structure, communities and perhaps the economy itself. To be sure, losing a job is invariably traumatic, and no more so than when a worker is in mid-career with a mortgage and family to sustain. Psychologists say that laid-off workers commonly experience anger, loss of confidence and depression. Families can split asunder if a spouse fails to understand and support the worker.
Yet, most laid-off employees eventually work again, resolving the financial crisis. And out of the emotional upheaval, many forge a new outlook on life.
Dr. Sharon Coleman, a psychotherapist in Manhattan whose practice includes out-of-work managers, compares the psychic journey to the grief following a loved one's death.
"There's usually denial, then anger and then bargaining," Dr. Coleman said. "People go up and down until finally coming to acceptance, which is healthy. When you get to accepting that the game has changed in the career world, you're ready to move on."
The process usually takes six months to a year, she said.
"They ultimately get to rethinking their priorities," she said.
Like a scimitar, the downsizing trend has cut broadly through the economy in recent years, in bad times and in good. Last week's announced merger of Chemical and Chase Manhattan banks included the news that 12,000 jobs would be cut. In all, American companies cast off 516,000 jobs last year, and 97,000 in the first three months of this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago consulting firm.
A decade ago, the layoffs were mostly on Rust Belt assembly lines, but in the 1990's, downsizing has spread to middle management. Economists say that many of the jobs, which were disproportionately held by men, have disappeared, never to return.
"All of a sudden, white middle-aged men have been falling out of corporations like there's no tomorrow," said Barbara Collins, a senior vice president of Drake Beam Morrin in New York, which advises laid-off workers how to find new jobs.
Experts say that men frequently have a tougher time handling a layoff because, unlike women, they do not have as much to fall back on. Women have frequently broadened their roles to include taking care of children or aging parents. But many men derive their identity and self-worth solely from work.
"When I had a job, it was everything to me, more important than my family," admitted Larry Shane, 41, a former vice president and portfolio manager at Prudential Securities in Rochester. "Everything was income, the country club and cars. Suddenly it's all yanked from under you, and you ask yourself, Where's the meaning now?"
Since losing his job last year, Mr. Shane has given up the country club, withdrawn his children from private school and lost a house in foreclosure. He and his wife struggle to get by on her part-time job at a Gap store and on disability checks from his old employer. The disability payment, he said, is the result of stress related to his job loss.
Yet, even if an offer to return to corporate life arose, he would not accept it, Mr. Shane said. He has concluded that the race for prestige and possessions is a sham. To help learn who he is, he has sought psychotherapy and in the meantime is a stay-at-home father of four.
"I think my values are moving much closer to my wife's," he said. "I was more in tune with the superficial. Whereas now, I say money is important because you have to eat, but what's the difference between making $50,000 or $100,000? I'm not a better person at $100,000. It hasn't been easy. It's been very painful. But I can tell you it was the best thing that ever happened to me."
Many laid-off corporate warriors have lowered their expectations of work itself. They no longer invest themselves emotionally in jobs, experts say, and they look elsewhere for satisfaction.
"At I.B.M., my attitude was 'Never say no,' " said Mr. Brooks, the former systems designer. "Everything was focused on the company. I've come to the conclusion that was not the proper approach. Now, all I think is: Do the best job you can and show up on time, and don't be personally involved in the outcome."
Many have tried to become consultants or entrepreneurs, usually trading off a lower standard of living to be their own captains.
Ken Brynildsen, another former I.B.M.-er, joined his wife in a home business making children's gifts. Unable to afford their old home in Rye, N.Y., they moved to Sandwich, Mass., on Cape Cod. Mr. Brynildsen, 51, a former corporate speech writer, never imagined he would end up selling at crafts fairs around New England. But he counts himself better off.
"To be honest, I did not think I could be this happy," he said. "The quality of time I spend with my 14-year-old son is better. In eight years at I.B.M., I never met an I.B.M. customer, but now I deal with customers all the time, and the pieces we make touch people's lives."
Others find satisfaction in volunteer work, shifting their focus away from careers to civic life. Dave Heitmiller, of Seattle, worked for U S West for 17 years, most recently as a product manager. Now, he is a Big Brother and hammers nails two days a week, unpaid, for Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit group that builds homes for the working poor.
"To me, it's giving time back to the community," said Mr. Heitmiller, 49. "I believe the planet is in big trouble and there's certain things we can each do to help. When you're working full time, you're either too tired or too burned out to do a lot of those things."
Mr. Heitmiller and his wife, Jacqueline Blix, 46, a former marketing executive at Pacific Telephone, participate in a group that meets regularly to discuss low-stress, low-cost living. The group was inspired by the book "Voluntary Simplicity" by Duane Elgin (Morrow, 1993).
Encouraged by the group, Mr. Heitmiller and Ms. Blix sold their four-bedroom house in a posh Seattle area and moved into a rented apartment in a working-class neighborhood. Once owners of a Jeep Cherokee and an Audi 5000, they now drive a single economy car, a Nissan Sentra, and have pared other expenses to live on investment income of less than half of Mr. Heitmiller's old salary of about $60,000.
"This should never be considered deprivation and poverty," Mr. Heitmiller insisted. "We have most of the comforts we need. We adjusted to a smaller space rather readily. Last year, we traveled in Europe for two months."
Not everybody has the ability to live off savings, especially those with children at home. In many cases, the wives of laid-off men become their families' primary breadwinners, a role-reversal that can produce family stress.
Dominic Arbisi was laid off by the Xerox Corporation in 1978, during one of the earliest downsizing waves, and his wife, who had not worked since the birth of their three children, got a job as a teacher of learning-disabled children.
"There were periods I felt I was fading into the woodwork because I had no means of support, and in our society if you're male and you're not working, you have no value," said Mr. Arbisi, who lives in Minnetonka, Minn.
Now 70, Mr. Arbisi still works, as an inventor and struggling entrepreneur. A line of his salad dressings, Arbisi's, based on old family recipies, is sold regionally.
Mr. Arbisi and others like him, members of a generation whose values were fixed when there were few two-income couples, have had to expand their definition of sex roles, in some cases raising children while their wives work, in others, caring for aging parents.
"While some men appreciate being the stay-at-home partner, a lot don't," said Mitchell L. Marks, a psychologist and the author of "From Turmoil to Triumph" (Lexington Books, 1994), a book about the impact of downsizing on corporations. "It leads to depression for someone whose identity is wrapped around work. On the other hand, some men never knew they could get so much pleasure staying at home being a daddy. I've heard of daddies who don't want to go back to the workplace, or they take a less-demanding job."
In Texas, the Brookses, the couple who used to work at I.B.M., meet regularly with an alumni group of some 125 former I.B.M.-ers at a Lutheran church.
There are participants who remain demoralized about being laid off, Mrs. Brooks said, but a frequent topic of conversation among others is how personal philosophies have changed. Once, they were in thrall to the corporation. Now, many have rediscovered their own identities and a sense of self-reliance.
"I think we haven't begun to see the impact of this on society and business," Mrs. Brooks said. "The entrepreneurial spirit, the women-owned businesses, the people who now have time to volunteer. I think five years from now we're going to see it's changed us as a country an awful lot."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Japan Intervenes But Backs Off When Fed Doesn't

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged yesterday after the Bank of Japan took the currency market by surprise and bought dollars for yen.
The intervention came after Japan announced that its current accounts surplus in July fell 21 percent, to $9.22 billion, from a year earlier. 
 The currency market initially shrugged off the data, but it was brought to attention when the central bank entered the market intent on moving the dollar higher.
The bank's intervention propelled the dollar toward a six-month high against the yen, but after the dollar peaked at 99.20 yen, it backed off.
"It was just seen as an overall dollar-supportive measure," said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
He said the dollar moved up smartly against the yen and then against European currencies.
The dollar was further bolstered against the German mark after the Bundesbank cut a money market rate for the fourth time in five weeks. At its regular weekly money-market operations yesterday, the German central bank cut the 14-day securities repurchase rate, or repo rate, by one-tenth of a percentage point. In the last five weeks, the repo rate has fallen to 4.2 percent from 4.5 percent.
Still, economists said it was far too early for another cut in either the Lombard rate or the discount rate, both of which the Bundesbank lowered by a half a percentage point two weeks ago. Lower German interest rates would tend to make the mark-based investments relatively less attractive.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 98.88 yen from 97.68 yen on Tuesday. It rose to 1.4762 marks from 1.4621 marks. The British pound fell to $1.5520 from $1.5577.
For much of the day in New York, the market was unnerved by the prospect of the Federal Reserve following Japan and buying more dollars. But dealers gingerly took profits when the Fed did not emerge.
Despite the dollar's inability to burst through to fresh highs against the yen as it butted into significant technical resistance, some dealers saw fresh gains ahead.
"I think we're getting close to liquidating some of those export orders that still lurk up there," said Steve Jonathan, vice president for foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch, referring to Japanese export companies that frequently need to convert their dollar holdings to yen.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Planning to Monitor Japan Compliance on Autos

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 6

 BODY:
Sensitive to those who contend that its hard-won agreement to open the Japanese automotive market would have little tangible result, the Clinton Administration announced a plan today for monitoring Japan's compliance.
Central to the plan, which involves what the Administration called "unprecedented collaboration" with American producers, would be a team headed by the top United States trade official, Mickey Kantor, and the Department of Commerce. Their day-by-day scrutiny of progress in raising sales of American automobiles and parts in Japan would be documented in semiannual public reports, beginning next March. 
 At the same time, Mr. Kantor, the United States trade representative, told a White House conference room packed with industry representatives that "you're the most crucial aspect" of the process, both supplying information to monitors and taking full advantage of new opportunities in a Japanese market that has long resisted inroads by the United States and other foreign producers.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a long-time trade specialist who now heads the Administration's National Economic Council, said, "We need a tough, enforceable agreement, and we want to be able to judge that over time."
The automotive agreement was reached on June 28 in Geneva after turbulent, marathon negotiations that brought relations between Japan and the United States to the boiling point. It came just hours before $5.9 billion in United States tariffs against Japanese luxury cars were set to take effect.
In what seemed an early sign that the agreement could be fruitful, a unit of Tenneco Inc. announced today that the Toyota Motor Company would sell its replacement shock absorbers and struts through 5,000 Toyota dealerships in Japan.
Until now, Tenneco said, its Monroe and Rancho brand shocks have been restricted from use as replacements for Japanese-made original equipment because shocks were considered by Japan to be "critical parts."
The Toyota contract calls for an initial shipment of Rancho shock absorbers to be sold as replacement parts for sport utility vehicles.
"This contract provides the first concrete evidence that the Japanese auto market is opening up to U.S. replacement parts as a result of the U.S.-Japan trade agreement," Richard A. Snell, president of Tenneco Automotive, said in a statement.
The size of the deal, which comes more than 20 years after Tenneco began trying to penetrate the Japanese market, was not specified.
The shock absorbers for Toyota would be made in a Paragould, Ark., plant where Monroe employs 1,000 workers.
Alex Trotman, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, pledged strenuous efforts for the Big Three auto makers to reach a goal of 200 new outlets in Japan by next year and 1,000 dealerships by the year 2000, but said "serious constraints" still existed.
The high cost of establishing dealerships in Japan had deterred American auto makers in the past.
The Administration's enforcement team would consist of 10 members, including specialists from the Departments of State, Labor and Transportation; the Customs Service; the Commerce Department, and the trade representative's office.
In addition, the Auto Parts Advisory Committee, an industry group, announced a new mechanism today for data collection and reporting under which an independent firm is to collect, analyze and report company figures on parts, accessories and materials on an aggregate basis.
The Administration has estimated the agreement would generate about $9 billion in sales for the American automotive industry over the next three years, 75 percent of it going to Japanese plants in the United States.
Japan, however, has declined to provide estimates of the effect of the agreement. The agreement, however, has no numerical goals.
Critics like Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, have called the agreement vague and unenforceable.
What the Administration's enforcement team would watch, according to today's announcement, is a list of 17 items, including changes in the number and value of new foreign vehicles sold in Japan, in the number of new franchise agreements between foreign producers and Japanese dealers, in the value and share of foreign parts bought by Japan for after-market use, Japan's responsiveness to complaints about deregulation of repair or car-modification inspections, and the trend in purchases of American auto parts.
"I am confident that the spotlights have been placed in the right places," said Andrew Card, head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association.
But William A. Raftery, a North Carolina consultant, said the data to be collected on automotive parts would suffer from failing to adequately include second-tier suppliers.

HEADLINE: Liberals Duck Immigration Debate

BYLINE: By Michael Lind; Michael Lind, a senior editor of The New Republic, is the author of "The Next American Nation: The New Nationalism and the Fourth American Revolution."

 BODY:
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has been praised by liberals for his courage in opposing measures to deter the use of public services by illegal immigrants. The truth is that ignoring the rising costs of mass immigration, legal as well as illegal, is anything but courageous -- or liberal.
While business-class and populist Republicans have engaged in serious debate about immigration, discussion of the subject by Democrats is still governed by taboos. The consensus liberal position rests on two articles of faith. 
 First, while illegal immigration may cost the jobs of low-skilled American workers, no legal immigrant has ever displaced an American worker. Second, any suggestion that the arrival of almost a million legal immigrants a year has any effect on job opportunities and wages in the United States is said to be sinister racist "scapegoating."
Though this viewpoint is appealing, the harmful effects of legal as well as illegal immigration on low-income American workers are real.The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has attributed "heavy immigration to border cities" as the reason for unusually high unemployment in cities like Laredo, El Paso and McAllen. The economist George Borjas has calculated that immigration accounted for a third of the decline in the wages of high school dropouts in the 1980's; a major cause is the willingness of foreign workers to accept lower wages.
While economists debate the magnitude of the displacement of native labor by immigrants, the white and black working poor have been fleeing the metropolitan areas of California, where the economic competition with Latin American and Asian newcomers is the most intense.
The downward drag on wages caused by immigration is likely to grow worse. The economy cannot expand rapidly enough to provide decent jobs for the bottom half of the native population, much less for hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants arriving each year. Figures from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the number of new entrants to the work force will outstrip the number of jobs created by more than a million and a half between 1995 and 2005.
From the point of view of business-class conservatives, the labor supply can never be too large and wages never too low. It is no coincidence that spokesmen for the plutocratic wing of conservatism, like Dick Armey, the House majority leader, and the editorialists of The Wall Street Journal, favor even higher levels of immigration and the abolition of the minimum wage.
Unable to win on the facts, all too many pro-immigration liberals resort to nostalgia. With misty eyes and trembling voice, they invoke the Statue of Liberty and accuse critics of treason not only to American ideals but to the memories of immigrant ancestors. This may be good politics for politicians like Mayor Giuliani, but it is bad history.
The movement to curtail immigration in the early 20th century was opposed by business leaders enjoying access to cheap labor, but was supported by many labor leaders. Samuel Gompers, the American Federation of Labor president, argued that the flood of European immigrants was depressing wages.
He was right. From 1890 to 1920, American wages rose from 1 to 4 percent less than they would have in the absence of immigration, according to the Harvard economist Claudia Goldin.
The many ethnic divisions among native and immigrant workers at the time explain the weakness of the American labor and social democratic movements, compared with those in Western Europe's low-immigration democracies. And cynical employers who pursued a divide-and-rule policy of "balancing the nationalities" exploited these divisions.
The restriction of immigration in the 1920's, by encouraging a tight labor market and a culturally unified work force, was a precondition for the successes of the labor movement and New Deal liberalism from the 1930's to the 1960's.
The liberal taboo against realistic discussion of immigration extends to a refusal to acknowledge its effects on poor blacks. In the 19th century, as Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington noted, European immigrants displaced black workers from jobs as longshoremen, artisans, barbers and caterers. Closing the borders in the 1920's opened up job opportunities for blacks in the North, laying the basis for economic gains and the civil rights movement.
Since 1965, however, the black working poor have suffered again from competition, this time with Latin Americans and Asians. There can be little doubt that many employers discriminate against African-American workers and in favor of immigrants, who are more likely to accept low wages and poor conditions without complaint.
Many immigrant groups, once they have moved into professions like taxi service or the grocery business, set up nepotistic networks in hiring and finance from which long-resident urban blacks are frozen out.
Why have liberals been silent about the economic effects of immigration on their natural constituency -- the working poor, and black workers in particular? One reason is the inability of liberals to say no to any apparently generous program, particularly if it aims to help those in poor countries. Another is the influence of Hispanic groups seeking to enlarge their constituencies. Many affluent opinion-makers in politics, the media and academia themselves benefit from a never-ending supply of low-wage immigrant maids, janitors, receptionists and other poorly paid, non-unionized employees.
A few courageous liberals like former Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas have dared to bring up the relationship between mass immigration and falling wages. Ms. Jordan, chairman of the bipartisan Federal Commission on Immigration Reform, called for limiting family-reunification immigration to nuclear families, eliminating the annual allotment of 10,000 visas to unskilled foreign workers, deterring illegal immigration by means of a national identity card, and capping legal immigration at 550,000 a year (down from almost 800,000 a year in 1994).
These sensible reforms do not go far enough. We should also follow most other democracies in making it difficult for employers to hire non-citizens if qualified citizens are available. When many college graduates cannot find good jobs, why are we issuing so many work permits for foreign workers (more than 600,000 last year)? Why should a company be allowed to replace American computer programmers with Indian guest workers in the United States?
The United States can no longer be the world's employment agency and welfare service of first resort. A genuine liberal policy toward immigration would reduce the supply of surplus labor by reducing the supply of immigrants. A tight labor market is the best program for restarting America's stalled engine of upward mobility.
The liberal case for reform is based on numbers -- on the quantity of immigrants, not their quality. Under a rational plan, most immigrants would still come from Latin America and Asia; they would simply arrive in smaller contingents. Unlike conservatives, liberals should insist that legal immigrants, while waiting to be naturalized, should have access to the basic civil rights and entitlements of American citizens.
For 30 years, we have had an immigration policy tailored to the convenience of the American overclass. Pro-labor liberals and non-racist populists on the right should unite to demand an immigration policy that puts the interests of American workers above the interests of the native rich.

HEADLINE: After China, Hillary Clinton Finds Mongolia a Gentler Place

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Flying from China into this grassy, sparsely populated country, Hillary Rodham Clinton might be forgiven today for feeling as though she had passed through a looking glass.
In contrast with China, Mrs. Clinton found a functioning democracy here. The crowds that clog every Chinese city were nowhere to be found, and Mrs. Clinton's 10-car motorcade seemed to disrupt few Mongolians. In a big change, the security agents seemed friendly. 
 In Beijing for two days this week, Mrs. Clinton irritated her authoritarian hosts with a powerful speech on human rights. She also inadvertently created chaos at a nongovernmental forum, where thousands of women trying to hear her speak clashed with Chinese security forces.
But in Mongolia, when Mrs. Clinton gave another speech about the need for democracy and freedom, Mongolian officials responded with applause, not condemnation.
The visit was to "express support for Mongolian democracy and for Mongolian independence," said Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, who accompanied her.
But away from politics, Mrs. Clinton seemed most excited today by getting a taste of the nomadic life that still dominates Mongolia.
Wearing black suede cowboy boots and a maroon shawl she bought last year in India, Mrs. Clinton entered the musty-smelling yurt of a man named Zanabaatar and his wife, Haliun and their six children 20 miles into the grasslands. She stepped carefully past the pail of cow dung used as fuel and gamely tasted mare's milk and horse cheese.
Taken outside to watch one of the family's horses get milked, Mrs. Clinton spied some large animals ambling along the crest of a hill.
"What's that big...? It's a yak!" she exclaimed.
Mrs. Clinton sped off to spend lunch with Mongolia's ever-smiling President, Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, and his wife, Tsevelomaa.
"A visit like this can put a spotlight on a country like Mongolia, which Americans pay little attention to," said Mr. Lord. "It's quite a remarkable story."
Mrs. Clinton seemed eager to learn about Mongolia's moves away from one-party control in 1990 , its loss of aid from the Soviet Union, its runaway inflation and how the changes had affected the status of women, meeting with eight women in the residence of the American Ambassador, Donald Johnson.
But despite their new-found freedom to speak, the women -- a doctor, a women's federation leader, a young politician among them -- seemed to respond with rehearsed speeches. Mrs. Clinton's questions went largely unanswered.
At Mongolian National University, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the importance of working together by citing a lesson that Genghis Khan's mother tried to teach her children.
"To make her point, she showed them how easily one arrow could be broken, but how hard it is to break five arrows when they are held together," she said.

Restrained Rebuke From China
 BEIJING, Sept. 7 (By The New York Times) -- China issued a rebuke today directed at Hillary Rodham Clinton for her denunciation here of human rights violations.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Chen Jian, said officials had noted "that some people from some countries made some unwarranted remarks or criticism of other countries."
"We would like to caution these people to pay more attention to the problems in their own countries," he said, citing a Chinese proverb.

HEADLINE: THE PACKWOOD CASE: THE OVERVIEW;
PACKWOOD SAYS HE IS QUITTING AS ETHICS PANEL GIVES EVIDENCE

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
As his colleagues watched grimly, Senator Bob Packwood announced his resignation today, hours after the Ethics Committee released a 10-volume indictment, much of it in his own hand, of his personal and official conduct.
But Senator Bob Dole raised the possibility tonight that Senator Packwood would not leave immediately. Mr. Packwood, an Oregon Republican, did not set an effective date for his resignation. 
 Mr. Dole, the majority leader, told the Senate that Mr. Packwood should be given "a reasonable time." Later, Mr. Dole proposed to the Democratic leadership that Mr. Packwood stay for 90 days, a period that would allow Mr. Packwood, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to manage critical Republican legislation over the next several weeks.
On "Larry King Live" on CNN tonight, Mr. Dole noted that Mr. Packwood "can certainly vote" until he leaves. Defending a plan to keep Mr. Packwood in place as long as possible, Mr. Dole said it would take time for Mr. Packwood to "get his things in order."
It was not clear whether Democrats -- or indeed many Republicans -- would accept such an unusual arrangement.
In his resignation speech, Mr. Packwood said he was "aware of the dishonor that has befallen me in the last three years." The tearful Senator told the hushed chamber, "It is my duty to resign." Later, he added, "I leave this institution not with malice but with love."
Sinking back into his chair and clutching the hand of his longtime political aide, Elaine Franklin, Mr. Packwood ended his 27-year career as the junior Senator from Oregon. For the last three years, he had been fighting accusations that he had discredited himself and the institution he said he loved.
Until today, most of his colleagues knew only the sketchiest details of the sexual misconduct, obstruction of justice and ethics charges against him. But yesterday the Senate Select Committee on Ethics voted unanimously for his expulsion, and this morning it released 10 volumes of evidence it had collected. Consisting of 10,145 pages and weighing 40 pounds, it described in sometimes startling detail his activities of the last quarter-century as a senator.
"These were not merely stolen kisses, as Senator Packwood has claimed," Senator Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Ethics Committee, said in describing Mr. Packwood's "physical coercion" of toward women. "There was a habitual pattern of aggressive, blatantly sexual advances, mostly directed at members of his own staff or others whose livelihoods were connected in some way to his power and authority as a Senator."
Most disturbing to Senator McConnell, a Kentucky Republican whose committee had been investigating the case for 33 months, was what he called Mr. Packwood's "cover-up" of his criminal activities.
He said that Senator Packwood's "deliberately altering and destroying relevant portions of his diary" -- portions that Mr. Packwood described in the diary itself as "very incriminating information" -- would earn him 10 to 16 months in prison if he were tried in criminal court.
The Ethics Committee said today that it would refer the charges to the Justice Department, where they might prompt an inquiry. "This is a gravely serious offense," Mr. McConnell said.
The Senator whom Mr. McConnell described this morning as guilty of "gross and persistent misconduct" was markedly different from the Senator who was eulogized this afternoon on the floor as his colleagues endured the spectacle of one of their own cut down at the height of his power. Much of the Republican agenda and its promise to overhaul the way government works was riding on Mr. Packwood's shoulders in his position as as chairman of the Senate's pivotal Finance Committee..
His resignation changed the mood of the Senate chamber as his friends, starting with his fellow Oregonian, Mark O. Hatfield, extolled his virtues. Mr. Hatfield, a former professor of political science who once taught Mr. Packwood, hailed him as his "most brilliant student" and declared that the "political nightmare" that Mr. Packwood had suffered was over. Mr. Packwood rose and hugged him. Both were in tears.
Mr. Packwood, who had been telling his top staff as late as noon today that he would not resign, emerged onto the Senate floor about 4:30 P.M. Given his chance to write his own political obituary, he recapped the high points of his career, reminding his colleagues of his successes over the years, including his lonely fight for abortion rights, his championing of Israel and his overhaul of the tax system in 1986. Then he made his tearful farewell.
"The Bob Packwood we heard today is the Bob Packwood we've known over the years," said Mr. Dole, who looked as if a dark storm were playing out over his visage. Indeed, Mr. Dole, whose Presidential campaign has been losing some of its momentum lately, has been relying on Senator Packwood to steer the Republicans' sweeping economic program through the Finance Committee and shepherd it into law.
On the other hand, the prospect of Mr. Packwood's wrangling with his Senate accusers was an unpalatable alternative for Mr. Dole, who is basing his Presidential bid on his "leadership" of the Senate. He concluded his remarks by saying, without elaboration, that Senator Packwood "made the right decision."
The senators listened in silence to Mr. Packwood and to the handful of his colleagues who rose to speak about him.
Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, derided the Ethics Committee process, as did Senator Alan Simpson, Republican of Wyoming. The committee was created, Mr. Simpson said, "to avoid a public hanging, frontier justice and vigilante justice" but "something surely has gone awry." Tourists in the gallery applauded.
When Mr. Simpson lauded Mr. Packwood for championing women's rights, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat, nodded in assent. By that time, Barbara Boxer, her California colleague, who had agitated for Mr. Packwood's resignation and had tried to force the Senate to hold public hearings in his case, had left the chamber.
Two Democrats joined the eulogizing. The first, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is Mr. Packwood's closest friend in the Senate, seemed truly distraught and, for once, at a loss for words. "I haven't prepared remarks because I'm not especially prepared," he said. He rambled briefly, concluded by saying "the greatest of these is love," and sat down.
The second Democrat was Mrs. Feinstein, who unexpectedly delivered a gracious tribute to Mr. Packwood, whom she said she hardly knew. She said her father always told her to remember a man by what he did best, not by what he did last.
"We do make mistakes," she said, "but it is a sign of a wise man and even a giant man who stands and does what needs to be done and goes on to fight another day."
Senator Packwood, apparently surprised and overwhelmed, crossed the floor, clutched her hand and cried.
When the speeches stopped, the few senators who remained in the chamber went up to Mr. Packwood, instead of avoiding him as they had in recent weeks. Senator Larry E. Craig, an Idaho Republican who is a member of the Ethics Committee, sobbed as he hugged Mr. Packwood. Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, was also in tears. Mr. Packwood gave a big bear hug to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah.
In Oregon, both Republican and Democratic contenders began jockeying today to succeed Mr. Packwood in a special election, which Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, must call under state law. Unlike other states, the Governor is not empowered to name an interim Senator, but must set an election date, possibily before the end of the year.
Representative Peter A. DeFazio, 48, a Democrat from Springfield, Ore., has already declared himself a candidate, and Representative Ron Wyden, 46, a Democrat from Portland, is expected to announce soon.
On the Republican side, the early favorite is Gordon Smith, 43, the president of the Oregon Senate.
In the Senate there were no tears this morning, when senators on the Ethics Committee said that their review of the bales of evidence against Senator Packwood had independently led them to the inescapable conclusion that he should be expelled from the Senate.
Beyond that, the committee members said, Mr. Packwood's behavior toward the committee as his case unfolded over the last 33 months -- they characterized it as defiant, selfish and unrepentent -- contributed to their belief that he deserved the most severe punishment the Senate could exact.
Moreover, they said, as he took to the television talk shows last night and this morning to decry the process as unfair, Mr. Packwood continued to misrepresent his case. He claimed he had been denied the chance to confront his accusers and had not had the chance to give his version of events.
Senator McConnell branded this as patently false, noting that Mr. Packwood had fought against public hearings and had voted against them.
"The victimizer is now claiming the mantle of the victim," Senator McConnell said. "The one who deliberately abused the process now wants to manipulate it to his advantage. That won't wash.
"The committee has heard enough, the Senate has heard enough, the public has heard enough," Mr. McConnell concluded at a news conference extraordinary for its expressions of blanket disgust with a colleague.
With Mr. Packwood's resignation, he seems likely to keep his annual pension of $82,922. The only time a senator automatically loses his pension is if he is convicted of treason or of violations of national security. In this case, Republicans said they would not try to strip Mr. Packwood of his pension since he served for 25 years and is being punished enough.

HEADLINE: St. Maarten Is Left Smashed and Looted After Luis

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: SIMPSON BAY, St. Maarten, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Jose Perez strolled casually down the winding hillside road from Philipsburg to Simpson Bay today, pushing a grocery cart loaded with a Hitachi television, a Canon electric typewriter and a roll of Bounty paper towels. Like hundreds of other residents of this devastated island, Mr. Perez had helped himself to the goods after Hurricane Luis demolished dozens of stores.
"Yeah, I took it," he said matter of factly as he gestured at the television set. "And I don't know if it's going to work." 
 Widespread looting, which the police and military authorities have permitted with little resistance since the hurricane blew through on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, seems to be the least of the problems in what was once a jewel of the Caribbean.
Almost directly in the path of Luis, this island, divided between the Dutch St. Maarten and the French St. Martin, suffered one of the strongest blows from a storm that left its physical, financial and emotional wreckage across a chain of islands that stretches hundreds of miles.
The breath-taking damage caused here by the force of nature stands in stunning contrast to the natural beauty that has long drawn thousands of tourists each year. From a helicopter, the inviting aquamarine of the sea now quickly gives way to brown mountainsides stripped of all vegetation by the wind.
The worst damage occurred on Antigua and its sister island, Barbuda, where the hurricane damaged some 75 percent of the buildings, and on this island, where nine deaths were reported. An American on the French side was washed overboard from his boat, Julie Reside, a State Department spokeswoman in Washington, said today, but she did not know his name or whether he was among the nine confirmed dead. A total of 15 deaths have been linked to the hurricane.
The Government of Antigua and Barbuda declared a national emergency and appealed to the United Nations for financial and technical help. Officials of the United Nations Development Program said the storm had set back development on Antigua by 10 years.
In St. Maarten, residents and the police said many of the dead were sailors who were trying to save their vessels. John Reeves, a Dutch police officer who arrived today from the island of Curacao, said dozens more were injured and about 100 were still missing.
"They haven't dug up the bodies in the lagoons," said Jane H. Alexander, marketing manager of one of the few grocery stores still functioning on the island. "People were trying to keep the boats up until the end, and they went down."
Mr. Reeves said the death count would certainly rise. "We haven't been up in the hills yet to the shacks or into the boats," he said. "There must be people in the shacks and in the boats."
In addition to the deaths here, one man died in Dominica, apparently drowned while trying to save a boat. In Guadeloupe, a French tourist was washed into the sea while photographing the heavy surf. In Puerto Rico, two people were killed, one in a fall from his roof while preparing for the storm and another who was electrocuted by a fallen power cable. Two were reported killed in Antigua.
Up and down the string of islands, from Barbuda to the United States Virgin Islands, some people emerged from homes and shelters today for the first time since Monday night. Electricity, food, fresh water and telephone service remained scarce, if not impossible, to find on most of the hardest-hit islands, residents and officials said.
On St. Maarten, the damage to housing was inestimable. Whole hillsides were transformed into junkyards of multicolored scrap metal as Luis's 130 mile-per-hour winds flattened the shanties of the poor. The villas of the wealthy, although better built, proved only slightly more durable. Many were stripped of their orange tile roofs and wooden siding, with the debris hurled hundreds of yards away. Swimming pools were dark with mud and trash.
Refrigerators and washing machines were tossed by the wind on top of houses. Cars were thrown on their sides. The hood of one was flung through its windshield.
Hundreds of boats, some worth millions of dollars, were tossed aground like so many toys thrown from a bathtub. Many lay on top of others, their hulls torn by jagged holes. In the lagoon here, two sailboat masts, one red and one white, emerged from the sea like lollipop sticks.
The airport on the Dutch side of this island was closed to commercial traffic and the one on the French side was demolished. Two planes were submerged in a pond next to the French airport near Grande Case. For the time being, there is no way out.
While some tourists took the storm in stride, lying in the brilliant sunshine on what was left of Orient Beach, others seemed simply dazed. A woman sitting on the side of the road by her grounded, shattered sailboat could not bring herself to talk to reporters, waving them on when asked for her account of the storm.
A group of American medical students summed up the frustration of many islanders and tourists. "I just want to get the hell off this island," said Michael J. Gagnon, of Oak Brook, Ill., a student at the American University of the Caribbean here.
Help was on the way to several islands. The Dutch have sent a ship here from Curacao to help on their side of the island, while 250 French soldiers arrived on the French side by transport plane from Guadeloupe.
Samantha A. McEvoy, 24, a sailor from Cape Town, South Africa, who has spent the last six months in St. Maarten, said the emotional toll had been extreme.
"My boat is on its side and another is smashed into it," she said. "People have lost their whole lives. The only things they had were their boats." Like many residents, Ms. McEvoy was almost as stunned by the looting as she was by the hurricane.
Much of the stealing was taking place at Rams Cash and Carry, a gigantic food and dry goods warehouse in Philipsburg that had lost its entire roof. From the air, hundreds of people could be seen wandering among the twisted metal framework, picking through boxes of goods like ants on a carcass. A line of cars waited for the thieves to emerge with black plastic garbage bags filled with loot.
"There's so much disaster and pain and suffering going on and those people are making it worse," Ms. McEvoy said.
Jose Lazaro Martinez, a 44-year-old mechanic, explained that the looting "was an opportunity that occurred."
"Everything is broken and people have turned out to grab whatever there is," he said.
The police and soldiers directed traffic on narrow roads, with at least one firing a rifle in the air to emphasize his instructions. But they seemed to have concluded that stores like Rams were a lost cause.
"The Dutch Army is out there, but they're just letting them loot," said Seth B. Parker, 24, a medical student from Fort Worth. "These people don't have any food or water."
Although the clanking of hammers could be heard all across this island of 60,000 today, there is little plywood available to repair the gaping holes in many roofs.
"Seventy percent of the island is homeless," said Ms. Alexander. "They don't have houses, they don't have food, they don't know where to sleep. It's pretty much desperation."

HEADLINE: As Santa Fe's Allure Slips, Boom Times Fade

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., Sept. 7

 BODY:
On Friday night, as at this time every year, thousands will gather here to watch the burning of Zozobra, a 40-foot-high puppet popularly known as Old Man Gloom.
As the flames rise to engulf the monster, it will groan in agony, flailing its giant arms. And the audience will cheer as the year's accumulation of fears and anxieties is carried away, or so the legend goes, in a billowing plume of smoke. Fiesta, Santa Fe's weekend bacchanalia, will officially begin. 
 This year, the flames will have to burn especially bright to exorcize some of Santa Fe's demons. For many residents, 1995 has not been the best of years. After soaring throughout the decade with an influx of newcomers, the real estate market has taken a dive. On one stretch of Canyon Road, the most fashionable address in town, the half-dozen "For Sale" signs threaten to become as old and historic as the weathered adobe houses.
At the same time, tourism and housing construction -- the other economic mainstays here -- are showing signs of decline. One of the most arresting sights of the summer was the unusually large number of neon "Vacancy" signs lighting Cerrillos Road, where the city's motels and restaurants are concentrated.
Tensions between Santa Fe's rich and poor are flaring, as they do from time to time. Hardly a week passes without a report of a purse snatching or a mugging on or near the city's historic plaza. The stately stuccoed walls along Santa Fe's most beautiful streets -- Alameda, Acequia Madre, Old Santa Fe Trail, Camino del Monte Sol -- have been attacked again and again by vandals wielding spray cans, leaving garish graffiti like that found in New York or Los Angeles. The marks are quickly removed by the city's new anti-graffiti crew, but, like painting the Golden Gate Bridge, it is a job that never ends.
"Crime is a problem partly because the population is growing," Councilman Cris Moore said. "But there is also a growing sense of resentment. A lot of families are not able to make a living in this economy."
Mr. Moore said the decline in tourism might have as much to do with the national economy as with local problems, "and the fact that no place stays the hot place to visit forever."
"But we should take this as a wake-up call," he added. "The mistake we've made is building an economy that depends so much on the wealthy."
Any slowing of the flood of people coming to Santa Fe to visit or stay might be considered a blessing to those tired of fighting for a table in a restaurant or seeing their downtown turned into what locals derisively call Adobe Disneyland.
"Santa Fe was just becoming too expensive," said Councilman Steven Farber. He said a "welcome correction" was long overdue.
"Mass-production tourism" has dulled some of the city's luster, Mr. Farber said.
"This doesn't mean it is not still beautiful, magical; it's just lost some of the glow," he added. "One can pan Santa Fe because it's not as pristine as some would hope, but we don't have the kind of problems that a San Francisco or a Miami does. We ought to be grateful for that."
Besides tourism and the housing industry, the two other main sources of employment here have long been the state government and Los Alamos National Laboratories, half an hour's drive away. But Los Alamos recently announced that it would lay off 1,500 workers in the next year, and New Mexico's Governor, Gary E. Johnson, a Republican, is waging a campaign to trim the state work force.
Although a few financial service companies have been recently added to the economic mix, efforts to attract clean industry -- electronics, computers, biotechnology -- have not been very successful, partly because of high real estate prices. The main thing Santa Fe has to sell is its ambiance, but as the city grows, that is in shorter and shorter supply.
Through Aug. 31, 44 robberies had been reported in the area of the city that includes the plaza and the Guadalupe Street tourist district; if the pace continues, this year will see twice as many robberies as in 1991, when there were 32. But Capt. Ray Rael of the Santa Fe Police Department said the perception of crime was probably worse than the reality. Santa Fe is still a small-enough town that purse snatchings are written up in the crime column of the daily newspaper, The Santa Fe New Mexican.
More visible to tourists and residents is the graffiti on Santa Fe's subtly hued walls. The city has tried to lower the din of visual noise with a mural project for teen-agers, letting them decorate the traffic-control boxes that are a common target of vandals. The hope was that vandals would be less likely to deface decorated boxes. But graffiti continues to accumulate on traffic signs, mailboxes and utility company junction boxes.
The drop in popularity of Santa Fe as a tourist destination has come to a city that had been riding a crest of publicity of nearly absurd proportions. In a 1992 reader survey by Conde Nast Traveler, Santa Fe was named the No. 1 tourist destination in the world, surpassing San Francisco, Vienna, Florence and Rome. Last year, it was down to No. 9.
Well-heeled refugees have bid up housing prices to the point where a small two-bedroom adobe on a rutted dirt street could easily fetch a quarter of a million dollars. But this spring, the balloon began to leak.
After a record number of houses were sold in 1994, the number sold in the first quarter of 1995 dropped almost 30 percent, to 188 from 266. Bob Dunn, president of the Santa Fe Association of Realtors, said the decline had continued, although he could not give precise figures.
Apartment vacancy rates in the area that includes the plaza and the city's historic core have risen to 10.9 percent in the second quarter, compared with no vacancies two years ago, according to the Apartment Association of New Mexico. Apartment complexes are offering incentives for renters, and cardboard For Rent signs are starting to appear, even on Canyon Road.
Fred Lopez, the investment and cash manager for the city Finance Department, said gross receipts from construction were down 14.5 percent in July and 2.5 percent in August, compared with the same months in 1994.
Faced with these disturbing portents, businesses hoped that the summer would bring an injection of tourist money. But the latest figures from the New Mexico Hotel and Motel Association show Santa Fe's occupancy rates down to 82.1 percent in July, compared with 86.7 percent in the same month last year. Art Bouffard, director of the association, predicted that the August figures would be down from July's.
Some of the decline in tourism and real estate is probably cyclical. Tight occupancy levels and high rental and occupancy rates led to a wave of motel and apartment house construction. Continuing economic problems in California, the source of many of the visitors and newcomers, have rippled to New Mexico. High lumber prices could be depressing housing construction.
But the possibility remains that as Santa Fe grows from a town into a city, it is inevitably losing some of its only real commodity, its charm.
"We're starting to have all the negatives of a big city without the pluses," said Leo Romero, a poet and bookseller who grew up in northern New Mexico and has lived in Santa Fe since 1983. "There has been a big change just within the last year and a half. It's like night and day."
Fiesta will end on Sunday night, as it always does, with a Mass of Thanksgiving at the St. Francis Cathedral downtown and a candlelight procession to the top of a nearby hill where the Cross of the Martyrs commemorates the local Franciscan priests who died in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The red and yellow graffiti on the stuccoed base of the monument was painted over today, just in time for the celebration.

HEADLINE: Gunfire and Siege on East Side Lead to an Arrest

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
An unemployed man who the police said threatened President Clinton early last month because he was angry at the Social Security Administration, shot at two Secret Service agents yesterday afternoon. The police said the suspect then barricaded himself in his basement studio apartment on the Upper East Side for more than three hours before surrendering.
No one was injured, though the heavy emergency response to the gunfire at 243 East 81st Street and the tense standoff closed off the block between Third and Second Avenues. While under siege, the suspect managed to get on the telephone with the White House and various radio and television stations, complaining that he was misunderstood and a victim of a cruel system that was denying him Social Security checks. 
 Assistant Chief John J. Hill, the commander of Manhattan detectives, identified the suspect as 48-year-old Paul Nagy, a slightly built, unemployed Romanian immigrant who came to New York City 14 years ago. He said that Mr. Nagy had a history of making threats against Government officials.
Chief Hill said that Mr. Nagy, who moved in the apartment building two months ago, called the White House on Aug. 2 to complain about the Social Security Administration and then "made a threat to a White House receptionist." The Secret Service agents went to Mr. Nagy's apartment yesterday to try to interview him, Chief Hill said.
Mr. Nagy was charged yesterday with harassment and felonious assault of a Federal agent.

HEADLINE: NATO Raids Against Serbs Are Increased

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
On the eve of crucial American-led talks among the three warring parties in Bosnia, NATO expanded its air campaign against Serb-held positions in Bosnia today, bombing bridges, ammunition dumps, communications centers and air defense radars.
The bombings came as President Clinton met with his senior advisers to discuss how to convince the warring parties to accept the United Nations-brokered partition of the country and enforce an eventual settlement. But President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia warned that Moscow would have to rethink its partnership with NATO if the alliance continued its bombings. 
 NATO warplanes took advantage of a break in rain, fog and clouds before dawn to attack the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo, trying to force them to withdraw their heavy weapons from around the Bosnian capital. In one strike, a NATO plane bombed an ammunition dump near the Serbian headquarters in Pale, setting off the explosives with such force that they blackened the skies and damaged neighboring houses.
NATO has vowed to continue the strikes until the Serbs move their heavy weapons at least 12.5 miles from Sarajevo, but in Pale, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, insisted, "We have withdrawn as much as we could."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that NATO would continue its air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions despite NATO's failure to force the Serbs to move their heavy weaponry.
 "This campaign can continue for some time," Mr. Christopher said in an interview on the "MacNeil/ Lehrer NewsHour." He also played down differences with Russia over the NATO campaign, saying that he was confident that "we'll be able to stay together with Russia."
The bombing resumed this week even as Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke was preparing for a meeting in Geneva on Friday that will bring together representatives of the three warring parties for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two years.
Senior officials from France, Germany, Britain and Russia will be part of the Geneva session, which is expected to produce a vague statement of principles but avoid territorial issues that still divide the parties.
Mr. Clinton approved a recommendation from his top national security and economic advisers on the composition of a NATO peacekeeping force should the three sides make peace and agreed to present this idea to other NATO members in Brussels next week, senior Administration officials said.
The United States wants the non-American NATO troops now serving in Bosnia in a rapid-reaction force to be the core of the new peacekeeping force to be established as soon as a settlement is reached, the officials said. The United States will insist that this peacemaking force be well-armed and operating under a NATO command and control structure. Their duties will include enforcing a cease-fire and supervising and enforcing the withdrawal of the warring armies to separate areas.
But Mr. Clinton and his aides are eager to limit the number of American ground troops involved in enforcing a settlement in Bosnia. Without any agreement on how many American troops will be committed, Pentagon planners are assuming that 50,000 NATO troops, including 25,000 Americans, will be required for the plan.
Besides agreeing to the shape of such a NATO peacekeeping mission, Mr. Clinton agreed with his aides that a separate international force should train and equip the Bosnian Army to defend its territory.
On the military front, NATO warplanes from Aviano air base in Italy and the aircraft carrier Roosevelt hit ammunition dumps, communications centers, bridges, barracks and air defense radars in at least six waves of attacks today.
But the Serbs said civilian targets were also hit, and Bosnian Serb television ran a report, without pictures, claiming that 15 civilians including 4 children had been killed in Doboj in western Bosnia.
More than a total of 75 NATO F-18's, F-15's, F-16's and other warplanes attacked many targets in and around Pale that poor weather had prevented pilots from striking.
The NATO commander said warplanes hit new targets as well as old ones that NATO reconnaissance experts determined had not been destroyed and that about two-thirds of the targets had been destroyed or rendered ineffective.
The NATO commander said there was a brief pause tonight between the daytime bombings and later attacks against bridges that could be used to resupply ammo dumps.
"There is a very robust political dimension to this," the officer said. "It's kind of a yo-yo."

HEADLINE: Grim Forecast Is Offered On Rising Juvenile Crime

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
If current trends continue, the number of arrests of juveniles for violent crimes will double by the year 2010, the Justice Department said today in the most comprehensive report ever assembled on crimes committed by young people.
The report based its projection on a finding that arrest rates among juveniles ages 10 to 17 for violent crimes jumped 100 percent between 1983 and 1992, and the number of teen-agers in the population was expected to increase 20 percent over the next decade. 
 The report also calls into question some of the most popular crime prevention programs adopted by cities, states and the Federal government in the past few years, including curfews and midnight basketball leagues. The report found, for example, that the peak time during which youths age 6 to 17 commit violent crimes was from 3 to 6 P.M., between the end of the school day and dinner.
James Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern University, said the new figures on the time at which young people commit crimes showed that "we can't leave it to families" to solve the problem of juvenile violence. "The families aren't available, and it's often not out of choice," Professor Fox said. "They are off working out of economic necessity and it leaves kids idle, unsupervised with little to do except hang out with their friends."
Professor Fox said the report showed a clear need for more after-school activities at a time that the public and politicians have been cutting financing for athletics and after-school arts and music classes.
The report, "Juvenile Offenders and Victims: A National Report," was put together by the National Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh. It amounts to an encyclopedia of information on youth criminals, victims and how the juvenile justice system functions.
Among other findings in today's report were these:
*From 1980 to 1992, reports of children abused and neglected almost tripled, to 2.9 million from 1 million. The report cited several studies that showed a clear link between child abuse and neglect, and future juvenile delinquency and adult criminality. But Howard Snyder, one of the authors of the report and director of systems research for the National Center for Juvenile Justice, said it was unclear how much of the increase in cases might be attributed to better reporting of child abuse.
* Between 1984 and 1993, the number of homicides among juveniles involving handguns increased fivefold. Eighty percent of juvenile homicides now are committed with a gun. A spokesman for the White House, Rahm Emanuel, said that President Clinton found the projection of a doubling in arrests for juveniles by 2010 "very disturbing."
The spokesman said that it was because of concerns like this that President Clinton had pressed for money to put 100,000 additional police officers on the streets over the next few years. That program has come under attack by Republicans in Congress, who have pledged to convert the Federal money intended to hire the new officers into block grants for the states.
Attorney General Janet Reno said today that she was particularly dismayed by the finding that the homicide rate among 14- to 17-year-olds had increased 165 percent in the past 10 years.
"This report is a road map to the next generation of crime -- unless we do something now," Ms. Reno said. "This is not the time to let up and it is not the time to turn back."
The report, showing the huge increase in violent crimes by juveniles, comes as many cities, particularly New York and Houston, have reported a sharp drop in their homicide rates over the past three years. The reason that the national violent crime rate has recently declined overall while it is up among young people, Professor Fox said, is that there has been a sharp decrease in homicide by adults. From 1990 to 1993, the homicide rate among people age 25 years and older dropped 10 percent, he said.
Professor Fox has long been among those criminologists who have predicted that the national violent crime rate will go back up as the number of teen-agers begins to increase again after a dropoff in the 1980's. "This is the calm before the crime storm," he said. "Enjoy it while it lasts."
But he questioned whether the stark prediction in today's report of a doubling in arrests for violent crime among juveniles would really be that high. The reason it might not, Professor Fox said, is that after the juvenile arrest rate increased 100 percent from 1983 to 1992 "it would be hard to keep on going straight up."

HEADLINE: Mr. Dole's Bogus Welfare Safeguards

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, will bring to a vote, perhaps today, an amendment to his welfare bill that would supposedly soften the blow to the poor. The amendment is a sham. It purports to require states to maintain current spending on programs for low-income families. But the amendment is riddled with loopholes and will not, in fact, force any state to spend a dime.
Mr. Dole has not rounded up enough votes to pass his welfare bill. Conservatives like Senator Phil Gramm complain that the bill is too lenient, permitting states, for example, to put unwed mothers on the dole. Moderates fear that the bill will drive needy families off welfare and into the streets. Mr. Dole's amendment was proposed to sucker moderates into dropping their opposition. 
 Under the Dole bill, Washington would turn over a fixed amount of money, called a block grant, to states for them to spend on the poor. The House has already passed similar legislation. Mr. Dole's block grants would provide states about the same amount of Federal aid that they collected in 1994 for cash assistance, child care and job training programs. But Mr. Dole would eliminate a current requirement that states qualify for Federal aid only if they put up between 20 and 50 percent of the money themselves.
The Dole bill would also eliminate additional Federal aid now provided as welfare rolls rise during a recession, leaving states to meet the needs of burgeoning poverty all on their own. States will be tempted to drop benefits and raise eligibility, in part to avoid attracting an influx of the poor from neighboring states.
True, Mr. Dole's amendment purports to address this threat by requiring a certain level of expenditures on programs for low-income families. But the requirement would expire after two years. Also, states could satisfy the amendment merely by maintaining current spending on Medicaid -- health insurance for the poor -- and eliminating their contributions to cash assistance, child care, job training and other welfare programs.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, one of the country's leading students of welfare, predicts that the Dole bill would create millions of homeless children. The sham amendment would do nothing to mitigate the carnage.

HEADLINE: Don't Blame Nafta for U.S. Job Losses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Pat Buchanan (Op-Ed, Aug. 25) offers no new reasons to conclude that the North American Free Trade Agreement was a mistake. 
 During 1994 United States exports to Mexico surged, averaging $1 billion per week, up 21.7 percent over the previous year. This was true across every sector, leading to thousands of new jobs. This is what proponents of Nafta predicted, and this is just what happened.
The Mexican economy collapsed at the end of 1994, and with it United States exports to Mexico. This was not a result of Nafta, but of mistakes relating to management of the peso. And the devaluation of the peso accounts for the disappearance of the United States trade surplus with Mexico. To argue, as Mr. Buchanan does, that 340,000 United States jobs have been lost because of Nafta is without foundation. Blame for mistakes in the way the peso was devalued cannot be laid to a fundamentally sound trade agreement.
Mr. Buchanan argues that Nafta has not produced an end to illegal immigration. I know of no friend of Nafta who thought that illegal immigration would disappear within 18 months of its implementation.
Many problems Mexico confronts are serious, and no course of action will fix them immediately. But whether Mexico recovers or enters into a graver crisis, it will remain on our southern border and we will feel the effects of its decisions. This is true in spite of any fence Mr. Buchanan imagines will insulate the U.S.
During the Reagan Administration, Latin America underwent a transformation toward democratic rule and market economics. This transformation represents a real advantage for American security and for the American economy. There will be setbacks along the way, but they are not reason to veer off a course that will strengthen the hemisphere.

HEADLINE: Orange County Supervisors Said To Share Blame

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Sept. 7

 BODY:
The Orange County Board of Supervisors contributed to the county's financial disaster by failing to oversee the operations of the county treasurer, a report released today by the Orange County grand jury said.
Ineffective management played a part in the collapse of the county investment portfolio, according to the report, titled "Safeguards for the Management and Investment of Orange County Funds," which was prepared by Kroll Associates, a private consulting firm, along with the county grand jury. 
 "These losses can be linked to a badly flawed investment strategy," the report said, referring to the strategy used by Robert L. Citron, the county's former treasurer.
"However, the foundations of this financial disaster were clearly built on ineffective management of, and oversight controls over, treasury operations, coupled with a basic absence of a rational investment process," the report concluded.
Orange County declared bankruptcy on Dec. 6 after sustaining investment losses initially estimated at $1.7 billion. It has sued Merrill Lynch & Company, its investment adviser, in an attempt to recover some of the losses and is also expected to seek damages against KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm.
Merrill Lynch, which has denied misleading buyers of Orange County bonds, said the Kroll report showed that the county bore responsibility for the losses. "This report is another blow to Orange County's credibility in its attempt to shift the blame to others," said Timothy Gilles, a Merrill Lynch spokesman.
Another report, by a California State Senate committee, was also highly critical of local officials.
Orange County's investment pool had higher than average interest earnings for many years, but those earnings depended on low interest rates. When rates rose sharply last year, the county's investments suffered heavy losses.
The grand jury is conducting a civil investigation of the financial crisis. It is also hearing evidence related to criminal cases.
In April, Mr. Citron pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to the crisis. The following month, the grand jury indicted the former assistant treasurer, Matthew Raabe, on similar charges. Mr. Raabe is contesting the accusations.
The grand jury report also called for sweeping changes in the county's management structure. It recommended that the treasurer no longer be an elected official and that a strong chief executive and a chief financial officer be appointed by the Board of Supervisors to oversee county finances and investments.
The report asserted that the county supervisors had failed to oversee Mr. Citron, failed to play a role in his investment strategy, and failed to develop an effective audit strategy.
"Responsible county executives, including the Board of Supervisors, failed to adequately oversee the investment activities of the treasurer," it said.
Separately, the Board of Supervisors approved the final terms of the county's recovery plan.
A committee of cities, schools and special districts in the bankruptcy case had approved the plan's terms earlier in the day. The Board of Supervisors then voted 4 to 0 in favor of the plan, with one member absent.
The county said it would be able to raise money -- through the diversion of revenue from a local transit authority and special districts, by importing trash from other counties and by restructuring debt -- to repay note holders. It added that the recovery plan should allow it to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the fiscal year.
As part of the agreement, Orange County has dropped a controversial demand for participants in the investment pool to pay $18 million to cover certain general fund expenses. The final agreement also alters the distribution of potential litigation proceeds, which may benefit schools and others in the investment pool.
The plan must still be approved by individual cities, schools and special districts. Pool participants are expected to vote on it in the coming week. The plan also requires the California Legislature's approval.

HEADLINE: U.S. Farms Out Compiling of Leading Indicators

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
In what is thought to be the first privatization of a Government statistical series, the Conference Board will assume custody of the Leading Economic Index and two companion business-cycle gauges, the Commerce Department announced today.
The Conference Board, a business-sponsored research organization based in New York, will begin its compilation of the widely followed monthly figures with data for October for publication on Dec. 6. It beat five other competitors for stewardship of the indicators, which the department has published since 1968. 
Although the content and format of the indexes are expected to show little immediate change, Conference Board officials said, graphics may be added, and an advisory panel is being created to study possible conceptual improvements, according to Gail D. Fosler, vice president and chief economist.
One refinement, she said, may be to devise preliminary figures that could be published sooner than at present. The current timetable involves delays of about five weeks after the end of the month. A rival bidder suggested that the Conference Board might substitute results from its own survey of consumer confidence for those now provided by the University of Michigan.
No money changes hands under the deal. Asked the Conference Board's motivation, Ms. Fosler cited the 79-year-old organization's "long tradition of trying to communicate to the public what's going on in the economy." From 1918 to 1959, for example, the board published figures on the cost of living, she said.
Although the department declined to discuss the losing proposals, a Wall Street economist said the Conference Board narrowly bested a bid by the National Association of Business Economists, under which Michael P. Niemira of the Mitsubishi Bank would have been project director.
Other submissions were said to have come from Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research and from WEFA, a Philadelphia research firm. A proposed collaboration of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston collapsed after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, objected to participation by the regional bank. The Fed did not respond to a request for comment.
Although often derided, the Leading Economic Index is the most popular of the three indexes. It is intended to forecast turning points in the economy and comprises 11 items that normally move before the economy in general, such as the number of building permits issued and the volume of new orders to factories.
The other indexes, the coincident and lagging indicators, are made up of items that tend to move at the same time as the economy or lag behind it.
The Government's motivation in seeking a private-sector steward for the gauges was to free money, about $450,000, for work it considers of higher priority, notably overhauling its broadest national statistics to keep pace with structural changes in the economy.
"Better output measures are now the highest priority for improving our economic statistics," said Everett Ehrlich, the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. "Transferring the indicators will allow us to shift resources in that direction."
Conference Board officials projected their additional costs would be $250,000, but unlike the department's savings, this figure did not include allocation for office space and other overhead.
The Conference Board's advisory panel will be headed by Janet L. Norwood, a former Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As part of the refinement process, the indexes will be the subject of an annual conference at which sponsored research will be presented.
"Rest assured that the indexes are in good hands," said Jack V. Wirts, acting president of the Conference Board. "We think we are uniquely equipped to carry out our new role."
Had the National Bureau of Economic Research taken over compilation of the indexes, which are based mainly on independently reported data from the Government and industry sources, it would have been resuming work begun under its sponsorship in the late 1930's by Arthur F. Burns and Wesley Clair Mitchell.

HEADLINE: Leaping to the Lectern

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Harvey Mackay, businessman, author and motivational speaker, is a one-man band of self-promotion. At $50,000 a pop, he gives 50 or so speeches a year, raking in $2.5 million. His speeches help sell his books and vice versa -- he's a walking, talking version of the success principles he lists in "Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive."
At the moment, Mr. Mackay is swimming in a very profitable tide. Even in this day of electronic connections, the old-fashioned business of business speaking is booming. The number of business and trade conferences is growing, more people are becoming speakers, and fees are rising. While few industrywide numbers are available, most speakers bureaus -- companies that provide speakers to banquets, conferences and other corporate events -- report revenue growth of around 20 percent a year. 
 The National Speakers Association, a trade group for professional speakers, has grown by 30 percent in the last five years to 4,000 members, most of whom speak to business groups. In the same period, the Conference Board, a global business-research group, has doubled the number of its conferences to more than 100 a year, requiring about 2,000 speakers.
With the summer holidays behind it, corporate America is getting back to work -- and shopping around for speakers like Mr. Mackay to inspire the troops. "The number of platforms available for business speakers has easily doubled in the last decade," said Robert Dilenschneider of the Dilenschneider Group, a public relations firm in New York. "Everyone wants a speaker these days and when they sit around in meetings, they are all looking for the Norm Schwarzkopf of today," he added, referring to the retired Army general and Persian Gulf war hero.
Mr. Schwarzkopf may add glitter. But when it comes to speakers with more corporate knowledge than marquee value, a review of their latest themes provides a window into the current mood of business.
Today's public speakers have a more upbeat message for American business than the one they pitched just five years ago, specialists say. The emphasis has shifted from managing corporate cutbacks and revampings to coping with growth and changes. A recent survey by the National Speakers Association shows that two of the hottest new topics are finding opportunities in the global marketplace and developing strategies for the future -- nonexistent categories in a similar survey in 1990.
"Business wants to know what to do with the corporation now that it's re-engineered," said Robert Falcey, vice president for conferences at the Conference Board, referring to the popular term for cost-cutting. "Re-engineering ground up business and took out the fat. Now businesses are having to start again and build anew."
Gurus of the moment on these topics are Tom Peters, the former McKinsey consultant and best-selling author, who discusses ways for corporations to cope with change; Roger Blackwell, the Ohio State University marketing professor who specializes in how to do business in a global marketplace, and Daniel Burrus, the futurist who talks about how a vision of times ahead can shape business decisions today.
The more optimistic attitude can be measured in another way -- the return of humor. "As business becomes more stable, people are letting their breath out and relaxing a bit," said Brian Palmer, vice president at the National Speakers Bureau, based in Chicago.
Business groups looking for public speakers basically have three choices. They can hire high-powered types like Mr. Peters or Mr. Mackay, who combine business expertise with polish. Or they can get lesser-known specialists whose main purpose is to impart information, whether the topic is mutual funds or chemicals.
Finally, companies wishing to make a big impression can go for celebrities with high marquee value. In this category, No. 1 on almost everyone's list is the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who gives fewer than six speeches a year for up to $100,000 each. Her topic is always foreign affairs.
Running close behind is Gen. Colin L. Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Three former Presidents -- George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford -- are also stars, along with Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State. And the speaker of the hour is James Lovell, commander of the Apollo 13 space flight that is the subject of a hit movie.
What can Colin Powell tell business? At $60,000 or more a speech, he delivers anecdotes about growing up, insights into leadership and thoughts about the military experience. "He doesn't pretend to know the organization well," said Thomas Fiske, manager of special events at Andersen Consulting, who hired Mr. Powell to speak at its annual partners' meeting last October. "But he speaks about his experiences and the experiences of the gulf war."
Some business motivational speakers are legends. These are typically sports figures hired to pump up sales meetings. Lou Holtz, the Notre Dame football coach, is considered the undisputed master. But others in his league are the basketball coach Pat Riley, who has moved from the New York Knicks to the Miami Heat, and Tommy Lasorda, the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
"Holtz gets them weeping and cheering in their seats," Mr. Dilenschneider said. "He delivers a speech about self-realization and how if you believe in yourself, you can make it."
Betsy Berg, head of the lecture division at the William Morris Agency, said: "Pat Riley is in huge demand. People bring these guys in to get the sales force revved up."
Among businessmen who are speakers, the big draws include the economist Henry Kaufman, for his "inside baseball" view of the Federal Reserve System, and Malcolm Forbes Jr., publisher of Forbes magazine, because, according to Ms. Berg, "people assume he knows what's going on."
Richard Branson, head of the Virgin Group, is also popular, as is C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, for his views on health care.
It also helps to have a best-selling book or to appear frequently on television. "When television first came around, people thought it would end the speaker business," said Don Walker, president of the Harry Walker Agency. "But the more people are on TV, the more they are in demand. People want to ask questions eyeball to eyeball and see these people in the flesh."
As for books, Mr. Palmer of the National Speakers Bureau said they "propel you into the arena of celebrity, even if the book didn't do well."
Chief executives are in high demand, but few speak to outside groups. John F. Welch Jr., chief executive of the General Electric Company, is the most sought after, but he is "really difficult" to get, said Mr. Falcey of the Conference Board. And while no one would turn away Michael D. Eisner, the Walt Disney chairman, or Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, they rarely give speeches, except to trade groups.
Appealing to core business concerns can be a hit with specialized groups. Jack Florin, director of advertising and promotion at the Kelly-Springfield Tire Company in Cumberland, Md., recalls how the tire sales force was mesmerized by Mr. Blackwell of Ohio State.
"He held the audience for three hours by talking about the future of retailing," Mr. Florin said. "Three hours is a lot."
In speaking before business groups, lesser-known names sometimes fare better than the stars. "Those that receive the best reviews are those who aggressively personalize their presentation," said Mr. Palmer of the National Speakers Bureau. "Prominent speakers sometimes come with such a high level of expectations that they leave their audiences disappointed."
Mr. Mackay parlayed his success as a businessman into a set of sales tips that are articulated in his books. His audiences sometimes measure in the thousands -- including, once, a group of 10,000 Century 21 real estate agents, all in their company's distinctive gold jackets.
Mr. Mackay, who also runs an envelope manufacturing company with $50 million in sales, jumped on the speech bandwagon after "Swim With the Sharks" became a best seller. The book is a paean to aggressive sales techniques and describes how business needs to be focused on the consumer in order to succeed.
Following the techniques he outlines in his book, Mr. Mackay hits up the companies that hire him to speak to buy envelopes from his company. "I have the unusual opportunity to walk into wonderful companies, share information with them and get an obscene honorarium," Mr. Mackay said, "and then I get a chance to do business with them for the rest of my life. It's a dream."
If business is still a mostly male domain, so is the world of business speakers. Only a handful of women can be pitched to men's groups -- notably Margaret Thatcher and Barbara Bush and, on a less-exalted level, Peggy Noonan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, and Christie Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy Enterprises.
Among businesswomen's groups, one of the hottest tickets is Ivana Trump, who speaks on "how I had it all, lost it all, got it back and now am doing terrifically on my own," according to Ms. Berg at William Morris. Other current favorites are the television star and pitchwoman Candice Bergen and the entertainer Lily Tomlin -- sought for their image as strong, successful women.
But sometimes women are a tough sell -- at least at first. Mr. Dilenschneider remembers proposing Ms. Hefner as a speaker for a world economic forum in Switzerland a few years ago. "A lot of the heavy guys in the group said, 'no way,' " he recalled. He booked her anyway, assigning her to a small room with only 40 chairs.
By the end of the conference, he said, 500 people signed up to hear her -- more than for any other speaker.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Even in an era of electronic connections, demand for old-fashioned business speaking is growing. Harvey Mackay, the author and motivational speaker, gets $50,000 a talk -- or $2.5 million for 50 lectures a year. He spoke at a sales conference in Denver this week.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Trade Lower On Fresh Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bonds traded lower yesterday, as investors reacted to both fresh economic data and comments by a Federal Reserve official.
"The market is in a sideways drift that seems destined to hold into next week," said James Hales, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco. "Day traders see the risk-reward of trading this market as unappealing right now. To them, the bull market is tired and not worth chasing." He said people trying to short it lately had been burned. 
 Initial unemployment claims shrank last week for the first time in a month, signaling to some in the market that economic growth was stronger than expected. That could entail a possible risk of accelerating inflation, which would leave the Fed little reason to cut interest rates again.
That sent the benchmark Treasury bond down, but it rebounded as some market participants concluded that the economy was not growing at a fast enough pace to press the inflation-alert button just yet.
Analysts said another economic report showing that nonfarm productivity shot up 4.8 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate from April through June indicated a lack of underlying inflation pressures; rather, it showed businesses were producing more goods and services with fewer workers.
Still, the 30-year bond fell 6/32 of a percentage point, to 103 19/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.60 percent, from 6.58 percent on Wednesday. Intermediate-term and short-term issues were off as well.
Jobless claims for the week ended Sept. 2 fell by 10,000, to 339,000. Traders had expected claims to slip by only 1,000. The four-week moving average, which takes the volatility out of the weekly data, rose to 343,500 from a revised 341,750.
Kathleen Stephensen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, noted that since the jobless data for the week ended Sept. 2 were collected during a shortened business week, because of the coming Labor Day holiday, the drop of 10,000 claimants for the weekly survey might be subject to a substantial revision with next week's report.
James Hale, at MMS International, said, "There continues to be talk of flows out of mortgages and into Treasury securities supporting the long end of the market, as prepayment adjustments cause duration of mortgage portfolios to shorten." A large West Coast institutional money manager bought between $500 million and $1 billion of 30-year Treasuries early in the session, and that may have been the motivation.
Some of the market's selling yesterday was attributed to comments by Robert T. Parry, president of the San Francisco Fed. Speaking in Boise, Idaho, before directors of the Salt Lake City, Seattle and Portland, Ore., branches of the Federal Reserve System, he said the economy would soon recover from its recent slow growth. He added that the second-quarter gross domestic product figures were not so weak as they appeared on the surface.
Mr. Parry also said that the current unemployment rate, 5.6 percent in August, was below the lowest level that could be sustained for long without raising the risk of accelerating inflation. The so-called natural rate of unemployment is "closer to 6 percent," he said.
Traders said the comments suggested to some in the market that the central bank would not be compelled to cut rates further in order to stimulate the economy, which appears to be gathering strength on its own.
Traders and investors should get more insight into the pace of inflation next week, when the Government releases data on last month's producer and consumer prices.

HEADLINE: Productivity In U.S. Makes Strong Gains

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers posted its best quarterly performance in nine years, helping drive down labor costs, the Labor Department reported today.
Nonfarm productivity shot up 4.8 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate from April through June, even stronger than its 3 percent initial estimate last month. The increase was the biggest since productivity -- defined as output per number of hours worked -- jumped 7 percent in the first quarter of 1986. 
 It was much larger than the 3.5 percent improvement that many analysts had expected and followed a 2.5 percent gain in the latest January-March quarter. Productivity is a key measure of the nation's living standards and business competitiveness. Increases mean companies are making their goods more efficiently and at lower costs.
"The fact that it is up so steeply is encouraging," said Samuel D. Kahan, a Chicago-based economist. "Usually toward the end of a business cycle, productivity tends to decline because resources have been exhausted.
"But we're now into the fourth year of the recovery, and we're still getting solid growth. It rivals what we had in the 1950's and is considerably better than the 70's and 80's."
Productivity increased more than 2 percent annually during the 1950's, but slowed to 1.5 percent in the 1960's and 1970's and to less than 1 percent in the 1980's, Mr. Kahan said.
He and other economists attribute much of the recent gains to business investments in high-technology equipment and to cutbacks in employment by many companies.
The report also said that unit labor costs, typically two-thirds of the cost of a product, fell 1.2 percent during the three months ended June 30. It was the biggest drop since a 2.5 percent decline in the final three months of 1993 and nearly erased a 1.6 percent increase in the first quarter of 1995.
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the number of first-time claims for jobless benefits fell last week by 10,000, to 339,000, the first drop in five weeks.
Mr. Kahan said part of the decline resulted from the Labor Day holiday, which produced a shorter workweek in which to file claims.
But he also said it was consistent with stronger job growth. The department reported last week that unemployment dipped to 5.6 percent in August from 5.7 percent in July, and that 249,000 jobs were created.
While the productivity report suggested an absence of inflationary pressures, it showed that workers were not sharing fully in the efficiency gains.
Hourly compensation, when adjusted for inflation, inched up just one-tenth of 1 percent, well below the 1 percent advance during the first quarter.
Output in the April-June quarter rose 2.3 percent, slower than the 4.5 percent advance in the first three months. But total hours worked dropped 2.3 percent after increasing 2 percent from January through March.
Manufacturing productivity rose at a 2.6 percent rate from April through June, slower than the 3.5 percent gain three months earlier.
Total business productivity, including farming, rose 4.7 percent, well above the 2.1 percent pace during the first quarter.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Western National has high hopes for its annuities sales strategy.

BYLINE: Michael Quint 

 BODY:
THE Western National Corporation, a leading issuer of annuities sold through banks, cannot point to rising sales or even much growth in its earnings in the last year. But despite those uninspiring results, Western has high hopes that its strategy of partnership with banks will distinguish it from other insurers to which banks are merely sales outlets.
Instead of the standard practice, where banks merely provide branch offices to sell annuities whose terms and conditions are set by the insurer, or issuer, Western's annuities are offered in an arrangement where the bank manages the investments backing the annuities. The bank and the insurance company cooperatively determine terms and conditions of the annuities. 
 Because expenses are held low -- primarily by paying a smaller commission on sales at bank branches -- Western National and its bank partners can offer annuities with better terms than those offered though other arrangements. For example, branches at First of America, a Michigan banking company, offer Western National annuities in which withdrawals may be made without any surrender charge after six years instead of the eight-year period required by many other annuities sold by insurance agents. And the surrender charge is 7 percent of the annuity deposits, compared with 9 percent elsewhere.
"We don't think that anybody can offer a better product," said David DeGorter, a senior vice president in charge of the insurance group at the First Union Corporation, a Charlotte, N.C., banking company. First Union is one of the most active banks in the annuities business and has recently started training classes so that more than 2,000 branch workers will be licensed to sell insurance.
About 200 branch workers in First Union's Florida bank are expected to have licenses within a few months, thanks to a change of policy at the Florida Insurance Department, which recently dropped objections to issuing insurance agent licenses to bank branch workers.
Western agrees to handle the issuance of annuities and the administration of policies outstanding while the bank handles the investments that back those policies. Western also provides advice on marketing and sales, though it is up to the bank, or an outside company it may hire, to provide licensed sales agents to work in branches.
As the earnings on the investment account fluctuate, the bank, in consultation with Western, must make decisions about how to adjust the annuities backed by those investments. In response to lower interest rates, for example, the bank could choose to cut the interest rate on the annuities, sell the annuities with a lower commission or accept a cut in the fee it earns managing the investment account.
Across the country, Western National has signed up six banks for the new arrangement, with a total of more than 1,700 branches and sales projected in 1996 at $400 million. New sales at banks with about 1,200 branches, not part of the new partnership arrangement, are estimated at $725 million this year, so the additional $400 million would be a 55 percent increase.
But while the bankers' interest is gratifying, it has not yet been translated into investor demand for Western National stock. At yesterday's closing price of $13.50, down 12.5 cents, Western has gained $1.50 from a recent low of $12 on Aug. 24. But since a public stock offering in early 1994 at $12 a share, the stock has been a disappointment as revenues and profits declined last year.
Profits in the first half of this year were less than in 1994. But Paul Goulekas, an analyst at Conning & Company, a Hartford securities firm specializing in insurance companies, says the new bank arrangements are a solid reason for expecting growth in sales and profits during 1996.
Michael Poulos, chief executive at Western and formerly an executive at the American General Corporation of Houston (which owns 40 percent of Western) acknowledges that Western lacks the safety provided by a more diverse sales system. "But annuities are the strongest part of the insurance business," he said, "and the banks are in annuity sales to stay." That makes Western's narrow focus a strength, not a weakness, he said.

HEADLINE: Japan Reduces A Key Interest Rate to 0.5%

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Japan's central bank reduced the key discount rate by one-half of a percentage point today, to an unprecedentedly low 0.5 percent, in an effort to keep the nation's fragile economy from slipping further into recession.
The action meant that the discount rate, the rate at which the Bank of Japan lends money to commercial banks, is approaching zero. It is the lowest official interest rate in Japanese history and represents an extraordinarily low level for an industrial nation. The bank last cut the rate by three-quarters of percentage point on April 14, to 1 percent from 1.75 percent. 
 By comparison, the discount rate in the United States is now 5.25 percent and 3.5 percent in Germany, the world's two other giant economies.
The announcement of the rate cut here came during the stock market's midday break. After trading resumed this afternoon, the market's rise accelerated. At the close, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks was up 658.37 points, or 3.74 percent, to stand at 18,279.55. In the currency market, the dollar broke the 100-yen barrier for the first time since January, reaching 100.18 yen before falling a bit at the time the Nikkei closed. On Thursday the figure was 98.99 in New York.
Describing the central bank's action, Robert Alan Feldman, director of economic research at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said: "It denotes a more aggressive attempt to get the economy moving again. It's enough to solidify the yen here and make it a little less likely that it will go back to the 80's." He referred to a trading range between 80 and 90 yen to the dollar that prevailed several weeks ago.
The move also came amid substantial concern here and overseas over the state of the Japanese financial system. The nation has recently been shocked by scenes of consumers clamoring for their money as a big regional bank and two of the country's largest credit unions failed in a period of several weeks. While Japanese officials say the worst of the banking crisis has passed, few people here seem to believe that.
Washington has also been worried that the weak Japanese economy would be a drag on worldwide growth. There is concern that a financial meltdown in Japan would have grave consequences for the world banking system. Japanese investors might well withdraw from bond markets in the United States, raising American interest rates.
In a statement released in Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin welcomed the rate cut, and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to cooperate in the currency markets with the rest of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
The discount-rate cut here today had been expected, both as part of an economic stimulus package to be introduced later this month by the Government and a concerted effort by the central banks of the United States, Japan and Germany to raise the value of the dollar.
Lower interest rates in Japan and Germany make yen- and mark-denominated deposits less attractive than dollar-based ones, increasing the demand for dollars.
How much a discount-rate cut will help the Japanese economy in the long run, however, is questionable. This is the ninth such cut since 1991, when the rate was 6 percent.
One problem, economists say, is that there is excess manufacturing capacity in the economy so that companies do not want to borrow money to build factories even if interest rates are extremely low. To get the economy moving, the economists say, spending must increase. The Government plans to announce public-spending programs and other fiscal incentives expected to total at least $100 billion.
The move by the Bank of Japan comes as the broad economy is showing mixed signs. In recent weeks, the strong yen has eased from an exchange rate as high as 80 to the dollar to near 100 yen to the dollar, in part because of currency-market intervention by the United States, Japan and Germany.
With that change, brokerage houses now predict that Japan's blue-chip manufacturers will record double-digit growth in profit this fiscal year, which ends next March. Those earnings prospects have sharply lifted the stock market's Nikkei index, which closed below 14,600 as recently as June 13.
Still, the positive signs have been outweighed in many minds by negative ones. Industrial production has dropped for four months. Automobile sales, which started the year robustly, have slowed. A quarterly survey to be released later today by the Bank of Japan is expected to show a decline in business optimism.
Sluggish consumer demand, excess manufacturing capacity and the influx of low-priced imports are also helping lower prices, putting further pressure on companies to cut costs and leading to fear of a deflationary spiral.

Delta Seeks to Expand European Partnerships
Delta Air Lines said it had applied to the Department of Transportation for approval and antitrust immunity to expand its partnerships with Austrian Airlines, Sabena and Swissair.
While the existing partnerships allow the carriers to integrate their passengers with each other on some trans-Atlantic flights, antitrust immunity would allow them to integrate flight schedules, marketing plans and sales programs, essentially allowing the partners to function as one carrier while legally remaining separate. Analysts said other carriers might seek similar partnerships. [Page 34.]
 
Exxon in Plan to Build Pipeline That Skirts Russia
Exxon, Mitsubishi and China's state oil company have announced a partnership to study building a $12 billion, 4,900-mile natural gas pipeline from the former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan, on the Caspian Sea, to the Pacific -- bypassing Russia and avoiding Moscow's political and economic leverage. It would be the longest natural gas export pipeline in the world. [1.]
 
Japan Rate Cut May Aid Banks
With the cut in its official discount rate by half a percentage point, to 0.5 percent, the Bank of Japan is providing essentially free money to commercial banks, which could help them dig out from under their mountain of bad debts and lift the economy. Some analysts, however, said Japanese banks were so reluctant to lend money that a discount rate cut would not be sufficient to restore the economy. [35.]
 
The dollar surpassed 100 yen for the first time since January before falling back to close in New York at 99.65 yen. [32.]
 
First Capital May Shut Down
First Capital Strategists, the investment firm whose rogue trader lost $138 million in the accounts of the Common Fund, is close to shutting down. [34.]
 
General Magic Splits in Two
General Magic has split its Magic Cap and Telescript software businesses into two divisions. The revamping followed the recent departure of two senior executives and a co-founder and comes at a time when the Sunnyvale, Calif., company's products have encountered a slower-than-expected acceptance by the market. [36.]
 
Rise in Borrowing Slows
Consumer borrowing rose at a slower pace in July than it did in June, a sign that household finances may be coming under stress. Consumer credit rose $8.82 billion in July at a 10.9 percent annual rate, after rising a revised $11.15 billion in June at a 13.9 percent annual rate. The July increase was the 26th consecutive monthly rise in borrowing. [34.]
 
Trading in Olivetti Halted
Trading in shares of Olivetti was suspended on the Milan stock exchange for a company announcement. Analysts said Olivetti was expected to seek as much as $1.25 billion through an offer of stock and convertible warrants and was expected to use part of the money to overhaul its troubled personal computer division. [35.]
 
Plan for Rockefeller Center
The owners of Rockefeller Center are trying to negotiate a reorganization plan for the property, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection, so that they could retain ownership of the center for five years and then turn over a majority interest to their largest creditor and an investment group led by Sam Zell, the Chicago financier. [34.]
 
Coffee Falls on Harvest Report
Coffee prices fell after a Colombian coffee-growers group reported that it expected to harvest 15 percent more of the crop than estimated. On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for December delivery fell 2.90 cents, to $1.369 a pound, the lowest in seven and a half weeks. [32.]
 
Captured Workers Remembered
In December 1941, Morrison Knudsen had 1,100 men on Wake Island in the South Pacific building a naval air base. But six hours after attacking Pearl Harbor, the Japanese bombed Wake and took over the island after a two-week battle. In the fall of 1945, only 700 of those men came home. Next week, about 150 of the survivors from around the nation are to gather in Twin Falls, Idaho, for ceremonies. [6.]

CORRECTION-DATE: September 15, 1995

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the reunion of Morrison-Knudsen workers who survived the Japanese occupation of Wake Island misstated the island's location. It is in the North Pacific, not the South Pacific.

HEADLINE: Packwood Is Leaving As a Pariah In His State

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Sept. 8

 BODY:
All states have narrative myths, the heroic images that are chiseled into granite in the Capitol building and passed on through the generations. In the Beaver State, people worship the Oregon Trail pioneer and the political maverick.
Until recently, Senator Bob Packwood could lay claim to a bit of both traditions. His great-grandfather, he said, was an Oregon pioneer. And on political matters, he became known as a giant-killer, someone with extraordinary political instincts. Long before he was Bob Packwood the political pariah, he was the man who took on Presidents from his own party and muscled through legislation considered impossible to pass. 
 So, among the many paradoxes in his fall from power, friends and foes here say, are that he leaves office, not just as someone who left a written record of politics at its most cynical level, but as someone who had become a stranger in his native state.
In his last months, he tried to embrace the maverick image -- the fighter against doctrinaire feminism and "political correctness," as he put it -- but to no avail.
"He made this state a laughing stock of the country," said Georgia Vareldzis, a 62-year-old Portland cookbook author. "The only Oregonian Bob Packwood represents today is Bob Packwood."
Over the last three years, Mr. Packwood had become a spectral figure in Oregon, rarely coming home and refusing to talk to the state's leading newspaper. He did not even have a home in Oregon; for a time, he lived out of a trailer.
His rise and fall, viewed from his home state, is a story of a man who forgot some of the lessons of the great Oregon mavericks.
"He was a procedural master, brilliant in many ways, but what did him in with the Senate was the same thing that got him in trouble with the women -- he couldn't read human nature," said James Moore, a political science professor at the University of Portland. "It wasn't that he doesn't get it on women's issues. He doesn't get it on people."
Had Senator Packwood followed the example of his mentor and fellow Oregon Republican, Senator Mark O. Hatfield, he might have saved his political career, Professor Moore said. When, in the mid-1980's, Mr. Hatfield got in trouble with the Senate Ethics Committee for accepting gifts, he apologized profusely, threw himself at the mercy of the committee and returned all the gifts.
Today, there are buildings in this state named after Mr. Hatfield, and he is sometimes referred to as Saint Mark.
More than 40 years ago, Mr. Hatfield was a teacher of political science at Willamette University, and Mr. Packwood was his prize student.
"I never had a more brilliant student than Bob Packwood," Mr. Hatfield said on the day of Mr. Packwood's resignation. He then recounted a story that may have seemed arcane to the national television audience but is legendary in this state.
After a few terms in the State Legislature, Mr. Packwood, in 1968, took on Wayne Morse, a United States Senator for 23 years, and an Oregon maverick as well, known for his early opposition to the Vietnam War. Nobody gave Mr. Packwood a chance. He was "a sacrificial lamb," as Mr. Hatfield said.
"But he was energetic, young and brilliant," said Jeanette Slepian, who has known Mr. Packwood since 1963. A televised debate in the 1968 campaign showed a young and eloquent Bob Packwood, and a verbose Senator Morse, his hands shaking. Mr. Packwood won by just over 3,000 votes out of 813,999 cast.
In the Senate, he was a liberal Republican who considered himself a feminist. He introduced legislation to legalize abortion and wanted to take tax breaks away from parents who had too many children. He was a friend of Gloria Steinem, a leading feminist, and promoted women to top positions in his staff.
In 1969 and 1970, early in his first term in the Senate, he bucked President Richard M. Nixon and voted against two of the President's Supreme Court nominees, Clement Haynsworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell. And when President Nixon found himself in trouble with the Watergate scandals, Mr. Packwood called on him to resign well before it was a foregone conclusion.
By then, he had earned his maverick status, some people here said. Although nobody compared him to Tom McCall, the former Republican Governor who had almost Lincoln-like status in Oregon, he was considered to be in the tradition of Oregon politicians who marched to a different drummer.
A member of the Senate Finance Committee since 1973 and the chairman or top-ranking Republican on that panel for the last decade, Mr. Packwood stood out in the Senate as a master of the tax code and the intricacies of health policy.
His best-known achievement came in 1986 when he pushed through legislation that cut top Federal income tax rates almost in half and eliminated scores of deductions, exemptions and other tax breaks. The measure, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, affected the taxes of almost every individual and company in America and was one of the most important laws enacted in the last 30 years. Its central philosophy was that taxes should be levied to raise money, not to achieve social or economic purposes.
In working on the law, Mr. Packwood also displayed the ability to put together a political coalition, a skill many did not know he possessed.
But the writing of this law exposed another side of Mr. Packwood as well: his tendency to do political about-faces and, as is evident now from his diaries, to use his position to grant political favors.
When his supporters compare his accomplishments with the details of his diaries, made public on Thursday, they flinch.
In the diaries, Mr. Packwood talks about taking money from supporters after doing them favors. Even his friends say this revealed a bald political deal maker -- anything but the maverick, standing on principle.
One entry, for example, notes a favor he did in the 1986 tax code overhaul, when he had inserted a $5 million tax break to benefit an Oregon firm owned by a friend. Another time he wrote that he was doing his "Christian duty," by having sex with a female staff member.
"It doesn't paint a picture of the kind of character you would want your kids to emulate," said Randy Miller, chairman of the state Republican Party in Oregon and, until Thursday, a staunch Packwood defender.
In his final months, Mr. Packwood tried desperately to play the maverick card. He said he was a victim of the liberal press, dogmatic women and political correctness. But these arguments did not take hold here, some experts say, because he had, by then, removed himself from the state and its traditions.
"Sympathy? For Bob Packwood? No way," said Ana Thompson, a flower shop owner in Portland.
Len Bergstein, a political consultant, said, "The maverick stuff didn't work for him in the end because he forgot his roots. He had stopped practicing the kind of retail politics that people in this state like."
Some of the women who brought Mr. Packwood down see his legacy as a cautionary tale. "What I learned from all this," said Maura Roche, one of 19 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, "is that it is possible to go up against someone that's far more powerful than you and prevail."

HEADLINE: Delta Seeks to Expand Its Tie With Three Airlines in Europe

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines said yesterday that it had applied to the Transportation Department for approval and antitrust immunity to expand its partnerships with Austrian Airlines, Sabena and Swissair. Delta and the three European airlines currently have a combined market share of almost 17 percent on the highly competitive Atlantic routes.
While the existing pact allows the carriers to integrate their passengers with one another on a limited number of trans-Atlantic flights -- a process known as code-sharing -- antitrust immunity would allow them to integrate flight schedules, marketing plans and sales programs. In short, it would allow the partners to function as one carrier while remaining separate companies. 
 "Antitrust immunity can be very helpful because it allows you to sit down with your partner and divvy up the market," said Philip A. Baggaley, an airline bond analyst with Standard & Poor's. "But for it to succeed requires a strong commitment on the part of each carrier's management and a willingness to set aside their particular viewpoint for the good of the alliance."
If Delta gains the exemption, analysts expect other carriers to petition Washington. "United Airlines, with its partnership with Lufthansa, would probably be the most logical next step," said Virginia Lee, an analyst with NatWest Securities. From a strictly economic point of view, Ms. Lee said, "global alliances make a lot of sense."
The only such sweeping arrangement approved by the United States was that between Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in 1992. Last year, that relationship generated more than $125 million for Northwest, according to a recent report by the General Accounting Office.
A spokesman for the Transportation Department, speaking on the condition that he not be identified, said yesterday that it was fair to say that Delta's request "will be read with some care by us and the Justice Department."
One analyst, who also insisted on not being identified, said it might be difficult for Washington to deny Delta what it had previously granted Northwest, especially in view of the upbeat G.A.O. report. Adding that the Government may have painted itself into a corner, the analyst said it might be prudent for Washington to postpone a decision on Delta until after next year's Presidential election.
Northwest's antitrust exemption was approved soon after negotiation of an open skies aviation agreement between the United States and the Netherlands. Such agreements allow airlines of participating nations to fly where they want in either country without limits on frequency or capacity. Delta's announcement yesterday pointedly noted that Switzerland, Belgium and Austria had recently signed similar open skies agreements with the United States.
But Northwest may have been given the antitrust exemption because it was thought at the time to be in danger of going out of business. Moreover, KLM had invested $400 million in Northwest. In contrast, while Delta has consistently lost money on its trans-Atlantic routes -- most of which it bought from the bankrupt Pan Am in 1991 -- it is considered fundamentally sound.
Moreover, Bill Berry, a spokesman for Delta, which is based in Atlanta, said yesterday that there were no plans for any of the partners to take additional equity stakes in one another. Since 1989, Delta, Swissair and Singapore Airlines have held a 5 percent equity stake in one another.

HEADLINE: Governor Wants to Cut California Taxes by 15%

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Facing politically damaging charges by other Republican Presidential hopefuls that he is a "big taxer," Gov. Pete Wilson called today for a 15 percent cut in California taxes, with the issue to be decided by a ballot referendum.
"It's time to take our cause to the people," said the Governor, who in his first term supported a major tax increase but since then has been urging the State Legislature, without success, to make tax cuts. 
 "Californians pay higher taxes than workers in any other Western state and we have one of the highest income taxes in the nation," the Governor added, going on to accuse Democrats in the Legislature of "irresponsibly" stalling his tax relief bills.
Mr. Wilson's Presidential campaign is struggling, and political experts say he must gain some momentum soon if he is to be a credible candidate. Recent polls indicate his support among voters in his home state, the "must win" state for Presidential candidates, is as embarrassingly tenuous as his support among voters nationally.
For example, in theoretical matchups among California voters, a new Field Poll, the leading California poll, has Mr. Wilson more than 10 percentage points behind both President Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee for 1996, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the strongest of the Republican contenders nationally.
In that context, today's suggestion of a tax cut, always a popular move with many voters, seemed designed and timed in good part to give the Governor a much-needed lift in both California and elsewhere.
Almost certainly his opponents will see it that way and will not let slip the opportunity to accuse him of opportunism and political flip-flopping. That is what they charged earlier when he dropped his support for affirmative action programs and liberal immigration laws.
In 1991, his first year in office in Sacramento, Mr. Wilson supported a $7 billion increase in California taxes, with the increase going to balance the state budget.
He has since said that he had no choice but to support the increase because state law requires a balanced budget and the State Legislature refused to balance the budget by cutting spending.
Whatever his rationale for the increase, it has come back to haunt him politically in the Presidential contest. At every turn, other Republican contenders cite it as proof of where his fiscal heart truly lies, pointedly ignoring his record since then as a strong advocate of cutting taxes and spending.
In one of his first campaign swings into New England, site of the crucial New Hampshire primary on Feb. 20, Mr. Wilson made a big show of "taking the pledge," as the saying goes in the Granite State.
More than in any other state, New Hampshire's Republican voters demand that candidates, at least those who hope to make a credible showing, pledge not to raise taxes. Mr. Wilson so pledged.
Mr. Wilson made today's tax cut suggestion in a speech to a thousand or so California business executives who had gathered in Sacramento to push for legislation favorable to their companies and corporations. The gathering takes place annually just before the Legislature adjourns, which this year will occur next weekend.
In the Presidential race, as in past state and local races, Mr. Wilson plans to lean heavily on the huge, wealthy California business community for major financial support. However, many state business people, like California voters in general, oppose Mr. Wilson's Presidential bid, arguing that he should remain in Sacramento and help the state overcome the lingering drag of the recent national recession.
Just in case his tax cut proposal left anyone with lingering doubts about his commitment to fiscal conservatism, the Governor coupled today's reduction suggestion with a boast that he also favors major cuts in spending programs and has the record to prove it.
"We made such deep cuts in state spending," he said, referring to his first term in office, "that if Washington had shown the same spending discipline, we'd have a Federal surplus, not a $200 billion deficit."
Mr. Wilson's aides said he intends to put his tax-cut proposal on the 1996 fall ballot -- along with his own name in the slot reserved for the Republican Presidential nominee.
"We'll have to gather roughly 600,000 signatures on petitions to do that," Paul Kranhold, the Governor's press secretary, said of the ballot initiative. "That's a piece of cake for a tax cut referendum. And we don't have any doubts that voters will then approve it easily."
In recent years, as partisan bickering has tied up the California legislature more and more, ballot referendums have become increasingly popular as an alternate way to decide contentious issues.

HEADLINE: Port-au-Prince Journal;
Haiti Task Force, Battling for Women's Rights

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
The elegant white building just across the square from the National Palace has long been a center of power here, and that is just fine with the women who have displaced the fearsome soldiers who once swaggered through its halls.
In an act laden with symbolism, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has turned over the two-story French colonial-style house to the 50 or so women who now serve as the Ministry of Women's Affairs. 
 It was with a mixture of pride and anxiety that the women took over the very offices where army officers plotted the overthrow of Mr. Aristide in September 1991. But since the President's return last October, the army has been dismantled.
"This building represents power in the Haitian mind," said Marjorie Michel-Kernisant, former president of the Haitian Women's Fund, a private group that provides money to women wanting to be entrepreneurs. "When President Aristide gave this building to women, somehow it also meant that we women are in power."
The Minister for Women's Affairs, Lise-Marie Dejean, said: "We consider it an honor that we are given this house. It was a place of death before, and now it is a place of life."
While many countries have government bureaus dedicated to women's issues, Haiti is one of the few to have a Cabinet-level ministry for them. Its creation came in November 1994, after years of lobbying and organizing by Haitian women, who have doubly suffered as the poorest members of what is already considered the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
The ministry is intended to act as a kind of well-placed advocacy group for the 3.5 million women who make up a little more than half of Haiti's population. If the Planning Ministry seeks aid money from abroad for a development project, for instance, the Women's Ministry is there to insure that women receive some of the jobs. The ministry says it will coordinate its efforts with the hundreds of private groups here that also work to better women's conditions.
Even though women are generally regarded as the economic backbone of everyday life here, their contribution is seldom equally compensated. Nearly everywhere they can be seen laboring in mostly menial and manual jobs -- carrying water in buckets atop their heads, tending small farm plots, peddling produce.
Women were barred from universities until 1939, and even today their legal and social standing generally remains below that of most Haitian men. The Constitution, for instance, calls for a woman to turn over all that she inherits to her husband; the legal code punishes women more severely than men if caught committing adultery; and the age of sexual consent is 18 years for boys, while for girls it is just 15.
Abortion is illegal in this nominally Roman Catholic country. Fewer than 10 percent of women use birth control, according to studies by relief groups, and few women outside the capital have access to family planning. The average Haitian woman will bear six children, often at home without medical attention, and the death rate in childbirth is five times that of women in the United States.
"This ministry is the result of the women's struggle," said Ms. Dejean, the Women's Affairs Minister. "It was not a gift."
Ministry officials have begun what they described as the first comprehensive study of the social and economic status of women in Haiti. The survey will try to compare women's wages with those of men, measure their strength in the paid work force and document the often unsanitary conditions women labor under in unregulated outdoor markets.
The ministry, which has a yearly budget of about $1 million, out of a total Government budget of $300 million, has also started a program with the Agriculture Ministry to channel credit to women who are farmers, and it has set up a counseling program for victims of rape.
But while many people here agree that opportunities for Haitian women should be improved, some have questioned the need for a ministry. The ministries of Justice and Social Affairs, they argue, are perfectly capable of handling the cause.
"This is reverse discrimination," said Dr. Kyss Jean-Mary, a New York-trained obstetrician and gynecologist, and critic of the Women's Ministry. "Are they going to create a ministry for men's affairs? It's a cosmetic salon."
Whatever the criticism, the ministry has a strong champion in Mr. Aristide, who has several women among his closest advisers. Of his 18 Cabinet ministries, 4 are headed by women, including those for foreign affairs and finance.
A record number of women are also expected to sit in the new 110-member Parliament that convenes this fall.
After Mr. Aristide returned last year, the electoral code was changed to allow women to pay lower registration fees than men to to run for office. The number of women running for Parliament this year increased to 45 from 16 in 1990, when Mr. Aristide was elected.
Until Haitians vote in run-off elections scheduled for Sept. 17, women's total representation will not be known. But their numbers are likely to increase from the three who were seated in the old 83-member Chamber of Deputies and the one in the 27-member Senate.
In a play on words based on the initials of the ministry's former occupants, the Armed Forces of Haiti, or FADH, people have taken to calling the new ministry Fem Actionaises d'Haiti, which, loosely translated, means the Hard-Driving Women of Haiti.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
What Price Peace?

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The self-congratulation surrounding today's statement of basic principles for peace in Bosnia obscures the fact that the Serbs will keep most of their territorial gains won during 41 months of war and will get what amounts to a separate state inside Bosnia.
But today's 12-paragraph agreement may provide the basis for an eventual peace settlement. It would give back to the Bosnians some of the territory they lost in the war and, not incidentally, be easier for NATO troops (including Americans) to enforce. 
 As brutal and repugnant as the outlines of such a peace may seem, the United States and its allies argue that it is hard to criticize any effort that offers peace instead of war at a moment when the Serbs may be ready to stop fighting.
So today's statement closes one of the chapters of Western policy toward Bosnia with a practical if not an ennobling ending.
"Wars must end and enemies must live and work together," Richard C. Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary of State who brokered today's agreement, told reporters today. "It's happened in Western Europe. It's happened in Asia. It must happen in the former Yugoslavia."
Mr. Holbrooke might have called it "hold your nose but hope for the best" peacemaking.
The Clinton Administration came into office vowing not to put its stamp of approval on the kind of peace settlement like that now being considered. It initially resisted endorsing the so-called Vance-Owen plan, which would have divided Bosnia into 10 ethnically dominated provinces, saying it failed to protect the multi-ethnic nature of Bosnia and rewarded aggression.
But over the past two-and-a-half years, the Administration has gradually come to champion the European view that the most promising outcome for peace was based not on ethnic blending but on ethnic division.
The dilemma of that reversal was underscored by the negotiations themselves, in which the American team had to depend on the goodwill of Mr. Milosevic.
As late as December 1992, Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger stood up at an international conference in Stockholm and declared that the Serbian leader should have to answer in a court of law for atrocities committed against Bosnians in an effort to expel them from their homes and villages during the early stages of the war.
But in recent weeks, the United States has transformed Mr. Milosevic from a potential war criminal to be shunned into a statesman to be courted.
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns made clear just how important Mr. Milosevic had become to the peace effort when he told reporters on Thursday, "President Milosevic is a respected leader among the Serbs, and for him to come out and dedicate his Government to a peace process is a positive sign."
And signaling the Clinton Administration's eagerness to see the new accord produce results, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that the United States has not ruled out dealing with Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, even though they too have been accused of war crimes.
"There are some practical logistical problems that might arise in that situation" because the two men are wanted by the War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, Mr. Christopher said at a news conference.
"But we recognize we need to deal -- with respect to finding a peace settlement -- with the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs as well as the leaders of Serbia," he said. "And so, we have not ruled out dealing with them."
The door to negotiation was opened by several other crucial developments: the new and mounting strength of the Croatian Army; the recent expulsions of Serbs from Croatia and Muslims from Serbian-held areas of Bosnia that further carved up the region into ethnically homogeneous zones; the political dominance of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia over Radovan Karadzic, the much-weakened Bosnian Serb leader; and the realization by the Clinton Administration that its diplomacy was indispensable to any settlement.
While satisfying no one entirely, today's agreement is sufficiently ambiguous and sprinkled with enough face-saving phrases to allow each of the three warring parties to claim victory, before the hard negotiations over strategic pieces of territory begin.
The Bosnian Government at first strongly resisted giving the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb government in Pale the right to call itself the "Republika Sprska" or Serb Republic, but was persuaded by Mr. Holbrooke that the concession was necessary for a deal.
"All peacemaking is holding your nose," said one senior Administration official. "That's the definition of the process. To make peace when people are shooting at each other means somebody has to give up what they're shooting for."
But the agreement may encourage further ethnic separation by creating two distinct "entities" inside Bosnia, one for the Muslims and Croats, the other for the Serbs, and by allowing each part to enter into "special relationships" with its neighbors.
That is where hoping for the best comes in.
The Administration and its partners in the negotiations -- France, Britain, Germany and Russia -- are now hoping that the warring parties are eager enough for the economic benefits of peace that in the next few weeks they can resolve a daunting array of territorial and constitutional differences.
Asked what the best case scenario for Bosnia would be, a senior Administration official said, only half-jokingly, "Belgium."

HEADLINE: At U.N. Women's Meeting, An Outbreak of Harmony

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 8

 BODY:
It was billed as a clash of civilizations over how to define the rights of women in language that could influence how all nations act.
So when delegates and advocates from 185 nations started converging on the Chinese capital late last month for the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women and a parallel forum of nongovernmental organizations, many people thought that conservative Muslims allied with the Vatican and the anti-abortion coalitions of North America would join forces and storm the ramparts of the meeting halls here. 
 It's not happening.
There is plenty of debate -- even passion -- at the United Nations conference, which opened on Monday and runs through next Friday, over how to define the fundamental rights of women, in sexual relations, politics and the economy. The nongovernmental forum, which began on Aug. 30, ended today.
But there is little rancor -- at least so far.
Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services and co-chairwoman of the American delegation, characterized the marathon negotiations going on behind dozens of closed doors here today as marked by "integrity and good will."
She pointed out that already there had been "significant steps forward" in shaping a consensus for the 120-page Platform for Action that will emerge from this conference to serve as recommendations for governments to improve the health and status of women.
The only person who seemed to be fuming today was Msgr. Peter Elliot of the Vatican delegation, who was trying to correct a Spanish press report that the Vatican had decided to accept all forms of contraception.
"As if," he said, as he fumbled inside his briefcase for the Vatican's rebuttal, "we would change our position on an issue like contraception at a conference like this."
Privately, many delegates are saying that the most important factor in the conciliatory tone of the Beijing conference so far is the transformation of the Vatican's strategy since last year, when the United Nations held its conference on population and development in Cairo.
"The Vatican has been smarting from Cairo," a senior member of the American delegation said, "and from all the bad press it got" by assailing the Cairo majority as "anti-family" on some points. The Cairo declaration held that the best method to control population is to raise the educational and economic levels of women, while providing them with access to health care and family-planning services.
"This time, they don't want to look like they are anti-United Nations," the American official said of the Vatican's delegation, which for the first time is headed by a woman, Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard University law professor.
On Wednesday, Mrs. Glendon made clear that the Vatican, while not altering its opposition to abortion, would not build an alliance to once again challenge the majority.
In the meantime, Iran has sought to play a more pragmatic role as broker at this conference, carefully extracting itself from its earlier alliance with the Vatican, while restating its conservative Islamic views.
Although peace reigns now, that could all change, several delegates said today. Large, substantive issues remain that could throw this conference onto the shoals.
This weekend, delegates will be forced to work overtime on negotiations over language that remains under dispute: on sexual rights and sexual orientation, as well as wording on parental roles in decisions regarding their adolescent children's sexual activity and orientation, and reproductive health.
"If we mean by health the right to an abortion, then we are against," said El-Ghali Benhima, a member of the Moroccan delegation. "Not only is Morocco against that, but you can be sure that a majority of member states of the Organization of Islamic Conference would be against."
In a noteworthy step today, the Vatican took the position that it would not oppose the use of condoms to prevent infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, but its negotiators reserved the right to voice its opposition later in the conference to using condoms as contraceptives.
The language that is hammered out here is not legally binding, but most delegates and advocates here testify to its power in influencing national policy and international standards.

HEADLINE: Bonds Flat As Traders Await Data

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday in lackluster trading.
Many investors consolidated their positions in anticipation of potentially market-moving economic reports next week, including data on producer and consumer prices. 
 "There was some profit taking and some selling," said Kevin Flanagan, an economist on the trading floor of Dean Witter Reynolds. "People are just a little leery going into next week."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 , to 10328/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.57 percent from 6.60 percent on Thursday. Other maturities were flat. The price of the two-year note was unchanged, yielding 5.81 percent.
The market continues to be supported by expectations that inflation will remain moderate, leaving the Federal Reserve room to cut short-term interest rates again this year, traders and analysts said.
"The underlying bullish tone still exists," Mr. Flanagan said. "Inflation is subdued. The Fed's bias is still toward easing, not tightening; no one thinks the economy is going to take off in any significant fashion, and people hope there is going to be a budget deal down in Washington."
Prices started the day stronger, following the dollar higher after Japan cut its discount rate to 0.5 percent. A rising dollar makes American assets like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
The early strength forced traders who had bet that prices would fall to cover their short positions, lifting the market through a key technical level and generating "buy" orders that took the market even higher.
But prices were dragged down at midmorning by a single market participant's sale of as much as $500 million to $1 billion in 10-year notes. After that, the market stagnated for the rest of the session, analysts said.
Traders said the late afternoon release of a Government report on consumer installment credit had little impact. The Federal Reserve said consumer credit expanded by $8.82 billion in July, compared with a revised $11.15 billion increase in June. The expansion was the least since December.
Christopher Low, senior economist at HSBC Markets, said the decline in consumer credit was part of a trend of consumer retrenchment.
The next week will bring economic reports offering the most recent look at inflation and consumer demand.
The Labor Department is scheduled to release the Producer Price Index for August on Tuesday and the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Commerce Department will report retail sales for August.
In the municipal bond market, prices were mostly unchanged after a brief attempt at a midday push higher. Traders said the market had grown weary from its recent gains, and investors were nervous that prices had reached their highs.
Next week's slate of new issues, which may signal the end of a summer drought of supply, will help determine the market's short-term direction, traders said.
Among the largest deals on tap for next week is a $325 million Connecticut special-tax-obligation issue, scheduled for sale on Tuesday through the senior manager, Merrill Lynch & Company.
In a preliminary retail order period for the issue, Merrill has been offering 20-year bonds at a top yield of 5.80 percent.
The corporate bond market took a breather after a week dominated by $3.275 billion of new corporate issues. Trading was muted yesterday with no new pricings.
Junk bonds closed slightly higher, with trading concentrated in the morning session, traders said.
APP International Finance, a unit of Asia Pulp and Paper, is set to price a $350 million deal on Monday. That is expected to be the first junk bond priced in September. A further $6.7 billion of junk bonds are scheduled for pricing in coming weeks.

HEADLINE: Port Authority to Lay Off 300 More Workers

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
A day after it said it would lay off 300 workers, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced a new round of staff cuts yesterday and acknowledged that with these reductions, it would have to scale back its role as a leader in analyzing trends in the region.
The authority's executive director, George J. Marlin, said in an interview that the authority would eliminate another 300 jobs early next year as part of its effort to close a budget gap and hold the line on its bridge and tunnel tolls and commuter railway fare. That brings the number of layoffs to 600 from the authority's 8,800-person work force. 
 The cuts are by far the largest in the 74-year history of the authority, and Mr. Marlin said he could not rule out more next year.
After announcing a new organizational structure that pares down the agency, Mr. Marlin said that the authority no longer had the money to conduct many of its influential studies. The authority's research into topics like the impact of tourism or arts on the economy of the region have long carried great weight with politicians, academics and executives in the private sector.
Mr. Marlin said that the authority would still do some analysis and economic forecasting, but only if it was directly related to its operations, which include the region's three major airports, the George Washington and other bridges, the World Trade Center, the Holland and Lincoln tunnels, the PATH commuter line, most of the marine terminals on New York Harbor and industrial parks.
"I don't see, for instance, why we had a report that came out on immigration, why the Port Authority was doing this," Mr. Marlin said. "It is a luxury. In this area of limited resources, we want to consolidate and get back to our core businesses. The studies will be focused and will concern day-to-day business."
Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who oversee the authority, have repeatedly criticized it as inefficient, and Mr. Marlin said that after evaluating it over the last six months, he agreed with them.
"What has developed over the last couple of decades is an endless level of middle management," he said. "In my judgment, this organization has been stifled because of these tremendous levels of management."
Mr. Marlin again said the layoffs and the decision to avoid an increase on the $4 round-trip toll for the authority's six bridges and tunnels or the $1 PATH fare would not affect services or the agency's $4 billion capital budget, which is for much-needed renovations to the airports and other improvements.
But some former authority officials and planning experts have said they feared that the authority was under so much political pressure to put off toll and fare increases that it would begin channeling money from its capital budget to its operating budget.
The authority has promised to maintain the pricing on the tolls and PATH fare only until the end of 1996, but it seems highly unlikely that it would raise them in 1997, when Governor Whitman is up for re-election.
"I am concerned about their ability to continue the capital program" at the current levels, said Richard C. Leone, a former chairman of the authority. "I will be pleasantly surprised if they can without raising tolls."

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Pace Slows

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Borrowing by American consumers rose at a slower pace in July than it did in June, the Federal Reserve reported today, a sign that household finances may be coming under stress.
Consumer credit rose $8.82 billion in July at a 10.9 percent annual rate, after rising a revised $11.15 billion in June, a 13.9 percent annual rate. Previously, the Federal Reserve had said consumer borrowing had risen $9.6 billion in June. 
 While the increase was smaller than the previous month's, July still was the 26th consecutive month to show a rise in borrowing. Many analysts had expected a $9.3 billion increase in consumer credit for July.
The burden of loan repayment -- paired with consumers' fear of digging themselves deeper into debt -- may be behind a recent gap between the growth of personal income and spending, economists said.
In July, consumer spending rose two-tenths of 1 percent, which was smaller than expected.
Earlier this week, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported that the number of homeowners late in paying their mortgages rose in the second quarter.
"The debt overhang will continue to act as a drag on consumer spending in the next few quarters," Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates, said before today's report.
By category, credit-card use increased a slower $3.208 billion in July after rising $6.455 billion in June. But auto borrowing increased at a faster $4.397 billion in July after rising $2.774 billion in June. The increase in auto borrowing may have reflected dealer discounting to clear lots of 1995 model cars and trucks.
The Fed also reported that other types of installment credit, like mobile home loans, rose at a slower $1.213 billion during July after increasing $1.920 billion in June.

HEADLINE: Tenants in Limbo as New York Stops Foreclosing

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
At the end of each workday, as Jyreain Privette crosses the threshold of her apartment building in Harlem, she wonders if the lobby will be filled with drug dealers who come and go at will because the front door has neither a lock nor an intercom. She considers riding an elevator to her third-floor apartment, but the elevator often leaves her stranded between floors. If she chooses the stairway, it will probably smell of urine, and the lights will probably be out.
Her building is one that no one wants. The landlord is in bankruptcy and for all intents has abandoned it. And New York City, which over the last two decades has rescued thousands of buildings in similar distress, no longer considers the process worth the expense. 
 "Things here keep getting worse," said Mrs. Privette, who has lived at 343 St. Nicholas Avenue for almost 48 years. "No matter where we go for help or what we do, things keep getting worse."
In a city with no shortage of decrepit buildings, hers is among the worst. City records show that the 50-unit building has 413 code violations outstanding, more than 50 of them posing an immediate safety threat. And because the landlord, Andonis Morfesis, owes the city $423,000 in back taxes and fines, officials have the right to seize the property immediately.
But the city's protective custody is probably a thing of the past. Beginning in the last months of the Dinkins administration, the city largely stopped the seizure process.
And now, armed with a new consultant's report showing that the city would be spending an average of $2.2 million in repair costs and other expenses for every building it seized, the Giuliani administration is expected to make that moratorium formal soon, ending the city's role as landlord of last resort.
Considering that the average amount of back taxes owed by landlords of those buildings is only $36,000, city officials say it is cheaper to help the owners retain the buildings.
"Managing housing is not only a job the city should not have, it is a job that we can't do very well," said Deborah C. Wright, Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "Despite the amount we spend, when a building finally comes into city hands it is in terrible condition, often beyond the point of a reasonable repair job."
But to many critics of the city's policy, the issue is not simply a financial one. On 140th Street in Harlem, residents watched the inexorable decline of their building after the landlord defaulted on his taxes and filed for bankruptcy in the late 1980's. Although it was owed $96,000 in back taxes, the city never moved to foreclose on the building, an action that housing advocates say could have put the building in line for repairs.
In March, a rear wall collapsed, and three residents were killed.
Officials are looking for alternatives, such as programs to help prop up landlords having trouble paying taxes and efforts to return the almost 3,000 occupied buildings the city still owns to private ownership.
"Our goal is to reach buildings before they are near collapse," Ms. Wright said. "Rather than put so much money into buildings that are nearly dead, we need an early warning system."
Those options, though, offer little hope for Mrs. Privette and the residents of hundreds of other buildings caught in a similar state of limbo -- people like Margaret Harris in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn and the Galarza family in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx.
"We've been waiting since April for the landlord to do something about the fire damage in the apartment," said Mrs. Harris, who lives with her daughter and two small grandchildren in a two-bedroom apartment on St. Marks Avenue and whose landlord, H.&L. Realty, owes $300,000 in back taxes.
"We don't have windows; we've lost the bedroom to the fire. I can't let the children play in a room with no windows and where the walls and floors are burned up."
Leonard Gayle, a principal of H.&L., said contractors had broken appointments to measure for the windows. In the meantime, Mrs. Harris has worked with a community organization to arrange for her rent to go toward the cost of new windows and for the repair of the bedroom.
 
The City's Role
Abandonments Up, Vesting Down
 New York City's role as a landlord began in the 1970's when it started using foreclosure to combat the wave of abandonment that blighted many neighborhoods. Through a process known as vesting, the city would take over management of the buildings, make repairs and sell them to private landlords or nonprofit organizations.
As the economy surged in the 1980's, housing advocates say, the city made significant progress in renovating buildings and finding new owners. But as the recession struck in the late 80's and early 90's, thousands of more buildings were abandoned by owners, prompting city housing officials to scale back and eventually halt the vesting process.
Much of the city's intervention in blighted neighborhoods in the last decade was bankrolled through a $4.2 billion housing plan initiated by Mayor Edward I. Koch. But that plan, which created more than 50,000 new apartments and homes in largely vacant buildings, is winding down.
And with the city no longer taking over any additional buildings, advocates for low-income tenants fear that the consequences will be severe.
"The city cannot be allowed to tell the public that not vesting will be a benign action and will not have costs to the public," said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society, an nonprofit organization that assists the needy. "The collapse of the low-income rental market was the start of the homelessness crisis. There will be a price to pay downstream if saving money is the only goal and if great care is not taken with this plan."
Frank P. Braconi, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit research organization, said the city's moratorium on foreclosures had already worsened the condition of many buildings.
"When foreclosure is delayed," he said, "it makes it harder and harder for anyone -- the city or another owner -- to bring these buildings back."
It is impossible to say precisely how many buildings are on the brink of abandonment because of their owners' financial problems. But housing advocates assume that owners who are not paying their tax bills are not taking care of their buildings either. And tax records show that more owners are finding the going rough. The Community Service Society estimated that at the end of last year about 1,400 buildings were in serious tax arrears.
Moreover, city records show that the tax-delinquency rate for residential buildings has risen from a low of 1.8 percent in 1989 to 5.7 percent as of March.
In some buildings, like the Bronx apartment house at 1898 Harrison Avenue where Sonia Galarza lives, the city has addressed the neglect through court actions. The owner, the Harrison Tremont Realty Corporation, which owes more than $500,000 in taxes and fines, was so negligent that last year the city urged the Housing Court to let an independent administrator step in and run the building.
But things have not improved in the dangerously decaying building, Mrs. Galarza says. Rodents squeeze through holes in baseboards of her apartment, and the bathroom sink that was removed more than a year ago by the superintendent for repair has not been replaced.
"We keep hearing about the money the building is supposed to be getting to fix things up," said Mrs. Galarza, standing in the space where her sink used to be. "The only evidence we have seen has been in the new superintendent's apartment. It really looks nice now."
 
The Building
Doorman to Rats To Bankruptcy
 Life was not always so grim as it is now for tenants in the building at 343 St. Nicholas Avenue where Jyreain Privette lives. When, as newlyweds, she and her husband, James, moved into the building at 127th Street in the late 1940's, it boasted a marble lobby, a doorman and elevator attendants.
"It was so very nice here then," Mrs. Privette said. "The owners didn't live here, but one of them came by nearly every day."
The building started to lose its luster in the 1950's as crime and poverty began to take a toll on the neighborhood. Mrs. Privette recalls that luxuries like the doorman started to disappear in the 1950's. Repair jobs began to take longer and painting and polishing were less frequent. Soon the working men and women were outnumbered by families on welfare. In the 1980's, the owners started filling empty apartments with homeless families whose rents were paid by public funds.
"They took the city's money, but they didn't take care of the tenants," Mrs. Privette said. "Things started to get really bad."
Between 1985 and 1990, when speculation in Harlem was at its most feverish, a dizzying array of owners came and went. The paper value of the property soared, as the mortgage records reflect. In 1985, owners twice took loans against the property for $84,951 and for $110,000. The building took on an additional $105,000 in mortgage debt in 1987, a $754,033 mortgage was added in 1989 and still another for $1.2 million in 1990. So optimistic were investors that in late 1980's there were plans to convert the building to a co-op or a condominium.
By the time the current owner, Half Moon Real Estate, and its principal, Andonis Morfesis, took over in 1990, the mortgage debt was $2.8 million, records show. It is not known how much cash Half Moon or any of the previous investors put into the deal, but as little as 10 percent would not have been uncommon.
Officials say Mr. Morfesis is a notorious housing code scofflaw and owner of at least a dozen other troubled Harlem properties. The city's litigation against him for code violations dates to 1984. The motivation behind the purchase of such a troubled and mortgage-burdened building remains a mystery.
So far, no principals of Half Moon have been willing to discuss their ownership or problems in the building. But Claude Castro, their attorney, said the owners had been thwarted in efforts to maintain the building by tenants who waged a rent strike for three years.
By 1991, city housing officials were well aware of the problems at the building. But in 1993, with the city having chosen not to seize any more buildings, housing officials took Mr. Morfesis to court to force him to provide for his tenants. And when Mr. Morfesis tried to evict the rent-strikers, a Housing Court judge ruled that conditions were so badthat those who refused to pay rent were justified.
Five times since he took ownership, Mr. Morfesis has faced contempt charges for ignoring court orders to repair the building; the few repairs the building has received have come from the city, in response to emergencies like lack of heat or hot water, rat infestation and ceiling collapses. In that time, Mr. Morfesis has paid about $18,500 in penalties to the city while his debt to the city is up to more than $423,000.
"Ownership by people like Mr. Morfesis is a shell game where the ultimate losers are the tenants," said Raymond Brecia, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who has been assisting tenants with court cases against the owner. Mr. Brecia says that , unless the city intervenes in a more forceful manner, the building will slip beyond the point of being repairable.
"If that happens," Mr. Brecia asks, "where will tenants go? Some, I fear, will end up on the streets; others will end up in shelters."
Mrs. Privette said a low point in the building's decline came on a recent sweltering Saturday evening when an ambulance crew had to rescue frightened tenants stranded between floors in the broken elevator.
In recent weeks, the building seems to have gone from limbo to suspended animation. In June, the prospects for improvement became even more remote when Half Moon filed for bankruptcy on the property and a judge put it in a trustee's hands. This month the trustee filed a notice of abandonment. The reason cited: "The building has no value to the estate because of significant liens and other encumbrances, as well as the extremely poor condition of the building."

Dollar Moves Above 100 Yen As Japan's Discount Rate Is Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surpassed 100 yen yesterday for the first time since January after the Bank of Japan halved its discount rate and bought dollars for yen in Asian trading.
The dollar later retreated, settling in New York at 99.65 yen, up from 98.99 yen on Thursday. 
 Still, the rally yesterday left the dollar trading up against the yen on a year-to-date basis for the first time since early February. The dollar is now up nearly one-tenth of 1 percent against the yen since Jan. 1.
Since touching a low of 79.75 in intraday trading on April 19, the dollar has rebounded 25 percent against the yen.
Yesterday's surge came after the Bank of Japan cut its discount rate to half of 1 percent from 1 percent. Lower interest rates reduce investors' return on Japanese deposits, thereby making the yen less attractive.
The central bank then began an aggressive bout of dollar-buying that drove the dollar as high as 100.18 yen, its strongest since Jan. 23.
"B.O.J. intervention was pretty massive, estimated at up to $5 billion," said Jeffrey Yu, senior currency dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York. Some traders put the estimate lower, although all agreed that the central bank bought more aggressively than usual.
Against the German mark, the dollar rose as high as 1.4892 marks, its best showing since Aug. 24, when it touched 1.4962 marks. The dollar settled in New York at 1.4760 marks, down from 1.4787 marks on Thursday. The British pound edged up to $1.5515 from $1.5506.
Speculation that the United States would join Japan in a concerted round of dollar-buying rose after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin issued an unusual late-night statement half an hour after the Japanese rate cut, traders said.
Mr. Rubin praised Japan's move and said the United States would continue to cooperate closely in the foreign exchange market with the other leading industrialized nations.
But the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank did not join the Bank of Japan's intervention yesterday as they did on Aug. 15, traders said.
Although the dollar failed to hold above the 100-yen level, many traders said they were optimistic about its prospects in coming days.
"If we take out 100.40 yen, that might make the sub-100-yen dollar a thing of the past," said Steve Flanagan, currency trader at Credit Agricole in New York.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
The Bonus Holdup

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS 

 BODY:
YOU DON'T KNOW the meaning of anarchy until you've seen Wall Street at bonus time. As Labor Day recedes in the rearview mirror and Thanksgiving comes in sight, each firm creates a committee to decide the bonus for each employee while each employee tries in various ways to convince the committee that he is underpaid. The trick here has always been to point out the terrible injustice of the $685,000 you were paid last year without seeming either ridiculous or ungrateful. A rumor that you have received a big offer from a rival firm is helpful, so long as you aren't caught spreading it. It's treasonous to complain too loudly, but it's suicidal not to complain at all. The person who rises above the bonus fray is as Godforsaken as the man who stands back from the luggage conveyor belt at the Calcutta airport. He'll spend the rest of his life waiting for his bags to arrive. (Nice guy. Shame it happened to him.)

MY SPECIFIC MEMORY OF bonus time at Salomon Brothers is of an entire firm rumored to be leaving for Merrill Lynch unless they were paid the fortune they deserved. Around mid-October everyone became artfully disgruntled. That no one wanted to be thought to be poorly paid further complicated the ritual.
You might go into your meeting with the bonus committee disgruntled, but when you came out you were officially pleased (until 10 months later, when once again you became disgruntled). 
 But perhaps the strangest aspect of the bonus wars was that they existed independently of the firm's fortunes. Indeed, the worse the firm fared the more certain the employee that he was about to be gypped, and so the more he scrambled for what was rightfully his.
I recall wondering, after the first time I helped to rob the bank, why the shareholders did not revolt. After all, it was their money we were after. Why did they not march into the firm and say: "Each of you is replaceable. From now on you will be paid huge sums of money as a group only if you succeed as a group"?
NOW WE KNOW. LAST October Warren Buffett, Salomon Brothers' biggest shareholder, announced that the firm's employees would from then on live by the same rules as the employees of normal corporations. The Buffett rules meant that all but a few of the firm's 200 managing directors would be guaranteed a salary of $400,000, but they would receive a bonus only after the firm's profits reached a certain level.
"It is difficult to maintain the Wall Street Entitlement Program," Deryck Maughan, the firm's chairman and chief executive, declared, "where everyone gets paid a million dollars just for coming to work."
Buffett, the second-richest man in America (after Bill Gates), was conducting an experiment in collective living upon people who wanted his money at least as badly as he did. The conditions were ideal. The firm was about to announce a pretax loss of nearly $1 billion for 1994. How could any employee who had helped to rack up these fantastic losses demand a bonus?
EASILY, AS IT TURNS OUT. Within a few months 25 of the firm's managing directors had quit, and more were vanishing in the middle of the day on job interviews. (Most embarrassing headline in The New York Times: "A Salomon Managing Director Will Be Kansas Utility Executive.") One morning five investment bankers up and left for UBS Securities, taking with them a $2 billion corporate merger.
And so this past winter the Buffett rules were bent: a small pot of money was set aside for exceptional performers. More people left. And then a trader who had been made an exception to the new rules, and had been paid $30 million last year, was told, in effect, that the firm could no longer afford exceptions. He left, too. Standard & Poor's cited the mass exodus as a reason for lowering the company's credit rating.
Finally, in late June, the Buffett rules were scrapped. The first attempt to introduce into the modern Wall Street corporation the notion that the individual must sacrifice his short-term interests for the long-term good of the whole has been pronounced a disaster.
WARREN buffett once wittily wrote that he was looking for businessmen who learned their lessons from other people's mistakes rather than their own. In that spirit we proceed.

LESSON NO. 1: Only a fool would buy shares in a Wall Street firm. In good times the employees take a huge chunk of the profits; in bad times they not only refuse to give them back but take more.
LESSON NO. 2: The Wall Street labor market is now so perfectly fluid that a corporation on Wall Street is not so much a group striving to prosper together as a bunch of people who happen to work in the same building. The operative unit in modern finance is the individual -- another reason it makes little sense to invest in groups of financiers.
LESSON NO. 3: The first rule of American capitalism is that the capitalists live by different rules than everyone else. During the leveraged-buyout craze of the 1980's, investment bankers jetted around the country preaching to managers the need to own their firms, while the bankers themselves remained highly paid employees free of the risk of ownership.
Today the great trend in our economy is the drift of bargaining power from workers to owners. Even as corporate profits skyrocket, real wages remain stagnant. American corporations currently are thriving in part because they are able to cut workers out of their gains. By contrast, a Wall Street firm that has just lost $1 billion cannot even reduce bonuses without risking the loss of its entire work force.
LESSON NO. 4: As bonus day approaches, and it looks as if there might not be enough to go around, a feeling rises high in the chest of the Wall Street employee, similar in intensity to the feeling that rises in a bear when a day hiker strolls between her and her cubs. Bet on the bear.

EXHIBITIONS
September
 "LIGHT CONSTRUCTION" -- Designs by Jean Nouvel, Steven Holl and the Swiss team of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron are among the more than 30 subjects that illustrate what the curator Terence Riley describes as "an emerging sensibility in contemporary architecture," structures that shed their weight and emphasize transparency and translucency. Sept. 21-Jan. 2. Museum of Modern Art.
 
October
 "MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE" -- Organized by the Boston-based architects Rodolfo Machado and Rodolphe el-Khoury, this show features drawings, photographs and models of nine recent projects that share the qualities of simplicity and economy of form. Oct. 1-Feb. 11. Heinz Architectural Center, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh. (412-622-3131)
"HUDSON RIVER PARK" -- Five hundred acres of parkland and water, 13 recreation piers and an esplanade are featured in a new plan for a five-mile stretch of Manhattan's West Side waterfront. Prepared by Quennell Rothschild/Signe Nielsenn Associates and the Hudson River Conservancy, the plan is based on meetings and workshops with residents. Oct. 3-Dec. 2. Sponsored by the Municipal Art Society at the Urban Center.
"BEYOND THE BOX" -- Is New York ready for superstores? Can they help the city regenerate rusting industrial zones, or will they wreck local economies that are built on small shops and businesses? These issues will be raised by an exhibition of building designs and neighborhood plans. Oct. 11-Nov. 17. Urban Center.
"ARCHITECTS OF THE IMAGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE HEROIC AGE OF CONSTRUCTION" -- The photographer as architect: that's the premise of this show of 75 photographs of buildings under construction. While the finished buildings may not reveal the dynamic force of their engineering, photographs can capture and preserve the power of a structure going up. The exhibition includes work by Alfred Stieglitz, Berenice Abbott and Walker Evans. Oct. 11-Jan. 14. Canadian Center for Architecture, Montreal. (514-939-7026)
"THE PRAIRIE SCHOOL: DESIGN VISION FOR THE MIDWEST" -- Once you get past the dreary name and the oppressive, reform-school air of wholesome living, the work of the Prairie School offers a rich experience in the making of a distinctly American architectural space: horizontal, open, organic. Designs by Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright are featured. Oct. 14-Jan. 7. Art Institute of Chicago. (312-443-3600)
 
November
 "THE ARTS OF REFORM AND PERSUASION, 1885-1945" -- This show about the impact of modernity on architecture and design will inaugurate the new Wolfsonian Museum in Miami.

Nov. 16-March 10. Queens Museum of Art, New York City Bldg., Flushing Meadows Corona Park. (718-592-9700)
"WE WILL BE BACK: OKLAHOMA CITY REBUILDS" -- These days, demolished buildings seem to resonate with greater force than many new ones. In recent seasons, architecture shows have focused on vandalized inner-city buildings and the shelled buildings of Sarajevo. This exhibition examines the impact of the Oklahoma City bombing on residents and on the city's redevelopment plans. Nov. 17-March 17. National Building Museum, Washington. (202-272-2448)
"JEAN NOUVEL" -- The first United States show devoted to this leading French architect will feature a new site-specific project along with videos, models, drawings and photographs of his work. Nov. 18-Dec. 30. Storefront for Art and Architecture, 97 Kenmare St., SoHo. (431-5795)

Liberty Street Gallery, World Financial Center. (945-0505)
"WILD DESIGN: DESIGN FOR THE WILD" AND "LEBBEUS WOODS: THE SAN FRANCISCO PROJECT" -- The first show is a display of camping equipment and outdoor gear that explores of recent technology's adaptation to the challenge of surviving in nature. The second, gently related, is a series of drawings that explore the esthetic potentional of architecture designed to work with, rather than against, the seismic activity in the San Francisco Bay area. Dec. 16-Apr. 16. San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. (415-357-4000)
 
February
 "FRANKLIN D. ISRAEL" -- This show, a survey of work by the 50-year-old Los Angeles architect, promises to include "aroma" as one of the features of a special installation designed by Mr. Israel for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Feb. 4-May 26. (213-626-6222)
"LILY REICH: DESIGNER" -- Lily Reich was the professional collaborator and personal companion of Mies van der Rohe from the mid-1920's until the architect's immigration to the United States in 1938. Best known for her exhibition designs, Reich has been credited with influencing Mies's sense of color, materials and space. A small selection of her drawings, all from the Mies van der Rohe Archives, will form the nucleus of this show. Feb. 7-May 7. Museum of Modern Art.
 
BUILDINGS
September
 GEHRY COMMUNICATION AND TECHNOLOGY CENTER -- Yesterday, Los Angeles. Today, the world.

Opens in Bad Oeynhausen, Germany, on Friday.
 
October
 ARONOFF CENTER FOR ARTS -- If you took away the plazas at Lincoln Center and scrunched all the buildings together, the effect might be something like Cincinnati's new Aronoff Center for Arts, designed by Cesar Pelli & Associates. It will feature a 2,700-seat auditorium for dance and musical theater, along with smaller halls and galleries. Oct. 21.
SKIRBALL CULTURAL CENTER -- Designed by Moshe Safdie, this building will sponsor exhibitions, conferences and other programs that explore the American Jewish experience. Situated in Santa Monica Hills, Calif., the 125,000-square-foot building has been designed to accommodate the challenging terrain. The center's outdoor amphitheater has been designed as an earth buttress, while the museum wing forms a dam. Oct. 21.
THE NEUROSCIENCES BUILDING OF THE SCRIPPS INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY
This building, designed by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, should compensate somewhat for the controversial new addition to the best-known landmark in La Jolla, Calif., Louis Kahn's Salk Institute. The new Scripps building has been described as "a scientific monastery."
 
December

SOUTHERN REGIONAL LIBRARY, U.C.L.A.
Books go for heavy ground cover at the Southern Regional Library at U.C.L.A. A new addition by Frank Israel, in association with Leiden, Frost & Horowitz, the design of the Los Angeles library continues the architect's experiments in integrating architecture with landscape design.
 
April
 BUILDING FOR ART, ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI -- The heartland's love affair with the architectural agitator Peter Eisenman continues, with the opening of Mr. Eisenman's new building for the University of Cincinnati's department of art, architecture and planning. An auditorium, a library and a gallery are among the features of this sinous pastel reptile of an academic building.

September
 "THE ISLAND OF LOST SHOES" -- Even if Imelda isn't in the audience, she should be. Bloolips, the British troupe of high-heeled clowns, extends the season for summer camp with a musical about shipwrecked drag queens. The songs are by Ray Dobbins. Through Sept. 24. Performance Space 122. 
 "SEVEN GUITARS" -- Angels in Pittsburgh in 1948. August Wilson's requiem for a guitarist considers life, death, heaven and jazz in some of the most musical language being written today. This most recent of the Wilson chronicles of black America through the decades (first staged in Chicago by Walter Dallas) is now in the familiar hands of the director Lloyd Richards, Mr. Wilson's enduring collaborator. Scheduled for a March opening in New York, it is a Broadway rarity: a real, new play from a major American playwright. Through Oct. 8. Huntington Theater, Boston. (617-266-7900)
"THE AMERICAN CHESTNUT" -- A marriage between two American icons that simply had to be. The performance artist Karen Finley (of the N.E.A. Four) addresses the subject of Martha Stewart. Tues. to Sept. 17. A part of the Fall Festival at the American Repertory Theater, Boston. (617-547-8300)
"MACBETH" -- Take that, Macduff, ya big palooka! Stacy Keach, the classical actor and television gumshoe, puts up his dukes as the scheming Thane of Cawdor. Joe Dowling, always worth checking out (and the heir apparent at the Guthrie Theater) directs. Previews begin Tues. Opens Sept. 18. Shakespeare Theater, Washington. (202-393-2700)
"A DOLL'S HOUSE" -- That door just won't stop slamming. Grey Johnson directs Henrik Ibsen's tale of the little squirrel who roared. In previews. Opens Sept. 17. Pearl Theater, 80 St. Mark's Pl. (598-9802)
"COMPANY" -- An overdue revival of the musical that made the Me Decade sing. Vintage, sparkling, tart-tasting Sondheim from 1970, with a book by George Furth. Boyd Gaines, Kate Burton and the splendid Debra Monk are among those bringing life to Mr. Sondheim's articulately unhappy urbanites, who complain with peerless wit. Scott Ellis, who successfully resuscitated "She Loves Me," directs. Bet on an extended life in another Broadway house. In previews. Opens Sept. 28. Roundabout Theater Company.
"SIN" -- A new kind of voyeurism (looking at wickedness in San Francisco from a traffic reporter's helicopter), from Wendy MacLeod, a playwright who gave us a new kind of incest (it involved re-creating the Kennedy assassination) in last season's "House of Yes." A welcome return for the skewed at heart. Directed by David Petrarca. Previews begin Tues. Opens Oct. 11. Second Stage Theater.
"MOON OVER BUFFALO" -- Before she ruled prime time as America's Tarzan-yodeling sweetheart, Carol Burnett conquered Broadway as the shy but loud princess of "Once Upon a Mattress." More than 30 years later, she's here to reclaim the old turf in a backstage farce by Ken Ludwig ("Lend Me a Tenor"), with the sterling Philip Bosco. Tom Moore directs this likely hit with matinee audiences. Previews begin Wed. Opens Oct. 1. Martin Beck, 302 W. 45th St. (239-6200)
"THE EMPEROR JONES" -- Another long day's journey into deconstruction from the mixed- media maestros of downtown New York.

"FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO" and "A MOVIE STAR HAS TO STAR IN BLACK AND WHITE"
Finally, a forum in New York for one of the American theater's most original voices. Adrienne Kennedy's poetic one-acters on psychic strife and movie making (aren't they the same thing?) lead off a Kennedy season at the Signature Theater, which provided memorable showcases for unexplored Albee and Foote. Joseph Chaikin and Caroline Jackson Smith direct. Opens Sept. 22. At the Signature's temporary headquarters at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.
"GARDEN DISTRICT" -- Two one-act companion pieces from Tennessee Williams (who, after last season's "Rose Tattoo," is again flourishing in the city that spurned him), and the occasion for some appetizing casting: In "Suddenly, Last Summer," Elizabeth Ashley is Mrs. Venable, the mental-health expert only a dead son could love, directed by Harold Scott. And Myra Carter, the most formidable of Edward Albee's Tall Women, returns (hooray) in "Something Unspoken," directed by Theodore Mann. (Part of a season of American classics: "Holiday," "The Petrified Forest," "A Moon for the Misbegotten" and "Hughie," given star wattage by Al Pacino.) Previews begin Sept. 22. Opens Oct. 10. Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway. (239-6200)
"FULL GALLOP" -- Mary Louise Wilson bravely takes on the task of imitating the inimitable Diana Vreeland, the late high priestess of high style. The script, partly adapted from Vreeland's autobiography, is by Ms. Wilson and Mark Hampton. Nicholas Martin directs. Why don't you polish the soles of your shoes, as Mrs. Vreeland always did, before attending? Previews begin Sept. 26. Opens Oct. 17. Manhattan Theater Club, Stage II.
"ENDGAME (FIN DE PARTIE)" -- No, the rules haven't changed. But Samuel Beckett's mordant classic should be worth re-examining with the estimable Kathleen Chalfant as one of the players. With John Seitz. David Esbjornson, who does despair stylishly, directs. Previews begin Sept. 26. Opens Oct. 5. Classic Stage Company, 136 E. 13th St. (677-4210)
"MOONLIGHT" -- Well, there is certainly no longer pause than death, is there? Harold Pinter, the great master of the elliptical drama, interpreted by two fine American actors, Jason Robards and Blythe Danner, in this exploration of a terminally ill man and his family. Sure to be the season's hottest literary ticket. Karel Reisz, better known here for his film work ("Morgan," "Isadora") directs, and Kathleen Widdoes and Paul Hecht co-star. An auspicious opening for the new Laura Pels Theater at the Roundabout. Previews begin Sept. 27. Opens Oct. 17.
"DANGEROUS CORNER" -- Bourgeois facades, hidden romances and an unexplained suicide. Wasn't that what "An Inspector Calls" was about? A shorter work from the same author, J. B. Priestley, whose deconstructed "Inspector" was a surprise hit on Broadway. The question here is whether the director, one David Mamet, can make this one breathe without collapsing a building. Previews begin Sept. 30. Opens Oct. 12. Atlantic Theater Company, 336 W. 20th St. (239-6200)
 
October
 "POMP DUCK AND CIRCUMSTANCE" -- The highest single-ticket price of the season ($150), for three and a half hours of vaudeville and epicurean dining in a 1930's-style Belgian circus tent. Created by a chef, Hans-Peter Wodarz, this interactive, international and inflationary evening is appropriately destined for the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Its Manhattan setting, if you please, is DeWitt Clinton Park on 11th Ave. near 53d St., which should make for startling contrasts. Previews begin Oct. 2. Opens Oct. 11. (307-4100)
"VICTOR/VICTORIA" -- How many years have we been waiting for this one? At long last Julie Andrews (a k a Mrs. Blake Edwards), recreating the cross-dressing role she played in Mr. Edwards's 1982 film. Word from the road has been mixed, but who's going to pass up the chance to see Broadway's original fair lady? Tony Roberts plays the good-hearted, hammy homosexual (the Robert Preston part); with Michael Nouri and Rachel York. Music by the late Henry Mancini and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse. Previews begin Oct. 3. Opens Oct. 25. Marquis, 1535 Broadway, at 46th St. (307-4100)
"MOSCOW STATIONS" -- Down and out in Russia, where they really know from down. Still, this one-man account of a train trip through an angst and alcohol haze is said to be a true up, since Tom Courtenay plays the man. (The Brit crits were ecstatic.) Stephen Mulrine adapted Venedikt Yerofeev's novel. Previews begin Oct. 5. Opens Oct. 12. Union Square Theater, 100 E. 17th St. (505-0700)
"PATTI LUPONE ON BROADWAY" -- Silent no longer, the voice that didn't make it to New York's "Sunset Boulevard" is ready to shake the rafters. Even for non-LuPonites, this two-hour concert is worth attending for the privilege of seeing just how hysterical fans can become watching a Broadway diva with a dramatic professional past. Conceived and directed by Scott Wittman. Previews begin Oct. 5. Opens Oct. 12 for a six-week run. Walter Kerr, 219 W. 48th St. (239-6200)

Previews begin Oct. 5. Opens Oct. 29. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center.
"BUTTONS ON BROADWAY" -- As in Red Buttons, who definitely still knows how to hold a stage. A return engagement of this summer's exercise in stand-up nostalgia. Opens Oct. 5 at a theater to be announced.
"ALICE" -- Robert Wilson, a theatrical conceptualist who gives deep thoughts the cosmetic form of Vogue layouts, visits Wonderland, which is sure, at least, to look great. A stream-of-consciousness approach to a childhood classic. Tom Waits, who collaborated with Mr. Wilson on "The Black Rider," did the music; Paul Schmidt, the text. Oct. 6-14. Next Wave Festival, Brooklyn Academy of Music.
"SWINGING ON A STAR" -- This musical revue celebrates the songs of Johnny Burke -- Johnny who? -- at least some of whose words are undoubtedly stamped on your memory ("Misty," "Pennies From Heaven"). Michael Leeds wrote and directed this tribute to the prolific lyricist (whose collaborators included Jimmy Van Heusen and Erroll Garner), with choreography by Kathleen Marshall. Previews begin Oct. 6. Opens Oct. 22. Music Box, 239 W. 45th St. (239-6200)
"PICASSO AT THE LAPIN AGILE" -- Proof that being a playwright means never having to say "Excu-u-se me." The actor-author Steve Martin, who is sprouting Off Broadway like goldenrod, introduces Albert Einstein to Pablo Picasso in this "Travesties"-like fantasy set in the Paris of 1904. Directed by Randall Arney. Previews begin Oct. 6. Opens Oct. 22. Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th St. (239-6200)
"MRS. KLEIN" -- The rare presence of the actor's actor Uta Hagen (the original Martha of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") makes this production of Nicholas Wright's psychodrama something like the theater buff's equivalent of Halley's comet. Amy Wright and Laila Robbins co-star in this look at the contradictions in the life of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. William Carden directs. Previews begin Oct. 6. Opens Oct. 24. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher St. (239-6200)
"NIGHT JUST BEFORE THE FOREST" -- Paris when it drizzles is not lovable in this brooding drama of alienation set on one rainy night. From the European cult favorite Bernard-Marie Koltes, who died at 41 in 1989. Directed by Susan Einhorn. Opens Oct. 10. Ubu Repertory Theater, 15 W. 28th St. (679-7562)
"THE TEMPEST" -- As presented in Central Park, this Shakespeare Festival production was indeed such stuff as pure theater magic is made on. The question is how much a conventional indoor stage will ground George C. Wolfe's enchanted, high-flying take on Shakespeare's valedictory play. Patrick Stewart returns to recreate his charismatically fierce Prospero for Broadway. Previews begin Oct. 10. Broadhurst, 235 W. 44th St. (239-6200)
"HELLO, DOLLY!" -- Thirty-one years later, Carol Channing is still glowing, still crowing, etc., in a clock-stopping reprise of her 1964 triumph.

Opens Oct. 19 for a seven-week run that may be extended. Lunt-Fontanne, 205 W. 46th St. (307-4100)
"THREE PLAYS IN REP" -- Andrei Serban, who was detonating classics when "deconstruction" was still something a contractor did, takes on a heady trio of seldom-performed works from European masters: "Love, the Greatest Enchantment" by Calderon de la Barca, "The Golden Bird" by Carlo Gozzi and "La Dispute" by Pierre de Marivaux. In repertory. Oct. 11-22. La Mama Theater.
"THE MODEL APARTMENT" -- Yes, unhappy families are different, or play-going would be mighty redundant.

Primary Stages, 354 W. 45th St. (333-4052)
"NATHAN THE WISE" -- Searching for religious harmony in medieval Jerusalem in an 18th-century poetic drama that was, not surprisingly, banned by Hitler.

Opens Oct. 15. Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery. (677-0060)
"SALOME" -- Steven Berkoff meets Oscar Wilde at his wildest. The director will also be playing King Herod. Be prepared to go over the top -- way over. With music by Roger Doyle. Oct. 17-21. Next Wave Festival. Majestic Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Manhattan Theater Club, Stage I.
"RIFF RAFF" -- Hey, if Steve Martin can make the transition from screen acting to stage writing, why not Laurence Fishburne? The excellent actor sinks into the lower depths of lower New York to portray an uneasy friendship in the shadow of a disastrous drug heist. Mr. Fishburne directs in the maiden offering from the Circle Repertory Company in its first season under the artistic directorship of Austin Pendleton. Previews begin Oct. 18. Opens Nov. 1. Circle in the Square Downtown, 159 Bleecker St. (239-6200)
"BUSKER ALLEY" -- Once known as "Buskers," once known as "Stage Door Charley," this show with a troubled past asks how many lives a musical can have before Broadway. Tommy Tune has the lead (in, believe it or not, a role created by Charles Laughton) in this adaptation of the 1938 film "St. Martin's Lane." With Dulcie Roberts as a star aborning, and music and lyrics by Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman of "Mary Poppins" fame. The director and choreographer is Jeff Calhoun, although many hands are said to have stirred this pot. Previews begin Oct. 19. Opens Nov. 16. St. James, 246 W. 44th St. (239-6200)
"ROBBERS" -- Have you been missing Marshall W. Mason, former head of the Circle Repertory and a director of indisputable emotional depth? In New Haven, he is staging Lyle Kessler's look at how you tell the teller from the tale. Previews begin Oct. 20. Opens Oct. 25. Long Wharf Theater, Stage II, New Haven. (203-787-4282)

"VALLEY SONG" -- Life after apartheid, according to the playwright most able to address the subject, Athol Fugard, from whom the appearance of a new play is automatically an event. This one appropriately finds an old man and his granddaughter trying to reconcile the past with the future. Directed by Mr. Fugard. Oct. 24-Nov. 12. American premiere at the McCarter Theater, Princeton, N.J. (609-683-8000) Previews begin Nov. 28. Opens Dec. 12. Manhattan Theater Club, Stage II.
"SACRILEGE" -- It's a good year for actresses, a bad year for religious orthodoxy (see "Racing Demon"). Ellen Burstyn, who has spiritual glow to spare, stars in Diane Shaffer's tale of a radical feminist nun (no less) battling the Roman Catholic establishment. With John Forsythe and the compelling Giancarlo Esposito. Don Scardino ("A Few Good Men") directs. Previews begin Oct. 26. Opens Nov. 2. Belasco, 111 W. 44th St. (239-6200)
"MASTER CLASS" -- Callas in her twilight, from Terrence McNally, whose enthusiasm for the "Norma" of all times was already evidenced in "The Lisbon Traviata." Zoe Caldwell plays the diva assoluta, who transports star temperament from the stage to a music-school classroom in the 1960's. Audra MacDonald, the exciting Carrie in the recent "Carousel," plays one of her students. Leonard Foglia directs. Previews begin Oct. 26. Opens Nov. 5. Golden, 252 W. 45th St. (239-6200)
"BRING IN 'DA NOISE. BRING IN 'DA FUNK"
Why the beat goes on. An anatomy of the enduring rhythms behind tap, rap, be-bop and hip-hop from an auspicious trio: Savion Glover (the dancer), Reg E. Gaines (the oral poet) and George C. Wolfe (the director). Previews begin Oct. 27. Opens Nov. 15. Joseph Papp Public Theater.
"FOOL MOON" -- Mime that can charm even mime haters. David Shiner and Bill Irwin engage in a magical, wordless battle with the universe in a reprise of their popular 1993 show. With music by the Red Clay Ramblers. Previews begin Oct. 21. Opens Oct. 29. Ambassador, 219 W. 49th St. (239-6200)
 
November
 "RACING DEMON" -- David Hare, a playwright never averse to pulpit pounding, goes head to head with the Church of England in this polemical look at four clergymen. The unobtrusively excellent Richard Eyre, who first staged it for the National Theater, directs Brian Murray, Kathleen Chalfant and Michael Cumpsty. Will this provocative London hit translate for American ears? Don't discount the power of Anglophilia in New York. Previews begin Nov. 1. Opens Nov. 20. Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center.
"BLACK GIRL" -- J. E. Franklin's ground-breaking 1971 play about growing up in the ghetto would seem to be wedged in its time. But similar doubts were raised about the revival of Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls," triumphantly produced by the same theater in June and still running. Anderson Johnson directs for the New Federal Theater. Nov. 9-Dec. 3. Harry de Jur Playhouse, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand St. (598-0400)
"THE MONOGAMIST" -- A comedy to give hope to the unproduced, since this one actually made it out of a slush pile to the main stage of Playwrights Horizons. The 30-year-old author, Christopher Kyle, casts a precocious eye on midlife crises. Directed by Scott Elliott, who so admirably brought Mike Leigh's "Ecstasy" to life. Previews begin Oct. 13. Opens Nov. 6. Playwrights Horizons.
"I AIN'T YO' UNCLE: THE NEW JACK REVISIONIST UNCLE TOM'S CABIN" -- A play with a title that fully expresses its intentions. The slaves in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" wrest the novel from Harriet Beecher Stowe to tell the story their way. Reggie Montgomery directs Robert Alexander's inversion of the 19th-century classic. Previews begin Nov. 11. Opens Nov. 17. Hartford Stage. (203-527-5151)
"SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL" -- Richard Sheridan's prototypical Restoration comedy gets the treatment from the National Actors Theater, which has certainly tried its hands at most other genres in its erratic previous four seasons.

"WASP AND THE MAGIC TRICKS" -- More from Steve Martin, the season's most ubiquitous promising middle-aged playwright (see "Picasso at the Lapin Agile"). Here, one-acters about men versus women and white-bread ethnicity. Directed by Barry Edelstein, who ripped the stuffing out of "The Merchant of Venice" last season. Previews begin Nov. 28. Joseph Papp Public Theater.
 
December
 "THE DUCHESS OF MALFI" -- Politics, revenge and gallons of blood. John Webster's ultimate Jacobean potboiler seethes anew under the ever-inventive direction of Declan Donnellan for the Cheek by Jowl company (whose "As You Like It" was a high point of the last theater season). A must-see for the strong of stomach. Dec. 6-16. Next Wave Festival. Majestic Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music.
"THE FATHER" -- And you thought your family was dysfunctional. Strindberg in full misogynistic spleen, as interpreted by Robert Falls ("The Food Chain"). Frank Langella, who can storm with the best of them, is the paterfamilias under siege. Previews begin Dec. 13. Opens Jan. 4. Roundabout Theater Company.
"THE UNIVERSE" -- Richard Foreman, lord of New York's theatrical underground, concludes his trilogy about the mysteries of existence. While he is unlikely to solve them, he is likely to provide an invigorating slice of cerebral vaudeville. Previews begin Dec. 27. Ontological Hysteric Theater at St. Mark's Church, Second Ave. at 10th St. (420-1916)
"WONDERFUL TIME" -- Jonathan Marc Sherman, a produced playwright before he was 20 (with "Wallace and Women"), is probably the season's youngest old hand at 27. Here, the articulate author of "Sophistry" follows the course of an impetuous romance across America. WPA, 519 W. 23d St. (206-0523)
 
January
 "MOLLY SWEENEY" -- Brian Friel's exquisite series of monologues about the imponderable realm of the senses comes to New York via Dublin and London. Jason Robards, fresh from his duties in "Moonlight," also stars here with the radiant Catherine Byrne ("Dancing at Lughnasa") in the title role. The season's best bet for sentimental goose bumps. Mr. Friel directs. Previews begin Jan. 3. Laura Pels Theater at the Roundabout.
"TRUE CRIMES" -- Romulus Linney, a playwright for whom evil is never far away, finds it anew in the Smoky Mountains in this anatomy of a rural murder. Directed by the author. Jan. 11-Feb. 4. Theater for the New City, 155 First Ave., at 10th St. (254-1109)
"BED AND SOFA: A SILENT MOVIE OPERA"
The subject belongs to the past, but the musical is new, so who's complaining? Polly Pen, a composer with an elegantly brooding voice, wrote the music and Laurence Klavan the libretto for this adaptation of a 1920's Russian film. Andre Ernotte directs. Jan. 11-Feb. 11.Vineyard, 108 E. 15th St. (353-3874)
"MATA HARI" -- A musical whose very name became synonymous with "turkey." This doomed tale of the spy who loved too much opens itself up for reappraisal. Edward Thomas wrote the score, with a book by Jerome Coopersmith and lyrics by Martin Charnin, who also directs. Previews begin Jan. 12. Opens Jan. 17. York Theater Company, St. Peter's Church, Citicorp Center, 54th St. and Lexington Ave. (935-5820)
"BLUE WINDOW" -- Alone in a crowd once again: the before and after of a New York cocktail party that introduced the melancholy whimsy of Craig Lucas to New York audiences. The worthy Joe Mantello ("Love! Valour! Compassion!") directs the revival of this 1984 play. Previews begin Jan. 16. Opens Feb. 6. Manhattan Theater Club, Stage I.
"RENT" -- "La Boheme," set in the East Village of today. Cool, huh? Jonathan Larson's musical, a hit in workshop incarnations, is presold to a cult audience. Directed by Michael Greif, who is never predictable. Previews begin Jan. 19. Opens Feb. 6. New York Theater Workshop, 79 E. 4th St. (460-5475)
"SPOKE MAN" -- The view from a wheelchair, courtesy of John Hockenberry, a journalist of coruscating eloquence and humor, in a one-man show. Opens Jan. 24. American Place Theater, 111 W. 46th St. (840-3074)
"A FAIR COUNTRY" -- Jon Robin Baitz, the American theater's favorite angry young man of the moment, goes back to South Africa, a country he grilled to a crisp in "The Film Society" (1989), with this study of a diplomatic family undone. An eagerly awaited return from one of the most lionized playwrights of his generation. Daniel Sullivan directs. Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center.
 
February
 "FLOTSAM" -- Oh, those wacky East Villagers! The season's second musical in which downtown's hedonists jive to the rhythms of life. The quirkily talented Michael John La Chiusa ("Hello Again") adapts stories by the quirkily talented Deborah Eisenberg. Previews begin Feb. 13. Second Stage.
 
March
 "WORKING TITLE" -- A big-time screenwriter commits the unspeakable Hollywood sin of breaking his formula for success. By the wonderfully strange screenwriter Andrew Bergman ("The Freshman"), who should know about such things. Directed by Max Mayer. Previews begin March 2. American Jewish Theater, 307 W. 26th St. (633-9797)
"A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM" -- You may as well get used to seeing it once a year. This version comes from Adrian Noble and the Royal Shakespeare Company and is said to be truly dreamy. How often, in this day, does Shakespeare make it to Broadway twice in one season? Previews begin March 19. Nederlander, 208 W. 41st St. (921-8000)
"THE YOUNG MAN FROM ATLANTA" -- This year's Pulitzer Prize winner, Horton Foote's compassionate study of an aging couple and the dead son they never really knew, returns to Manhattan in glory, with Ralph Waite and Carlin Glynn in the roles they created last season for the Signature Theater Company. Peter Masterson directs still another example of the season's happiest trend: substantial dramas in Broadway theaters. Previews begin March 29 at a theater to be announced.
"THE KING AND I" -- Rodgers and Hammerstein with a high sugar content. But getting to know Donna Murphy, who provided the passion in "Passion," as the "I" of the title should be a treat, as should Jerome Robbins's original choreography. Christopher Renshaw directs, with additional musical staging by Lar Lubovitch. The crucial X factor, his imperious majesty, has yet to be announced.Previews begin mid-March. Neil Simon, 250 W. 52d St. (307-4100)
"WAITING FOR GODOT" -- Estragon and Vladimir's excellent adventure in Yiddish. Part of the 80th-anniversary season of the Folksbiene Playhouse, 123 E. 55th St. (755-2231)
 
April
 "UNDER THE SKIN" -- Corporate attorney meets homeless suspected serial killer. Wasn't that a movie of the week? Susan Yankowitz's drama is, however, being directed by the less than orthodox Melissa Bensussen. Previews begin April 2. Opens April 9. Women's Project at Theater Row Theater, 412 W. 42d St. (765-1706)
"THE SHAWL" -- This is the one everyone swooned for when it was first produced in Sag Harbor, L.I., two seasons back. Cynthia Ozick's drama about memory and the Holocaust comes to New York with its original director (Sidney Lumet) and at least one of its original stars (the delectable Dianne Wiest). April 13-May 5. Jewish Repertory Theater, Playhouse 91, 316 E. 91st St. (831-2000)
"VENUS" -- Suzan-Lori Parks ("The America Play") finds a mirror for colonization and its discontents in the life of Saartjie Baartman, an African who toured Europe as "the Hottentot Venus" in the 19th century. Richard Foreman, who, like Ms. Parks, is stronger on imagination than clarity, directs. Don't be surprised if you leave scratching your head. A co-production with the Yale Repertory Theater. Previews begin April 16. Joseph Papp Public Theater.
"ARTS AND LEISURE" -- A largely unloved species is put under the microscope in this story of a drama critic in an advanced state of existential nausea. The writer and the director, Steve Tesich and JoAnne Akalaitis, have every reason to enjoy his predicament. Previews begin April 26. Opens May 19. Playwrights Horizons.
"THE CHANG FRAGMENTS" -- The lie of the melting pot, as manifested in the experiences of one Asian-American family. From the pen of the often insightful Hang Ong. Previews begin April 30. Joseph Papp Public Theater.
"A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM" -- This latest instance of revival mania has two very strong things going for it: its director, Jerry Zaks, and its star, Nathan Lane, who know just how to find a punchy immediacy in well-ridden war horses. (Remember the bliss that was "Guys and Dolls" several years ago?) And for all its leers and nudges, this farce, set in dirty old Rome, from Burt Shevelove, Larry Gelbart and Stephen Sondheim, has a vaudevillian zest that doesn't die. Pretty close to a sure thing. Broadway house to be announced.
"THE SKRIKER" -- A welcome new offering from Caryl Churchill, a truly major playwright who has been too long from these shores. Here, she shuttles between contemporary England and a creepy, mythological underworld ruled by the shape-changing creature of the title. Mark Wing-Davey, who memorably directed Ms. Churchill's "Mad Forest," gets a chance to redeem himself for this summer's unfortunate "Troilus and Cressida." Joseph Papp Public Theater.
"BIG" -- What's this? An honest-to-goodness new musical on Broadway? Hopes are high for this adaptation of the Tom Hanks movie, though much rides on the choice of the lead, which is yet to be announced. Mike Ockrent, who brought enjoyable flash to "Crazy for You," directs. Book by John Weidman; lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr.; music by David Shire. Shubert, 225 W. 44th St. (239-6200)

HEADLINE: THE MAN INSIDE BILL CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY

 BODY:
It has been clear for some time that America under this Administration has no coherent foreign policy. Jason DeParle's article on Anthony Lake helped me to understand how this could be so. Until I read it I thought that only Batman spent his time actively working to combat "evil" in the world.
Lake is going about in search of monsters to destroy. All in the name of destroying evil so long as it is not too strong, the combat will insure media coverage, and any combat will not test our staying power. This is a good and noble goal for an idealist, but it is not a foreign policy. Certainly it is not a foreign policy for a nation whose vital interests face no all-threatening enemy anywhere in the world, who is a net debtor in the world economy and whose industrial and military strengths on a relative scale are far below what they were in the 1940's. 
 DeParle's article indicates that Lake's desires and demeanor have created his lack of recognition despite his high position. Could it also be that someone recognizes how difficult it would be to defend his positions on national security should they become better known?

Increases In Co-op Rents

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
MILDRED FINKLE is incensed about the hardship rent increase she has been ordered to pay on the five-room Manhattan apartment she has lived in for the last 20 years. And while countless other tenants living in rent-regulated apartments have undoubtedly expressed similar sentiments about rent increases, Mrs. Finkle's situation is a bit different.
As a rent-stabilized tenant in a co-op, Mrs. Finkle has been almost immune to hardship rent increases. That immunity -- shared by thousands of other rent-regulated tenants living in unsold co-op apartments -- emanates from the Department of Housing and Community Renewal's steadfast refusal to grant hardship increases to owners of unsold shares in a co-op. 
 Such owners are usually the original sponsors who converted buildings from rental into co-op status; with the real-estate problems of recent years, however, financial institutions, private investors and co-op boards are sometimes owners of unsold shares.
The virtual immunity to hardship rent increases enjoyed by rent-stabilized tenants living in such apartments changed last month, though, when the agency issued a final ruling on a hardship increase it granted last year to the owner of 76 apartments in the building at 203-205 East 72d Street where Mrs. Finkle lives.
The increase, which is retroactive to 1987 and will cost some tenants thousands of dollars, has evoked a wide range of reaction in the real estate community. Tenant advocates, stung by the decision, say it is yet another example of landlords profiteering on the backs of renters. Co-op experts, concerned about it, say the decision can cut both ways, either hurting or helping co-ops depending on the circumstances. Other real estate experts, nonplused by the ruling, say it is an anomaly that will have little or no long-lasting effect.
"This is a significant decision," said Jeffrey Turkel, a lawyer with Rosenberg & Estis, the Manhattan law firm that represented the applicant in the proceedings before the agency. "It means that if you are the holder of unsold shares to a rent-stabilized apartment, and you're losing money on a monthly basis, you can apply for a hardship increase and possibly eliminate a negative cash flow and get into the positive."
The ruling is the result of a decadelong effort by the owner of 76 rent-stabilized apartments in the 150-unit building that was converted to a co-op in 1979, to obtain a comparative hardship rent increase on the rent-regulated apartments. After several denials by the housing agency and a series of court battles, the applicant's estate -- the original applicant, Peter Sharp, died in 1992 -- was ultimately awarded a $5.54 per-room per-month hardship increase last October. The ruling on the increase, which was retroactive to June 1, 1987, was appealed by the tenants. On Aug. 23, however, the agency declared the ruling final and ordered payment of both the prospective increase and the retroactive amounts due.
"This is an outrageous decision," said Michael McKee, director of development of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, which is in Manhattan. "What they're doing is allowing sponsors to first profit off the conversion and then make additional profits by squeezing the nonpurchasing tenants."
Mr. McKee said that law allowing hardship increases should not be extended to owners of shares in a co-op. "A legitimate hardship situation should apply to a hard-working landlord who owns a rental building and who is in a hardship situation through no fault of his own," he said.
Original sponsors, he said, are not in that situation. "All kinds of calculations go into a conversion," he said. "And one thing that is always included in the equation is the fact that the sponsor is going to end up owning apartments that are not sold."
As a result, Mr. McKee said, any hardship experienced by an original sponsor -- and for that matter, anyone who acquires unsold shares from an original sponsor -- is a self-imposed hardship. The recent ruling, he said, allows sponsors to recoup their bad investments from their tenants.
Robert Katz, counsel to the Queens League of Tenants in Rego Park, agreed, adding his concern that hardship increases would also be granted to owners who are not original sponsors. "We're afraid that now, anybody who buys three or four apartments in a co-op and claims a hardship will get one," Mr. Katz said. "This decision flags some very dangerous and very vulnerable areas for abuse of the rent laws."
Co-op experts take a different view of the decision.
"It's a double-edged sword," said Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives.
On the one hand, Mr. Saft said, the ruling could help co-ops that have taken back large blocks of unsold shares from sponsors. Many such buildings, he said, are now absorbing significant monthly shortfalls resulting from the difference between the maintenance fees due on unsold apartments and the stabilized rents the occupants are paying. The ruling, he said, might allow such co-ops to eliminate some of that shortfall.
On the other hand, he said, the ruling could exacerbate an existing problem in buildings with a many unsold apartments in the hands of original sponsors or investors.
"One of the biggest problems we've seen in the last few years are sponsors selling 25 or 30 percent of their units and then refusing to convert any more," he said, adding that in many buildings, sponsors or investors were holding unsold units until the original tenant moved out and then renting the apartments out at market rates.
"The people who bought in the building are then unable to sell or get refinancing because a majority of the building is still rental," Mr. Saft said. A hardship increase, he said, may make it even easier for sponsors or investors to hold on to unsold units until the regulated tenant moves out, or may even encourage the tenant to move out sooner, leaving the owner with a lucrative deregulated apartment.
As a result, Mr. Saft said, "the ruling cuts both ways so you have to analyze each situation individually."
Arthur Zabarkes, the director of the real estate institute at New York University, said that concerns about the impact of the ruling were probably exaggerated. "I believe it will be irrelevant," Mr. Zabarkes said, "because a comparative hardship increase is virtually impossible to get."
Mr. Zabarkes, who worked for the owner of 203-205 East 72d Street and shepherded the hardship application through the housing agency, said that it was extraordinarily difficult for an owner to accumulate the documentation necessary for a comparative hardship.
At least six years of records are necessary, he said, so that the agency can compare the required "three-year base period" ( usually the first three years of ownership) with a "three-year test period" (the most recent three-year period) to determine whether the owner is losing money. "Even though we broke ground on a lot of this," he said, "it's still enormously time-consuming and difficult and expensive."
Nevertheless, most experts interviewed for this article said they expected a significant number of hardship applications to be filed.
Still, even successful applicants will ultimately have to deal with tenants like Mrs. Finkle.
"They say I owe them $3,887," Mrs. Finkle said. "Well, let me tell you something: they'll whistle Dixie a long time before I pay that."

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

Paying Interest On Interest
 
Q What is meant by negative amortization? Under what types of purchase money formats will it occur? . . . Erica W. Potts, Manhattan.
 
A Edward T. Braverman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that a negative amortization mortgage is one on which the required monthly payment is less than what would normally result from the actual interest rate being charged. The difference is added to the loan, thereby increasing the principal balance by the amount of unpaid interest, until a predetermined ceiling has been reached. 
 "In effect," Mr. Braverman said, "the borrower is paying interest on interest."
A negative amortization mortgage can be either a fixed-rate or an adjustable-rate mortgage, he said.
With fixed-rate negative amortization mortgages, Mr. Braverman said, the mortgage payments increase over the life of the loan. As a result, he said, the early payments are set at an amount that is less than what the fixed rate would require and the later payments are set at an amount that is higher, eventually amortizing the entire loan.
With adjustable-rate negative amortization mortgages, Mr. Braverman said, although the interest rate is changed periodically, the monthly payment is kept constant and usually below the interest that would otherwise be charged. The difference between what was actually paid and what should have been paid is then added to the principal balance of the loan.
In either case, Mr. Braverman said, such mortgages should be approached with caution.
"It is a product by which lenders entice buyers into the mortgage market at a time when high interest rates might otherwise prevent a buyer from qualifying for a loan," he said.
 
Who Can Own Co-op Shares
 
Q Are individuals the only ones who can own shares in a co-op? Or can other entities such as corporations and limited partnerships also own shares? . . . Mike Lichtman, Manhattan.
 
A Marc J. Luxemburg, president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said that before 1986, Federal tax laws allowed owners of co-ops to take homeowner deductions on their tax returns only if the shares were owned by "individuals," meaning human beings. Accordingly, he said, virtually all co-ops prohibited corporations, partnerships and trusts from owning shares.
In 1986, however, the tax laws were amended to allow co-op owners to claim homeowner deductions if the owner was a "person," a term that for tax purposes includes "legal entities" such as corporations, partnerships and trusts, as well as human beings.
Notwithstanding that change, Mr. Luxemburg said, most co-ops continue to prohibit "legal entities" from owning shares.
"A cooperative is designed to be an owner-occupied residence," Mr. Luxemburg said. "And by definition, a 'legal entity' cannot physically occupy an apartment as its home."
Co-ops, Mr. Luxemberg said, are not intended to be vehicles for tax, business or estate planning -- they are intended to be cooperatively managed residences for shareholders. Accordingly, he said, most co-ops continue to require that apartments only be owned by individuals.

HEADLINE: Islander, Insurer and Business Maverick

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
THREE three decades ago, Robert S. Weiss of Stamford saw a little ad in the Sunday newspaper. An island in Connecticut was for sale and he was intrigued. He had spent more than four years in the Navy during the Korean conflict, part of that as the captain of a small landing craft, and thought an island would be delightful to have as a refuge from the trials of his fledgling insurance agency.
"I thought it might be be one of the Thimble Islands" south of Branford in Long Island Sound, he says today. He was far off course. The water wasn't even salt. 
 The island was well inland, in Lake Pocotopaug, in the town of East Hampton in eastern Connecticut, sort of a frontier for someone who had grown up in Fairfield County. It was an area so unfamiliar he had to look it up on a map.
As he tells the story, he decided to check the island anyway, piled his wife and three young children in the car over the weekend and drove to East Hampton. He discovered that the five-acre island contained an abandoned Boy Scout camp that was overgrown and pretty much of a mess. The asking price was $150,000.
He decided to make an offer of $25,000 which surely no one would take seriously. Indeed, the offer was greeted by the agent with derision. Mr. Weiss answered that the agent was obligated to at least present the offer to the owners.
Shortly, he said, he heard directly from the Boy Scout council that owned the island. It would take the $25,000. "It was such a suprise," he said, "my wife thought the island might be sinking."
It wasn't, but there was a problem. "I had no money," Mr. Weiss said, and bank after bank looked askance. "They said they didn't give mortgages on abandoned islands."
Finally, he struck pay dirt. The head of Middletown Savings Bank agreed to give him a mortgage of $15,000, which left him only $10,000 short of island buying. He pressed on, returning to the Boy Scout council with a new proposition: that it put up a $10,000 second mortgage on the property. The council agreed. Now he was rolling.
He went back to the Middletown Savings with a new proposition. How about adding a construction mortgage so he could build some rental cottages on the island? The bank said it would finance one cottage and when it was built and rentable, would finance another.
What Mr. Weiss had done was buy an island for no money down at all, with financing to build on it. And over several years, he did. "My kids were told that when we went to the island it was work first and then play," he said. The island was cleared of brush and debris, five rental cottages were erected, and the scout camp's 40- by 80-foot mess hall was converted into a retreat for the Weiss family, with a main room big enough to hold a dance.
To have a base for working on the island, Mr. Weiss bought a tiny cottage on the lakeshore, eventually replacing it with a showplace year-round home, complete with a putting green leading to the water. The putting green is strictly for guests because he has never played golf. He considers that a waste of time.
He seldom wastes time, believing explicitly in the work ethic and that if you really want something it is within reach.
His insurance company is the leading current example of that credo.
Five years ago, in 1990, Mr. Weiss created Connecticut Life and Casualty, the state's first chartered insurance company in more than a century. And he did it at what certainly looked like one of the worst possible times.
The state's insurance industry was in disarray, a condition that has continued since. In Hartford, a city that touts itself as the insurance capital of the world, layoffs became the rule Takeovers and mergers with out-of-staters obscured mainstays like Travelers and Phoenix mutual.
Into this economic stew Mr. Weiss launched Connecticut Life and Casualty, with headquarters in one of the state's more depressed small cities, Meriden.
As Robert Weiss tells it, the secret has been hard work and a zest for competition, things the big insurance companies have not been noted for.
More than half of the insurance sold in the state is sold by independent agents and this implies a good competitive market, he explains. But it isn't competitive, he charges -- the giant insurance companies buy the loyalty of "independent" agents by paying them high commissions, costs that are passed right on to consumers.
Mr. Weiss should know, having run an agency in Stamford for many years, during which time he became progressively disenchanted, and a vocal critic of the way the insurance industry conducted itself.
Particularly, he said, he found the "agents of record" practice odious. This comes into play when one agent sells liability insurance for a town or city, becoming the municipality's agent of record. The agent then feeds off some of the profit to other casualty and property agents in the area.
In Stamford, Mr. Weiss said, "The first time I got a check for $65, then the next year it was more than twice that. I felt it was money for nothing and I sent it back. Then The Stamford Advocate ran a story about the system and said that more than 100 Stamford agents got money from the agent of record. I called them up and said, 'Not me,' and they ran a correction."
What bothered him even more, he said, was that no matter how badly insurance companies were run they could do no wrong.
"If their investments went bad, they just raised their rates to consumers," he said. "If someone had a good driving record, or if someone made sure the house was safe, it made no difference. The rates went up. And there was no competition. The rates all went up at once. What other industry could do this?" It was not really a question.
For years, he said, he had been bothering an old friend, an investment banker in Stamford, with his dismal views of the insurance companies and one day the friend responded with a suggestion: "Why don't you start your own insurance business?' "
So he did. He went to the state's Insurance Commissioner in 1989, to discover that he was the first person to apply for an insurance charter in 103 years.
In 1990, armed with his charter and $2 million in financing from Fleet Bank, he divested himself of his Stamford operation, opened Connecticut Life and Casualty offices in the old International Silver Company building off Route 5 in Meriden and moved to the house with the putting green in East Hampton. The pontoon-boat ride to his island takes less than five minutes.
His is not a traditional insurance company by any means. Mostly it sells its policies over the phone. Then, in an effort to get to know the objects of its insurance -- and cut back on losses -- it sends its inspectors to look over the houses and cars the company is asked to insure.
"When was the last time someone from an insurance company actually showed up to see your house or car?" Mr. Weiss asks.
The inspections, in fact, do startle some people. "A few wives have asked if we could put some job down on the list required for insurance that their husbands have been promising to do but never get around to doing. The first time it happened, I thought someone was kidding."
But overall, he said, customers, "tell us they're grateful when we find deficiences such as leaks in a furnace that could be life threatening."
Today Mr. Weiss is responsible for a weekly payroll of 125 people, including some working in a health care plan, Connecticut HealthPlan, that he he has also started up at his Meriden headquarters. From the start, Connecticut Life and Casualty has aimed at "the middle of the market" in casualty insurance, he said. "We are not looking for the high-priced home but for moderate home owners. And we don't skim."
Skimming, in insurance parlance, means taking only low-risk business. "We underwrite people," Mr. Weiss insists. "People want safe homes and we show them how to make their homes safe. If they meet our qualifications, we give them the lowest insurance rates in the state and then hold the rates there."
And, he added, it did not take a financial genius to work out the system. "If a dummy like me can do it, something's wrong with the industry."
He admits that he is not on exactly friendly terms with other officials in the industry and has complained about being badmouthed by some.
Competitors, he said, have told prospective clients that he is underfinanced, which he denies, and that his company does not have a good rating. The latter charge was particularly insidious, he said, because insurance companies are not rated for their first five years.
When Connecticut Life and Casualty was rated for the first time this year, by A.M. Best, it received a B++, or very good.
Of the other insurers, he says: "I don't go to dinner parties wih them." In fact, in an industry known for its multitude of organizations and associations, he belongs to none. "I'm not interested in joining."
This year, for the first time, a state insurance commissioner, George M. Reider Jr., is holding regular public forums around the state so consumers can criticize insurance company policies and make suggestions for change.
Robert Weiss, business maverick, is all for that.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Government Leases;
When Albany Pulls the Plug on the Rent

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
TRINITY REAL ESTATE and a state agency were pretty close to closing a deal for what Walter F. Spardel, Trinity's managing director, calls a "substantial amount of space" at 345 Hudson Street, near King Street. Yes, the state was insisting on the standard executory clause that allows governments to break a lease without penalty if the tenant agency loses its financing. But with no state bankruptcy looming, that seemed pretty remote, so Trinity settled for a modicum of added financial protection if the lease is broken.
But that was before the state lowered the boom on 315 Park Avenue South, the 24th Street building that for two decades has been home to the State University of New York's College of Optometry. This summer the state Legislature passed a bill that ends financing for the rent next July, eight years before the lease expires. Now Mr. Spardel is holding out for wording that says that, if the state ends its lease, Trinity will be reimbursed for any unamortized portion of brokerage commissions and costs of customizing the space. 
 "At best, this will add 30 or 60 days to our negotiations," Mr. Spardel said. "But without this protection, this deal will not go through."
The state's short-term motives are clear. It wants to move the optometry school to 33 West 42d Street, which the state owns. That, in turn, would make it fiscally feasible for the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, that building's sole tenant, to move to condominium space at 371 Fifth Avenue, the former B. Altman building at 34th Street.
The moves will save the state some $7 million a year in rent at 315 Park. But landlords and brokers caution that they will bring some costly problems of their own.
"I wonder if the state factored in litigation costs when it figured what it was saving," said Michael T. Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate, who is certain the owners of 315 Park will sue. "And it has jeopardized its off-balance-sheet financing, since every landlord will be reluctant to lay out money to improve state space now."
In fact, some realtors wonder whether it makes sense to rent to the state at all. "State agencies bring a lot of traffic to a building, and rarely turn out to be upscale tenants that really improve the property," said Bruce Mosler, vice chairman of the Galbreath Company. "Now they've made themselves even more undesirable."
Indeed, across the city, landlords who had welcomed government tenants for their seeming stability are thinking twice about the terms under which they will let them in. They say they always trusted the state to invoke the executory clause only if an agency itself lost its funding, not just because they did not like paying above-market rents. Now, they say, that trust is gone.
"It is a really shortsighted, bad decision for the state to cancel that lease," said Douglas Durst, president of the Durst Organization. "Now we wouldn't rent to a state agency without making sure the provisions for cancellation were ironclad, that technical loopholes were closed as tightly as possible. And we certainly wouldn't give them a big contribution to work now."
EVEN less adamant landlords are less enthusiastic about state tenants now. "You still get a great tenant who you know will be able to pay its rent," said Arthur L. Bocchi, a vice president at Sumitomo Realty who handles leasing at 666 Fifth Avenue, at 52d Street. "But now we'd fight for specific language that says that, if the agency is still in existence, the state can't invoke the right to terminate."
The negative impact on the state economy may extend well beyond its ability to strike real estate deals, said Larry Silverstein, a prominent New York owner who still hopes the state will reconsider its actions.
"This affects the credibility of the state as a place in which to do business as well as an entity with whom to do business," he said. "It can cause businesses to question the merit of coming here or of staying here."
The budding landlord revolt provides cold comfort to Stephen M. Mullins, a general partner in a Chicago group that owns 315 Park Avenue South. The optometry school occupied 70 percent of his 300,000-square-foot building, and its lease was the collateral for its financing.
The state, he says, is paying an annual rent of more than $35 a square foot, rising to $40 before its lease ran out. In this market, he doubts he could get $25 a square foot for the space. And bringing in a new tenant would mean paying new brokerage commissions, as well as $30 or $40 a foot to customize the space. In this situation, Mr. Mullins said, he could be forced to put the building into bankruptcy. "If our lenders don't cooperate, we could lose the building," he said.
Mr. Mullins says that, in the past, he offered to reduce the rent substantially if the state signed a 50-year lease. And he is still willing to sell the state the space as a condominium. He also retains hope that the state will find another agency or department to put into the space for the rest of the lease. But if that does not happen, Mr. Mullins says, he will sue.
State officials say they do not understand what the hoopla is about. While he could not cite a specific incident, Kenneth Goldfarb, a State University spokesman, said that "the executory clause is in all state contracts, and it has been enforced in the past."
Edward C. Sullivan, a state assemblyman who sponsored the definancing bill, insists that the state "researched the lease" thoroughly, and is within its rights in terminating. "Both the optometry school and the Graduate Center need to expand, and this way we are saving money in the process," he said. "The ultimate beneficiaries are the taxpayers of New York."
Not surprisingly, few New York realtors agree with that stance. Several landlords, including Mr. Mullins, say that politics, not economics, guided the state. "The benefactors of this whole deal are the owners of the B. Altman building, and they are highly politically connected," Mr. Mullins said.
In fact, numerous landlords suggest that it was such political clout that kept the Real Estate Board of New York from staging a loud protest on Mr. Mullins's behalf. While Steven Spinola, the board's president, says that is not true, he does say that the Altman building's importance to the city's economy colored his thinking as well as the state's.
"We are not happy with what took place, but my conversations with the state give me confidence that this is a unique situation, not the beginning of a trend towards ending leases prematurely," Mr. Spinola said. "Without this project, we would have had a major white elephant in the middle of 34th Street, the part that really connects the East Side to the West Side."
THAT, of course, is the stance that Peter L. Malkin, the Altman building's general partner, is taking. "The idea that no one wants to offend me is flattering, but it certainly has no basis in fact," he said.
Mr. Malkin also said that executory clauses were exercised to save rent money far more often than most landlords wanted to believe. In fact, he said he got skewered once, too. About five years ago, he says, Congress de-authorized financing to the United Nations for several condominiums it was renting from Mr. Malkin, leaving him with lots of empty residential space in a depressed market. "We'd bought the apartments subject to long-term leases to the U.S. Government figuring, what could be more secure than that?" he recalled.
Whether they engineered the musical space chairs or not, Mr. Malkin and his partners clearly are the major beneficiaries of the state's actions. They have turned the vacant Altman building into a government condominium. The state has bought 110,000 square feet of space for Oxford University Press, and another 213,000 square feet for the New York Public Library's Science, Industry and Business Library. The Graduate Center is scheduled to go into the building's remaining 375,000 square feet.
All the sour notes have not ruined the optometry school's sweet feeling about its impending move. The Legislature has authorized up to $17 million to equip 33 West 42d Street with a diagnostic and treatment center, wet and dry labs, a small-animal facility, all things the Graduate Center never needed. And the building already has a 260-seat auditorium and a big board room suitable for conferences and receptions as well as a broadcast studio, now used by City University broadcasting, that the school hopes to use for "distance education," or broadcasting courses over the airwaves.
"These facilities are real gems," said Dr. Alden N. Haffner, the school's president. "They far exceed what we have now."

HEADLINE: Time Shares: New Players Seek to Create A New Image

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
BRUCE HESSE is knowledgeable about money matters. He is a certified public accountant and a finance manager for Johnson & Johnson, the huge pharmaceutical concern in New Brunswick, N.J. His background, perhaps, explains the raised eyebrows he encounters when he tells friends and colleagues that three years ago he bought a two-bedroom "time share," in Palm Springs, Calif.
"Some people do think it's unusual," he said. "But I looked at it as purchasing vacation time in the future, and I weighed what a first-class hotel room would cost me over the next 30 years. 
 "I didn't do a formal spreadsheet," he added. "But I did do some calculations, and I figured that I would get my money back after about 15 years."
Time shares, a concept once thought to be little more than a real estate fad (and in many cases a real-estate scam) from the 1970's, appear to be making a comeback of sorts in the 90's, much to the dismay, it must be said, of many time share owners who may still regret their purchases.
"I've definitely been burned," said Laurie Edwards, a marketing consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y., who paid $9,000 for a studio time share in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, eight years ago. "The economics don't really make sense, the maintenance keeps climbing, and you are locked into the same place unless you want to pay extra fees."
Unlike the time shares of the past, however, that were often sold by fast-talking, fly-by-night salesmen, today's time shares often carry the imprimatur of established hotel and resort companies like Hyatt, Westin or the Walt Disney Company, which opened its 496-unit Disney Vacation Club in Orlando, Fla., in 1991 and is building other time share complexes in Newport Beach, Calif., and Vero Beach, Fla.
Marriott International, the hotel chain, was one of the first big names to enter the time-share business and it now owns 20 percent of the worldwide market, a market that has grown from $500 million to $5 billion over the last 15 years. Marriott entered the market in 1984 and now operates 29 resorts in 12 cities and has sold units to 65,000 owners.
"Many people are more comfortable with time shares, and the industry has matured," said George Leposky, director of communications for Interval International of Miami, a vacation exchange service for time-share buyers. "And with well-known brand names, such as Marriott and Hyatt and Disney, involved, people know those names and they are comfortable doing business with them.
"By extension, if those names are involved that must mean the rest of the industry is O.K., too," he added.
Not all time shares are as reliable or quality-oriented as Disney or Marriott, however. Complaints still abound about overselling of units, bait-and-switch tactics, embezzlement and fraud.
"I think they should be illegal with some of the nightmares we have experienced," said Erin Branham of Fort Worth. "My husband bought one in St. Petersburg, Fla., and the owner-manager of the building embezzled the insurance and tax money, and then a hurricane tore up the roof.
"Finally, the owners organized and got rid of this guy, but the state of Florida put a tax lien on the property and of course the roof was not covered by insurance as it was never paid," she added. "The only way to make up for this missing money was with 'special assessments' to the tune of about $1,500 over 3 years -- in addition to the regular maintenance fee of $250 per year.
"My husband, being young and fresh out of college, was duped into buying this place for $7,000 with a 14 percent interest rate over seven years -- all this without ever seeing it," she said. "They promised him a free trip there, but when he tried to use it he was told the airlines or travel agency were bankrupt! They are now selling the same unit for $1,000."
By the mid-80's, though, most states had started regulating time-share sales more stringently. Many states now requiring the salespeople to be licensed, developers registered, bonding an escape clauses in contracts to allow buyers to bail out of a deal if they change their mind.
"What you truly have is an industry that is coming of age," said Tom Franks, president of the American Resort Development Association, a trade group in Washington. "Given the realities of the economy of last five to seven years, with inflation what it has been, what we have been driven to is quality. The product has gotten better and more sophisticated."
Time sharing is a form of ownership in which the buyer spends a designated week or weeks each year in a specific unit at a specific property, usually a one to three-bedroom furnished condominium. Time shares, however, can also be sold for spaces as small as lots at campgrounds or even for shares of boats.
In some cases, the buyer will own an individual interest in the entire complex. Other times, the buyer does not actually own anything but only has a right to use the property for specific period.
Time shares with large companies -- now often called "vacation ownership or interval ownership" rather than time shares -- are sometimes more flexible.
At the Disney Vacation Clubs, for example, buyers purchase points rather than blocks of time. The points can be used at other Disney properties or traded for rooms at other time-share resorts through organizations like Interval International or Resort Condominiums International. The average time-share costs $15,000 for a week at a Disney Vacation Club with annual maintenance fees or dues of $650. (The ownership lasts until 2042.)
If that sounds steep, consider that daily rental rates for the Disney units currently range from $190 to $755 a day depending on the size of the unit and the season.
Season is, perhaps, the most important factor in determining cost. At the Marriott Mountain Valley Lodge in Breckinridge, Colo., a week in summer in a studio or one-bedroom unit costs $7,000 to $9,000. A week at Christmas, however, runs $17,900 to $22,000.
Typically, a week at a time-share resort costs an average of $9,500, according to the American Resorts Development Association, the trade group representing time shares. The term is usually 25 to 50 years, and there is an annual maintenance fee, which can range from $200 to more than $1,000, depending on the resort.
Mr. Hesse's time share with Marriott cost $11,000 with annual fees of $300. The plan includes the ability to accumulate points and exchange them for credit with other Marriott properties.
"We have never been back to Palm Springs," said Mr. Hesse, who lives in Tewksbury, N.J., and vacationed this year in Williamsburg, Va., with his wife, Rosemary, and their children, William, Robert and Edward. "Next year, we're going to Hawaii."
EXCHANGING units is not always so easy, of course. And using a service like Interval International costs money. The 19-year-old firm charges an annual membership fee of $66, and fees of $89 ($109 for foreign) to exchange units.
The biggest complaint, by far, however, is that time shares are difficult to sell. "We bought our time shares in Las Vegas about 10 years ago for $7,500 each, and they are now selling in the same area for $11,500, yet we can not find anyone in the area who wants to handle resale on time shares even though we have said we would be happy to get out only what we have put into these units," said Larry Snyder of Reno, Nev. "They keep telling us they are going to start a resale program, but that been for the past two years."
He added that he will not pay to list his time share, which has a $200 annual maintenance fee, nor pay someone up front to try and sell it. "Once sold, however, I will pay a reasonable fee for that service," he said. "Like maybe six percent of the $15,000 or an agreed-on fee for a lesser amount."
IN recent years, there have been a growing number of swindles involving guarantees to find buyers for time shares. According to the Association of Real Estate License Law Officials in Centerville, Utah, thousands of time-share owners have been duped out of as much as $15 million.
"People will find out where the time shares are that aren't selling and people that have had them for sale for a lot of years and can't sell them," said Charles Heitbrink, president of the association. "Then they will notify them by card that they have have buyers and a national listing service and guarantee them that they will be able to sell it. Of course, there's usually an upfront fee of anywhere from $395 to $1,000 -- and they get it; it's a big business."
He added that are some legitimate brokers who do list and resell time shares and sometimes they require an upfront fee. "The key is that they never guarantee the sale," Mr. Heitbrink said. "No one can guarantee the sale."
Some of the larger time-share companies, like Marriott, have their own resale programs that begin when a resort is sold out, as they are in Orlando and Hilton Head, S.C.
"People can probably expect to get 70 percent to 110 percent of what they paid for them," said Jim Miller, national director of resales for Marriott. "Industrywide, the average is probably 50 percent or less."
Not everyone is interested in selling, though. Mr. Hesse, for instance, said he hopes to hand his unit down to his children. "It is transferable and ours is an actual deed on the property," he said. "It's not just for 30 years. It is good in perpetuity."
A recent survey by the resorts association showed that 80 percent of time-share owners cited the exchange opportunity as a primary motivation for buying a time share. Unlike other real estate transactions, however, time shares should not be considered an investment. Reselling them can be next to impossible, unless one has bought at one of the top resorts in the country.
"There is no question at all that this is a product meant to be used -- we are sternly against investment pitches as most people in real estate are today," Mr. Franks said. "This product is a prepaid vacation package with a lot of nice amenities."
Time sharing began in the French Alps, and was exported to the United States in the 70's. The American Resorts Development Association reports that more the number of households owning time shares has increased from 100,000 in 1978 to 1.6 million today.
The popularity of time shares nowadays comes, in part, because of demographics. The Baby Boom, now ages 32 to 50, is entering what is widely thought to be the prime age group for second or vacation home ownership, 45 to 64.
Many people today, though, are skittish about putting money into real estate, largely because of the decline in prices in the late 1980's and early 1990's, and a small investment in a time share may suit them the best.
Also, because the hotel industry has been so weak in the last few years, it has been aggressively moving into the time-share business.
TIME shares are also making inroads into places not normally known for them, like cities. Time share projects are being planned in Boston and New York, for example.
In New York, developer Ian Bruce Eichner is planning to convert at least 10 floors of the 33-floor Park Central Hotel at 870 Seventh Avenue at 56th Street, across from Carnegie Hall, into the city's first time-share condominiums.
He projected that the units may sell for about $15,000 per week with maintenance fees of about $575 a year. Mr. Eichner bought the hotel last month for $60 million.
In Boston, the Beal Company and Marriott are planning on building time-share condominiums in that city's historic Custom House Tower.
The Disney Company is also contemplating a time-share project at Eighth Avenue and 42d Street, but a go-ahead on that project is still probably several years down the road.
"We have had these urban time-shares in San Francisco for awhile," Mr. Franks said. "And I think we will soon start to see more of them in other cities. I think it will be quite popular with foreign tourists."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
A Contest for Senate With Real Potential

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON; Iver Peterson is the Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Representative Robert G. Torricelli reads a good speech, only he's not reading. The stately paragraphs, the deliberate pacing and emphatic pauses make him one of the best arguers in the state delegation, and help explain why so many in New Jersey's Democratic leadership are scurrying to make him the man to defend the Senate seat that Bill Bradley now disdains.
So when Mr. Torricelli announced that he was a candidate on Wednesday -- officially, it was only an announcement about an "exploratory" effort -- he offered an imposing roster of nearly 150 men and women from business, labor, politics and the black arts of fund-raising who have endorsed him. The announcement also offered a glimpse at what a race between Mr. Torricelli and the likely Republican nominee, Representative Dick Zimmer, would be like, and that peek should offer some heart to people who think that political debate is dead in New Jersey just because Ivy Leaguers like Mr. Bradley and former Gov. Thomas H. Kean won't run. 
 On the surface, Mr. Torricelli, of Bergen County, made it clear that he intended to run against Speaker Newt Gingrich as much as against Mr. Zimmer. Mr. Torricelli suggested that Mr. Zimmer, from Hunterdon County, is but a cat's paw for Mr. Gingrich, whose "Deep South, rural agenda" is for the first time creeping like pellagra across the Delaware River.
A Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli said, "should represent the needs of the State of New Jersey, not any alien ideology, and not the needs of the rural South." And he added, "Dick Zimmer will have to explain to the people of New Jersey why he voted against transportation funding, against environmental standards."
No one knows how popular Mr. Gingrich is in New Jersey, although the Republicans did pretty well running on the Contract With America last fall, when they picked up two House seats. Still, Mr. Zimmer showed early signs of being uncomfortable at being linked to the Speaker, or to the Deep South. He issued a statement calling Mr. Torricelli's announcement speech "sleazy" and a "smear."
It has been common for people to say that politics in the state has become too angry and too simplistic for decent and high-minded people to serve. This view suggests that with Mr. Kean and Mr. Bradley out of the way, we are left with only a bunch of street fighters and name callers, and that we will suffer for it.
Yet there is no reason to lament the prospect of a campaign between scrappers like Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Zimmer. Sure it would be rough, but it would also be about something that has been on the minds of thoughtful Americans since about 1776 -- the proper role of government.
On the right, wearing denim coveralls with the "Dixie" label, Mr. Zimmer has pretty much embraced Mr. Gingrich's fundamental argument that government has become too expensive and too meddlesome, although he protects his green flank by defending some environmental rules that Mr. Gingrich might scorn. On the left, in a sharp suit and loafers with little leather flounces, Mr. Torricelli defends what government alone can do, but he protects his right flank by supporting Mr. Gingrich's Federal income-tax cut. Each supports abortion rights.
Still, Mr. Torricelli is clearly willing to speak up for the things that taxes pay for, and in a state and region where politics has been mostly about how bad taxes are, Mr. Torricelli's stump speech would offer a welcome defense of the state.
"For more than 20 years," he said on Wednesday, "we have been waiting for someone to arrive on a white horse with a new formula for our economic and social problems. I want my campaign to be built around the fact that the only way we are going to build our econony and address our problems is to do it they way our parents and grandparents did it. It is a difficult formula -- giving our children more, not less, higher, not lower, standards. To pay the government's bills so that interest rates are reduced and businesses can afford to expand, to train our workers for the jobs of the future rather than leaving them to their own devices.
"I want to be the guy who says there's no white horse and there's no magic formula."

HEADLINE: NEWS AND TOPICS: ROAD AND RAIL;
On the Waterfront, a 20-Mile Trolley Chugs Closer to Reality

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
From the 1890's to the 1930's -- Hudson County's heyday as a booming industrial and commercial center -- commuters and shoppers could hop on a trolley and ride elevated tracks from Hoboken to Jersey City. But as the Hudson River waterfront faded and crumbled, so did the county's transportation system, and the trolleys fell victim to bad times and competition from buses and highways.
Now, the trolley is poised for a comeback. 
 Last month, the Federal Transit Administration granted $50 million to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Transit System, a $1.3 billion project to shuttle light-rail cars, or modern trolleys, from Bayonne along the waterfront to the Vince Lombardi park-and-ride lot on the New Jersey Turnpike in Ridgefield. That brings to $108 million the money pledged so far by the Federal Government for preliminary engineering, design and environmental impact studies.
As with any project this ambitious, there are still many obstacles, chiefly the question of continued Federal financing. But New Jersey Transit, the project's sponsor, and other advocates are optimistic that ground can be broken next spring and that the first passengers can be riding by New Year's Day 2000.
"Hudson County has long needed a north-south transportation corridor; it has plenty of east-west," said Robert Janiszewski, the Hudson County Executive, one of the project's biggest proponents.
The 20.5-mile system would be built in two stages. The first, estimated to cost more than $700 million and scheduled for completion in 1999, would start at 34th Street in Bayonne and snake northward through Jersey City to the Hoboken train terminal. The second, at more than $500 million, would continue south to Fifth Street in Bayonne, and north from Hoboken through Weehawken and West New York to the Vince Lombardi lot.
In all, there would be 33 stations, 5 of which would allow transfers to ferries, buses, PATH trains and New Jersey Transit trains. Of the 20.5 miles, 15 would be on existing railroad rights-of-way, 3 would be on surface streets and only 2 would require new rights-of-way.
The hope is that 100,000 people will ride the 92 trolleys each weekday by 2010, said Frank M. Russo, senior director of new rail construction for New Jersey Transit. Fares would be competitive with those of local bus lines, he said, and there would be discounts for using the trolley in conjunction with PATH, buses, trains and ferries.
The project has been 15 years in the making, driven by concerns about air pollution and hopes of encouraging economic development on the New Jersey side of the Hudson. There were hundreds of meetings and dozens of proposals. But in 1993, the mayors of all the Hudson County municipalities, the Hudson and Bergen County executives and state officials signed an agreement committing the entire region to the project and its route.
The trolley project relies heavily on a partnership between public agencies and private companies. Rather than applying the conventional approach of waiting for state and Federal aid and building the project piecemeal, New Jersey Transit plans to encourage contractors to design and build it as quickly as possible. Congress and the State Legislature are much more likely to provide money to a project that is well under way, the reasoning goes, than to one that is in limbo as it awaits financing.
The approach has proved popular with prospective contractors. Even though New Jersey Transit will not request formal proposals until November, five groups have already expressed interest.
Still, this is a time of budget-cutting and general distaste in Congress for public-transportation projects with the word "billion" attached to their names. "In the long run, Federal funding of transit projects is very much in jeopardy," said Chris Miller of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a nonprofit group in Washington. "When you sift through it all, it's really a fight between the outer suburbs, which are trying to get public subsidies for new highways, and the inner suburbs, which are trying to get money for transit systems."
The trolley system has local critics as well. Some are not happy with route, saying the trolleys should run through different sections of Jersey City. Others say the route should have continued north, through Edgewater and up to Tenafly.
"Down there, they already have the PATH and other rail services; over here, we have nothing," said Albert F. Cafiero, chairman of the Transit Committee of Bergen County, an advocacy group. "It's extremely disappointing."
But other transit advocates have been pleasantly surprised and look forward to the once-familiar sight of trolley cars weaving through old downtowns.
"Among projects, this one has been very smooth because it's got broad bipartisan support and it's a project that makes sense," said Janine Bauer, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. "People are going to be option-rich in that territory."

HEADLINE: Weekend Escadrille

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
HIGH noon at Sky Manor Airport in Pittstown, and the breakfast buffet is going great guns. At least 20 people gather around the steam tables with the blue-checked tablecloths, loading and reloading their plates while they keep an eye on the big picture windows, watching the Cessnas and Pipers, and the occasional old-fashioned tail-dragger, take off and land. Nice, confident flying earns knowing nods. Takeoff too low? There is a quick, acerbic remark, a raised eyebrow. Nothing vicious: they'll be facing the same judges when they leave.
The walls are covered with framed photographs and posters of airplanes in flight. The regular menu has items like the "copilot's special" (a hamburger). But the buffet is the main attraction. Mushroom and sausage omelettes, biscuits with sausage gravy, waffles, bacon, sausage, fruit salad, chocolate pudding, whipped cream, orange juice, tomato juice, grapefruit juice, coffee, soda. All you can eat and drink, $7.99. 
 Of course, the main course is outside the big picture windows, between the 2,438-foot runway and the tie-down area, where the fuel pump reads $1.85 a gallon, a bargain price. "I'll burn $50 of fuel to save a nickel," says Ben Diss, 31, a computer expert for Lord & Taylor and a devoted weekend flier.
Boy, is he not alone!
There are about 350 airports in New Jersey. Nearly 50 of them are something like Sky Manor: small, often privately run, with pilot shops and flight schools; some have restaurants, one has a plane-shaped pool. And particularly in these next two months, while the air cools and the sun burns and the weather stays relatively dry and predictable, they are the haunts of a thousand variations on Mr. Diss. These are pleasure-loving but precise-minded men, and a small but growing number of women, who relish the aerial short cut to Block Island or Nantucket -- or who just wake up on a bright morning and feel like bouncing around. In which case, any excuse to take off will do.
 Take last Sunday. Ben Rosenberg, 41, the owner of a Hoboken software company, left the Essex County Airport, in West Caldwell, in his new Mooney for the 45-minute hop to Hershey, Pa., where he would take his 6-year-old twins to an amusement park.
Mr. Diss and his wife, Melodee, borrowed a friend's plane from Teterboro to take a couple of visitors on an air tour of the state.
At Sky Manor, Rich Mosciano, 46, was taking time off from his job as an AT&T vice president to put his aerobatic-certified red-and-white Pitts through some confidence maneuvers: snap rolls, hammerheads, barrel rolls, loops, inversions.
And Marty Kress, who runs a mechanic shop there, and his friend Laura Gloshinski were settling into a home-built aluminum tail-dragger (a small tail wheel instead of nose wheel), heading out for a visit to her family at the Jersey shore.
Jehd Webster and his buddy Steve Smith might have had the slimmest excuse of the day: they left from Greenwood Lake in Mr. Webster's Cessna 172, heading up to Granville, N.Y., near the Vermont border, because Mr. Webster had heard that the water there was exceptional. And he likes water. "I had one glass," he said. "It was good."
This is not a cheap hobby. The pilots make self-deprecating jokes about their "$100 hamburgers," and acknowledge, if not wallow in, the false economy of flying two hours to get cheap fuel. But for most weekend fliers, the destination is simply a flight requirement. The point is to fly. And to talk about flying. And then to fly some more.
 
Safety First
 Sunday, 10 A.M., Teterboro Airport. Ben Diss goes through the preflight checklist. He circles the Mooney 201, checking flaps, eying the bolts, looking for bird nests in the tail. Would that be dangerous? Like most pilots, he speaks deliberately, with a somewhat practical attitude about life-and-death issues: "Uh, that could be terminal."
There is always an oil check, just like one for a car, and a fuel check. Mr. Diss, who has analyzed accident data for Aviation Consumer magazine, says the most common mistakes are running out of gas and flying into a cloud without being trained to fly by instruments. Safety, he believes, is training and proficiency. "The pilot makes the difference," he says.
After 10 minutes or so on the plane's exterior, Mr. Diss climbs inside, then invites his passengers to board. Another checklist, and then he looks around for errant pedestrians. "Clear prop!" he bellows out his window, just like a golfer's "Fore!"
Then a call to the tower for clearance to taxi. Another request for takeoff. A final check of the electrical system, ignition system, propeller controls. And then, in one unbroken sweep, he rolls out to the runway, levers up to full throttle and lets the airspeed hit 60 knots. The nose goes up, the plane follows, and shortly before 11 A.M., his flying day has begun.
 
'It's Exhilarating'
 Melodee Diss, 35, is a biologist who tests polio vaccine before it is distributed. She is enthusiastic about flying, though not about the sharp banks that her husband loves -- they produce what she calls "unpleasant physiological effects." Of New Jersey's private pilots, who number about 6,000, no more than 5 percent are women, according to the Ninety Nines, an international organization of female pilots. Mrs. Diss is working toward her pilot's license, and her role today is pilotage: identifying the plane's location on the topographical maps, called sectional maps, that specify airspace rules.
Today's plan has some definites and some not-so-definites. There's the breakfast fly-in at Sky Manor, with at least two other planeloads of pilot pals expected. After that, some of the breakfast crowd are going to head up to Bar Harbor, Me. But others might find it more fun to cruise around New Jersey. Unlike commercial airliners, which fly according to stringent instrument rules and must preplan their paths, small planes fly on more relaxed visual flight rules.
In the direction of Newark, La Guardia and Kennedy Airports, New Jersey airspace ranks as some of the most complicated and regulated in the world. But heading west and south, the skies empty and the pilot's ironclad attention can throttle down to mere caution. And that is more conducive to the pure joy of flying.
Not that these flying folk are much good at explaining what that joy consists of.
"The freedom," says Mr. Diss, who detests commercial airlines. "You don't have to sit in the cattle car and be at somebody else's mercy."
"It's like a drug," says Markus Buttikofer, a 37-year-old Swiss-born chef who came to the United States 18 years ago and now runs the Mac Dan flight school at the Essex County Airport. He remembers a recent flight above a solid carpet, no, a pillow of clouds, with just the tops of the World Trade Center towers sticking out, set off against a vivid blue sky. "And every 45 seconds, there's an airplane popping out of the pillow from La Guardia. It's one of the greatest memories I have."
"It's an addiction; it's relaxation kind of thing," adds Adam Gnall, 36, a senior flight instructor at Mac Dan and a graduate student in psychology. "I couldn't put my finger on it exactly."
"It's exhilarating, quite frankly," says Mr. Rosenberg.
Sonja Steeves, the 16-year-old daughter of Tom Steeves, who runs a full-service shop at Greenwood Lake, frowns in concentration as she answers. "It's like a different feeling," she says. "It's different from driving a car. You're, like, free. You can go basically wherever you want."
More than one flier points to such chroniclers of flight as Antoine de Saint-Exupery and Charles Lindbergh.
"Night already shadows the eastern sky," Lindbergh begins in "The Spirit of St. Louis," his memoir. "To my left, low on the horizon, a thin line of clouds is drawing on its evening sheath of black. A moment ago, it was burning red and gold. I look down over the side of my cockpit at the farmlands of Central Illinois. Wheat shocks are gone from the fields. Close, parallel lines of the seeder, across a harrowed strip, show where winter planting has begun. A threshing crew on the farm below is quitting work for the day. Several men look up and wave as my mail plane roars overhead. Trees and buildings and stacks of grain stand shadowless in the diffused light of evening. In a few minutes it will be dark, and I'm still south of Peoria."
But that isn't the world the modern recreational pilot sees. When Ben and Melodee Diss leave Teterboro, they fly low, like Lindbergh, between the clouds and the cloud-shadowed earth. They see green fields marked off by lines of trees; farmland in curving sweeps of sandy brown and yellow ; brown-rimmed reservoirs that testify to drought amid mossy-looking expanses of woods. They see the jutting smokestacks of huge factories; stark apartment towers and the spread of suburban geometry, interrupted by aqua patches of backyard pools.
It's not just the view from the air that is treasured. Small airports make great family outings. Neighborhood folks come. They bring their children. They bring their grandchildren.
Sky Manor, in Hunterdon County, has several benches along the runway. Milton Smith, 77, and his wife, Aletta, live nearby. They were there on Saturday. "I'm just enjoying the clouds and the blue skies and the comfortable temperature," he said, hiking up his belt. "I was a pilot in World War II -- B-24 bombers, biggies! And you don't get it out of your system."
 
Brunch or Burgers
 Mr. Diss checks the bright orange windsock at Sky Manor, announces his arrival on a channel monitored by other planes in the area, and banks downwind, then crosswind, before turning into a final approach. Touchdown is smooth, and he gets a round of applause from his passengers. "Thank you," he says, smiling with satisfaction.
He taxis over to the parking area, cuts back fuel until the engine dies, and methodically shuts down the plane. There is a predictable 40-minute wait for Pete McWilliams ("He's always late!" the Disses say), and then a crowd of eight heads indoors for brunch or burgers, and an hour of talk crowded with acronyms and inside jokes.
"Hey, Scotty, did you bring the beast?" Mr. Diss teases Scott Dyer, a bearded 39-year-old in shorts and a golf shirt. "The barge," Mr. Dyer corrects him, referring to his Cessna 210, a six-seater that flies like a truck. Mr. McWilliams rubs at his knee. "Darn! Knelt in the oil again." His girlfriend laughs.
The pilots check out the day's arrivals and departures out the window, tease the waitress, trade updates on what they're flying, who saw a rare plane for sale somewhere. They talk angrily about how the suburbs keep encroaching on small airports, filled with people who don't care at all about flying but care a great deal about peace and quiet.
That's a frustration shared by Governor Whitman, whose administration has been called upon frequently to mediate conflicts between municipalities and small airports. "People who build homes at the end of a runway have to understand the runway was there first," she said over the phone last week. "They really shouldn't complain, but they do."
Her father flew; her brother, Dan Todd, is a devoted flier and has run more than one New Jersey airport. Years ago, under his tutelage, Mrs. Whitman accumulated about 6 hours of flying time.
"I love flying," she said. "I love the perspective it gives you on the state, the freedom it gives you to move around."
She believes small airports are crucial to New Jersey's economy. "First, they open up the state," she explained. "In a state as crowded as this, the ability for business executives to move around freely grants them a great deal of flexibility, and that has made the state attractive for corporations. And then the recreation flier puts a great deal of money into the economy."
Ask pilots to tally the cost, and they count the plane, fuel and oil, maintenance. And then there are food bills. "Aviation is just a way to get from one meal to another," observes Dave Halpern, 32, who declines the breakfast buffet in favor of a copilot special with blue cheese.
 
Swapping Stories
 The day is waning. Some of the crowd head to Bar Harbor. Some head home. Mr. and Mrs. Diss decide to show their visitors a few more airports. At the end of the day, they're back at the northern edge of the state, at the Greenwood Lake airport.
One minute, Jehd Webster is sitting in the shadow of an enormous 50-year-old passenger plane -- a Lockheed Constellation, the last of the four-engine piston-powered airliners. The "Connie" was brought in to be a cocktail lounge in the long-ago days when the place held an amusement park. Now it's a flight shop.
The next minute, Mr. Webster, who flew to Granville for a glass of water, is standing around with three or four pilots, and the stories are flowing. There's the cheap-gas contest: Mr. Diss, who once found fuel once for $1.50 a gallon, was beaten by Mr. Webster, who'd got it for $1.47 in some distant state. A bearded German man joins in. He just landed, dropped off by the friends who just flew him back from a European trip via Iceland, Greenland and the edge of the Arctic Circle. He and Mr. Webster, it turns out, have both flown extensively in Central and South America. They compare notes on a tiny Panamanian strip.
Stories of far alternate with stories of near: there's the wealthy woman who flies out of Greenwood to Hilton Head once or twice a year just to shop. The drug trade has prompted a serious rate of airplane theft in Los Angeles, where Mr. Webster lived until a couple of years ago.
There's a wild story about an 89-year-old student pilot who had a heart attack in mid-flight, and the instructor has to crash-land the plane. But he lands so well that no one is hurt. "The pilot wasn't even hurt," Mr. Webster says. "But he was dead."
Then, while the sun goes down and the Disses get ready to head home to Teterboro, Mr. Webster tells the story of the interesting situation in April, when he and his wife were flying back from Louisiana, and an exhaust valve broke. The engine died. He really didn't want to scare his wife. "I didn't even declare an emergency," he says with the pilot's pride of calm in crisis management. "First, I want to keep her flying. Second, I didn't see the need for one; we had the airport made." Within eight minutes, they were on the ground, safe.
 
IN THEIR OWN WORDS: High-Tech or Open Cockpit, the Sky's the Limit
 Ben Rosenberg
 He concedes that his daughters might be getting a slightly skewed version of reality. "We flew to Cape May, and it took 45 minutes," says Ben Rosenberg, a 41-year-old computer executive who has a touch of Rodney Dangerfield in him. "So Kathryn, she was about 3 then, says, 'Gee, Dad, why so long today?' "
And then he and his wife, Marie, tried taking them on a car trip. "We were in the car half an hour. Rebecca says, 'Are we in Vermont yet?' We weren't even out of New Jersey yet!"
Marie, he says, is "destination-oriented." So last year, when he traded his old plane for a fast, new, sophisticated low-wing Mooney Ovation he let her choose the interior and the plane's colors: it's white-crowned, with a red body and gold stripes, sort of a Marlboro box without the black. He won't say what he paid, but the plane, with all its added avionics, is "probably worth 300K." His running cost, he calculates, is $90 to $100 an hour. But since he owns his own software company, Advanced Systems Concepts Inc., in Hoboken, that isn't a problem. And anyway, Mooney made him a great deal.
His favorite trips include a New Year's Eve jaunt to Portland, Me., to pick up 25 pounds of fresh lobster. ("It's the only time I really felt like a jet-setter," he says. "But the whole way back I had this eerie feeling they were climbing out of the back seat to come and get me.") And then a nice trip in May to take the kids to Disney World; the rent-a-car was delivered directly to the airplane.
He's protective of his passengers, giving them a safety briefing worthy of an international commercial flight. And he's very protective of his plane, which is clear when he points out the air-sick bag. "They say you can't open the plane door in flight," he says. "The speed keeps the door closed -- you don't have that strength. But if you throw up in my plane, I'll have that strength!"
On a quick tour along the Hudson last weekend, he thumbed his nose at stalled highway traffic and joyfully circled the Statue of Liberty. But like any pilot, he trains himself to be "situationally aware," meaning alert to all possible problems.
There seems to be only one topic he doesn't have a light response for.
Has he had any close calls? "Later," he answers.
Is that not something a pilot discusses while in flight? "That's correct," he says, eyes firmly ahead.

Tom Watkinson
 Here's a man who would just as soon throw the high-tech equipment out of his cockpit in favor of a simple joystick and sharp eyesight. "I like the hands-on flying," Tom Watkinson says. He shares two airplanes with his father. One is a 1967 Piper PA 28 Cherokee, the standard family plane of its time. The other is a true classic: a 1946 Piper PA 12 Supercruiser, an open cockpit tail-dragger.
"I like the Supercruiser," Mr. Watkinson says. "All that is is a stick. There's a minimum of instruments. I feel like it's real grass-roots flying." He might fly 200 hours a year, he says, but because his planes are old, slow and boarded inexpensively at the Alexandria airport, it costs him no more than $2,500 a year. That's affordable: Mr. Watkinson, who lives in Short Hills, is the Millburn Township engineer and runs a consulting firm; altogether, he earns $75,000 to $100,000 a year.
"I think I have a little bit of a barnstormer attitude," he says. "I'm not reckless, but when people started flying . . . well, now, you know, people get autopilot, and you don't have to do anything," he says with some disdain. "That's nothin'!"
He has a similar low-key approach to air travel. "I like to just go up in the air," he says. "But you feel stupid if you don't have a destination -- only because other people think you're stupid."
So he takes little jaunts to have lunch with relatives, or flies over buildings he's in the process of inspecting in the course of his work, or heads to the little grass strips that attract like-minded fliers.
"One thing, I would like to take the old plane to Alaska," he says. "Fly cross-country, then follow the old Alaska highway up. Just pack up a sleeping bag and some survival equipment."
Is that his dream trip? "Yeah," he said, "I think so."
Will he do it? "Yeah," he said, laughing, "I think so." ANDREA KANNAPELL

HEADLINE: ART;
Fantasy in the Bronx and Justice in White Plains

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

 BODY:
FANTASY versus real life: The first can be seen in the Bronx, at the Lehman College Art Gallery, the second in Westchester, at Krasdale Gallery, in White Plains.
Andrea Arroyo left her native Mexico for New York City in 1993, with the purpose of studying dance with Merce Cunningham but has since changed professions. Either that or Ms. Arroyo has found an avocation in art for, at Lehman, she is showing off her paces as a self-taught painter, having already produced a mural for a Bronx school by way of the Percent for Art Program. 
 "Mythologies," as the show is called, consists of many small scenes featuring a nymph in different roles. Here, she is a mermaid served up as part of a sushi meal, complete with chopsticks, there she is Daphne metamorphosing into a tree. Elsewhere she plays the daughters of Lot, one a redhead, the other with purple tresses, and both bearing down on their father for nefarious purposes.
But as Eve or Lilith, the subject is the same demure little nude with rubbery limbs -- an archeype whose setting can be water built up in clay or plaster, landscape similarly embossed with trees or just sky. The atmosphere is always idyllic. Colors are bright and, except where they are embellished with low relief, the surfaces are smooth; frames are painted and some appear to be hand carved. In addition to biblical stories and pagan myths, Ms. Arroyo draws inspiration from her own life as a dancer, as when she portrays a woman on a sofa contemplating Matisse's "Danse," which hangs behind her at the end of a long room carpeted in green. Other departures include faux books, like the one paying tribute to "Alice in Wonderland." This volume stands open to reveal, on one side, a niche papered with text that contains an image of Alice falling and, on the other, a melange of text, watercolor and collage in which the White Rabbit, his pocketwatch and a disproportionately large letter can be discerned. Ms. Arroyo's imagery is charming, playful and wholesome to a fault -- a winning formula these days.
Plans are afoot for the painter to talk about her accomplishment, but time and date have yet to be announced. The number to call for information is (718) 960-8732. Meanwhile, viewers may look forward to the gallery reception scheduled for Oct. 25, from 5 to 7 P.M. The show itself continues through Dec. 16.
Krasdale visitors are justified who recoil from "The Art of Justice," a show organized by Sigmund Balka, Krasdale Foods' general counsel, in collaboration with Susan Hoeltzel, who directs the gallery at Lehman. Still, those who abandon ship will miss an experience that may be without precedent in corporate territory. First, there is the title, which is doubly ironic for designating art that is mostly about injustice while suggesting that justice itself has been demoted to an art form. Second, there is the installations' general tone, which borders on the apocalyptic.
Having conceded in the briefest of introductions that this is not the kind of work displayed in corporate premises, Mr. Balka, in effect, proposes that its beholders not judge a book by its cover. He then pushes home the point by appending questions calculated to focus attention on the content of the show rather than its unprepossessing appearance. For example, he asks visitors to decide if they feel they have ever been unjustly treated, to consider which are the kinds of injustice that can be dealt with most effectively and so on.
Considering that nothing, be it food or news, reaches the consumer unprocessed, Mr. Balka deserves credit for trying to encourage independent thought. Nevertheless, the odds against his succeeding -- long enough to begin with -- are stretched to infinity by art that ranges from so-so to dreadful and by documentation that is, to say the least, spotty.
Admittedly, there have been no Goyas in the 20th century but that hardly excuses the presence of Bert Winsberg's canvases based on photographs and executed in colors that are at best disagreeable. One features Wilbur Mills living it up in a restaurant with his presumed paramour and another man; another depicts a German soldier who lingers, camera in hand, among corpses dangling from a tree like the proverbial "strange fruit." With friends like Mr. Winsberg, justice needs no enemies.
There are artists who raise the show's esthetic level but too often they are represented by inconsequential works. Thus, Elizabeth Catlett's black and white linocuts about repression in Chile, though well done, make about as much impact as a postage stamp. And, dramatic though it is, Nancy Spero's lithograph of an eagle with the head of a soldier superimposed upside down on one wing that is captioned "kill commies" resists detailed interpretation. Even more puzzling are the Mao-shaped openings that Zhang Hongtu cuts in papers coated, respectively, with lipstick and soy sauce and embalmed in epoxy resin. Those seeking help from the catalogue will learn only that the artist believes "in the power of the image" but not in its "authority" and that his holey images, though related to the Taoist concept of nothingness, are actually inspired by the shape of a bagel.
Innocuous as it seems, Stephen Lack's sketchy painting of two men with guns waiting for water is a comment on the meaning of the term "consultant" when it is used in connection with the politics of third-world countries.
Albert Chong draws the onlooker into his black and white photograph of a carved chair on which reposes a still life including another photograph -- of a Jamaican man garlanded with cowrie shells. Unfortunately, the explanation of the image, inscribed on the copper mat that frames it, is all but illegible because of the way the light hits the metal. Other issues addressed include unemployment and lynching, during the Depression, Civil Rights disturbances in the 1960's and, more recent, the Navajo and Hopi land dispute.
"The Art of Justice" could persuade its viewers that Rome is indeed on fire but it leaves them no alternative but to follow the example set by Nero. The show remains on view through Oct. 27, and, as usual, prospective visitors must call (718) 378-1100, extension 2125, for an appointment.

HEADLINE: A 'Vulture' Looks Skyward

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:

 Thou shalt not covet trophy properties.
Thou shalt not buy at auction.
Thou shalt not own old, outdated office space. 
 THESE are the commandments according to Sam Zell.
Or rather, these were his commandments. In bidding for control of Rockefeller Center, the grande dame of office developments, Mr. Zell, the feisty Chicago financier, appears to be violating his own cardinal rules.
Those rules laid the foundation for the billion-dollar empire that Mr. Zell and his late partner, Robert H. Lurie, assembled from the junkyards of the real estate industry and corporate America. Classic "vulture" investors, they bought faltering properties or businesses at cents on the dollar, betting that with a little prudent management and upturns in the business cycle, the value of their bargain-basement purchases would rise.
For the most part, their bets paid off. Today, the empire spans 24,500 mobile home sites, 57,250 apartments, 15 million square feet of retail space and 28 million square feet of office space, which makes Mr. Zell and his Equity Group Investments Inc. the country's top owner of office space. Equity has much more than real estate, though, including stakes in oil and gas, insurance, cruise lines and building products to bicycles, radio stations, plastic packaging, drug stores and fertilizer.
But with the exception of the Revco drug store chain and Schwinn bicycles, Equity is a sprawling collection of companies and properties whose names ring few bells: Vigoro, Capsure, Great American Management and Investment, Itel, Equity Residential Properties, Jacor.
Rockefeller Center sticks out among that crowd like the Hope diamond on a rhinestone bracelet, leading some to speculate that Mr. Zell is abandoning his principles in an effort to build a legacy. "Rock Center is an ego property," said David Shulman, former head of Salomon Brothers' real estate group and now its chief equity strategist. "I'm assuming Sam is doing this to make money, but that doesn't mean his ego isn't involved, too."
Could it be? Is the bad boy of real estate succumbing to the folly that lured Japanese bankers into buying Pebble Beach or Donald J. Trump the Plaza Hotel?
The mere suggestion elicits an unprintable four-letter response from Mr. Zell, who subsequently refused to pose for a picture outside the center for fear some would mistake his intentions for what he calls "an edifice complex."
"I don't invest in anything other than economic prospects," the 53-year-old Mr. Zell insisted in his gravelly growl, which enhances his reputation for irascibility. "If it's not economic, I'm not interested."
To hear him tell it, far from being an impractical trophy, Rockefeller Center is one of the few chances left to buy office space at a steep discount in hopes of reaping huge rewards a few years down the road.
Indeed, among real-estate cognoscenti, Mr. Zell's interest in Rockefeller Center -- in spite of its name and age -- is regarded as a clear signal that the bust that has plagued the commercial property business since the overbuilding of the 1980's is fast ending.
"It has become much tougher to execute a strategy of buying distressed real estate these days because there's much less distressed real estate out there to buy," said Mike Kirby, a principal in Green Street Advisers Inc. and a long-time Zell watcher.
Whether Mr. Zell will get the keys to Rockefeller Center should become clearer by Tuesday, when a bankruptcy court hearing about the center's future is scheduled in New York.
In May, the center's owners, the Mitsubishi Estate Company and Rockefeller family trusts, sought bankruptcy protection for the partnerships through which they control the property. In a bid to gain control through foreclosure, Mr. Zell has teamed up with Walt Disney and Merrill Lynch in a tentative partnership with Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., the real estate investment trust, or REIT, that holds the center's $1.3 billion mortgage.
At Tuesday's hearing, the owners are expected to unveil their reorganization plan for the property. Until late last week, they had been working on a plan with a New York development company, Tishman Speyer Properties L.P. But those talks have halted because opposition from the REIT made it certain that the plan would never have been approved by creditors.
Instead, as the deadline for the hearing looms, the owners have been meeting with representatives of the Zell team. The plan under consideration would be designed to lessen the owners' tax liability from a change of control. In exchange for injecting $250 million into the REIT, the Zell group would get a portion of the center's income for five years and then get ownership.
The effort to come up with a plan agreeable to all parties is a hallmark of Mr. Zell's way of doing business. "I'm known as a tough guy and maybe I am," he said late last week, "but I've learned it's a lot more fun to make love than to make war."
On the face of it, Rockefeller Center appears to be the most uneconomic of ventures. Its need for upkeep, improvements and repairs has cost Mitsubishi more than $500 million -- on top of mortgage payments and the $1.4 billion the Japanese real estate giant paid for an 80 percent stake in the center and other midtown Manhattan properties and businesses that it bought from the Rockefeller trusts in 1989. The outlays have far outstripped the center's rents and the prospect of further losses prompted the bankruptcy filing.
Moreover, a month before the filing, Mr. Zell pooh-poohed Rockefeller Center and other "big queens," as he calls old but elegant office buildings, as obsolete piles of brick and mortar.
But a stroll through Rockefeller Center that covered "every square inch" of the property changed Mr. Zell's mind.
First, Mitsubishi and, to a much lesser extent, the Rockefeller trusts have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into improvements.
Additionally, Mr. Zell and others angling for control -- including Goldman, Sachs & Company, a big creditor of Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., and two of the REIT's large shareholders, Gotham Partners and the Leucadia National Corporation -- see unexploited opportunities in the property.
Take the roughly 500,000 square feet in the center devoted to retailing. With the exception of the area around the skating rink, the center's retail space is filled with second-rate restaurants and shops selling T-shirts and souvenirs. Yet the foot traffic is among the heaviest in New York. "The retail space is really a collection of tenants, not a shopping experience," Mr. Zell said.
Like others, he also believes the pieces are worth more than the whole. "Think of what Disney could do with the Guild Theater and Radio City Music Hall," he said.
The General Electric Company likely would pay top dollar for the building New Yorkers call 30 Rock, which houses its NBC studios, among other things. G.E. has sunk at least $1 billion into improvements in the building, and its rent, currently at below-market rates, is scheduled for a hefty increase in October 1997, two good reasons for presuming the company would be interested in buying the building.
But it is his more than quarter-century of wrestling with troubled properties and companies -- and his understanding of the intricacies of the bankruptcy process and the center's tangled ownership structure -- that gives Mr. Zell the best chance of capturing Rockefeller Center, and making it pay off.
"Rock Center is interesting because it has an unending number of players, both real and potential," he said. "It's like a jigsaw puzzle with an enormous number of moving parts, and the person who can see them all and know why they're moving and where they're moving will win."
Finally, there is the more global reason forcing real-estate vultures like Mr. Zell to cast their principles to the wind: properties in the throes of financial distress are increasingly hard to find.
Five years ago, a glut of real estate created a buyer's market, with a shortage of investment capital on the buy side and an endless choice of properties for sale. In short, the market was grossly inefficient -- just the way the vultures like it.
Now, the economy is humming along. Very few new buildings have gone up in the last five years, and the excess capacity left over from the 80's is beginning to fill up. New players -- like Apollo Advisers L.P., Morgan Stanley, the Blackstone Group and Goldman, Sachs -- are making the real estate game more competitive.
Been there, done that, says Mr. Zell, who dismisses most of his new rivals as "slicers and dicers -- they buy up a package of distressed apartment properties, slice them up into smaller pieces and sell them off in two years."
What's more, the increasing balance between supply and demand is making it a less attractive game for players like Mr. Zell. "It's what happened in 1980," he said. "The market got efficient -- and efficiency is my enemy."
BY that time, Mr. Zell had his first fortune. He started amassing it when he was in law school at the University of Michigan in the 1960's and began managing off-campus student housing.
After graduation, he tried his hand at law but found moonlighting in distressed real estate more fun -- and more lucrative. So in 1968, he and Mr. Lurie, a fraternity brother, went into business together, buying insolvent commercial, residential and industrial properties from banks and pension fund and insurance company investors. They put virtually no money down but promised that if things worked out, the lenders would get a slice of the profits.
They did that until the late 1970's, turning huge profits. By 1980, Mr. Lurie and Mr. Zell decided that the distressed real-estate game had run its course. So they turned their attention to the corporate graveyard, acquiring control of Great American Management and Investments Inc., a real estate investment trust with some $500 million in assets. Great American had emerged from bankruptcy protection in 1979 with $120 million in tax credits, which could be used to shelter future profits. They sold off the real estate and began a diversification program, buying up companies and using Great American's net-operating-loss carry forwards to offset earnings.
They liked that investment so much that in 1984, they went after the Itel Corporation, a computer leasing company that had also gone through bankruptcy protection. With more than $400 million in tax credits on its books, Itel fit the Zell-Lurie modus operandi, and they engaged in a battle for control.
Mr. Zell's boardroom behavior after their victory cemented his reputation for mincing few words, taking no prisoners and suffering nary a fool. He sliced middle management jobs, fired the chief executive and scattered cigarette butts and ashes on the white carpeting in the executive suite.
Using Itel's and Great American's tax credits to shelter profits, Mr. Zell and Mr. Lurie went on a buying spree in the 80's. They accumulated more than $2 billion in debt, and when the recession hit in the early 90's, Equity was unable to refinance its many loans, more than $500 million of which were personally guaranteed by Mr. Zell.
Worse than his financial woes was the loss to cancer in 1990 of Mr. Lurie, who had tended to the operational details of their holdings. Mr. Zell describes their relationship as "living out of the same checkbook," and Mr. Lurie's slow deterioration was painful for Mr. Zell. A photo of Mr. Lurie, whose wife and six children retain a 50-percent stake in most Equity deals, is on the wall of Mr. Zell's office.
Sheli Rosenberg, then Equity's general counsel, stepped into Mr. Lurie's role. She has deliberately kept a low profile but intends to increase her public role and the role of other executives as Equity's holdings become more and more public.
Becoming more public was part of the process of bringing Equity out of its financial bind. Since 1990, Mr. Zell has sold stakes to the public in seven companies. Last year, he took his apartment and mobile home holdings public.
"The buoyant equity capital markets have bailed him out," said an investment banker whose firm runs a fund specializing in distressed real estate that often competes with Mr. Zell for properties. "He couldn't have recapped in the private market and gotten values anywhere near what he did in the public market."
And since 1988, when Mr. Zell teamed with Merrill Lynch to coax institutional investors to give him $408 million to plow into troubled property, a big portion of his deals are done with other people's money. Although the first Zell-Merrill Lynch fund started buying into the office market before it bottomed out, thereby depressing returns, Mr. Zell and Merrill have raised more than $1 billion in two subsequent funds and are preparing to start a fourth.
Separately, Mr. Zell, in tandem with Chilmark Partners, an investment firm run by the former Salomon Brothers restructuring expert, David M. Schulte, has raised $1 billion to invest in distressed companies. Until last month, Zell-Chilmark's holdings included 54 percent of Broadway Stores, the West Coast department store chain.
With the sale of Broadway to Federated Department Stores for stock plus the assumption of $1 billion of debt, Mr. Zell pulled a rabbit out of the hat. Although he did not immediately recoup all of Zell-Chilmark's $250 million investment, he did avert the bankruptcy filing that many were predicting. And if Federated stock goes up, it may yet prove to be a winning investment.
He now gleefully displays a miniature Lucite tombstone encasing a clipping from the Aug. 16 issue of Crain's Chicago Business, which predicted that the "grave dancer," the nickname Mr. Zell has chosen for himself, might soon "have a corpse on his hands" -- namely Broadway Stores.
Mr. Zell expects his Rockefeller Center adventure to be commemorated in celluloid -- not Lucite. In his dealings with Peter D. Linneman, chairman of the REIT through which Mr. Zell hopes to gain control of the center, there was one non-negotiable issue.
"I said there was one last thing that could be a deal-breaker, and that's that I get the movie rights to the story about the battle for this great property," Mr. Zell growled.
Mr. Linneman acceded -- but only if he could choose the actor to play Mr. Zell. "Depending on how things turn out, you'll either be Robert DeNiro or Danny DeVito," Mr. Zell recalls Mr. Linneman saying.
Mr. Zell mused for a moment. "I actually like DeVito a lot," he said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: AT THE GATE;
With New Issues, Small Can Be Beautiful

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
IN the dicey world of initial public offerings, many people invest only in headline deals put forth by well-known companies and underwritten by major Wall Street firms. First issues are nail-biters anyway, the thinking goes, so better to play it safe in some respects, going with a Nabisco Holdings, a Netscape or a similar venture backed by a giant that researches, underwrites and markets several billions of dollars in new issues every year.
Sometimes, though, it pays to look at smaller deals done by modest-sized firms far from Wall Street. "Many of the regional houses do very well with these small offerings," said Robert Mascale, a research analyst for New Issues, a newsletter published by the Institute for Econometric Research in Deerfield, Fla. Not only can investors avoid the exorbitant prices that often accompany highly publicized deals, but they also have a better chance of finding a broker willing to sell some shares. 
 Consider Eastbay, a catalogue company in Wausau, Wis., that sells about a tenth as much as its better-known neighbor to the south, Lands' End in Dodgeville. Founded in 1980 by a school coach and a college director of recreational services, Eastbay sells athletic equipment and apparel to high school and college teams and to individuals. It mailed its first catalogue in 1984 and now sends out nearly 40 million copies a year.
Like the company, the offering, for which no date has been set, is modest. Eastbay expects to raise no more than $30 million. The underwriter is a small Milwaukee firm, Robert W. Baird & Company, for which this will be the first I.P.O. of the year. Piper Jaffray of Minneapolis is co-manager.
But, though it isn't a technology play and lacks the name recognition that can make for a hot stock, Eastbay may be worth a long look. During the last three years, its annual earnings have sprinted to $4 million from $1.2 million, for the 12 months ended in June, and in the same period revenues more than doubled, to $98.8 million.
What accounts for these impressive numbers? "The thing about Eastbay is that they have a really strong niche," said Steven Ashley, a retailing analyst with the Milwaukee firm Cleary Gull.
Many people will never find an Eastbay catalogue in their mailboxes. The mailing list consists mostly of 12- to 24-year-olds, many of whom asked to be added to the list after seeing the hard-to-find Nike styles and other items in the catalogue. Eastbay's secret is to focus on rural areas, the inner city and other markets ignored by Foot Locker, Sports Authority and other chains, and to offer a broad selection. The strategy enables Eastbay to sidestep its competition.
And the offering price looks fair. At $12 to $14, the shares would sell at a reasonable multiple of 17 times trailing earnings, which is less than Eastbay's average annual growth rate of more than 25 percent for the last two years. While Eastbay has no direct publicly held competitors, the stock also looks cheaper than that of some indirectly comparable companies. Many catalogue companies are more expensive; for example, at Friday's closing price of $17.50, Lands' End was selling at a price-to-earnings multiple of 20. Shares of Sports Authority, $28.50 on Friday, carried a multiple of 35.
Moreover, while the deal doesn't have the backing of a Wall Street powerhouse, Baird and Piper are both respected regional firms that specialize in companies in their geographic area, like Eastbay. Piper, the lead manager in five initial offerings in 1994, had one of the year's best underwriting records, according to Standard & Poor's.
But small firms do have their drawbacks. Because Baird and Piper don't have as many brokers as larger firms, their deals probably won't see the same jump in stock price on the first day of trading that bigger firms can generate, and might get less backing in the ensuing months.
Eastbay is a small company trying to break into a big and competitive league. Its $98.8 million in revenue looks puny compared with the Sports Authority's nearly $1 billion in sales. It is young, too. Eastbay still hasn't named any of its outside directors, although its founders, Richard Gering and Arthur Juedes, did bring in an experienced manager, Harry Colcord, three years ago. For 10 years before joining Eastbay, Mr. Colcord, president and chief executive, headed a division of Apogee Enterprises, a Minneapolis building products company with $800 million in sales.
Small deals can be beautiful, but they can also be dangerous. Investors should beware of the infamous bucket shops that push whatever offerings are available, and avoid tiny deals done by unseasoned firms. "The lack of experience and inability to really judge a company's worth might prove to be disastrous," Mr. Mascale said.

HEADLINE: DIARY

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:

POLITICS
 
Finance, After Packwood
It's one of the few flattering labels stuck on Bob Packwood lately: "master of detail." He sure is. Just read, amid the more damning diary entries, the blow-by-blow description of a senatorial hairdo. But where that mastery will leave the real void, now that he's resigning, is on the Senate Finance Committee, which he heads. He somehow understands the intricacies of taxes and Medicare -- and, it is said, can explain it in English (quite a trick!). So while one colleague said, "I don't think any senator is indispensable," others said his departure "complicates things" and leaves a "substantial void" in areas where the Republicans crave big changes. What now? Bob Dole is expected to run the committee, from offstage, till yearend.
 
STALKING CHRYSLER
 
This Time, Kerkorian's Serious
When Kirk Kerkorian made noises in the spring about buying Chrysler, people stopped listening after a while, and Mr. Kerkorian seemed to fade into the upholstery. He didn't. He was, apparently, scouting around for an ally who'd be taken seriously, and last week he found one, luring Jerome York, former Chrysler finance chief, away from I.B.M. The markets are taking it very seriously, with Chrysler's stock rising as relentlessly as I.B.M.'s falls. And Chrysler took it seriously -- doubling, to $2 billion, its stock buyback. Mr. York, it is agreed, wants to run Chrysler -- so he probably won't be satisfied with what Chrysler may offer: a board seat.
 
CUBA
 
Island of Capitalism
The official line, still: Cuba is an evil Communist empire, a lurking threat to the very barbecues and bowling leagues of democracy. But each day that image meanders further from reality, as Fidel Castro's once-defiant island looks more and more like a bastion of capitalism -- lacking only American capitalists. Last week Cuba passed a law allowing foreign investment in anything but defense, health care and education. To be sure, the door could have been opened wider -- the Government must give its nod case by case, and "anything that doesn't benefit" Cuba's development "will be excluded." Still, some American businesses -- which would love to get a foot in this fast-revolving door -- saw a golden opportunity to rethink our trade ban.
 
AUTOS
 
Trucks in Cars' Clothing
They're priced like luxury cars. They're filled with luxury-car goodies, like CD players, phone outlets and serious leather. But Jeeps, Explorers and Suburbans drink gas like trucks. How do they get away with it? Because they're "light" trucks, ruled by much looser mileage standards. This is no small matter, for of every 10 new passenger vehicles sold, 4 are light trucks, and this surging popularity has slammed into reverse the nation's solid gains in fuel efficiency. "Outrageous," said a Sierra Club official. "Ridiculous," said Automotive News. Indeed, the Administration might raise mileage standards for trucks -- fiercely opposed by auto makers, of course, and the regulation-busting House.
 
JAPAN
 
Few Jobless, but Few Jobs
In the United States, by the strange math of economists, 6 percent unemployment is often considered "full employment." So Japan, with an official jobless rate of 3.2 percent, would seem a job-seeker's paradise. Far from it. On Monday, as most Americans basked in a Labor Day untainted by labor, more than 12,000 Japanese college students flocked from across the nation to a Tokyo stadium for what was essentially a huge job fair. With Japan stuck in recession, top companies were not exactly clamoring for their talents. Top seniors competed for jobs as clerks and construction workers, others competed for any job at all -- and women were left with the scraps. It was the dark side of lifetime employment -- don't hire in the first place.
 
CHARITIES
 
Rewarded Before Heaven
The men and women who head the nation's nonprofit organizations naturally do so out of dedication to good works, but starvation wages are not usually part of the deal. Even after the president of United Way was sent packing after he lived it up on the charity's money -- a scandal that snapped the public to attention -- salaries are rising steadily. And a survey out last week found that the top salaries, by far, went to the heads of big city hospitals: Mount Sinai, $900,000; Sloan-Kettering, nearly $800,000. The Salvation Army's president, though, made just $58,000, while the president of Philip Morris made nearly $2 million. And Newt Gingrich? $133,600 (without royalties).
 
EDUCATION
 
Mr. Moon Goes to School
Is a university just another business? After all, if it can't pay its bills, it'll be as bankrupt as a failed dry cleaner. So can anyone with ready cash simply "buy" this "business" and do with it what he will? That was the extra-credit question last week as the University of Bridgeport bestowed an honorary degree on the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, who saved the school from bankruptcy by giving it $98 million since 1992. Enrollment has risen from 1,100 to 1,800, but the "Moonies" have not "taken over," said the president -- a 20-year friend of Mr. Moon's. "This is a normal American university with a unique funding source." Critics, though, say Mr. Moon's followers have lured foreign students with big scholarships -- with church training part of the deal.
 
 
PUBLISHING
 
A Magazine, by George!
Government-bashers will love this one: a model as President. Even those irreverent souls who said Ronald Reagan was merely acting the part wouldn't have had such a wildly cynical fantasy. But there she is: Cindy Crawford as a seductive George Washington on the cover -- unveiled last week -- of an odd new magazine called, yes, George. This isn't just any magazine, though. It's "post-partisan," whatever that means. It's the MTV of politics. It's full of Georges, of all stripes: Wallace, Stephanopoulos, Bush (well, Barbara anyway). Oh, and by the way, a fellow named Kennedy edits it (no, not George: that's the actor; this is confusing enough!). This one, if memory serves, is related to some former President. Could that be what the fuss is about?

HEADLINE: Beyond the Couch

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
IT was always a one-way love affair. New York City adored Sigmund Freud. Freud hated New York City.
He was here just once, in 1909, and he took in the usual sights: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Coney Island, Central Park and Chinatown. But as he left the States, he wrote to his sister: "I am very glad I am away from it, and even more that I don't have to live there." 
 As Freud was busy denouncing all Americans as materialistic, superficial, prudish and uncultivated, New Yorkers couldn't get enough of the father of psychoanalysis. The International Psychoanalytic Society set up shop in Manhattan in 1911, and in the 1920's there were "Freuding" parties in Greenwich Village where guests analyzed one another's dreams. Woody Allen's oeuvre has certainly burnished the image.
"Psychoanalysis might have originated in Vienna, but it was copied and Americanized, then marketed, and marketed on a scale immeasurably greater than Europe could offer, in New York," Ann Douglas wrote in "Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920's" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1995), her sweeping portrait of New York City.
Today Freud is still a strong, some would say towering, presence. No matter how many of his theories or techniques have been rejected or modified, he is still the one who created the "talking cure," the foundation of all psychotherapy.
But with changes transforming the health-care industry and managed-care companies looking for ways to cut costs, Freudian analysis is taking a back seat to cheaper and shorter approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy and group therapy. The image of a couch-bound patient free-associating four or five days a week for years on end, while a bearded analyst sits silently by, is largely a thing of the past.
"There are still therapists out there who believe in sitting on the sidelines and just letting a patient talk and talk and talk," said Dr. Robert M. Naiman, a Manhattan psychiatrist who has practiced for more than 40 years. "That was O.K. back in the classic orthodox days when patients coming into psychoanalysis expected that, but in this day and age I think people should and do expect activity and interaction."
More typical these days is a patient who sees a therapist once a week and sits up. The talk may indeed explore childhood difficulties and last night's dreams. But it will also focus on current problems, self-defeating tendencies, relationships and career goals. The therapist doesn't give advice per se, but is clearly engaged, asking questions, making connections and helping the patient achieve insights and, ultimately, positive changes.
"People who go into therapy know the process is going to take a long time, but they still want instant feedback," said Doug Garr, a Manhattan author and editor who has seen three therapists since 1982. "You don't want to lose your mind before you regain it."
In general, psychotherapy today tends to fall into two broad categories: a highly focused treatment that tackles a specific symptom by directly modifying thinking and behavior versus a more global, psychoanalytical approach that seeks to affect a major personality change by expanding insight.
The first approach zeros in on a particular problem or unwanted behavior -- a phobia or creative block, say -- and attempts to correct it. It does this not by looking into the psyche for root causes but by taking a pragmatic tack, involving homework assignments and mental exercises, to change thinking and behavior right now. Cognitive, behavioral and short-term therapies all work this way, and because they tend to move quickly -- and cost less -- they have become the darlings of the managed-care industry.
Dr. Russ Newman of the American Psychological Association said the public was warming to the swifter style of therapy, too. "Taking the economics out of it, I suspect that people are more immediate results-oriented, more symptom-focused, more behavior-focused today than probably they were 15 or 20 years ago," said Dr. Newman, the association's executive director for professional practice.
But many believe that for permanent, pervasive changes in both outlook and behavior, a deeper, longer-term plumbing of the mind, emotions and unconscious works best. For that, there are seemingly infinite schools and approaches, from the waning orthodox Freudian perspective (where the daily couch is de rigueur and the Oedipus complex looms large) to mainstream Freudian analysis (with couch optional, once or twice a week, and there's more interaction) to a number of distinct offshoots of Freud that drop many of the sexual theories in favor of others. Then there are Gestalt therapy, existential psychology, the humanistic approach, and many others that don't spring directly from Freud but still seek to boost insight into the causes of behavior by exploring repressed thoughts and memories.
But one trend that may make things somewhat easier for the consumer is the evolution over the years of an "eclectic" point of view, in which therapists shed a rigid theoretical orientation and instead draw on several different approaches, depending on the patient's needs.
"Once you are talking about a theory, you are talking about a very specific lens and certain things will be exaggerated and others will be minimized," said Dr. Beverly M. Rubinstein, a Greenwich Village psychologist whose overarching approach is more analytical than behavioral. "To the extent that the patient is respected, all of the theories have to be secondary to the phenomenon. In geology, the phenomenon is the rock. In therapy, it's the patient."
Nonetheless, choosing a therapist can be a bewildering process. There are not only many kinds of therapies, but also different types of therapists: clinical social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. (Actually, anyone can hang out a shingle advertising "psychotherapy," but only these three professional categories are recognized by New York State's licensing boards, which uphold standards and mete out punishment.)
 
NEW VIEW ON MEDICATION
 Clinical social workers have completed a two-year post-baccalaureate program. Psychologists have Ph.D.'s., usually earned after four to six years of study. And psychiatrists are full medical doctors. None of the three types are limited to any one approach, but psychiatrists are the only ones who can prescribe medications like Prozac, the antidepressant of the decade. However, social workers and psychologists usually have relationships with psychiatrists who will write a prescription after a consultation.
In the last 10 years it has become more common for patients to take medication for depression or anxiety. The thinking used to be that if moods were lifted "artificially," people would be less inclined to explore the causes of psychological pain, but the opposite view seems to hold sway today.
That is especially true of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, like Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Luvox, which have fewer side effects than the older generation of tricyclic antidepressants and have proved remarkably effective. For anxiety, Xanax seems to be the drug of choice.
"People take the medication and find they're able to work better in therapy," said Dr. Clark Sugg, a psychiatrist and director of clinical services at the William Alanson White Institute on the Upper West Side. "They begin to have hope and see that things can be different, and it sparks curiosity. It's almost as if you wake up from a dream."
Many health insurance plans do not cover psychotherapy, only psychiatric care in a hospital setting. But those that do usually require some co-payment and authorize a set number of sessions, like 15 or 20. The therapist can request another set of sessions by detailing the patient's inner turmoil; the notes are then reviewed by bureaucrats who often have little or no mental-health training. Therapists commonly warn patients that although those notes are supposed to be confidential, once they leave their offices there is no guarantee they won't come back to haunt the patient.
It is almost impossible to self-diagnose and choose the one therapeutic niche for you. But just about everyone agrees that individuals with phobias respond best to cognitive-behavioral therapy. Individual personality matters, too. Some people are just more comfortable with a pragmatic, focused approach; others may find it absolutely cathartic to speak in great depth.
 
FINDING A GOOD MATCH
 Most therapists suggest the prospective patient get a few names from friends, family members or trusted co-workers and then shop around. Don't hesitate to ask the therapist: What kind of therapy do you do? What does that mean? How does it work? How long will it take? How much will it cost?
The mantra of most therapists, interestingly, is for the prospective patient to find a good personality match. Even if you can't put a finger on it, if the therapist's personality rubs you the wrong way, keep looking. The therapist should seem caring and attentive and should put you at ease. A sense of humor can't hurt. "There are certainly people in my field -- social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists -- who are real zombies socially," one psychiatrist confided.
There are, to be sure, bad therapists out there. One family therapist, Dr. Neil Maron, said he knew of a psychologist who gives her excess patients to her husband, a salesman, for therapy. Group therapy is known among practitioners to attract the occasional aspiring cult leader to its fray. And, yes, there are therapists who fall asleep during sessions, breach confidentiality or become sexually involved with patients.
Even with a competent therapist, the talking cure can be far from a panacea. "Sometimes, when you understand why you're doing things, it makes things worse," said a woman in her 40's who works in the art world and who refused to be identified. "They say that too much knowledge is not necessarily a good thing, and I think that's true of self-knowledge."
Other patients complain of sounding like a broken record, feeling incapable of acting on their insights and growing emotionally dependent on the therapist, afraid to ever end the relationship. Many worry about all the money they're spending, money that could go into savings or into pleasurable -- and possibly even therapeutic -- activities like travel or continuing education.
Even some therapists think the 20th century could take some lessons from earlier eras, when people struggled with painful emotions and awkward personality traits on their own. "I don't think everyone requires therapy in this generation," said Dr. Maron, president of the Center for Marital and Family Therapy in New York City. "In fact, I think people are over-therapized."
When therapy spawns obvious changes, however, it can be exhilarating. Mr. Garr said he had a volatile temper before working on it in therapy. "It hasn't cured it totally, but it has helped," he said. "I can do a lot of self-adjustment in midstream. The smallest thing used to set me off. Now nothing is so bad that I can't cope with it."
 
 
 
How to File A Complaint
 Psychologists and certified social workers in New York State are licensed and disciplined by the state's Department of Education. Psychiatrists are also licensed by the department but are disciplined by the state's Department of Health. In all cases, an investigation begins once an official complaint form is submitted.
A patient may file a complaint against a psychologist or certified social worker by contacting the Education Department's Office of Professional Discipline at (800) 442-8106. Two of the most common complaints are breach of confidentiality and sexual abuse.
Last year the state found substantial evidence of misconduct in 31 cases involving psychologists and 11 cases involving certified social workers. Punishments ranged from a reprimand to revocation of the license.
To file a complaint against a psychiatrist, contact the Health Department's Office of Professional Medical Conduct at (518) 474-8357. Last year the agency took disciplinary action -- usually suspension or revocation of license -- against 30 psychiatrists for violations ranging from sexual abuse to the inappropriate prescription of drugs.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Japan Catches Up In Bank Failures

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THOSE who despair that America's economy has surrendered its leadership to Japan can take heart. In at least one big area, Japan is scrupulously imitating one of the landmark American business events of the 1980's: banking disasters.
Nearly five years after Washington came to grips with the full horror of the $500 billion savings-and-loan collapse, Japanese banks and thrifts are following suit as precisely as if executives had studied a how-to manual by Charles Keating Jr. 
 In Japan as in the United States, the biggest culprits are thrift institutions that were originally conceived to promote the conservative goals of saving and home ownership. In both countries, these institutions became go-go banks that attracted large sums by paying high interest rates. And then, in Japan as in the United States, they used these deposits to underwrite dubious shopping malls, vacation resorts and office complexes.
In both countries, government ultimately contributed to the problem by helping hedge the risks through low-priced deposit insurance. Government-backed deposit insurance guarantees that bank or credit union customers will be kept whole, even if a financial institution goes bankrupt. But the American savings-and-loan crisis overwhelmed the industry's insurance fund in the 1980's, and now Japan has temporarily wiped out its own insurance fund with the two recent bailouts.
No one yet knows the full scale of the problem here, but it is Texas-sized at a minimum. Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance shut down Kizu Credit Cooperative, the nation's biggest credit union, and a large regional bank; between them, they had roughly $16 billion in uncollectable loans. And those were only a tiny fraction of the total problem: Government officials estimate that Japan's financial institutions have about $400 billion in problem loans, and other analysts suspect the real total is much higher. Even by conservative estimates, the loans now in arrears roughly equal the estimated capital of the country's banks and other financial institutions.
 
Prolonging Recession
 No one thinks Japan's financial system is about to collapse, but the problems are enough to delay the country's recovery from recession, and a few of the biggest banks could be hurt badly.
What is most striking, however, is how similar this debacle is to America's savings-and-loan crisis.
The Osaka-based Kizu Credit Cooperative could have come straight from the S.&L. textbook. It was chartered as an employee credit union and was innocuous until the late 1980's. But then Japan's high real estate prices began to soar to astronomic levels as economic expansion left too much money chasing too few domestic investments.
Meanwhile, the Government decided to give credit unions a break, and let them offer whatever interest rates they wanted. It was a bow to deregulation, somewhat like what occurred in the United States when Congress began letting savings-and-loan institutions invest more freely in order to compete with banks.
Kizu, much like Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan, began to grow at a blistering pace. It offered top interest rates on big time-deposits, much as Lincoln had attracted money through certificates of deposit. (Lincoln financed splashy resorts with such high-interest securities before the enterprise collapsed; eventually, Mr. Keating was convicted of fraud.)
Kizu's deposits mushroomed between 1988 and 1995, from about $2.2 billion to $12 billion. Its volume of real estate lending climbed at roughly the same rate. But Japan's economy began to stall in the early 1990's. Annual growth slowed to about one percent and real estate prices collapsed. Today, property prices in many areas are less than half what they were; thus, a great many doubtful loans have become uncollectable.
One more similarity between the Japanese and American crises seems likely to emerge: cronyism. The American crisis was replete with cases of self-dealing, in which thrift executives siphoned off money in bonuses and lent to projects sponsored by close friends. In Japan, the Government recently raised alarms about the fact that executives at nearly half the nation's credit unions had outside business interests.
 
Why They Slept
 In hindsight, the dangers were obvious. But why didn't Japanese regulators and bank executives wake up earlier, particularly given the highly publicized American problems? "Objectively speaking, the situations were the same," said Toru Nakakita, professor of economics at Toyo University. But, he said, Japanese experts did not really understand that financial de-regulation would inevitably create both losers and winners. "In Japan, there was this myth that banks never go bankrupt, Professor Nakakita said. "The managers believed that as long as they took the same steps as all the others, they would never go bankrupt."
After remaining quiet for months as signs of trouble became steadily more acute, the Ministry of Finance and Japan's central bank took their first concrete actions by shutting down Kizu and liquidating the Hyogo Bank, based in Kobe.
The Government is now trying to deal with the problem in a classic Japanese attempt at collaboration. Instead of simply bailing out the bad loans with massive amounts of public money, as the United States finally did, Government officials here are leaning on Japan's biggest banks to put up most of the necessary capital. But the big banks are balking, and they have their own problem loans to worry about.
Regardless of who supplies the money, the amount needed will almost certainly make it harder for Japan to bounce back from its recession. That would be bad news for other countries, because it means Japan is less likely to import foreign products or to invest overseas.
But the banking crisis also rebuts the popular wisdom that Japan can somehow defy the laws of economics and of human sense. It turns out that Japanese, like Americans, have been able to fall victim to the same timeless traps: the lure of quick profits and the false certainty that what was true yesterday will be true tomorrow.
Maybe someone else can learn that lesson for the future.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Foes Use NATO Bombing to Press Him

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Seeking to turn what they called an international humiliation into a domestic campaign issue, nationalists, Communists and some moderates in the Russian Parliament today demanded that President Boris N. Yeltsin suspend Russia's cooperation agreement with NATO because of its bombing of the Bosnian Serbs over Russia's objections.
In a special session of the lower house called to consider Russia's position on Bosnia, the legislators passed a nonbinding resolution that called for Russia to suspend the NATO agreement and demanded the dismissal of Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev. 
 The resolution passed by a vote of 258 to 2 in a session boycotted by most of the more liberal politicians in the 450-member lower house. It also called for a unilateral lifting of the trade embargo on Serbia and for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
Mr. Yeltsin did not immediately respond, but seems unlikely to suspend Russia's agreement with NATO. It is unclear whether the political pressure might force him to adopt a more confrontational stance in dealing with the United States and its European allies, or whether it might force him to dismiss Mr. Kozyrev, who critics say is too sympathetic to NATO's position on Bosnia. Mr. Kozyrev was in Greece during the parliamentary debate.
The message from the nationalists and Communists, that Russia is being denied its rightful place as a superpower, was a familiar one. But with the campaign for parliamentary elections in December gearing up, a broad array of politicians took the session as an opportunity to apportion blame for Russia's loss of international influence and to establish their nationalist credentials with an electorate that shows little enthusiasm for the current Government.
Gennadi Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, called the situation in the former Yugoslavia "an obvious failure of Russian foreign policy" and described Mr. Kozyrev as the "minister of national disgrace."
Mr. Yeltsin has been broadly supportive of the latest American-led peace proposal for Bosnia while sharply criticizing American dominance of NATO and its bombing campaign in what was once a Soviet sphere of influence.
Anticipating the tenor of today's debate, Mr. Yeltsin had used increasingly harsh language to criticize NATO over the last several days, warning on Friday that an eastward expansion of the alliance could bring "a conflagration of war throughout Europe." He also criticized the Foreign Ministry's performance under Mr. Kozyrev. Mr. Yeltsin said "conclusions would be drawn" if the ministry's performance did not improve.
Outside of the parliamentary session, politicians said the electorate might not care about the particulars of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and that some of the more extreme statements from the debate could be dismissed as posturing.
But they said the nationalistic fears raised by Russia's isolation over the issue could work powerfully to the advantage of the loose grouping of nationalist, Communist and agrarian parties that dominates the tone of the Parliament and has limited but increasing influence over the Government. At a time of economic and social upheaval, voters are clinging to their pride in Russian power and stature in the world, they said.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS DRAW PLAN FOR SLOWING MEDICARE GROWTH

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
In a Medicare plan to be unveiled next week, Republicans expect to propose increasing most premiums, imposing annual limits on the growth of the program and reducing payments to doctors, hospitals and suppliers.
Republicans said their plan would also propose slowing the growth of Medicare by encouraging elderly people to join health maintenance organizations. 
 In interviews this week, the Republicans provided a fairly full account of their proposals. They said that beneficiaries would have a much wider choice of health plans and that the Government would contribute a fixed amount to the plan chosen by each beneficiary.
Republicans said they had backed away from their initial proposals to create strong financial incentives for elderly people to join H.M.O.'s and other forms of managed care, which seek to control costs by limiting patients' choice of doctors and hospitals. Democrats had said those incentives would amount to financial coercion. Republicans said they would still try to encourage the voluntary use of H.M.O.'s.
Although the political stakes for both parties are immense, Republicans say the risks for them are smaller than they once thought because they believe that many elderly people have been convinced that Medicare is not sustainable in its current form and must be thoroughly redesigned.
Lawmakers say the real battle lies ahead, as Republicans set forth details of their plan to cut projected spending on Medicare by $270 billion, or 14 percent, in the next seven years. Republicans and Clinton Administration officials agree that if there is no change in current law, Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays hospital bills for the elderly, will probably run out of money in 2002. That is nine years before members of the huge baby boom generation begin to qualify for Medicare.
But Democrats say the Republican plan goes far beyond what is necessary to preserve the trust fund. They assert that much of the money squeezed from Medicare would be used by the Republicans to help balance the budget and to finance tax cuts for affluent people.
House Democratic leaders say they will not negotiate on Medicare until Republicans abandon the idea of cutting taxes for people with annual incomes of more than $100,000. The Democrats, who failed to pass sweeping health care legislation last year, when they controlled both houses of Congress, have not offered a comprehensive alternative to the Republicans' Medicare proposals this year.
Tony Blankley, press secretary for Speaker Newt Gingrich, said the Republicans would probably introduce their proposals in a comprehensive Medicare bill next Thursday or Friday.
About 10 percent of the 37 million Medicare recipients are in H.M.O.'s, and the Republicans say they still want to encourage the use of such health plans. "But we don't intend to force people into managed care, directly or indirectly," said Representative James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania, one of eight House Republicans drafting the party's proposals with Mr. Gingrich.
House Republicans are seriously considering several proposals that would directly affect Medicare recipients. One would increase premiums for more affluent beneficiaries. Another would increase premiums for all beneficiaries except those with very low incomes.
"Means-testing is very acceptable," said Representative Dan Miller, Republican of Florida, who suggested that elderly people with incomes over $75,000 would pay the higher premiums. Under current law, all Medicare beneficiaries, except those with very low incomes, pay the same premium, $46.10 a month.
Premiums now account for 31 percent of the cost of Part B of Medicare, which covers doctors' services and is financed mainly with general revenues. Under a quirk in current law, the premium would drop to $43.70 next year. Merely keeping premiums high enough to cover 31 percent of Part B costs would generate $50 billion to $60 billion in additional revenue for Medicare over the next seven years.
Republicans have also drafted proposals that would require beneficiaries to pay some of the cost of home health care and clinical laboratory services and more of the cost of doctors' services and skilled nursing homes. But Republicans said they might shy away from these ideas, knowing that such proposals would make juicy targets for critics.
Political pressures have prompted the Republicans to soften the impact of their proposals on beneficiaries. As a result, more of the proposed savings will be extracted from doctors and hospitals.
"Hospitals don't vote; seniors do," said Thomas A. Scully, president of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,700 investor-owned hospitals. "Every day," he said, "we learn more about how the Republicans will whack providers and spare beneficiaries. The balance is being skewed."
Some lobbyists for the elderly said they feared that the Republican proposals would encourage doctors, hospitals and health plans to shift costs to beneficiaries by charging them more. But spokesmen for the elderly from more conservative groups, like the Seniors Coalition, welcomed the Republican proposals, saying they would increase the health insurance alternatives available to Medicare beneficiaries.
Returning to Washington after a four-week summer recess, House Republicans said that constituents were surprisingly willing to accept major Medicare changes to guarantee the solvency of the program.
"I found people to be open-minded about what we are doing," said Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. "I had thought there would be more concern, more protest."
Representative Bill Martini, Republican of New Jersey, said: "In my district, there was very strong sentiment in favor of voluntary participation in H.M.O.'s. Contrary to some of our concerns before we went back home, seniors understand that there is a serious problem."
But Democrats are preparing a full-scale assault on the Republican plan, denouncing it as the latest in a long series of Republican efforts to undermine Medicare.
Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, co-chairman of the Health Care Task Force of the House Democratic Caucus, said, "Seniors will be rightly upset when they understand the Republican proposals because the only way to achieve such big savings is by forcing seniors into H.M.O.'s or by requiring them to spend more out of pocket."
House Republicans said their Medicare plan would be subject to change until it is formally announced. But, they said, these are likely to be its main elements:
* The Government would, for the first time, impose annual limits on the growth of Medicare spending. From 1995 to 2002, average spending for each beneficiary would rise 40 percent, to $6,700 from $4,800. Under current law, it would grow 67 percent, to $8,000 in 2002, assuming the Treasury provided the money to pay the claims and prevent the exhaustion of the hospital trust fund.
* The Government would contribute a fixed amount to the health plan chosen by each beneficiary. Patients would presumably shop for plans offering the best care at the lowest prices because they would receive rebates if they chose plans charging less than the Federal payment.
* Medicare would curb payments to doctors, hospitals and other suppliers of goods and services to save $110 billion over seven years. Congress would, for example, reduce the amounts allowed to hospitals for inflation, graduate medical education, construction of buildings, purchases of new equipment and the special costs of treating large numbers of indigent patients. Such cutbacks have been on the standard list of policy options for more than a decade.
* If Medicare spending exceeded the targets set by Federal law, the Government would further reduce payments to doctors, hospitals and suppliers to save additional amounts, up to $80 billion over seven years. These cutbacks could be made automatically, without further action by Congress.
* Retirees could stay in health plans sponsored by their former employers, and the Government would pay most of the cost. But employers would not have to offer health insurance to current or former employees.
* The Government would encourage beneficiaries to report waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare by calling a toll-free telephone number. If the Government saved money, it would share the savings with informers.
Democrats say the initial reaction to the Republican plan is similar to the early euphoria over President Clinton's health plan in 1993, before people examined the details. Months of criticism by Republicans and health insurers, among others, turned public opinion against the Clinton plan. Democrats hope to block the Republicans' Medicare proposals in a similar way, and early criticism has already led to modifications of the Republican plan.
But the Democrats will have less time to make their arguments. The Medicare proposals will be part of a vast deficit-reduction bill. Republicans say they want to bring the bill to the House floor early next month, with Senate leaders hoping to act soon after that. Weeks of wrangling -- between the House and Senate, and between Congress and the White House -- may follow, so the bill's ultimate fate may not be resolved until November or December.

First Lady in Mongolia: Mare's Milk and Politics

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, Sept. 8

 BODY:
In this non-urban capital, where cows and pigs freely roam the streets, few of the inner-city problems so familiar to Americans are readily evident to visitors like Hillary Rodham Clinton, who stopped here on her way home from China.
Yet in the last few years, as Mongolia plunged into economic difficulties due to the sudden disappearance of economic aid from Russia and an inflation rate that reached 400 percent, a new crisis has emerged in Ulan Bator: street children. 
 Abandoned by parents who cannot support them, thousands of young children spend fierce Mongolian winters, when temperatures often dip under 40 degrees below zero, clustered in old box cars in Ulan Bator's train station and begging on the streets, Mongolian officials told Mrs. Clinton today.
During her 28-hour visit here, the First Lady went to a center for homeless children, where a few dozen children are given a place to eat and sleep and, perhaps, treatment for the skin diseases and malnourishment that are common among them.
In a ramshackle schoolhouse, with classrooms and hallways painted green and pink, a dozen young girls and boys assembled for Mrs. Clinton and sang a Mongolian rendition of "If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands," clapping, stomping and slapping their thighs.
Mrs. Clinton, followed through the building by a crew of American and Mongolian reporters, used the visit to make a plug for American aid to places like Mongolia.
"I think most Americans, if they knew the facts, would be very proud of our country because of what we're trying to do to help others around the world," Mrs. Clinton said.
She also referred to Mongolia's efforts to introduce democratic politics and a market economy, though evidence of American cultural influence hung on the center's walls as well: one drawing had the names of singers Janet Jackson and Jason Donovan scribbled over an imitation of characters from the Disney movie "The Jungle Book."
Mrs. Clinton announced that the United States would provide $1 million to Unicef to support children's health programs in Mongolia, some of which would go to the center.
 
When in Ulan Bator . . .
 Virtually no visitor to Mongolia can escape noticing the white tent-like dwellings that speckle the country's vast grasslands and that have lasted through the centuries because they can be easily taken down and moved, a major convenience if you're a nomad, as half of Mongolia's inhabitants are.
Known to Westerners as yurts, their Turkish name, they are called "gers" in Mongolia. Mrs. Clinton learned ger etiquette at the first of eight stops on her visit, the home of a typical-looking Mongolian family.
She dutifully circled the ger's hearth clockwise, sipped mare's milk, sniffed a snuff bottle and asked after the family's livestock.
In Mongolia, gers can pop up where you least expect them, even at the seat of Government, where Mrs. Clinton called on Prime Minister Jasrai.
After her 10-car motorcade pulled up at a large Soviet-like structure in the center of town, Mrs. Clinton was led through a towering entrance, down red-carpeted hallways and out a back door to where the Prime Minister awaited her -- in a ger.
About 25 feet in diameter, this ger was richly carpeted and graced with a chandelier and an enormous alabaster bust of Genghis Kahn.
At its center was a silver punch bowl of mare's milk, a drink that, as Mrs. Clinton already knew, has the foretaste of cow's milk and the aftertaste of rank sweat.
Since this was a ceremonial ger, for visiting dignitaries and important meetings, Mrs. Clinton was not offered mare's milk this time. She did not hesitate to tell of her visit to the family ger.
"I liked that ger so much," she told the Prime Minister. "I may have to put one up at the White House."
 
Meet the Mongolian Press
 For the 18 American reporters who accompanied Mrs. Clinton to Mongolia, her overnight visit overflowed with photo opportunities, but did not present much of what journalists call hard news.
But for Mongolian reporters, the First Lady's visit was one of the biggest news stories to come along in a while.
"Very big story, very big story," said Erdenetsogtyn Sonintogos of Ardyn Erkh, a leading Mongolian daily. "Top 10 of the year."
During a meeting at the children's center, Mrs. Clinton invited the reporters to ask questions of the director of the center, Khuushaan Baavgai.
Two American reporters asked about the plight of the children. Then Ms. Sonintogos stepped forward. "Will you run for President when your husband's term is completed?" she asked, evoking a laugh from Mrs. Clinton.
"Reporters are the same the world over," the First Lady said. "It must be something in the water."
Then she changed the subject.

HEADLINE: Gladys Dorman, Education Panelist And Lawyer, 84

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Gladys M. Dorman, a lawyer who served 20 years on the New York City Board of Higher Education, died on Thursday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 84.
As a girl growing up in Flatbush, Miss Dorman, who continued to use her maiden name throughout her professional career, became well acquainted with the law. 
 Her father, Benjamin Dorman, a leading figure in the Democratic Party in Brooklyn, worked his way up through the court system to become chief clerk of the Surrogate's Court in Brooklyn, where Miss Dorman practiced as an estate planner and wills litigator for more than 30 years. She was a partner of Raphael & Dorman with her husband, Benjamin R. Raphael, a Brooklyn Law School classmate whom she married in 1939. He died in 1992.
For all the family precedent, Miss Dorman, who received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1931, intended an academic career. But after she obtained a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1933, she switched to the law when a post she had been promised as an instructor at Brooklyn College evaporated in Depression economics.
She obtained her degree in 1936, and four years later was one of the first seven women elected to the Brooklyn Bar Association. In 1966, she became the first woman to serve as a trustee.
Miss Dorman's service on the Board of Higher Education, the governing body of the city colleges, began with an interim appointment by Mayor William O'Dwyer in 1949.
Miss Dorman was a member of the board's executive committee and chairwoman of the board's Brooklyn College administrative committee.
She is survived by two sons, both lawyers, Stephen M. Raphael of Brooklyn and Allan H. Raphael of Oak Park, Ill.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

HEADLINE: Look, Cars! Rare Species Sighted in Laos

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM 

DATELINE: BOTEN, Laos

 BODY:
The road into this remote Laotian village of thatched huts and wooden shacks cuts through mountains that are home to many of Southeast Asia's tigers and elephants.
This is a region where few people move on wheels, bicycles included, where it is not uncommon to see elephants transporting people or goods, even in the one-street provincial capital. Luang Namtha Province is one of the poorest in a country classified by the United Nations as one of the world's least developed. Electricity is available only in the capital, also named Luang Namtha, for two hours a day on good days. 
 The province's 130,000 inhabitants are splintered into 32 ethnic minority groups that share one trait: they are largely illiterate and hardly take part in the money economy.
So Boten would not seem to be a place for lots filled with new and used cars for sale. Yet it has the largest, perhaps the only, car market in a region that embraces some of the most remote parts of Laos, China, Myanmar and Vietnam.
On a recent visit, lots containing several hundred cars were seen stretching for more than 10 miles along the curving, rutted road from a Laotian customs office to the Chinese border village of Bohan, which begins where Boten ends. At one lot, two teen-agers guarded a few dozen new South Korean and Japanese cars. Carrying air rifles, which they hoped would deter bandits, not unknown in these mountains, the two lamented that business was slow.
Laotian salesmen and customs officials said the Chinese authorities seemed to be getting tough on the freewheeling trade. The only customers are the newly rich of southern China, who can afford to pay $20,000 to $40,000 in American dollars or Chinese yuan for a car -- still in short supply in China -- plus $1,000 to $2,000 to Chinese customs officials, a Laotian seller said.
He pleaded ignorance about whether the customs payment was official duty or a bribe, but a better customs deal is thought to be one of the attractions of the local car mart.
The dealer explained the circuitous route that the cars take. They originate in many places, including the United States, which produces Japanese cars with left-hand steering, suitable for China.
They are all shipped to Bangkok and are driven across Thailand to Vientiane, the Laotian capital. For a transit fee of about $1,360, the cars are admitted into Laos, bearing no license plates. The most difficult trek is over this country's wretched roads to Boten, a two-day, one-night haul that costs the seller about $130 and a few dollars for a plane ticket back to Vientiane for the driver.
The border trade became possible only after the Soviet Union, in its decline, relaxed its stern hold over this weak country. Now the border is open with virtually no formalities for Chinese and Laotians. Bohan, which barely existed a decade ago, has become a booming place of shops offering a wide range of cheap Chinese consumer goods to Laotians, whose country produces few items of daily necessity.
The village resembles a construction site, with a long row of shops newly built and another row nearing completion. So relaxed is life on the border that Laotian officials had no difficulty persuading the Chinese border police to waive their strict regulations and let an American accompanying them spend the day in China even though he had no visa.

HEADLINE: For Gay Zimbabweans, a Difficult Political Climate

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe

 BODY:
"Oh, my God, I can't believe it! I've been ripped off!"
Leonard, a 37-year-old professional man and locally well-known Diana Ross imitator, had discovered that the penalty for letting a young man you barely know stay in your apartment is the same all over the world: his television and CD player were gone. 
 Adding insult to injury, the thief had tacked his picture to the bookcase. Daniel, a good-looking young South African sponger, had fled.
The manhunt that consumed the next two hours was a whirlwind tour of gay Harare's hangouts: hair-dressing salons, florist shops and bars. Throughout it, Leonard agonized about whether he dared go to the authorities: "I can't. I hate the police. Oh, but I should!"
This is no small quandary in a country where the President, whose word carries enormous weight, has recently embarked on a relentless barrage of words against those he calls "sodomists and perverts."
President Robert Mugabe has said publicly that homosexuals have no legal rights. He has called them "worse than dogs and pigs," and sneered at a letter of protest signed by 70 American Congressmen, saying, "Let the Americans keep their sodomy, bestiality -- stupid and foolish ways."
But Mr. Mugabe's campaign has not -- or not yet -- reached the street.
"Gay bashing goes on only at the highest political level," said a local journalist. "There's a good deal of tolerance on the ground."
Mr. Mugabe's startling outbursts are widely assumed to be politically motivated. Even though his ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Popular Front, has a hammerlock on Parliament, he faces an election next year. And he would love to distract voters' attention from an economy hurt by drought, a swollen military budget and the bleeding of the public purse by corrupt officials. Mr. Mugabe is also a devout Catholic raised in the conservative culture of the Shona people.
Gay-bashing seems to work for him much the way it does for Jesse Helms: the newspapers are full of letters praising his stand. In some ways, Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Helms have similar constituencies: Zimbabwe is a nation of farmers, tobacco is a major crop and American fundamentalist preachers like Pat Robertson have big followings here via radio.
The fear is that Mr. Mugabe's words will inspire violence. In the past, the President has lashed out at stockbrokers and said that wealthy white farmers have "hearts as hard as Jews." But it stopped there. Nothing was nationalized, no one arrested.
But homosexuals are nervous about the party's Women's League, who wear dresses with Mr. Mugabe's picture on them and sing for visiting dignitaries. In black townships during the 1985 and 1990 elections, they broke into the homes of people supporting the opposition, beat them and threw their belongings in the street. Mr. Mugabe has made speeches recently suggesting they tie up homosexuals and bring them to the police.
Zimbabwe's atmosphere was not always anti-gay. There were gay clubs even before the 1980 transition from white-ruled Rhodesia, and in the mid-1980's a gay wedding was on the front pages. Harare has its own Central Park Ramble: the Botanical Gardens are a cruising spot, as is Cecil Square.
(Cecil Rhodes, the founder of Rhodesia, is widely assumed to have been gay. He lived with Neville Pickering, the first secretary of the De Beers Corporation, in a friendship described by the Imperial Secretary of Cape Town as "absolutely lover-like.")
A gay rights group, Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, was formed. Drag fashion shows to benefit people with AIDS were no secret.
Problems arose only when the Government was consulted. State censors refused to let the gay group import "Maurice," a fairly sedate film about a gay man, and it could not advertise dances or counseling because the party controls every paper "except The Financial Gazette, and that's not exactly our target audience," said one gay rights advocate.
In July the climate abruptly worsened. Saying that "they have absolutely no rights whatsoever," Mr. Mugabe banned the gay group's bookstand from an international human rights book fair here. The Minister of Information told the group to take down its banner, saying, "We don't allow protest in our country." The Minister of Home Affairs threatened arrests, though homosexuality is not a crime here. (Sodomy is.)
Interestingly, after the threats, the police stayed calm.
"They said, 'Don't hand out any literature, but you can talk to people,' " said Luke, another drag queen and a protester at the fair.
The questions that visitors to the book fair asked Luke show just how little-known homosexuality is in Shona and Ndebele society, where sex is discussed only with older relatives. "They asked things like, 'How many organs do you have?' " Luke said.
"Africans can accept a feminine man," said Leonard. "They believe that a spirit medium might get into you. But when it comes to the sex part, it becomes confusing."
That ignorance has voters believing Mr. Mugabe when he says homosexuality is a white vice imported with British colonialism.
But Leonard says that most of the 800 or so men in Harare's gay scene are black. And academic evidence undercuts Mr. Mugabe. Shona takes its modern vocabulary from English, but there is a traditional Shona word for homosexuality -- ngochani.
Gay African men are relatively lucky, Leonard said. At least they live in a male-dominated society. "Black lesbians have the hardest time," he said. "They can't earn money to get away."
He said he knew of a lesbian whose family locked her up and had a man rape her so she would get pregnant. After she ran off and had an abortion, they caught her and did it again. "Now she has the baby and is forced to live with this man," he said.
For Leonard, the price of his sexual orientation was not so high.
To his own amazement, he actually caught his thief, pulling him off a bus about to leave for South Africa. Then he lost him: Handing over his suitcase for security, Daniel begged to be allowed to run across the street and get his bus ticket refunded -- and then jogged off into the darkness. His suitcase held only some old clothes and a tape of the last "Mr. U.K." contest.
In the end, Leonard did go to the police. Since he had the picture and Daniel had apparently also sweet-talked the Sheraton Hotel out of hundreds of dollars' worth of room service, the officers treated Leonard as nothing less than a solid citizen.
In Zimbabwe, gay culture is so little known and men stay with male friends so frequently that it probably never occurred to the police that Leonard -- whose mannerisms, clothes and moussed hair would have screamed "gay" to the police in New York -- was one of those "perverts" the President had denounced.

HEADLINE: Conservative Christian Group Ends Conference With a Dual Identity

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Looking out with satisfaction at an audience of thousands of churchgoing, politically energized members of the Christian Coalition, Ralph Reed, the group's executive director, declared, "We have gained what we have always sought -- a place at the table."
In fact, the coalition, which ended its two-day conference here today, has reached a pinnacle of power in Republican politics, largely through Mr. Reed's carefully constructed two-pronged strategy. The group has broadened its base and won widespread backing from Republicans in Congress by toning down its oratory in recent years, emphasizing economic issues as much as social ones and even backing moderate Republican candidates. At the same time, the coalition has continued to stir up the faithful in the grass roots with unfettered attacks on President Clinton, homosexuals and abortion rights leaders, through mailed fund-raising appeals. 
 Now, as the coalition, with 1.7 million members, seeks to maintain and expand its political pull, its challenge is whether it can satisfy both constituencies and position itself as a mainstream organization without turning off the loyalists it is counting on to turn out at the polls.
"The Christian right finds itself torn between the pragmatism of its leaders and the purism of its followers," Mark J. Rozell, a political science professor at Mary Washington College, and Clyde Wilcox, a professor of government at Georgetown University, write in a book due out this fall on religious conservatives. "Movement leaders may find it difficult to convince the movement's activist core to volunteer on behalf of moderate Republicans year after year, especially if they receive no more policy payoffs than were offered by Reagan.
"Conversely," the authors continued, "if the movement resorts to the purist strategies of nominating candidates who are closely associated with or members of the Christian right, it is almost certain to lose."
The struggle within the Christian Coalition was evident at the group's annual convention. Mr. Reed and Pat Robertson, who founded the organization after his failed bid for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1988, stayed clear of the brand of militant oratory that had offended many of the more moderate Republicans at the party's 1992 convention in Houston.
As part of that effort to make the organization more palatable to all Republicans, Mr. Robertson -- who has a well-documented history of saying things that his opponents deride as extremist -- has ceded the public stage largely to the polished Mr. Reed, who espouses more mainstream views. One admirer of Mr. Reed's political skills is Lieut. Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican who told the convention, "He could sell an N.R.A. membership to Bill Clinton -- that's how good he is."
Like the group's leaders, two Republican Presidential candidates who appeared at the convention today were also tame in their speeches. Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana presented himself as having "Cal Ripken-like values" and made a plea "to challenge the morality of gambling."
And former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee took a mild swipe at a competitor for the nomination, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who once said he was running for President, not preacher. Mr. Alexander did not cite the Senator by name, but said, "At this time in our history, I'm not so sure that it wouldn't help if our President of the United States, the first President of the next century, were not a little bit of a preacher."
But any attempt by the coalition to keep contentious social issues from creeping into the program was shattered by other speakers who did not hesitate to charge up the audience with issues like abortion.
Phyllis Schlafly, a longtime leader of abortion opponents, told the group this morning it should demand that a Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate preserve the Republican Party's platform supporting a constitutional amendment banning abortion. Her comments drew an ovation, even though the coalition backed many Republicans in last year's Congressional races who did not support an outright prohibition on abortion.
Though Mr. Reed has called for the Republican ticket to be anti-abortion, Mrs. Schlafly went further and described abortion as "the central moral issue of our time."
"It is not enough that a candidate will tell you they have a pro-life record," she said. On Friday, Mr. Gramm tried to capitalize on such sentiments, reminding the group that Senator Bob Dole, another Republican Presidential candidate, had declined to sign a pledge to maintain the party's commitment to a constitutional amendment banning abortion.
Mrs. Schlafly took on prominent Republicans who favor abortion rights, singling out Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, both Presidential candidates, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who is often cited as a Vice Presidential prospect. "Even though these people have big names and great access to the media," she said, "we are not going to let the Arlen Specters, the Christine Whitmans or the Pete Wilsons take the pro-life platform out of the Republican platform."
But some analysts note that an aggressively anti-abortion ticket could put off voters in the general election -- or trigger a counter-mobilization from liberal groups.
Another risk facing religious conservative leaders is the nomination of a candidate whom they deem acceptable, like Mr. Dole or Mr. Gramm, but whom their membership will not support enthusiastically. The three Presidential prospects who most excited religious conservatives -- former Vice President Dan Quayle; William J. Bennett, a former Education Secretary and drug policy director, and Jack F. Kemp, a former Housing Secretary -- chose not to run.
Mary Erling, a coalition member from Great Falls, Va., said she did not think Mr. Dole, for example, was passionate enough about the abortion issue. "It makes me a little hesitant," said Mrs. Erling, who is 72. "He's definitely pro-life, but I don't agree that a woman's body is hers -- and I think he once made that statement."
John C. Green, a political science professor at the University of Akron and an authority on religious conservatives, said that in last year's campaign, "the Christian Right probably mobilized 4 million activists and reached 50 million voters -- a performance that rivals such traditional electoral powerhouses as the gun owners and labor unions." He also said that "probably no Republican candidate can win the Presidency without massive evangelical support."

HEADLINE: An Angry Man, Ugly Epithets, a Gun

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
It was a scene of terrifying ugliness on a New York City bus: a blustering, apparently drunken man with a beer bottle in a paper bag, pushing his way through the crowd, then confronting a man in a turban, an Indian-born medical doctor with six college degrees, a gentle, level-headed man who had always tried to avoid conflict.
They were aboard the northbound M-15 bus on First Avenue near 42d Street about 8:15 Friday night when the man came lurching and stumbling through the crowd, Dr. Kanwarjit Singh, a 40-year-old internist in residence at New York University Medical Center, recalled yesterday. 
 "As he was weaving his way through the bus, he bumped me, and began to yell at me, 'Respect my space! Respect my space!' " Dr. Singh said in an interview from a bed at Bellevue Hospital Center.
Dr. Singh's wife, Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer, who relayed some of her husband's version of his encounter with the stranger, said the man finally screamed at her husband: "Get out of my way, you Hindu . . ." ending with an obscenity.
"Of course," Ms. Dhillon said, "my husband is a Sikh, not a Hindu."
The aggressive man, who was black, continued to scream racial and ethnic slurs at Dr. Singh, his wife said, and when her husband silently backed away, the man raised his beer bottle as if to strike him.
That is when someone noticed the bulge in his waistband and shouted: "Gun! He's got a gun!"
The driver immediately pulled the bus to a stop on First Avenue and 45th Street, and riders spilled off in a panic to escape the danger. When the bus had cleared out, Dr. Singh and the man confronting him were left alone at the back, Ms. Dhillon said. The man blocked the doctor's way. The driver watched from the front.
"There was this 'High Noon' moment with him and me and the driver," Dr. Singh recalled.
Ms. Dhillon added: "He kept shouting about how he'd been insulted and wanted an apology. He says, 'Get down on your knees and apologize.' My husband made no attempt to comply. So the guy began to pull his gun and shot himself in the groin. He was very intoxicated, and when he shot himself he became completely infuriated. He emptied his gun at my husband."
All but one of the shots went wild. But one bullet struck Dr. Singh in the left chest, missing his heart but fracturing several ribs, passing through and collapsing his left lung and lodging in several fragments in his back, Ms. Dhillon said.
As Dr. Singh staggered off the bus and lay on the sidewalk, the assailant, bleeding from the groin, ran north on First Avenue and west on 47th Street to Second Avenue, where he was captured by a police officer who had heard his description on a radio and saw the suspect running. A .38-caliber revolver, its serial number filed off, was found in his possession, the police said.
The suspect, identified as 28-year-old Abu Muhammad, of 2110 First Avenue, was taken to Bellevue. Tests of blood samples taken on his arrival had found double the legal limit of alcohol for intoxication, Ms. Dhillon said.
Yesterday, after surgery, the doctor was listed in critical but stable condition, and the suspect, who was charged with attempted murder, was in serious but stable condition.
Little was known yesterday of Mr. Muhammad, who lives in a fourth-floor apartment in the East River Houses, a city project on First Avenue between 108th and 109th Streets. Rennis Wellman, a community advocate in East Harlem, said he had known Mr. Muhammad for 20 years since his family had moved into the neighborhood. He said the family had always been active in community affairs.
"Any time anybody needed anything from him, he was always there," Mr. Wellman said of Mr. Muhammad. "You're never going to hear anything bad about him." Told he had been charged with the shooting aboard the bus, he took a step back, apparently shocked. He said it seemed to him completely out of the realm of possibility.
Dr. Singh, who lives with his 26-year-old wife on East 86th Street, seemed in good spirits, despite his wounds, and said in the that he bore neither his assailant nor the city any ill will.
"I am an enthusiastic resident of New York," he said. "I am a citizen. I love this place. This is just the price of the ticket. It's a broad-shouldered city and we are a small ethnic group. If you live in a city like this, you have to live with a certain risk."
Asked if he had any bitterness toward the man who shot him, he said: "I prefer to think I had a providential escape. Things could have been much worse. I can truthfully say I bear him no bitterness."
Dr. Singh was described by his wife as a strong, athletic man who jogged regularly in Central Park, swam and went biking every week, and was in excellent health: a factor in his survival, for he had lost a great deal of blood when he reached the emergency room, she quoted doctors as saying.
"He's the most educated person I know," said Ms. Dhillon, herself a graduate of Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia Law School. She noted that they had met in 1993, when she was clerk to a Federal appeals court judge in Baltimore, and said she had never heard her husband even raise his voice to anyone.
She said: "He's really level-headed, sensitive, kind, very gentle. Very principled. He was not going to back down because he was challenged, but he avoids conflict. He doesn't ever win an argument with me. So that this could happen to him is shocking. He certainly had nothing to do with provoking it."
Dr. Singh, she said, was born and grew up in Punjab, India, one of three children of parents who were teachers. After high school, he attended St. Stephens College in New Delhi, majoring in physics and graduating in 1975 with a bachelor's degree. He then attended Oxford University in England for three years, and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in politics, philosophy and economics in 1979.
That year, he came to the United States, attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in 1981 earned a master's degree in business administration. After several years working as a business consultant in the Boston area, he came to New York and attended medical school at Columbia University, earning both his medical degree and a master's degree in public health in 1990.
After three years as a resident in surgery at the University of California at San Francisco, he returned to New York last year and began a new career -- a residency in internal medicine at the New York University Medical Center. He married his Ms. Dhillon, a corporate lawyer with Shearman & Sterling, about a year ago.
"He did a surgical residency in San Francisco, but after three years he decided to change his field to internal medicine," Ms. Dhillon said. "He wanted an easier life style. He wanted to settle down."
Ms. Dhillon said his residency in New York began in July last year and would normally have been a three-year term, but because of his previous experience he is to be allowed to complete the residency in two years. In recent months, he had been working at various hospitals, and since Sept. 1 has been working at the Veterans Affairs Hospital at 23d Street and First Avenue.
On Friday night, he called his wife about 7:30 and said he was heading home from the hospital. About 8, she said, he boarded the northbound M-15 bus on First Avenue at 23d Street. He took a seat near the front, but when two elderly women boarded, he gave up his seat and moved to the rear of what was becoming an increasingly crowded bus.
By the time the bus reached 42d Street, where Mr. Muhammad was believed to have stepped aboard, there were about 70 people on the bus, the police said, a situation ripe for conflict. The ensuing confrontation, though ugly with racial and ethnic overtones, was not fatal, and Dr. Singh said he had emerged psychologically unscathed.
"I've enjoyed every moment of New York," Dr. Singh said. "I feel myself a privileged member of this mosaic. It's more sorrow and grief that I feel than anger."

HEADLINE: New Study Rebuts Theory of a 'Brain Drain'

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Reports of a "brain drain" in Connecticut are unfounded, although the state is one of only four with population losses since 1990, said a study released this week.
Because of the weak economy, fewer people are moving into Connecticut while the number leaving the state has held fairly steady since the 1970's, said the report, which was based on Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service data. 
 The report rejected "a common misperception in the state that Connecticut has lost population for the past three years due to an overwhelming outflow of residents, including our 'best and brightest.' " It said those leaving the state are neither younger nor better educated than those who have left in the past.
Connecticut is one of four states that have lost population in at least one year since 1990. Two others are Rhode Island and Massachusetts, neighbors of Connecticut that share many of its economic problems. The fourth state is North Dakota.
The study was done by the C.P.E.C. Foundation, an affiliate of the nonpartisan Connecticut Policy and Economic Council.
Despite the report's conclusion that things are not as bad as many believed, the council's president, John J. Carson, warned, "Connecticut is losing economic activity that potentially it will never get back."
He said Connecticut had not recovered from the recent recession as well as the rest of the country and even its neighbor states. Connecticut has recovered only 14 percent of the nonfarm jobs it lost during the recession, compared with 40 to 100 percent in other New England states.
If the new jobs created at the Foxwoods Casino run by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians in Ledyard are not counted, Connecticut has regained none of the jobs it lost, said Stephen A. Clement, a senior researcher for the council.
The report recommended several steps to make Connecticut more attractive to industry, like cutting taxes and investing in education and training programs.
Connecticut's population -- taking into account births and deaths as well as migration -- has decreased three years in a row starting in 1992. In that year, the number of people leaving the state outnumbered those moving in by 31,300 -- roughly the population of Trumbull.
In 1993, the last year for which detailed figures were given, 106,829 people moved out of Connecticut -- only about 0.6 percent more than in 1987, when the economy was still strong. But in 1993, 76,962 moved in -- about 16.5 percent fewer than moved to the state in 1987.
The state's population is now estimated at 3,277,310, compared with 3,287,116 in the 1990 census.
Since at least 1985, the most popular destination of people moving out of Connecticut has been Florida, the report said. The other top destinations were New York, Massachusetts and California.
Polls have found that the most common reason for leaving Connecticut is the economy, said G. Donald Ferree, director of the Connecticut Poll and associate director for the Institute for Social Inquiry and the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut.
The report described the typical persons moving in and out of the state as similar -- about 30 percent have at least a high school diploma, about 35 percent are between 25 and 44, and at least 83 percent are employed. In 1992, those moving out had an average income about 4 percent higher than those moving in, the report found.
State Representative Jefferson B. Davis, who heads the Legislature's Planning and Development Committee, remarked: "One of the strengths of this study is to blast to smithereens the idea that it's just the unemployed and people looking for welfare benefits moving in, and it's the people with high education levels that are moving out."
The report found that cities continued to lose population in the 1980's while suburbs gained.

HEADLINE: Indian Bureau Sees 'Devastation' in Its Budget

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
The Bureau of Indian Affairs says that layoffs it plans because of cuts in its budget expected to be approved by Congress will gut its administrative staff and "wreak devastation" on tribes.
The bureau plans to eliminate at least 3,000 full-time and part-time positions, about a fourth of its work force, on the assumption that Congress will go ahead with a 15 percent budget cut approved by the Senate last month. 
 As many as 2,500 employees of tribes who run bureau programs under contract with the agency also could lose their jobs, officials of the bureau said.
The bureau provides a wide range of services to tribes, including welfare, law enforcement, education and management of natural resources. It is a major source of employment on reservations. Ninety percent of the employees who would lose their jobs are Indians, the officials said.
The layoffs, they said, will be spread through the bureau's field offices, its regional headquarters and two main offices in Washington and Albuquerque, N.M.
Eighty percent of the 650 full-time jobs in Washington and Albuquerque are to be eliminated, along with half the jobs in the bureau's area offices.
"This is a very sad and tragic time for American Indians and Alaska Natives," said Ada Deer, the Assistant Interior Secretary for Indian Affairs. She said the Senate-approved budget cut would amount to "economic and cultural genocide" and "wreak devastation" on tribes.
The Senate last month approved a 1996 budget of $1.47 billion for the bureau, 23 percent less than President Clinton had requested and 15 percent less than this year's budget of $1.73 billion.
In contrast, the House version of the bureau's 1996 budget is only 3 percent lower than the one for this year. A conference committee will work out the differences between the two.
The bureau's plans for layoffs will bring pressure on Congressional negotiators to soften the cuts. Tribal leaders have announced plans to hold a vigil at the Capitol next week to protest the reductions.
Ron Allen, chairman of Washington's Jamestown S'Kallam tribe, said bureau officials were "simply trying to cause the Indian community and the Congress to understand that the Senate proposal has some very serious consequences."
The layoffs and other effects of the budget cuts would "seriously cripple our essential governmental services and programs," Mr. Allen said.
Although the budget cut that is ultimately enacted may be smaller than the one the Senate approved, the bureau plans to send out layoff notices by Sept. 25. The longer employees stay on the payroll, the more layoffs will be necessary, the bureau's officials said.
The Senate Appropriations Committee said it had been led to propose major cuts in the bureau's budget to protect the Indian Health Service and Indian education programs.

Flatiron Flair: Capitalism Grows Its Own

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
CAPITALISM looks frenzied these days: The bulls rage on Wall Street, corporations merge and shed jobs at the drop of a stock price, and every financial twitch triggers a response in another time zone.
As an antidote, consider the story of "How to Get a Husband" pajamas, or how the cowboy wallpaper got on the wall of the men's room at the Chat 'n Chew restaurant on East 16th Street, or how Mark Randall landed the design work for a gay and lesbian television news program. 
 These are the kinds of business tales that abound in the Flatiron district around 23d Street and Broadway in Manhattan, where dozens of tiny young companies -- mostly in a niche of design, advertising or fashion -- are networking their hearts out, meeting and doing deals over panini sandwiches and cappuccino at Flavors, and in the street and inside the clanking elevators of their old industrial buildings.
Style is a statement here. Businessmen wear ties with their jeans, and women are seen in everything from art school black to billowing 1940's pleats. They all seem to know one another, forming a community that makes free enterprise look like the latest laid-back life style choice. In a neighborhood bracketed by the punked-out East Village and sleek-suited midtown, Flatironers borrow from both but give allegiance to neither.
O.K., so maybe they're not quite ordinary capitalists.
"HOW to Get a Husband" pajamas, for example, were invented by two women, Andrea Mantel and Susan Brown, who make up the entire work force of Smart Company of America, an 18-month-old startup that does business in a Broadway loft containing only a couple of desks and their collective creativity. The idea came from an old kitchen towel that Ms. Mantel picked up at a local flea market. Reworking the pattern with tongue-in-cheek humor and nostalgia, they licensed it to a manufacturer, and Bloomingdale's liked it enough to order some in time for Christmas.
Many of the jokes are strictly for the locals. One part of the pajama pattern features a tough-looking girl, drawn in a Betty Boop style, but straight from the 1990's East Village, with short dark hair and black clothes, slouching and smoking a cigarette. The text under the drawing advises husband seekers: "No boyish look."
"In the East Village they'd probably have tattoos up and down their arms and that would be the sexiest look," Ms. Mantel said. "It's such a hoot."
Andrew Silverman also knows the Flatiron state of mind. He lives on 18th Street, only a few blocks from the Flatiron building itself, which gives this neighborhood its punchy name and identity. Mr. Silverman owns six local restaurants, including a place scheduled to open next month on 18th Street modeled after a World War II-era soda fountain. The decor, he said, will feature 1940's wood paneling and chandeliers. The food, however, will be strictly Flatiron, circa 1995.
"Vegetarian friendly," he said. "You know: the Eurasian thing, the Thai thing, but affordable."
MR. SILVERMAN met Ms. Mantel of Smart Company on the street one day, resulting in the cowboy-inspired wallpaper (one of her company's designs) inside the Chat 'n Chew (one of his restaurants). Mr. Randall landed his design assignment after he kept running into Paul Aferiat on line for lunch at Flavors on West 18th. Mr. Aferiat is an architect who lives and works in a loft on Broadway, and whose business partner and roommate, Peter Stamberg, serves on the board of "In the Life," a gay and lesbian television news magazine on Broadway and 26th. Another done deal.
Such cozy mercantile relationships recall the old guild hall spirit of an earlier age of capitalism, when barter and personal webs of economic interdependence in communities were the norm. But the Flatiron didn't become what it is now without supplanting its forebears, either.
This is the part of New York once haunted, after all, by Andy Warhol. The building where he had his photo studio now houses a Herman's Sporting Goods. Local rock-and-roll landmarks like Max's Kansas City and the Fillmore East have been swept aside by new-wave commerce. The fierce winds buffeting larger corporations don't stop at the Flatiron's borders, either. A small interior design firm on Broadway was bought out not long ago by a larger company in the Midwest. Merged and gone, just like that.
"We used to cater their Christmas parties," Mr. Silverman said.
