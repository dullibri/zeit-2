HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Slide in Oil and Internet Shares Helps Stall Summer Rally

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
A summer rally stalled yesterday as concerns about stock valuations caused investors to sell shares that had strong gains in recent weeks.
Recent high-flying Internet shares and oil producers, weakened by falling crude oil prices, were at the center of the declines. After climbing as much as 59 points, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 6.73 points, to 9,085.04, with Chevron among the average's leading decliners. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.67 points, to 1,154.66, and the Nasdaq composite index slipped 1.36 points, to 1,908.11. 
 The Nasdaq composite index was weighed down by sizable declines in several Internet-related issues.
Lycos, which soared 20 1/2 on Monday after the company announced plans for a 2-for-1 stock split, plunged 14 9/16 yesterday, to 85. The stock had more than tripled this year, to 99 9/16 on Monday from a low of 33 1/8 on Jan. 9.
Other Internet shares, including America Online, Yahoo, Doubleclick and Earthlink, fell sharply. The shares had been rising recently on speculation about potential acquisitions or combinations.
Amazon.com, the Internet bookseller, fell 17 3/8, to 122 1/8. Still, the stock has risen more than 300 percent this year. As a result of such lofty gains, said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company, Amazon and other Internet shares were poised to fall as investors expressed skepticism about whether the stocks had become too expensive.
"I'm very nervous about it," Mr. Pradilla said about the gains. "Some of these companies are two years away from making money."
But there were some notable gains yesterday. Merrill Lynch rose 3 5/16, to 104 5/16, a 52-week high. The shares moved higher amid speculation that the company would split its stock, which would allow more individual investors to buy shares. Merrill officials declined to comment. Merrill last split its stock on May 30, 1997.
General Electric rose 3/4, to 92 5/8 -- a new high -- as it became the first American company with a market capitalization of more than $300 billion. Its market capitalization, or the value of its outstanding shares multiplied by its stock price, stood at $301.7 billion at the end of trading yesterday. So far this year, G.E. shares have gained more than 26 percent.
Such gains underscored the belief of some analysts that yesterday's declines would be short-lived and that the summer rally would soon resume.
"I don't think the summer rally is over yet," Mr. Pradilla said. His confidence is grounded in the current low interest rates and expectations that corporations will report strong second-quarter earnings.
James M. Griffin, senior vice president in charge of investment strategy at Aeltus Investment Management, said, "We're in a moment of everything going right, and the real risks to this balance are everything overseas" in Asia.
Some analysts, however, think American companies may have already felt the worst sting from Asia.
"I think the third quarter will be an important psychological turning point," said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Beginning in August and September, people will start to value stocks based on 1999 earnings."
And by September, the effect of economic measures enacted by the Japanese Government earlier this year should be apparent, he added.
"By the third quarter, we should have more answers than questions," Mr. Galvin said, "and if investors just think that we've started to hit a bottom, that's all we need to improve. Uncertainty is usually the worst side of the market."
In addition, shares of large domestic banks fell sharply during the fourth quarter of 1997 because of their exposure to Asia. That drag on profits should not happen again this year, he said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Paris Aghast at Mere Hint of U.S. Stake in the Tower

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 7

 BODY:
Sell the Eiffel Tower to the Americans? Mayor Jean Tiberi of Paris was as outraged at the idea today as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City might be at a suggestion that the Brooklyn Bridge was for sale.
"There is no risk to the ownership of this monument," Mr. Tiberi assured fellow Gaullists in a stormy City Council meeting this morning, after conservative renegades trying to unseat him spread the alarm that a subsidiary of GMAC, the financial arm of the General Motors Corporation, was on the verge of acquiring operating rights to the tower. 
 "It would be inconceivable and unacceptable for the tower to come under the control of an American group as its subsidiary," Philippe Dominati, another conservative, thundered as the renegades cheered.
GMAC Commercial Mortgage in Horsham, Pa., is indeed interested, along with the Bass brothers of Texas, in buying a 70 percent interest in the state-owned Credit Foncier de France. Credit Foncier owns half of a management company that has a 70 percent interest in the Eiffel Tower's operating company.
According to French law, the tower is the "inalienable" property of the City of Paris, which means aliens of any kind, including Americans, cannot buy it.
"I would imagine whoever is negotiating this for us on the ground is aware of that," said Scott Rombach, GMAC Commercial Mortgage's spokesman in Pennsylvania.
The 984-foot-high latticework tower, the highest in the world when Gustave Eiffel designed it for a centennial exposition in 1889, attracts almost as many tourists as Notre Dame. Its operations include a highly regarded restaurant, the Jules Verne, on its second "floor," and elevators that take tourists up to the most thrilling view in Paris.
Though the tower is not for sale, de Gaulle might have objected to the sale of Credit Foncier itself, which may not be the Eiffel Tower or the Arc de Triomphe but has serious credentials of its own. It was founded by decree of Louis Napoleon and financed Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann's vast remaking of Paris in the late 19th century, before entering the equally vast market for subsidized housing in the 20th.
But after the property market went sour in the 1990's, Credit Foncier lost $1.9 billion in 1996 and the conservative Government of the day let it be known that it was thinking of breaking it up and selling it.
Employees -- some of them civil servants who had been paid 16 monthly salaries a year, according to French accounts -- held the bank's chairman hostage for a few days in January 1997 in protest, and a few months later, voters threw out the conservatives and elected a Socialist-led Government, which continued to try to find a buyer for Credit Foncier.
GE Capital, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, decided against a bid, and the bank's unions agitated for a sale to the French post office. Now the question of whether the bank will be sold to GMAC and the Bass group is up to the Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is expected to make a decision later this month.
"The ball is in Dominique Strauss-Kahn's court," Jean-Antoine Giansily, one of the embattled allies of the Mayor, said today. Officials in Mr. Strauss-Kahn's office dismissed the whole matter as political posturing by conservatives desperate to hold onto power in the city but losing their grip after the mayor for nearly two decades, Jacques Chirac, became President of France three years ago.
A leading possible Socialist candidate for the mayor's job in the next election, in 2001, is Mr. Strauss-Kahn. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 14, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about an American group's proposed acquisition of a stake in Credit Foncier de France, which has an interest in the company that operates the Eiffel Tower, misidentified an American investor. It is the Bass Group, an investment group led by Robert M. Bass -- not the Bass brothers -- that is joining the GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation in buying the stake.

HEADLINE: New Low for High-End Hi-Fi

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
THE high end is in a funk.
These ought to be glory days for that peculiarly American obsession with the ultimate in stereo equipment. The numbers of the Wall Street and Silicon Valley wealthy multiply daily, seemingly increasing the potential customer base for monaural tube amplifiers at $34,000 a pair, an electrostatic speaker system at $70,000 or a CD player with no integrated circuits for $17,000. 
 But the high end isn't crowing; instead, it is experiencing a kind of existential angst, beset by demographic and economic issues beyond its control and technological trends that threaten its very relevance.
The best audio equipment is largely handmade, and therefore expensive, and the high end has always been a bit of a cult with its own language and customs, something that has scared away new participants. What makes it special is the tireless devotion of its practitioners to innovation and to a level of excellence that is as much art as engineering.
But high-end audio may be the only electronic product whose price has steadily risen in the past two decades, narrowing its potential market to software millionaires and magnates of the Asian tigers, now in eclipse, who made up as much as a third of the market.
"The high end has been preaching to the converted for years and hasn't branched out," said Wayne Garcia, editor-in-chief of Fi, a three-year old magazine devoted to high-end audio. "The traditional two-channel music lover is either aging, burned out or has enough gear and doesn't need to upgrade all the time or has other priorities," he said. "At the same time, the high end hasn't done a good job getting its message across to younger people."
Born in the hobbyist days of what was then called hi-fidelity, high-end audio blossomed in the late 1970's and 80's. Even as stereo equipment became the domain of mass-market consumer-electronics manufacturers, most of them Japanese, scores of small companies sprang up in the United States and Europe to pursue the elusive goal of nearly perfect sound.
Though they remained small businesses, brands like Conrad-Johnson, Martin-Logan and Spectral gained international followings for their exquisite amplifiers and speakers. Spurred on by magazines like Stereophile, The Absolute Sound and Fi, the auteurs of audio aimed to recreate the sound of live music.
While that goal may be forever elusive, a properly set up high-end audio system, using only two channels, can produce a musical experience that is startling real, a sound of a completely different order than that offered by mass-market equipment, albeit for a very few consumers.
A study by the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association estimated total United States factory sales for the high-end audio industry in 1997 at about $1.1 billion, out of a total market of about $75.6 billion. But the association did not differentiate between home theater and high-end audio. Many manufacturers say they believe that the industry is far smaller, not more than $500 million, and even that total is spread among literally hundreds of companies. Although sales grew in 1997, many companies have reported declines in 1998, which they attribute primarily to the Asian economic crisis.
Defining the high end is problematic. It's not just a matter of expense because a music lover can easily spend thousands of dollars on flashy gear that no self-respecting audiophile would condescend to listen to. The entry point for a high-end system today is about $10,000 for a CD player, preamplifier, amplifier, speakers and cables, more if the system includes a turntable, tuner or tape deck, less with savvy purchases of used equipment or with equipment built from kits. For an all-out assault on the state of the art, figure some multiple of six figures.
To some extent, the high end's woes reflect the same kind of changes that led to the decline of classical music radio stations. Not so long ago, listening to a broadcast of a symphony was a popular evening's entertainment; now most radio listening is done in cars. Similarly, the audio hobbyist who used to spend hours "tweaking" his system, playing record after record, may now be surfing the Web, even if it is to check in on rec.audio.high-end, a Usenet newsgroup devoted to his old hobby.
"It comes down to how people spend their leisure time," said Wendell Diller, president of Magnepan in White Bear Lake, Minn., a maker of large flat-panel speakers that are much praised in high-end circles. "They can play with a computer, watch a movie, but to sit and listen to music? C'mon, only the die-hard music lovers continue to entertain themselves this way. Although the economy is booming, I hear all my friends in the business saying, 'What's going on here?' "
Jeffrey Labovitz, who manages technology transfer for the University of California at San Francisco, has a roomful of high-end gear, but he has not set foot in an audio store in a few years. "I still have all the equipment, and I listen to it all the time, but I don't read audiophile magazines any more, and I don't hang out at the Audible Difference," he said, referring to a Palo Alto store that has outfitted many Silicon Valley luminaries. Noting the huge cost increase for an incremental improvement in sound, he said, "You reach a certain level and you stop."
Actually the seeming paradox of a healthy economy and a flat high end reflects a long-standing dichotomy in the industry, which has only been exaggerated by three or four decades of rising prices. Just as Porsche designs cars for race drivers but reaps most of its revenues from the merely wealthy, so, too, the high end may be driven by hobbyists and critics, but it survives on sales to successful entrepreneurs and professionals whose level of interest may not match their ability to spend. One does not need to be obsessed to spend $100,000 on a music system, only well-to-do.
But the wealthy have grown less enamored of huge speakers placed well away from walls for the best sound, racks of glowing amplifiers and yards of garden-hose-size interconnect cables. Today the demand is for custom installations that hide all the gear in walls or bespoke cabinetry and, above all, for home theater.
Some retailers are benefiting from this trend, devoting more of their store space to theater systems and reaping good margins from installation work. But the purists find it almost offensive. "It is the middle class, low to middle, who are fascinated with this," said Michael Kay, owner of Lyric Hi-Fi, Manhattan's temple to audio excess. "These people were never high end. They abandon the high end for today's fad, that I can't consider really musical behavior."
With five speakers instead of two and an emphasis on video projection, home theater systems attempt to make viewings comparable to attending screenings at the best cinema, a far different calling than recreating Carnegie Hall or the Village Vanguard in the living room.
"There has been a huge increase in personal wealth, and one of the ways people advertise their wealth to friends and neighbors is putting in a big home theater," said Larry Archibald, publisher of Stereophile, the leading audiophile magazine, which was acquired in May by the Petersen Companies. "Our Guide to Home Theater is seeing big advertising growth, and Stereophile is seeing flatness, and that is what's happening in the stores as well," he said.
While home theater is primarily the domain of big consumer electronics companies like Sony and Pioneer, a number of high-end manufacturers have developed products for this market. These companies say they can apply some of the values of the high end to home theater devices, like using the best components money can buy and building equipment that can be updated rather than replaced as technology improves and standards change.
"It's clearly an opportunity," said John Herron, manager for new product development at Madrigal Audio Laboratories in Middleton, Conn., which produces the ultra-high-end Mark Levinson line. Madrigal, a unit of Harman International, has introduced multichannel amplifiers and a digital surround-sound decoder in its more moderate Proceed line, with prices in the mid-to-high four figures. Some in the high-end industry say music reproduction and home theater are completely different goals. But Mr. Herron said the incompatibility was "not really the nature of the beast, it's the nature of the presentation."
Others disagree, on both esthetic and technical grounds. While home theater stresses dynamic range, the ability to play very loudly and have deep bass, to reproduce all those explosions in "Terminator 2," high-end audio systems are all about high resolution, the ability to recreate the most subtle tonal and spatial details of a musical performance.
High-end advocates also note that both Dolby Digital and Digital Theater Systems, or D.T.S., the two technologies battling for allegiance in home theater sound, employ compression technology that effectively eliminates phase information. Without that information, which delineates the precise timing of musical events, a music system cannot reproduce a three-dimensional sound stage. That is fine for theater systems, which rely on multiple speakers around the room to generate a 3-D effect, but anathema to the reproduction of live music.
"In an absolute all-out audio system, you never want to use compression," said Rick Frier, president of Spectral Inc. a maker of high-end amplifiers, preamps and compact disk players in San Jose, Calif. "That has cleaved the high end and home theater apart." Still, he added, the high end has to find a way to make itself relevant in this market. "Some can do it -- some swallow their pride and make a stab at it -- some say, Over my dead body," he said.
Even some high-end manufacturers who have introduced home theater products have reservations about them. The five channels of audio used in home theater "are going to lead customers to spend much less per channel, and that doesn't bode well for our part of the business," said Lew Johnson, president of Conrad-Johnson, a maker of high-end amplifiers and preamps in Fairfax, Va., that plans to offer a five-channel amplifier in the fall. "If you've got a $25,000 home entertainment budget and you spend $10,000 to $15,000 on a video projection system and spread the rest over five channels instead of two, your budget per channel for amplifiers and speakers is very limited," he said.
Still, there are signs that the high end may thrive again. Mr. Johnson is part of a work group meeting to promote an advanced audio disk based on DVD, which would take advantage of that medium's higher data capacity to offer better sound quality than do current CD's. But that effort comes just as CD sound, driven largely by a technology called HDCD, for high definition compatible digital, is finally approaching audiophile quality. HDCD, commonplace in high-end CD players, is now beginning to appear in mass market machines as well.
Surprisingly, sales of turntables have taken off this year, mirroring a simultaneous rebirth of the vinyl LP. "There is a resurgence," said Mr. Kay, of Lyric. "The small CD's that people buy are convenient, but the fanatic knows better. The analog is still better."
Perhaps more surprising, The Absolute Sound, which went out of business in March 1997 after all but coining the term high end, is back, with a new publisher and new financing. "We do not share this gloomy vision that the high end is dead; there's too much new and lively happening," said Harry Pearson, Absolute Sound's founder and editor. "They're confused, they're worried about surround sound and home theater, but I think the field is hopping."

HEADLINE: Stolen Old Masters Surface in U.S.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Four long-lost Old Master paintings, among a group of eight that were stolen 30 years ago, are to be presented to the President of Romania at a ceremony in Washington later this month. The President, Emil Constantinescu, is to return the paintings to a medieval castle in the Transylvanian region of Romania from which they disappeared in a brazen theft in 1968.
The Italian and Netherlandish paintings were recovered by the United States Customs Service in the house of a Romanian immigrant in Florida. The immigrant, Mike Oprisi, who gave a dramatic account of having escaped from Romania when it was under Communist rule, said he had had no knowledge that the paintings were stolen and had bought them from a Gypsy in Vienna for $1,200 before coming to the United States. 
 When stolen art is turned over to the law enforcement authorities, suspicion sometimes falls upon the individual returning it as a possible participant in the theft. But Patrick Jones, a spokesman for the United States Customs Service, which now has possession of the paintings, said that although the man's story was unusual, everything that could be checked -- including a bill of sale and customs declaration when the paintings entered the United States -- had been checked and that Customs was not making any charges.
"The individual who gave up the paintings was very cooperative, but of course we could not find anyone to confirm his whole story," Mr. Jones said. "On the other hand, no one ever escaped a Soviet bloc country in front of a crowd."
The United States will hand the four paintings over to Mr. Constantinescu in Washington when he visits the headquarters of the World Bank on July 18.
"President Constantinescu will first meet President Clinton and then accept the artworks," said Cristian Matei, the cultural counselor at the Romanian Embassy in Washington, who has been busy organizing the visit. "We're very pleased that these two events could be combined."
The paintings, which had been reported stolen from the Bruhenthal castle-museum in Sibiu, Romania, include works that art experts believe to be by Titian or an artist in the Venetian school of Titian; Dieric Bouts, the 15th-century Netherlands master, or perhaps his son; Franz van Mieris the Elder, a 17th-century Dutch artist; and Rosalba Carriera, an 18th-century Venetian master, or another artist in the Venetian school.
American art experts who have studied the paintings in recent weeks estimated the collection's to be worth somewhere between $300,000 and more than $1 million. One expert, who died last December shortly after making an appraisal, put the value of the purported Bouts painting, "Man With a Skull," to be worth $1.2 million.
The story began on May 27, 1968, when officials of the Bruhenthal discovered that eight "very valuable paintings by Old Masters," according to their report, had been stolen from the museum overnight. A year later, the Romanian Government issued a circular about the theft, describing the eight paintings in detail, but there was no response.
About this time, the young Mr. Oprisi decided "to seek a new life in the West," as he expressed it in a recent interview.
With only the clothes on his back and about $80 in his pocket, he said, he slipped out of Romania, swam across the Danube, made his way across Yugoslavia to Austria and settled in Vienna, where he claimed political asylum and worked as a tool and die maker.
In Vienna, he said, he met a Gypsy woman who offered to sell him four Old Master paintings. He borrowed money from an aunt living in Ohio and bought the four artworks for $1,200, he recalled.
A few months later, Mr. Oprisi emigrated to the United States and settled in Florida, becoming an American citizen in 1976. In 1996, he said, he noticed on the back of the painting referred to as "Man With a Skull" the seal of the royal Hohenzollern family, to which the King of Romania had belonged.
He showed it to an old friend, Frank Cesar, a Hungarian-born art appraiser and restoration expert who lived in Chazy, N.Y., near Plattsburgh.
Mr. Cesar said he thought the painting was by Dieric Bouts or perhaps one of the master's sons and was worth $1.2 million. Seeking further evaluation, Mr. Cesar sent a photograph of the painting to Jack Kilgore, a Manhattan dealer in Dutch and Flemish Old Master paintings. A short while later, Mr. Cesar died of a heart attack.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kilgore sent the photograph of "Man With a Skull" to the Netherlands Research Institute for Art History in The Hague. The institute quickly identified it as one of the stolen paintings. The Dutch institute then notified Interpol, the international police agency, which in turn alerted the United States Customs Service. They located Mr. Oprisi in Florida.
Vincent A. Rossi, the senior special Customs agent on the case, recalled that he was astounded when Mr. Oprisi volunteered that he had not one but four Old Master works and that he would surrender them all to Customs if it could be established that they were stolen property.
This fact was quickly established by John J. Baratte, a former museum director and art scholar retained by Customs for the job. "This was an easy one," Mr. Baratte said. "I was only trying to match the actual paintings with the fax sent by Interpol, and they were the same."
Mr. Oprisi then signed a statement in which he abandoned ownership, and Customs notified the Romanian Government.
"When I found out there was even a suspicion that the paintings might be stolen," said Mr. Oprisi, "I decided to give them away with no expectation of winning a medal or congratulations or anything. I could fight them by saying the statute of limitations had run, but I didn't want to. I said, 'Take them, and if the Government of Romania wants to repay the $1,200 I spent, I'll accept it, but if they don't want to pay they can have the paintings free.' "
Mr. Oprisi vehemently denies any knowledge of the four paintings that are still missing, including Van Dyck's "Death of Cleopatra" and "Portrait of a Man" by Hans Holbein the Elder.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The flimsy accounting in nuclear weapons decisions.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IN September 1951, Senator Brien McMahon laid out the argument for investing heavily in nuclear weapons. "The cost of military firepower based on atomic bombs is hundreds of times cheaper, dollar for dollar, than conventional explosives," he explained.
Nearly a half-century later, scholars at the Brookings Institution have released the first thorough assessment of the cost of nuclear weapons. "Atomic Audit" (Brookings Press) estimates that $5.5 trillion in 1996 dollars has been spent by Washington on building, delivering and defending against The Bomb -- and the meter is still ticking at the rate of $35 billion a year. 
 Just how much money is $5.5 trillion? It's more than has been spent on Medicare and veterans' benefits combined, though $2.3 trillion less than the total outlays on Social Security since 1940. Or, if you prefer the fanciful, $5.5 trillion stacked tightly in bricks made of $1 bills would be enough to build a wall 8.7 feet high around the Equator.
In the icy logic of economics, the benefits may still have exceeded the cost. But the very idea that nukes were initially embraced on such simplistic financial grounds is chilling testament to the sloppiness of military economics.
Senator McMahon, then the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, was right that a one-megaton nuclear weapon cost less than conventional bombs containing two billion pounds of TNT. But in giving short shrift to the expense of delivering the nukes, the Connecticut Democrat missed the forest for the merest of saplings.
The Brookings study, directed by Stephen I. Schwartz, estimates that building the weapons did indeed cost just $409 billion in today's dollars, 2 percent of defense spending from 1940 through 1996. But the delivery systems -- aircraft, missiles and related equipment -- added $3.2 trillion. Targeting nuclear weapons and systems to control their use absorbed $831 billion. Defenses against nuclear attack have swallowed $937 billion. The (largely future) cost of managing nuclear waste and dismantling obsolete weapons is projected at some $400 billion.
What began as a plan to substitute bargain technology for conventional forces took on a life of its own. First with the panicky military buildup during the Korean War. Then with the "missile gap" that became an issue in the 1960 Presidential election and morphed into a race with the Soviet Union for superior delivery systems. Still later, the Reagan Administration explicitly used military spending as a strategy for bankrupting the Evil Empire.
The Pentagon could calculate how many bombs would be needed to destroy Soviet rocket forces or to turn Moscow into a parking lot. But as long as the goal was something other than military victory, nuclear sufficiency was a subjective concept. "The closest to one man who would know what the minimum deterrent is would be Mr. Khrushchev," said Gen. Thomas Powers in 1960, "and frankly I don't think he knows from one week to another."
Not surprisingly, though, everyone seemed to have an opinion. President Lyndon Johnson's Bureau of the Budget, preoccupied with financing the Great Society in 1964, concluded that a force of more than 450 Minuteman missiles was a waste of money. Across the Potomac, the military bureaucracy reckoned the right number was 10,000. Defense Secretary Robert MacNamara settled for an even 1,000 missiles.
With the invention of underwater-launched missiles, the Navy thought a few dozen Polaris subs would deter the Soviet Union. But the Air Force thought otherwise, and Congress conveniently decided that a "triad" of sea- and land-based missiles along with manned bombers was needed to keep the Russians in their trenches.
Defenders of the nuclear establishment point out that, quibbling aside, the American arsenal succeeded in deterring a catastrophic war. But in Mr. Schwartz's opinion, this is an inadequate rationalization.
For one thing, he says, conventional forces backed by a small nuclear force would have cost far less and might have been equally effective. For another, the failure to contain either the size of the arsenal or the uncertainties associated with technological change made conflict more likely. The chances of accidental war, for example, were presumably greater with tens of thousands of delivery systems (rather than, say, hundreds). The adoption of hair-trigger response protocols in reaction to the huge numbers of offensive missiles surely increased risks. And the invention of compact warheads that could fit six to a missile made the verification of negotiated arms limits almost impossible.
However one reads the nuclear record, it is hard to deny that the policy evolved with little regard for other ways the cash could have been spent. Indeed, the scale was so vast that it inspires a variant on Senator Everett Dirksen's hoary quip. A trillion here, a trillion there -- and yes, it did add up to real money.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A Federal agency starts a paid campaign today to influence young people to stay away from drugs.

BYLINE: By Courtney Kane 

 BODY:
THE White House's drug policy agency will introduce its first paid national advertising today as part of its fight against drug use among adolescents.
President Clinton will join Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in Atlanta to introduce the campaign, the largest Government-financed social marketing effort to date. It will have an initial budget of $195 million, appropriated by Congress, and will involve television, radio, print, billboards and interactive media. 
 The decision to spend taxpayer money to finance the aggressive anti-drug campaign is a marked change from the Government's longtime policy of watching from the sidelines as advertising and media professionals coordinated unpaid anti-drug messages as public service advertising.
"For the first time we will be able to buy the time slots in the best media vehicles," said Thomas A. Hedrick, vice chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America in New York, "just like Nike or McDonald's or Pepsi does on a regular basis."
The partnership, a nonprofit coalition of advertising and media professionals, has supervised the anti-drug pro bono campaign since 1987. Though the media have donated the equivalent of more than $2.5 billion worth of commercial time and ad space for anti-drug advertising, Mr. Hedrick said, the organization has found it increasingly difficult to reach specific audiences with specific ads because the pro bono campaigns depend on the availability of time and space.
For instance, in a strong economy, exposure in desirable places like popular prime-time TV series is difficult to obtain, and many public service spots are relegated to late-night time slots when few if any of the intended viewers are watching.
"We're going to pay for the precise placement we need to get the right message to the right audience," Mr. Hedrick said, "with enough frequency to change attitudes and, over time, drug behavior."
The national paid campaign comes after a six-month test in 12 cities, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Denver, Hartford, San Diego and Tucson, Ariz. Each year for the next four years, Congress will be asked to appropriate an additional $195 million to continue the campaign. The ads, which will begin appearing today, will be a mix of work already produced for the partnership and new spots.
In an interesting twist, the media that will be selling the paid time and space will be asked for such bonus or in-kind contributions as public service advertising or programs or articles addressing drug issues. For example, a TV network that receives ad dollars for anti-drug commercials may agree to run an episode of a sitcom in which a character confronts the problem of drug abuse or may produce a segment on drug policy for a news magazine show.
In the test markets, Mr. Hedrick said, the media matched the paid ads with bonus contributions.
The television part of the paid campaign is scheduled to appear tonight on the four main broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- and on CNN. The goal is for anti-drug spots to run about 9:15, Eastern daylight time, on the five networks in a TV tactic known as a roadblock. The Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age said that other cable networks like ESPN2, ESPN News, MTV and VH1 had also committed to run spots at about the same time.
The plans call for ABC to run an anti-heroin commercial recently created for the partnership by Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners in New York. The spot updates the famous "This is your brain on drugs" commercial by showing a woman wrecking a kitchen with a frying pan to simulate the effect that heroin can have on a life.
CBS is scheduled to run a spot aimed at parents that features the actor Carroll O'Connor, whose son died after years of drug abuse. On Fox, teen-age viewers are the intended audience for a commercial with the rap star Chuck D. The spot planned for NBC is aimed at young parents, and the spot on CNN, to run during "Larry King Live," is also aimed at parents, addressing the need to discuss drugs with their children.
The print part of the campaign is set to begin today in big-city newspapers. One hard-hitting ad, titled "Disconnect," is meant to illustrate a generation gap about drugs. A photograph of a woman is accompanied by these words: "My kid doesn't smoke pot. He's either at school, soccer practice, piano lessons or at a friend's house." Underneath is a photograph of a boy, who says, "I usually get stoned at school, after soccer practice, before piano lessons or at my friend's house."
The ads for the paid campaign are being donated by agencies through the partnership, which is serving as an unpaid consultant and will receive no Federal money. Media planning and buying are being handled by Bates USA in New York, part of Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C., and Zenith Media Services in New York, which is owned by Cordiant and Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C.
Though many Americans consider anti-drug advertising a necessary component of the Federal war on drugs, some perceive the ambitious crusade as money ill spent.
Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center in New York, a drug policy research organization that is part of the Open Society Institute sponsored by the financier George Soros, said: "For the past 10 years, our nation's kids have been bombarded with anti-drug messages, and it is these same kids who are experimenting with more drugs. While these ads are well intended, this money could be better spent on programs that are proven effective in reducing drug use, such as after-school programs and treatment on demand."
Mr. Hedrick, needless to say, disagreed.
"I don't understand how it is a big waste of money," he said. "We have seen in independent research a strong and consistent correlation between exposure of anti-drug messages and improving anti-drug attitudes and behavior."
"There is simply no more cost-effective way" to deter drug use, he added, "than by investing 1 percent of the Federal anti-drug budget in this public-private partnership."
Still, Mr. Hedrick said, "the proof will be in the pudding." The partnership is awaiting the results of research from the 12 test markets, which are expected sometime in the fall, he said. There will also be research to evaluate the effectiveness of the national paid campaign.
Other organizations are also offering their assistance.
The American Advertising Federation in Washington -- which represents agencies, media and marketers -- will serve as a clearinghouse for matching public service advertising in 100 local markets where the paid campaign will appear. And the Advertising Council in New York -- the nonprofit organization that coordinates public service campaigns for the agency and media industries -- will serve as a clearinghouse for matching public service advertising nationally.

HEADLINE: Indonesians Visit U.S. Seeking Help With Debt

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
As the Indonesia economy worsens, Government officials embarked yesterday on a campaign aimed at persuading international lenders to repackage up to $9 billion of debt.
An International Monetary Fund official said he was confident that the fund would release about $1 billion in aid to the country next week, but it is uncertain whether other lenders and investors will display the same faith in the country's economy. 
 "The economy is in worse condition than it was in April," said Finance Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita, after meeting with bankers in New York yesterday. "Our main concern now is to stabilize the economy."
Mr. Ginandjar said Indonesia planned to keep interest rates high to combat inflation and would allow the country's weakest banks to fail as resources were concentrated on a handful of strong banks. He said Indonesia would also continue to liberalize its social policies.
"Indonesia has been portrayed as an outcast country because of our legal system and human rights issues," Mr. Ginandjar said. "We are embarking on a new era that we hope will cause the Western people and the Western media to look more favorably on us."
These are dire times for Indonesia. The damage wrought by the collapse of Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, has been so severe that a senior World Bank official said on Tuesday that Indonesia faced an economic crisis unparalleled in the post-World War II era.
Indonesia expects its economy to contract about 13 percent this year -- the first time the economy has shrunk since 1963. Automobile, electronics and construction output slid in the first half of the year, all of Indonesia's airlines are bankrupt and roughly 80 percent of flights to the country have been canceled.
In starker, more human terms, the World Bank forecasts that 50 million of Indonesia's 200 million people could fall below the poverty line by the end of the year. Government officials acknowledged a widespread concern about people dying from starvation. A severe drought is causing added pain in various parts of the country.
Although the World Bank said riots had disrupted food distribution networks, Mr. Ginandjar said the Government had a "distribution system that is independent" of routes disrupted by riots.
"The question is not the supply but the buying power," Mr. Ginandjar said, adding that the country had a program akin to food stamps that it would use to support those unable to purchase food.
Mr. Ginandjar was at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York to lobby international lenders to reschedule a portion of about $64 billion to $66 billion in debt owed by Indonesian corporations. The lobbying effort will continue to Washington, and on to Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul and Singapore, in the next week.
The Indonesian Government also has $54 billion to $55 billion in debt, but that is not a subject of the current negotiations. Mr. Ginandjar said there were "no problems" with the Government debt but that Indonesia remained open to various ways of restructuring the debt by renegotiating the interest rate or other terms.
While Indonesian ministers and advisers were upbeat about repackaging the private-sector debt, they face a tough challenge convincing lenders and investors that the country can overcome its economic challenges. Investors have cooled to a similar debt repackaging recently undertaken by South Korea, where the economy, while troubled, is considered to have stronger prospects than Indonesia's.
"Everybody wishes that things were better, but people are realistic," said Mark Walker, a lawyer with the New York firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, who is advising the Indonesian Government. "I sense that people understand why this program and why this proposal make sense."
Mr. Ginandjar said Indonesia "has a fair chance" of getting the battered rupiah, which has been trading recently in a range of 14,000 to 14,500 to the dollar, down to about 10,000 to the dollar by the end of the year.
He also was optimistic that free elections would be held by December 1999 and offered praise for the new Government of President B. J. Habibie, who has been struggling to assert his authority despite calls for an early election.
Although Mr. Ginandjar is considered an ambitious man with his own designs on the Indonesian presidency, he said Mr. Habibie had "done quite a bit in eight weeks," citing Mr. Habibie's acceptance of labor unions and the freeing of political prisoners.
Mr. Ginandjar said elections should not be held any sooner than the end of next year. "To be fair to the new parties, we need to give them time to organize," he said.

HEADLINE: Europe's Clunkers Shift to Fast Lane;
Introduction of the Euro Is Fueling Also-Ran Economies

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
When Jose Antonio Santamaria and his family moved into their new condominium in February, they got satellite television along with access to enclosed gardens and a swimming pool.
But they also got a euro-break. Largely because Spain has been accepted into the group of European nations that will adopt the euro as a single currency in January, interest rates here have plunged almost as low as those in Germany. 
 For Mr. Santamaria, that translates into monthly payments that are about $140 lower than he had calculated when construction started three years ago. "It is much cheaper than we had expected," he said. "And with the swimming pool and enclosed garden, the quality of life is better, too."
Like Mr. Santamaria, Spain has not had it this good in years. As much of Europe adopts the euro as a single currency, poorer countries like Spain, Portugal and Ireland are growing much faster than bigger and wealthier ones like France and Germany.
Since 1995, interest rates in Spain and Portugal have plunged to less than 6 percent from 11 percent, largely because interest rates across the "euro zone" are converging down to the levels in Germany. Ireland, with a well-educated work force and relatively flexible work rules, has become an important manufacturing base for American companies exporting to Europe.
The effect within these fast-growing countries has been profound. While Germany and France invest heavily outside their borders, the smaller and poorer countries have become magnets for foreign money. While job creation continues to be stagnant in much of continental Europe, it is speeding up rapidly in places like Spain. And while consumers in Germany anxiously refrain from spending, demand is surging in the poorer countries.
"None of us is going to be the same five years from now -- not us, not France, not Germany," said Rodrigo Rato, Spain's Economics Minister. "We are all moving toward a new era of more competitiveness and more openness."
Ireland, one of the poorest countries in Western Europe in 1990, is rapidly catching up with the rest of Europe in terms of income per person. Its economy is growing by more than 8 percent this year -- compared with about 3 percent for the European Union as a whole. Indeed, with real estate prices soaring and labor shortages cropping up in some areas, the biggest worry among economists is that Ireland is headed toward an overheated economy.
Spain and Portugal are growing at about 4 percent this year -- faster than almost anywhere else on continental Europe. Their stock markets have been among the best performers in Europe as investors bet that interest rates will remain low and stable for years to come.
"It is a gift, essentially, a gift from abroad," said Miguel Sebastian, chief economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya in Madrid.
To be sure, part of the current boom is simply catch-up as countries bounce back from past problems, in particular Spain's severe recession in the mid-1990's. Though Spain has generated about 400,000 new jobs since the start of 1997, its official unemployment rate is still 19 percent -- one of the highest in Europe.
"What we are living through now is the rapid correction of past imbalances," said Ignacio Gomez-Montejo, Merrill Lynch's chief equity analyst in Madrid. "We are being rewarded for correcting our mistakes."
Signs of new affluence are visible here. On the outskirts of Madrid, the Las Rosas condominium development is building 10,000 apartments with an average price of about $120,000. Beckoning young families with signs that boast "We are building your dream house," the condominiums are selling quickly.
Meanwhile, the center-right Government of President Jose Maria Aznar has pushed through several reforms aimed at bolstering employment and investment. It has promoted fierce competition in banking and privatized about $25 billion worth of state-owned companies. And soon after taking power in 1996, it drastically cut the tax on capital gains, reducing the top rate to about 20 percent from more than 60 percent. Now, the Government is pushing through a much broader tax reform that would reduce income tax rates by closing loopholes.
The Government, under Mr. Aznar and his predecessor, Felipe Gonzalez, has also made it easier for companies to hire workers on temporary contract. Though full-time jobs are still relatively scarce, temporary jobs have soared. But perhaps the biggest change in Spain is one of outlook: a new willingness of domestic companies to look abroad for opportunities. Since joining the European Union in 1986, the country has steadily increased its volume of trade with the rest of Europe. As recently as 1990, Spanish exports and imports added up to about 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Today, foreign trade in both directions adds up to about 70 percent, the lion's share with other European countries.
The new confidence is apparent in Elche, a city on Spain's southern coast that is the heart of its shoe industry. Bolstered by low interest rates and cheap money, nearly 50 companies are building factories and office buildings at the city's newest industrial park.
"Financial costs used to account for about 5 percent of a company's expenses," said Jose Pertusa Romero, a partner in Gesem, a consulting firm in Elche. "But in the last year, interest rates have declined, and those costs have been cut in half."
And though shoes are still the mainstay of the local economy, the business itself has changed. Instead of competing strictly on price, traditional shoemakers are reinventing themselves as designers and marketers of brand names. And they are exporting more.
"It was a revolution, a real shock for the local industry," said Felipe Gonzalez, export manager for Panama Jack Group Internacional S.A., which produces hiking boots and leather casual shoes and began developing its own brand nearly nine years ago.
Juan Peran, the founder of Pikolinos S.A., made a particularly striking odyssey. A small, wiry craftsman who started his company from scratch in the mid-1970's, he spent years stamping out cheap plastic shoes. But five years ago, he began designing and marketing his own line of high-fashion shoes for export.
The strategy has worked. Pikolinos has more than tripled its sales volume since 1992, to 1.1 million pairs of shoes from about 300,000, and the profit for each pair has increased significantly. About 80 percent of the companies sales are to other European countries.
Mr. Peran recently moved the company into a gleaming glass-covered building at the industrial park. Shoe designers work out their ideas by creating three-dimensional models on computers, and robotic cutting machines transfer those ideas into precise strips of leather that are then sewn into prototypes.
"I am still a shoemaker, but this is the way we create about 80 percent of our designs," Mr. Peran said.
One of the biggest differences between countries like Spain and Portugal and Europe's wealthier but slower-growing nations is the pace of job creation. Even though Germany's economy is expanding at one of its fastest rates in years, nearly 3 percent, the number of new jobs has increased only marginally. Over the last several years, the number of jobs in Germany has remained almost flat while the number of unemployed job seekers has steadily increased. Though German job growth has finally picked up in the last few months, unemployment is expected to stay above 10 percent throughout the year.
By contrast, economic growth is bolstering job gains in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Though Spain's unemployment rate of 19 percent remains one of the highest in Europe, economists and Government agencies calculate that about 400,000 new jobs have been added since the start of 1997, nearly 3 percent, and many others have probably been absorbed in the underground economy.
Portugal has had even greater success. Its unemployment rate has declined to about 6.3 percent from 7.3 percent in 1996 -- about half the level in Germany and France. And Ireland, with employment of 1.3 million, has added 50,000 jobs since 1995.
Though the evidence is mixed, many economists say the penchant toward hiring people in "periphery" countries stems partly from lower wages but perhaps more from greater flexibility, even though labor laws are often just as strict.
In Ireland, economists say the quality of workers is at least as important as the cost of wages.
"Most of the new jobs are coming from knowledge-intensive industries, not labor-intensive industries," said Terry Baker, an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin. Fifty percent of people entering the work force have college educations, and their educations have often been tailored toward technical areas. Ireland's biggest growth areas have been in computer and software companies, from Microsoft to Dell Computer to Intel.
"Irish labor is a good value," said Peter Jarrett, an economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, who has studied Ireland closely. "The quality of the educational system is as good as anywhere, and they have really geared it to the needs of the labor market."
Spain has worked to loosen its work rules. Although full-time permanent workers have some of the strongest job-protection laws of any nation, new laws allow companies to hire workers on temporary contracts -- often for years at a time. About one-third of all workers in Spain work on temporary contracts, one of the highest levels in the world and most of the new jobs are being created in the temporary labor market.
But as Europe's previously poor countries become richer, they may well become more like their wealthier neighbors. Even though Ireland has long boasted a devotion to "Anglo-Saxon" principles of light regulation, the country has followed Germany's tradition in reaching broad wage agreements in negotiations between unions, manufacturers and industry. In the most recent one the Government pledged last year to reduce income tax rates while unions agreed to modest wage increases of about 3 percent a year through 2000.
"It's very much on the old German or Scandinavian model, but it seems to have worked very well," Mr. Baker said,
In Spain, the Aznar Government has become a staunch defender of social programs even as it tries to support business.
"The big problem is how you keep social cohesion and at the same time stay ahead of the competition," said Mr. Rato, Spain's Economics Minister. "I don't think Europe is contemplating the American model on social issues. We do look to the American model on questions of competition and promoting capital markets. But on social issues, European society does not envy the Americans."

HEADLINE: Japanese Premier Promises Tax Cut for Long Term, Too

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 8

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today promised long-term tax cuts beginning next year, but he gave no details about how much the move might fatten pocketbooks or lift the sagging Japanese economy.
The United States and other countries have put enormous pressure on Japan to make permanent tax cuts to stimulate the economy and reduce the risk of a global downturn. Mr. Hashimoto's promise seemed aimed at winning support from Washington and from Japanese voters, who go to the polls on Sunday to choose members of the upper house of Parliament. 
 "Concerning tax-system reform, starting next year we would like to implement tax cuts that will be supported by the public," Mr. Hashimoto said today while campaigning in the central city of Nagoya.
His remark seemed to be an attempt to end days of confusion brought about by his public waffling.
Last Friday he suggested he would consider introducing permanent income tax cuts. Two days later he seemed to backtrack, saying that overall tax reform might not bring about a broad reduction in income taxes.
Mr. Hashimoto has been reluctant to lower the minimum level of taxable income, currently at nearly $24,000. Such a step would bring in more tax revenues but it would be politically risky because it would hurt the poor.
Today's remark, which seemed more forceful, still left many people wondering whether the size of the cuts would be enough to prompt consumers to spend more money. The yen, which had fallen against the dollar throughout the day, weakened slightly, to 139.60 yen, from 138.85 yen, just as Mr. Hashimoto was making his comments.
In April Mr. Hashimoto said the Government would tackle reform of the entire tax system, which many economists say drains a great deal of incentive from employees and businesses to make more money. Economists say they expect to see top rates slide to 50 percent, from 65 percent, on individuals and to 40 percent, from 46 percent, on corporations.
The challenge that Mr. Hashimoto faces, however, is that any tax cuts would have to be financed somehow by a Government that has just declared fiscal austerity to be its medium-term goal. Last fall Mr. Hashimoto pushed through a policy of fiscal austerity, and though he has since stepped back a bit, that principle seems to have kept the Government from spending its way too freely out of the recession.
Earlier this year the Government made $14 billion in income tax rebates, and it plans to make a similar rebate beginning in late summer. It has also said that next year, it will cut income taxes by another $14 billion.
Investors and economists have not been entirely pleased with those cuts, however, because they are one-time reductions that will not necessarily encourage people to spend more. Some members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, including the secretary general, Koichi Kato, have argued that most of the rebates go into savings rather than being spent, and that it is therefore an ineffective way to stimulate the economy.
"Tax reduction through tax rebates is nothing but giving liquor to an alcoholic," said Teizo Taya, an economist at Daiwa Institute of Research. "That is not going to change the motives of people."

HEADLINE: U.S. Policy on Nigeria Could Hinge on Results of an Autopsy

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
The United States said today that it would await the results of the autopsy on Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner, Moshood K. O. Abiola, before it considers resuming its high-level diplomatic efforts to bring democracy to the country.
The sudden death of Mr. Abiola, who was imprisoned in 1994 after apparently winning the democratic presidential election the year before, threw American policy toward Nigeria into confusion and generated debates among critics of the policy. 
 It also overshadowed what State Department officials described as an otherwise successful mission to Nigeria this week by a delegation of senior American diplomats, who pressed the Nigerian junta for democratic reforms and for the release of political prisoners, especially Mr. Abiola.
"I believe that continued and high-level contacts can take place, but I think we all need to wait and see how this autopsy comes out," said Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering, who was meeting with Mr. Abiola in a government guest house in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, when he fell ill on Tuesday.
Mr. Pickering, in a telephone interview from London, where he stopped en route home to Washington, said today that he found Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, to be receptive to American demands for movement toward democratic civilian rule there.
"They were receptive, particularly the head of state," Mr. Pickering said, referring to the general. "He committed himself to professionalize the military and get it back to its professional role in Nigeria -- clear and direct code words for getting the military out of politics."
"I expect they are going to release political prisoners," said Mr. Pickering, a former Ambassador to Nigeria. "It was very clear to me that they were prepared to release Abiola."
Last week the Nigerian Government told Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, that all political prisoners, including Mr. Abiola, would be released.
Mr. Pickering said that he had been impressed by the willingness of Nigerian officials to conduct an autopsy with outside doctors present.
"It was a Nigerian Government doctor in attendance who said that everybody must insist on an autopsy," he said.
Mr. Pickering said that while the timing of the death was extraordinary -- the American diplomat traveled with Mr. Abiola to a nearby hospital and watched as doctors tried to revive him -- the 60-year-old multimillionare businessman was known to be in poor health after four years' of often brutal imprisonment.
"He has some record of hypertension," Mr. Pickering said. "Both of his legs were swollen and he showed them to us."
The sudden death of Mr. Abiola prompted calls today from human rights organizations, African scholars and others for a reappraisal of American policy toward the Nigerian junta.
Walter C. Carrington, who was the United States Ambassador to Nigeria from 1993 until last fall, said in an interview that he believed the Clinton Administration should have been tougher in threatening to impose economic sanctions against the country's military leaders.
He said that while serving in Nigeria he was repeatedly rebuffed by the State Department when he recommended that the United States consider freezing the assets of corrupt leaders of the Nigerian Army, who are believed to have stashed millions of dollars in American banks.
He said the State Department's reluctance to offend the junta had less to do with oil -- Nigeria is the fifth-largest supplier of petroleum to the United States -- than with an institutional mindset in the State Department that "we should try to get along with the established leadership in Nigeria and everywhere else."
Mr. Carrington, a lawyer who is now on a fellowship at Harvard University, said that during his four years in Nigeria he had been frustrated by the reluctance of the State Department to throw its full support behind Mr. Abiola during his imprisonment, in part because of long-standing rumors that Mr. Abiola was corrupt and somehow involved in the narcotics trade.
The department, he said, failed to recognize how his years in prison had changed Mr. Abiola.
"The thing about Abiola is that he underwent an epiphany once he went into prison," he said. "I think he grew substantially as a real leader of the democratic movement."
The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy to Africa, said that the United States needed to demand the presence of independent medical experts at the autopsy.
"The way he died arouses real suspicion," Mr. Jackson said. "There are questions about whether his death was induced or whether he was simply allowed to rot in prison. These questions are unavoidable and should be addressed directly and frankly by the Nigerian Government."
Mr. Jackson said the United States would now have to step up its campaign to bring democracy to Nigeria, or risk the violent fragmentation of a nation of 110 million people that is torn by tribal and regional rivalries.
"The sheer size of Nigeria is such that we should not move too slowly right now," he said. "If the tension exploded there, it could be even more devastating than Rwanda."

HEADLINE: Scorched and Parched, the South Tallies the Rising Toll of a Drought

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 8

 BODY:
Although hurricanes and tornadoes sweep through with swaths of utter devastation, the erratic wildfires that have struck Florida since May have been more a menace than a catastrophe.
But with the passage of time, that menace and the drought behind it have wiped out crops and sent up choking clouds of smoke that have emptied beaches and hotels, disrupting the economic pulse of whole communities. 
 With lightning starting 50 new fires today, the onslaught is far from over. As firefighters spend their seventh week taming the worst fires in memory in Florida, state officials have only begun to tally the financial damage and assess long-term effects. As uncertain as the final damage bill is, the one certainty is that Florida is not alone in being hurt.
Severe drought conditions have been ruining crops since March from Texas eastward through Arkansas, Mississippi and Georgia, Federal officials said. At the same time the Midwest, middle Appalachia and New England have been awash in rain, they said.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it had spent more than $520 million in grants, loans and other assistance so far this year for states affected by fires, drought, winter storms, flooding and tornadoes.
For agriculture, drought has been a worse problem than flooding, said Albert Peterlin, chief meteorologist with the United States Department of Agriculture, even though damage figures were not yet available.
"The flooding is localized," Mr. Peterlin said. "Water is a thousand small threats. Drought is a big, terrible one."
In hard-hit states like Texas, where farmers say they have lost track of the days when temperatures topped 100 degrees and some are even hoping for a drenching hurricane, state officials estimate the loss to crops this year at $1 billion, with half of that involving the cotton crop alone.
The Texas Agriculture Commissioner, Rick Perry, said the overall economic impact is tripled when equipment dealers and other businesses that rely on agriculture are taken into account.
Some farmers said losses from previous droughts have left them barely able to hold on to their business.
"You have to laugh or cry," said Lynn Bartlett, 32, who grows cotton and peanuts on a 500-acre farm his grandfather started in the 1930's along the northeastern border with Oklahoma. "The dry-land cotton needs rain exactly right now, or it's close to being over."
In northern Florida, only two inches or less of rain fell in May and June compared with a normal 10 to 12 inches. Although only about $175 million of the state's annual $6.2 billion harvest has been lost so far to the record-breaking heat and drought, the weather has all but destroyed crops like corn and hay and inflicted major losses on about 12,000 growers in the Panhandle and north-central region, state Department of Agriculture officials said.
Livestock left hungry by dry pastures are subsisting on hay, which is not expected to last for the winter months when it is normally needed. As a result demand is great.
"We're desperately short of hay," said Terence McElroy, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Agriculture, which is seeking hay suppliers outside the state.
But the worst losses in Florida have come from wildfires that burned about 485,000 acres, more than half of it commercial timberland. About $300 million in timber has been lost and 324 homes have sustained damage estimated at $2.6 million. The price tag for firefighting efforts is now $104 million, state officials said.
Only about 260,000 of the state's 14 million acres of timberland have burned, but affected landowners are now turning to salvage efforts. The lost pine trees, used for paper and building materials, take 15 to 25 years to reach maturity, said Jeff Doran, executive vice president of the Florida Forestry Association, which represents the timber industry.
"You just go back and plant the trees all over again," said Jim Kauffman, land manager of the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation in Fernandina Beach, who expected to salvage less than 10 percent of 16,000 burned acres in Flagler and Volusia counties.
The fires that began burning out of control on Memorial Day have caused no deaths and 104 injuries, mostly to firefighters, because they were concentrated in forests.
Compared with the tornadoes in Central Florida in February that killed more than 40 people, or Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which killed 41 people in Florida and Louisiana, caused $30 billion in damages and still ranks as the nation's most expensive natural disaster, the recent fires have seemed a lesser evil.
But the potential for the fires to reach the scale of a major disaster as the flames moved toward towns and coastal communities last week prompted evacuations that displaced more than 100,000 people and closed major highways.
Tourism in most of the state remains unaffected by the fires, drought and summer heat, state officials said, but smoke has cast an acrid pall over beaches, keeping visitors away from coastal cities like Daytona Beach and Ormond Beach.
"We normally have a 90 to 95 percent occupancy this time of year," said John Connors, president of the Ormond Beach Chamber of Commerce. "There was one hotel I talked to that had only 13 of its 150 rooms occupied."
Scores of small businesses, from restaurants to fireworks stores, lost business because of mandatory evacuations that emptied whole communities like Flagler County last week, or from state health warnings that kept residents indoors.
In Ormond Beach, where 35,000 residents were under evacuation orders for four days, Paul LaRusso, manager of the Bicycle Company, said business was down 30 percent. Many of his customers are avid bicycle racers who left the area to train in other states because of the smoke.
"We normally get 50 to 60 people a day through here," Mr. LaRusso said. "One day I counted seven people in nine hours."
Even now, with communities returning to a semblance of normalcy, Ormond Beach officials say it is hardly business as usual. Judy Sloane, an Ormond Beach city engineer, said routine maintenance work is not being done because the smoke makes work outside difficult. The city has also imposed strict limitations on water use, asking residents to water lawns or gardens only two days a week, to conserve water for firefighters.
The fires have altered the landscape in the parched portions of Florida, but state ecologists said fires are a natural occurrence in the wild and that while some trees may take decades to grow back, much of the vegetation will recover quickly.
The fires have drawn attention to a nationwide problem: the migration of more and more people to forested areas. Residential development has curtailed controlled fires, which burn off dead wood and underbrush that, if left to accumulate, fuel bigger fires, Federal and state forestry officials said.
Federal Forest Service officials say residents who want to live in a rural environment should understand the need for controlled fires and protect their homes by taking such measures as building with fire resistant materials and keeping tall trees at least 40 feet away.
"In that environment, you have to assume the responsibility to make yourself safer," said Milt Williams, a spokesman for the United States Forest Service.

GRAPHIC: Map/Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Desperately Seeking Rain"
Hot, sunny weather and below normal rainfall have combined to produce drought conditions across much of the South.
 
Map highlights areas with the following conditions:
 
VERY DRY -- Has received as little as 50 percent of normal rainfall. Crops urgently need rain to sustain them.
 
EXTREMELY DRY -- Has received less than 25 percent of normal rainfall over the last three months. With temperatures hotter than normal, pastures are parched and crops are near failure in Texas.

The Eight Yeses

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To ingratiate himself with the Communist leadership in China, Bill Clinton became the first U.S. President to publicly embrace what Beijing calls "the three noes" -- no support for two Chinas, no independence for Taiwan, no membership of Taiwan in any international organization of sovereign nations.
Our former policy was brilliantly ambiguous: we acknowledged both sides' agreement that there was only one China and called for a peaceful settlement -- which carried an implicit promise to help Taiwan if Beijing launched an invasion. The newly expressed Clinton policy dismays Taiwan because "the three noes" explicitly deny self-determination. 
 Beyond that, Mr. Clinton forked over The Eight Yeses.
1. Yes to the purification of Tiananmen Square. By his ceremonial presence, Clinton helped Jiang scrub away the memory without reversing the verdicts.
2. Yes to China's insistence on exclusivity in the Presidential itinerary. At a time when financially shaky Japan and South Korea were desperate for reassurance, China demanded that the Clinton pilgrimage not be diluted by side trips to U.S. allies. Clinton meekly agreed.
3. Yes to giving China a veto over the American President's visiting party. Three Radio Free Asia journalists were denied visas and in effect bumped off the press plane. When the U.S. press failed to show solidarity, Clinton caved, setting a demeaning precedent.
4. Yes to China's pretense of being an "emerging" country that deserves special treatment in entering the World Trade Organization. By publicly asserting on Shanghai radio that "China is still an emerging economy," Clinton paved the way for a concession that would push the W.T.O. into giving China's powerful economy a competitive edge on subsidized exports.
5. Yes to China's harsh treatment of dissidents. Clinton acceded to China's denial of access to dissidents and made no personal protest at the roundup of protesters. He hailed the "freeing" of Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan -- as if their forced exile were not a victory for repression.
6. Yes to Jiang's need for superpower support of his new cult of personality. "He has a good imagination . . . vision . . . extraordinary intellect," gushed our President, which can be dismissed as the sort of hyperbole once lavished on Mikhail Gorbachev, but then Clinton blundered by giving America's political endorsement to an autocratic, Communist regime: "China has the right leadership at the right time."
7. Yes to China's decision to delay joining the Missile Technology Control Regime. Jiang wanted more time to sell missiles to countries developing nuclear weapons, and was willing only to "study" Clinton's plea; this was peddled to the traveling press corps as progress.
8. Yes to the "strategic partnership" desired by the Chinese leadership. This naively accepted formulation depresses our Asian allies, which fear China's growing military and economic power, and panics India, which responds to what sounds like Chinese-American hegemony by going nuclear. China may be a lopsided trade partner of the U.S., but to pretend that our geopolitical rival is a "strategic partner" is to eviscerate the meaning of strategy.
In return for accepting the three noes and offering the eight yeses, Mr. Clinton was given the opportunity to tell the Chinese people that we consider the "loss of life" at Tiananmen to be wrong, but it's not for us to impose our views, etc.
In 1969, as Richard Nixon shared with Charles de Gaulle his idea of an opening to China, the French President told him: "Better to deal with the Chinese now, when they need you, than later, when you're forced to because of their strength."
In 1978, the former President recalled that de Gaulle advice, and added to me : "Today it's to our interest to make China strong. When they do become strong enough that they no longer need us, they will have other reasons, ties and so forth, which will enable us to cooperate."
That is what justified Nixon's opening, Carter's normalization and even Clinton's campaign-style visit. Then he added this chilling caveat: "In the long haul, looking way down the line -- this is deep background -- 15 years from now, we may have created a Frankenstein."

Nigeria's Leader Pleads for Calm
Nigeria's military ruler agreed to allow outside experts to take part in the autopsy on the opposition leader Moshood K. O. Abiola and spoke in vague terms of moving the country toward democracy. His statements were intended to soothe public anger after Mr. Abiola's sudden death. Sporadic rioting has left at least 19 people dead. A1 

The United States said it would await the results of the autopsy on Mr. Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner, before it would consider resuming diplomatic efforts to bring democracy to Nigeria. The sudden death of Mr. Abiola threw American policy toward Nigeria into confusion. A8
 
Tax Cuts Promised for Japan
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto promised long-term tax cuts beginning next year, but he gave no details about how the move might help Japan's sagging economy. Mr. Hashimoto's promise seemed aimed at winning support from Washington and Japanese voters, who go to the polls on Sunday to choose members of the upper house of Parliament. A6
 
Indonesia Seeks Investors
Indonesia embarked on a campaign aimed at persuading international lenders to repackage up to $9 billion of the country's debt. An I.M.F. official expressed confidence that the fund would release about $1 billion in aid next week, but it was uncertain whether other lenders and investors would display the same faith. A9
 
Aid to Kosovo Rebels Opposed
The United States, Russia and European countries monitoring fighting in Kosovo between ethnic Albanian and Serbian forces condemned outside support for the rebels and urged all countries to prevent exiles from financing arms for the insurgents. Nonetheless, diplomats reiterated that the primary responsibility for the bloodshed lay with Serbia. A5
 
Britain Reshapes Its Military
Britain said it was reshaping its armed forces to reduce costs and meet the increasing need for speedy and flexible deployment to trouble spots abroad. The moves take into account the end of the threat of Soviet invasion as Europe's principal concern and the emergence of crises like the Persian Gulf war and unrest in Bosnia. A13
 
Belarus Yields on Housing
Belarus backed off from a threat to begin seizing the property of foreign ambassadors who had refused to remove the furnishings from their homes for government-ordered plumbing and sewerage repairs. A7
 
Legal Term Threatens Accord
A dispute between women's groups and the Vatican over the term "enforced pregnancy" could jeopardize agreement on whether rape would be declared a war crime by an international tribunal. The Vatican fears that the term, which women's groups want included in the treaty, could be broadly interpreted as an invitation to challenge anti-abortion laws. A3

HEADLINE: Study Rejects New Limits on Helicopters

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
A draft of the city's first comprehensive analysis of its heliport infrastructure and helicopter activity has concluded that the city should continue its year-old ban on sightseeing flights from the 34th Street Heliport, but it does not call for new regulations on corporate or commercial traffic.
The analysis, which is called the Heliport and Helicopter Master Plan and was provided to community board members this week, immediately drew objections from critics who have lobbied the city to place further restrictions on helicopter flights, which they assert are too noisy and potentially unsafe. The plan, the critics said, broke little new policy ground and did not address issues including when helicopters should be allowed to operate and the altitudes at which they should be allowed to fly. 
 Charles Millard, the president of the Economic Development Corporation, which controls the 34th Street Heliport and commissioned the study, said the city was "in discussion" with the State Department of Transportation about a similar ban on sightseeing flights at the heliport the state owns, at West 30th Street and the Hudson River.
Mr. Millard said the city would carry out a recommendation in the plan to construct fuel tanks at the East 34th Street Heliport as a means of reducing the thousands of helicopter trips across the city to the only existing refueling site, at the West 30th Street Heliport on the Hudson River. The city will also build a noise barrier around the landside perimeter of the East 34th Street Heliport, he said, and it will consider offering financial incentives, like lower landing fees, to helicopter operators that fly quieter new technology, an idea praised by helicopter industry representatives.
A third heliport, at Pier 6 and the Battery, is owned by the Port Authority, which cannot ban sightseeing flights because of Federal restrictions. Those restrictions end in 2005, and at that point, the plan says, the city will ban sightseeing flights from there.
Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said yesterday that the plan tries to balance quality-of-life and economic interests. "We should not have tourist helicopters flying all over New York," he said, "but New York needs flights for commerce."
But the plan quickly brought criticism from advocates of greater restrictions on helicopter traffic. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat and a proponent of stricter Federal aviation regulation for helicopters, criticized the plan for not addressing "overflights, minimum heights and curfews."
Joy Held, the founder of the Helicopter Noise Coalition, which represents 18,000 people, said the plan did nothing to reduce sightseeing flights from privately owned heliports, nor did it curb the number of corporate or media flights. "The sum total of this plan is that nothing is changing while the Mayor is claiming victory over the issue," she said.
Mr. Millard pointed out that the city had closed a heliport at East 60th Street at the end of February, and that traffic from the East 34th Street Heliport has been cut by 65 percent since the city ended sightseeing flights from there last August. There have been 41,875 flights so far this year from the three heliports, according to the Economic Development Corporation. In 1996, the latest year for which figures were available, there were 138,104 flights.
The plan does not address media helicopters because none take off from heliports in the city.
Matthew S. Zuccaro, a spokesman for the Eastern Region Helicopter Council, a trade association representing 86 companies, called the plan a "good foundation" for the city's helicopter and heliport operating system. But he agreed that the document set little new policy.
Mr. Zuccaro criticized the city's ban on sightseeing flights and its effort to get the state to do the same. "It seems," he said, "to be politically correct and expedient at this point, based on concerns about noise, to say, 'Okay, we'll just eliminate that segment of the industry.' "
The industry, he said, had made a substantial effort to regulate itself. Sightseeing companies have changed their routes to avoid flying over residential neighborhoods, he said, in addition to increasing the altitudes at which they fly, and stopped flying over Manhattan completely, instead coursing along the Hudson River. Mr. Zuccaro said he was also working on an operations manual for the city's eight news-gathering helicopters.
Mr. Zuccaro praised the city for not carrying out more of the activists' demands. "The Helicopter Noise Coalition," he said, "has indicated that their ultimate and only goal is to close all heliports and eliminate all helicopter traffic in the city, except for emergency flights."
Ms. Held responded, "That is definitely our goal."

U.S. to Send Sudan $16 Million in Food

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
The United States announced today that it would provide another 9,390 tons of food, valued at almost $16 million, to combat famine in the southern Sudan.
The Agency for International Development also said it would donate $1.5 million to expand air and road deliveries of food through the United Nations World Food Program and $2 million to the United Nations Children's Fund to support air operations. 
 A 15-year civil war, coupled with drought last year and a further rain failure this year are behind the latest hunger crisis in the southern Sudan, where more than 2.5 million people are in dire need of food aid, according to the World Food Program.
The AID administrator, Brian Atwood, said the latest United States contribution, which brings American aid in the Sudan to more than $75 million this year, would go to meet the most urgent needs of 1.2 million people. Mr. Atwood said that the Sudanese Government, which had earlier announced it would not impede relief efforts, had provided written authorization on Sunday for five additional heavy-lift aircraft.

HEADLINE: Rage of the Rank and File

BYLINE: By Charles R. Morris; Charles R. Morris, a financial consultant, is the author of "The Cost of Good Intentions: New York City and the Liberal Experiment" and a forthcoming history of financial crises.

 BODY:
Punching a police horse in the nose doesn't win you many friends, and the recent mobbing of midtown by angry construction workers is enough to make New Yorkers sympathize with taxi strikes. The taxi drivers, after all, scrape out a living by working incredibly long hours in a nerve-jangling, high-risk occupation. The brawny, well-paid suburbanites who left 18 injured police officers in their wake just don't tweak our innate sense of justice.
But beyond the boorishness, there is sadness. The demonstration wasn't about wages, or working conditions, or job site safety. Instead it was a simple outburst of frustration over the degree to which even New York is no longer a union town. 
 The precipitating issue was the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's hiring of a nonunion contractor for a major renovation job. Public agencies have always been allowed to hire nonunion workers so long as they pay prevailing wages. Until recently, however, it would have been inconceivable to see nonunion workers on big public projects. Numbers are elusive, but even the unions concede that most construction work in New York, especially if rehabilitations are included, is now nonunion.
American unionism was one of the great social movements that shaped our history, a transcendent cause that people got beaten up or died for, much like the civil rights movement. The collective memory of unionists thrills to dramas of torchlit parades, inspiring folk singers, legendary orators. The enemies were exploitative employers, dangerous working conditions, sweatshop wages. The movement was about simple moral imperatives, just like civil rights.
The heyday of construction organizing was about a century ago. Irishmen predominated in the trades, and their unions reflected an ethnic clannishness. Union memberships were passed down like family heirlooms, from father to son, from uncle to cousin. In construction trades, the union hiring hall is the real employer, not the contractor. Builders come and go; the union is the constant.
The union movement was already on the downswing in the late 1960's, when guild-style trade-union exclusionism ran smack into the civil rights demand for integrated work forces. Union resistance was partly just sheer, ugly racism, but partly it was also about losing control over a small, stable part of the universe. Now almost half of all new apprentices are from minority groups. That is both a tribute to the quiet efforts of labor statesmen like the late Peter Brennan and a reflection of generational discontinuities. The sons of plumbers prefer college.
Now, as often as not, unions are thought of as obstructionists, grit in the economic machinery, just one more reason that everything costs so much in New York. And it's true; unions are expensive. Nationwide, construction workers get half again as much as factory workers, and New York construction wages are a third higher yet.
But it's hard to begrudge that an operating engineer can make $100,000 in a good year, when Goldman, Sachs partners may pocket a billion from their company's public stock offering. Operating engineers run the big rigs, the shovels, cranes and bulldozers that delight all of us sidewalk gawkers. What Goldman, Sachs partner can do anything as useful?
More corrosive are the work rules: overtime for any hours outside 8 A.M. and 4 P.M., and the manning rules -- minimum numbers of paid standbys; nonworking, but paid, shop stewards; minimum two-man teams on light jobs; deputy foremen, much else. For years contractors have tried to void a rule requiring pay for mandatory teamsters, whether they show up or not, but that rule stands. The theatrical unions milked the movie industry the same way and chased it from the city. None of this is caused by global competition.
Only the highly skilled trades are heavily unionized now, despite some recent organizing successes among the laborers. Skyscraper buildings need hundreds of ironworkers, operating engineers, industrial-scale plumbers and electricians. Those are the kinds of numbers and skills that can be found only in a hiring hall. But union cards are rarely seen on run-of-the-mill work sites, like middle-income apartment developments. Contractors bring their own workers, not so much for pay savings as for work-rule flexibility.
We're living in an age of the 401(k) and nomadic "knowledge workers," when all the great social movements have ossified -- the New Deal is fossilized in bureaucracy, the civil rights movement fights over quotas, feminism has become political correctness, unionism institutionalized grabbiness. The outpouring of tens of thousands of workers in the union demonstration last week was a brief flicker from a time when big issues could still stir the soul.

 BODY:

The Winter Guest
Even the sea has frozen solid on the icy winter day that Elspeth (Phyllida Law) drops in unannounced and unwanted on her recently widowed daughter, Frances (Emma Thompson, left, who is actually Ms. Law's daughter). Having resumed life in northern Scotland with her teen-age son (Gary Hollywood), Frances is unreceptive to her mother's emotional support. As a sort of counterpoint, Alan Rickman's solemnly talky film weaves in the stories of three pairs of villagers and ends on a warmly mushy note in, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, "a fussy, sentimental exercise in theatrical counterpoint." 

1997. New Line. $101.76. Laser disk, $39.99. 106 minutes. Closed captioned. Release date: Tuesday.
 
Sphere
Yes, that's Sharon Stone as the starchy biochemist Beth Halperin down there in the submersible with the brilliant mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), the brash astrophysicist (Liev Schreiber) and the reasonable team psychologist (Dustin Hoffman). On the sea bottom is a strange round object that sucks in unsuspecting scientists for some quick mind bending and sends e-mail bulletins about its mood swings. Sounds extraterrestrial, maybe "bigger than Copernicus," as the story hype puts it. Anyway, it all gets checked out in Barry Levinson's "solid thriller with many showy scientific overtones" (Janet Maslin).
1998. Warner. $107.37. Laser disk, $39.98. 133 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.
 
Illtown
If it has no new twist on the old drug-deal-double-cross formula, Nick Gomez's film does present a cool, dreamy gangster's world with intimations of purgatory at every turn.
Dante (Michael Rapaport) and his lover, Micky (Lili Taylor), are routinely peddling the stuff when their former partner, Gabriel (Adam Trese), gets out of jail and, as the characters' names suggest, rakes up memories of past betrayals. With no plot trails to break, Mr. Gomez turns "Illtown" into "a sleek metaphysical experiment in visual style" (Maslin).
1996. Live. $83.33. Laser disk, $39.99. 103 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.
 
Swept From the Sea
Xenophobic Cornish villagers mistake the babbling young man to be a crazy person, but he's really the dashing Ukrainian adventurer Yanko Gooral (Vincent Perez), who's washed ashore after his ship goes down on its way to America. In Beeban Kidron's heavy-handed adaptation of Joseph Conrad's story "Amy Foster," Gooral is nursed to health by a beautiful but strange servant girl (Rachel Weisz). Despite a loud, determinedly romantic symphonic score, Mr. Perez and Ms. Weisz strike sparks like a wet book of matches. Also blame the film's soggy thud on "too much rain, too many shots of the churning sea and far too much music" (Holden).
1997. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77. Laser disk, $34.95. 115 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.
 
Straight to Video
Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release at one time or appeared on television.
GREASE. It's summertime in the 50's and the romance is back between the greaser Danny (John Travolta) and the wholesome Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) in a 20th-anniversary reissue of Randall Kleiser's adaptation of the Broadway musical. 1978. Paramount. $14.99 in wide-screen and regular television format. $19.99 for an edition with a CD and a booklet about the production. 110 minutes. PG.
THE FLY. During a matter transference a housefly gets mixed up with a scientist in the teleportation machine, producing a man with a fly's head and a fly with a man's head. It all makes ideal material for Vincent Price, who stars with Herbert Marshall in Kurt Neumann's cult film, with a screenplay by James Clavell. 1958. Fox. $14.99. 90 minutes.
THE FACE OF RUSSIA. In return for its icons, prose and music, Russia borrowed political and economic ideas from the West. James Billington narrates the three-part series shown recently on PBS, which traces the Russians through a thousand years of spiritual development, literature, art and architecture, music and, finally, the films of Sergei Eisenstein and modern media. 1998. Home Vision. Three cassettes, $79.95. 60 minutes each.
A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA. Rick is finished in town and now it's the Marx Brothers' turn as Groucho, Harpo and Chico tangle with war-surplus Nazis. 1946. Warner. $14.99. 85 minutes.

HEADLINE: DuPont Sees Profit Drop and Stock Falls

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., July 9

 BODY:
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company said today that it expected its second-quarter earnings to be 10 percent to 15 percent lower than the 99 cents a share it earned in the comparable period last year.
On the New York Stock Exchange, DuPont's shares tumbled $7 each, to $70.125, pulling down the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 DuPont attributed the lowered earnings expectations to problems with its crop protection products business, prompted by the Asian financial crisis and weather and pricing pressures in North America.
Lower oil prices, lower demand in the textile industry and the General Motors strike also contributed to the expected earnings decline, according to the statement from DuPont.
"We find this totally unacceptable," Charles O. Holliday Jr., president and chief executive, said in a telephone news conference. "We find it unacceptable that we didn't see this coming sooner."
He said the company had put into effect a plan to improve performance and productivity.
Although the G.M. strike has not had a major impact on the company, it has affected it broadly, he said, noting DuPont makes more than 40 products for the automotive industry, including paint, plastics and fibers.
Mr. Holliday said that unless energy prices improved, the company would not be able to post a fifth consecutive year of record earnings.
DuPont, which operates in 70 countries, said it will release an earnings statement on July 22.

HEADLINE: Will Asia Turn Against the West?

BYLINE: By Fareed Zakaria; Fareed Zakaria is a managing editor of Foreign Affairs and the author of 'From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America's World Role'

 BODY:
The fire raging in East Asia today jeopardizes one of the central achievements of postwar American foreign policy -- the stabilization and growth of East Asia. Even more dangerously, if it continues to fester, this crisis could undermine support for an open global economy and economic and political liberalization across the world.
The facts are bleak. In the last two years Indonesia's economy has shrunk by almost 80 percent, Thailand's by 50 percent, South Korea's by 45 percent, Malaysia's by 25 percent. Even islands of prosperity like Hong Kong and Singapore are in deepening recessions. Currencies and stock markets have plunged to unimaginable lows; unemployment and poverty are climbing to new highs. 
 To take the worst example, Indonesia's per capita gross domestic product has dropped from $3,500 to less than $750, wiping out 25 years of economic progress. Some 100 million people -- almost half of that vast country -- have sunk below the poverty level, and fears of a famine are growing. President B. J. Habibie has called on his citizens to fast twice a week to lessen the need to import food. Japan, the only nation that could spur a new round of growth in the region, has now slipped firmly into its second recession in five years.
The Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund had an initial strategy to deal with what began as a financial crisis in Thailand in June 1997. First, they assumed it would be temporary, "a few small glitches along the road" in President Clinton's words. Second, they assumed it would be localized. Third, they assumed that the I.M.F. would restore stability.
All three assumptions have been proved wrong. The I.M.F.'s prescriptions have not worked; currencies and stock markets continue to fall. The panic is now a depression and has spread beyond East Asia. Markets as large as Russia and Australia and as distant as Mexico and South Africa have been battered.
If official responses have been inadequate, the reactions of American foreign policy pundits to the crisis have been worse. Much of this commentary has been to note gleefully that Asia's troubles confirm the virtues of the American system and the bankruptcy of "Asian values."
In the late 1940's, as Europe struggled to cope with similar economic hardships, George Marshall warned Americans that "the patient is sinking as the doctors deliberate." Today it is as if the doctors are vivisecting the patient to score points about anatomy.
The prosperity and stability of East Asia are -- were? -- extraordinary achievements. Thirty years ago, most of these countries seemed stuck in the dismal poverty that afflicted the third world, and the region was the most troubled part of the globe.
In Indonesia, more than 300,000 people had died in mob riots after a failed Communist-backed military coup in 1965. Malaysia, in civil war from 1948, lifted its state of emergency only in 1960. China, Taiwan and the Koreas had all been through grueling conflicts in the late 1940's and 1950's. And the Vietnam War was still in full fury.
One generation later, most of these nations had dramatically raised their living standards, substantially alleviating poverty and disease. Many, like Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia, had begun liberalizing their politics as well. It was the fastest move out of misery in history.
The success of the region owes much to the hard work of its people but also to American foreign policy. The United States fought two wars after 1945 to maintain stability in East Asia. It advocated economic and foreign policies that were adopted in much of the region.
Compared with countries like Brazil, Egypt and India -- whose protectionism and central planning were cheered on by socialist governments and left-wing economists -- East Asian regimes adopted policies that were broadly hospitable to free markets and free trade. They opened themselves up to foreign investment and multinational corporations and allowed the private sector to flourish. Throughout the cold war they were consistently anti-Soviet, banding together to form the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, practically the only pro-American regional grouping in the world outside of NATO. For these policies they became the pariahs of the third world, often branded as American stooges.
In fact the growth and stability of East Asia have been a central achievement of American foreign policy in the post-war era, a living refutation of once fashionable theories about American neo-imperialism, third-world dependence and the necessity for socialism in poor countries.
All this is at risk today. If East Asia does not begin to recover soon, the dangers to its own well-being are obvious, but those to regional stability and American interests are also great. South Korea's growing weakness makes that peninsula even more unstable than it already was (and with 36,000 American troops stationed there, any internal problem will quickly become an international one). Indonesia, a geographic absurdity comprising 2,000 islands and 1,100 dialects, could easily lapse into violence and begin splintering.
The sudden shift in the balance of power away from Japan and toward China will not serve regional peace or American interests. Japan remains the second-largest economy in the world and a liberal democratic partner of the United States. Its decision to stay a nonnuclear and largely nonmilitary power is a cornerstone of East Asian stability.
China, on the other hand, is a rising power in the midst of transforming its entire political and economic system, ruled by a regime seeking legitimacy. Great power transitions are never easy, but it is better when they happen slowly, surely and, in any event, not in an atmosphere of general crisis. To take one example, anger directed against the wealthy Chinese minorities in much of Southeast Asia is growing. Already, more than 1,000 ethnic Chinese were killed last May during riots in Indonesia. One can only hope that Beijing will not feel the need to intervene in this matter.
Most dangerously, however, the continued unraveling of East Asia's economies could derail economic and political liberalization across the globe. East Asia's governments have already tried to quell unrest by sounding more populist and protectionist. Indonesia's President Suharto chose Mr. Habibie as his successor partly because the latter has economic nationalist leanings. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia had until now practiced a clever form of duplicity, making fiery anti-Western speeches while adopting liberal policies -- usually through his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. But Mr. Mahathir's talk is now turning into action: he has put an old friend in charge of the economy, slighting Mr. Ibrahim and his reformist agenda. The Prime Minister has also warned of a "guerrilla war" if foreigners try to come in and buy cheap Asian assets. Labor unions and opposition figures in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia have begun demanding an end to the I.M.F.-forced liberalization.
Beyond East Asia, one can also see people drawing the wrong lessons. In India, Egypt and Mexico, intellectuals and politicians have begun point to East Asia's fate as the reason not to move toward free markets and free trade. Support for liberalization has always been weak in most of the third world. But when a country is growing at 8 percent a year, the opposition to reform is effectively silenced. When growing at 0.8 percent, as Malaysia will probably do this year, opponents are emboldened and their arguments gain currency. If the world appears to be divided once again between the Western nations, all rich, and the non-Western ones, all poor, these fires of resentment will only grow stronger.
What is to be done? The I.M.F.'s initial approach to this crisis was misguided in two vital areas -- its requirements for low government spending and large-scale domestic reform. It treated East Asian countries as if they had the usual developing country disease out-of-control budgets. In fact, most were running budget surpluses, had high domestic savings rates and had little inflation. In this context, an insistence on a tight fiscal policy was unnecessary and probably counterproductive.
On the other hand, the fund's insistence on tight monetary policy high interest rates is an understandable compromise between those who advocate even stronger methods of maintaining the value of currency (linking it inflexibly to the dollar) and those who want deflation. Given the huge devaluations that have already taken place across the region, some measures to restore confidence in East Asian currencies are not just appropriate, they are vital.
The requirements for domestic reform, especially of the financial sector, are of course based on impeccable economic logic. East Asia's economies do indeed practice a form of "crony capitalism" with under-regulated banks and much nepotism.
But as a political matter, was this the time to attempt a radical overhaul? After all, many countries have major inefficiencies in their systems. Were the I.M.F. to focus its gaze on, say, France and Germany (let alone another developing country like Brazil), it would surely find extravagant subsidies, cartels and other market-distorting mechanisms.
The I.M.F.'s reform requirements have only undermined the legitimacy and support of East Asia's governments at a time of acute crisis. If the situation does not improve, we may well see five or six major countries -- including South Korea, which is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- default on their foreign debts and impose capital controls on their currency. Say goodbye to globalization.
To be fair, the crisis in East Asia is largely unprecedented. The I.M.F. has already begun to relax its constraints on spending, and Robert Rubin, the United States Treasury Secretary, has called repeatedly for a social safety net in the region. He has also properly identified Japan as the key to reversing the slide. Mexico recovered after its financial crisis of 1994 because of that great sucking sound to the north -- the United States economy buying Mexican goods. East Asia's economies can grow their way out of their current misery only if Japan similarly fuels their export expansion. With Tokyo's economy declining about 3 percent this year, this seems unlikely. But the Japanese can solve this problem by spending and investing some of the vast sums they have, both in public and private hands.
But more than any specific economic policy, the Clinton Administration must fashion an overall political and economic strategy for East Asia. The people of these countries need to be given the sense that economic and political liberalization has not caused their problems, that they are not being abandoned, and that the West -- and in particular the United States -- is ready to help. President Clinton and Mr. Rubin must push for a coordinated strategy of public rhetoric, loans and aid -- involving the major Western powers, the I.M.F. and the World Bank -- to give the people of East Asia a sense of hope. Even if default becomes inevitable, better that it be done in an orderly manner. A retreat is better than a rout.
The United States is associated around the world with the cause of globalization, a connection it should proudly accept. The opening up of the world economy in the last 40 years has led to enormous economic and political progress for hundreds of millions across the globe.
But free markets and free trade are not naturally occurring and self-sustaining. They rest on an edifice of politics. The last great flourishing of the world economy began in the late 19th century, with British power undergirding it. It collapsed in the 1930's, when the liberal capitalist states seemed to be foundering in depression while fascist and communist states were rapidly industrializing. What followed was the breakdown of the world economy, autarky, economic nationalism, increasing political tension and world war. With American leadership, we can make sure that Europe's past will not be East Asia's future.

HEADLINE: New Board Member's Educational Odyssey

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
TERRI THOMSON'S new constituents, the 1.1 million students who attend New York City public schools, may be interested to learn that she often spends her free moments as they do, cramming for exams. Not in algebra or social studies, mind you, but in courses like Protest Movements, Neighborhoods, and Urban Planning.
Besides being one of two new members of the New York City Board of Education, and a longtime vice president of community affairs at Citibank, Ms. Thomson, 49, is a college student six credits away from a bachelor's degree at Queens College. Her dual major is political science and urban studies, with a minor in sign language, and she hopes to graduate in February. 
 Her grade point average? 3.8.
"I blew it," she says, "I was 4.0 for the longest time."
In embarking on a four-year term as a caretaker of and advocate for the country's largest school system, Ms. Thomson possesses little firsthand knowledge of life within public schools. She attended parochial schools, including Bishop Riley High School in Queens and the Thorpe Secretarial School, a now-defunct Roman Catholic school in Manhattan, from which she graduated in 1966. Her two daughters followed a similar route, in what she calls "a personal decision" that was "not a reflection at all on our neighborhood schools" in Flushing.
But what does seem to qualify Ms. Thomson for the board, in addition to two decades as a backstage player inside the city's political theaters, is an empathy for those navigating the dead ends and extended detours of the educational process. She contends that her own educational odyssey -- interrupted by marriage, family and then work, but ultimately resumed at night and on weekends a decade ago -- gives her unique standing to inspire a system from which less than half of the students graduate in four years.
"I'm going slowly, taking my time, fitting it into my schedule," Ms. Thomson said of her college experience the other night, in a telephone call from the weekend home in the Adirondacks that she shares with her husband, Ed, an electrician.
"I don't look back," she added. "I love going to school. I think I will go to school the rest of my life."
Ms. Thomson says that the mind-set that will light her way through 110 Livingston Street, the board's labyrinthine headquarters in Brooklyn, has been influenced by many passages in her life. They include helping her daughters, 26 and 23, acquire the skills to graduate from Williams College and Boston College; stitching together a coalition of parents at the Electchester Co-op in Flushing in the early 1970's to rebuild a rundown playground; building on that experience to attend to constituent concerns in the 1980's as the district administrator for Representative Gary Ackerman, a Democrat from northern Queens, and being the public face of Citibank since the early 1990's in meetings with small-business owners and politicians within the five boroughs.
PERHAPS the element of her background that has most tantalized officials at City Hall, and most unnerved those within the inner circle of Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, is that she is the daughter of a policeman, Albert Farrell, who retired in 1978 after 25 years. The first major decision that Ms. Thomson will probably have to make is to declare her stance on the Mayor's bid to give the police more responsibility for school safety.
After being stymied for three years by Dr. Crew and an unwavering four-member majority on the seven-member board, Mr. Giuliani is now presented with a wild card in Ms. Thomson. She replaces Carol A. Gresser, one of the most vocal opponents of expanding the police role, and Ms. Thomson has said she has yet to decide on a position. With no shortage of advocates seeking her vote, she says she still needs to spend more time studying the issue.
Asked if growing up in a police officer's home would predispose her, Ms. Thomson spoke cautiously.
"When there is a proposal on the table," she said, "I'll look at it and and see what questions I might have and make an informed decision based on the outreach that I've done."
But anyone who takes her vote for granted would do well to consider her position on publicly financed vouchers that would benefit the same parochial schools she and her children attended. She opposes them, saying that more investment, not less, is needed for public schools.
Ms. Thomson's evenhandedness and modesty are among the qualities that prompted Borough President Claire Shulman to tap her to succeed Ms. Gresser.
Mr. Ackerman, a political ally of Ms. Shulman's, said of Ms. Thomson: "I think she probably gets embarrassed when her name is in the paper. At least she used to."
"She is a workhorse," he added, "not a show horse."
The Rev. Floyd Flake, who resigned from Congress last year after 11 years representing Jamaica, Queens, said he appreciated Ms. Thomson's keen ear for people's concerns. He recalled Citibank's decision not long ago to replace the tellers at its Rochdale branch with bank machines. When Ms. Thomson learned that older people in the neighborhood were terrified of entrusting their life savings to such technology, she prevailed on the bank to install a customer service representative to guide them through the first six months.
"That kind of flexibility," Mr. Flake said, "will be very helpful to her as a member of the board, which can be a place where people dig deep into the cement and are sometimes intractable."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices Higher On Treasuries In a Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices made modest gains yesterday, bolstered by a strong dollar. But trading was light, with many investors waiting for new economic data before making any significant committments.
Japan's plan for tax cuts has disappointed currency traders with its lack of details, and the dollar rose yesterday against the yen and other leading currencies. Also helping the dollar has been concerns that China may devalue its currency. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities an attractive investment to foreign investors because of the potential gains from currency translation. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, to 107 15/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.60 percent, from 5.62 percent on Wednesday.
Treasury prices were held down by competing debt from new corporate and agency issues. Fannie Mae priced for sale $2 billion of 10-year notes yielding 37.5 basis points more than a Treasury security with a similar maturity. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
With rates now at historic lows, companies and municipalities are taking advantage to raise cash or refinance existing debt to reduce debt service payments. The added supply of debt to the market can often pressure yields to move higher until the glut is absorb by investors.
In the municipal market, the State of New York priced $563.2 million of general obligation refunding bonds yesterday through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The bonds were initially priced to yield a maximum 5.23 percent for bonds maturing in 2021, with shorter maturities priced to yield from 4 percent in 2000 to 5.20 percent in 2018.
While trading was considered quiet, the talk was that today's report on June producer prices might break the market's inertia.
"Tomorrow's P.P.I. release is projected to show that goods inflation remained quite benign in June, aided in a large measure by depressed energy prices and the turmoil in Asia," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, referring to the Producer Price Index.
Mr. Fine expects next week's consumer price report to be subdued and nonthreatening. And that the G.M. strike may be clouding near-term consumption patterns.

HEADLINE: True Grit in the Gritty Inner City;
Some Dreams Come True, but Company Fights for Life

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, July 3

 BODY:
When President George Bush dropped in on Steeltech Manufacturing Inc. here in 1992, he told reporters following him on the campaign trail that the newly minted, minority-owned metal-processing company was proof that "the American dream can still come true."
There is impressive evidence today that his faith was justified. Steeltech has moved into a cavernous new manufacturing plant in one of this city's poorest, toughest neighborhoods. Customers praise the quality of its welding and its painting equipment, which can electrically coat larger pieces of steel than any other independent plant in the country. Steeltech has grown to more than 200 employees, many of whom are thrilled to have left behind dead-end minimum-wage jobs or the welfare rolls. 
"This has given people around here hope," said Kim Jordan, 42, a single mother of three who has done everything from welding to helping out in research and development.
Trouble is, the privately held Steeltech is no dream come true for its investors or for customers who had to provide cash and other concessions to keep it afloat. Even though it has finally begun to generate some operating profits, Steeltech has not made payments on more than $30 million in Federal, state, local and private loans since 1996. Milwaukee taxpayers are shelling out $50,000 a month to bondholders to forestall foreclosure.
Still worse, two contracts that have accounted for more than 80 percent of Steeltech's revenue are about to end. Rumors of imminent bankruptcy were swirling until the company recently won a contract to work on the steel roof of Miller Park, the Milwaukee Brewers' new baseball stadium.
"It's been constant firefighting," said Charles Wallace, 52, the company's chairman and chief executive.
The lesson? So far, Steeltech is stark proof that the goal of returning skilled, industrial jobs to blighted inner cities remains a daunting one, even when the economy is booming and many companies are frantically scavenging the nation for skilled -- or simply trainable -- labor.
"You could never sustain an economy on this basis," conceded James Scherer, the administrator following Steeltech's struggles for Milwaukee's Economic Development Commission.
The city is not giving up, though. The shuttering of urban factories over the last two or three decades has been cited by sociologists like William Julius Wilson as the single largest factor in worsening the poverty, crime and drug use that grip many inner-city neighborhoods and strangle once-thriving retail districts. While no one expects these jobs to return on a broad scale, smaller manufacturing companies like Steeltech are seen as important adjuncts to rebuilding a more service-oriented urban economy that can profit from a central location and the labor available in inner cities.
Although Steeltech's wages are at the low end of the industrial scale here, they still offer a better prospect of upward mobility than most entry-level service jobs, such as those at the Walgreen's drugstore that recently opened across the street where clerks start at $6 an hour.
The debate about Steeltech's value might be clearer if it were simple to measure its costs and benefits, but that can't be done.
"It's been good for Milwaukee and it's met its social goals," maintained Paul Hollowell, executive vice president of the Oshkosh Truck Corporation, which ended up as both Steeltech's major customer and a source of working cash. Did Oshkosh benefit? "It's like W. C. Fields said about being tarred and feathered," Mr. Hollowell said, pointing out that Oshkosh wrote off $3.2 million in loans extended to Steeltech. "But for the honor, we'd probably rather not have done it."
Bill Dempsey, director of the Campaign for a Sustainable Milwaukee, a coalition of community and labor groups, argues that Oshkosh clearly benefited because Steeltech helped it maintain its standing as a leading truck supplier to the military. Other Milwaukee businesses made money selling Steeltech goods and services. "The jury is still out," he said, "on whether the Steeltech jobs justify the heavy public investment to create them."
Steeltech's story has unfolded in a era when the number of minority-owned businesses nationwide has been growing. The most recent United States census figures showed a 60 percent increase in such businesses, to 2.15 million, from 1987 to 1992. And Harriet Michel, executive director of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, a New York City-based nonprofit group dedicated to linking major corporations and government purchasing groups with minority-owned companies, says the growth is continuing. "But most of them are professional service companies," she said, "because the start-up costs are cheaper."
When it comes to setting up new businesses in the poorest urban areas, most of the action is in the commercial and service sectors, said Elisabeth Reynolds, vice president of the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, a Boston-based group working to identify urban business opportunities. Where manufacturing does succeed, it tends to be small and closely integrated with existing activities. Auto company suppliers in Detroit and garment makers in New York are frequently cited examples.
"To create a business out of thin air," she said, "is more risky than building on something that's there."
Steeltech's singular journey began with a broad public-private partnership and a torrent of publicity. The prime mover was Fred Luber, chairman of the Super Steel Products Corporation, who saw a chance to help Oshkosh, one of his major customers, fulfill the Pentagon requirement to set aside a certain amount of business for minority subcontractors to qualify for a $1.4 billion contract to build cargo transport vehicles for the Army.
Steeltech's job, Mr. Luber figured, would be to paint and assemble a newly designed cargo platform to go with the trucks, known as the flat rack. Although the first order was for just 8,000 flatracks, the Army was expected to need 100,000 eventually.
The well-connected Mr. Luber won the backing of figures like John O. Norquist, Milwaukee's popular Mayor, and cajoled numerous public and private groups into going along because of the project's potential social benefits. He and his lawyer were able to recruit black and Hispanic investors to hold a majority of Steeltech's stock by arranging for the company to lend them the money to acquiretheir holdings.
But Steeltech was nearly strangled at birth by its Pentagon contract, which was based on a wildly optimistic guess about the company's overhead. The profit outlook did not begin to improve until 1995, when Steeltech landed a second flatrack contract and a contract to paint Dodge Ram truck frames for the nearby auto components subsidiary of the A. O. Smith Corporation (Smith sold the business last year to Tower Automotive Inc., based in Minneapolis).
Each step forward has been clouded with developments that have made the company a local business soap opera. Relations with Mr. Luber became strained over how costs and equipment were allocated during the first two years that Steeltech operated out of the Super Steel factory. Management turnover -- Mr. Wallace is the fourth chief executive -- and labor tensions became routine. The labor unrest gave the United Electrical Workers the opening it needed to organize the plant after a contentious struggle that hurt Steeltech's local reputation.
Steeltech also lost money in ill-fated efforts to diversify into making jail cells and modules for fast-food restaurants. Part of the problem was that the Oshkosh and Tower contracts occupied too much of its capacity for it to pursue other businesses that might have been more profitable.
Steeltech has also paid a price for pursuing its social mission.
Its founders envisioned stories like that of Shafi Roemel Brooks, who was 40 when he was hired and trained as a painter in 1995, a month after returning home to Milwaukee from five years in a Federal prison in Texas on drug charges.
"I sold drugs from the time I was 14, and if it hadn't been for Steeltech I would probably have gone back to the streets," said Mr. Brooks, who earns $11 an hour and is now married. He says Steeltech made it possible for him to acquire both his first home and a 1997 Chevy Blazer.
Often, though, the results have been disappointing. Absenteeism rates were astronomical in the early years, as workers unused to the discipline of factory life were given multiple chances to shape up. Background checks were perfunctory.
"Some people were attracted thinking they'd get cut slack because it was minority-owned," Ms. Jordan said. Union officials cite one case in which the company allowed an employee who was late 17 times during the 30-day probationary period to become a full-time employee.
Mr. Wallace has tightened standards for reviewing the 2,000 job applicants coming through Steeltech's doors annually. But he still faces high turnover. Many workers tire of the factory's rigors, and others leverage their training into higher-paying jobs at Tower and other local employers. Two-thirds of the hourly work force has been at Steeltech less than two years.
This year, skilled workers have been leaving out of fear about Steeltech's prospects. Steeltech lost the flatrack contract to a San Diego-based subsidiary of Korea's Hyundai, which will build its version of the cargo carrier with Mexican labor in Tijuana, and to Summa Technology Inc. of Huntsville, Ala., which is owned by E. C. Lee, an Asian-American. Summa, which won the part of the contract set aside for minority-owned businesses, plans to make its units with just 85 workers in a new automated factory in Coleman, Ala. Steeltech will make the last of its 16,000 flatracks in the next month.
Making matters worse, Tower is installing its own high-technology paint line. It has given Steeltech notice that it will quit sending Dodge truck frames by early next year. Tower said the Chrysler Corporation had required it to install the new paint line to be eligible to make frames for the new Dodge Ram scheduled for 2002. Tower figures that making the inevitable switch now could save $1.5 million that is currently eaten up trucking frames to Steeltech and repairing the nicks and dents that come with such transfers.
"We're protecting 700 jobs at our plant," said James Lozelle, who oversees Tower's Milwaukee operations.
Steeltech got a crucial lift, though, when it won a $2 million subcontract from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America to build the roof of the new baseball park. Now, Mr. Wallace said, Steeltech has more than a year's breathing room and a good shot at further work on other contracts with Mitsubishi. Several other irons are in the fire as well, including a potential deal with Caterpillar.
A couple of more new contracts could seal the one thing Steeltech really needs: some kind of agreement from its many creditors to refinance or forgive more than $30 million in debt. Mr. Wallace, who owns the biggest chunk of the 60 percent stake held by minority investors, hopes to complete a package that forgives $3 million in debt and refinances the rest.
It cannot come too soon for Hubert Nelson, his head of marketing. "This can be a profitable $100 million company in five years, but the thing that comes up over and over again with potential clients is, 'Your financial condition scares me,' " said Mr. Nelson, whose marketing resume ranges from Exxon to Miller Brewing. "It's a tough nut to crack."

HEADLINE: The History Behind Trent Lott

 BODY:
Senator Trent Lott's recent condemnation of homosexuality and a variety of anti-gay initiatives in Southern communities point up an important trend in American politics, and a threatening one for advocates of inclusive democracy. Curiously, this more restrictive attitude toward social freedom is linked to a newly expansive exercise of religious freedom. Starting about 20 years ago, evangelical Christians began shedding their traditional aversion to political activism. In the South especially, they have flooded into the electoral process, settling mainly in the Republican Party. In doing it, they have charged and changed American politics as has no other force since the civil rights revolution. They have transformed the Republicans, bringing to the party a potent bloc vote, boundless energy and an unwillingness to compromise on certain domestic social issues.
Suddenly, a party that had been centered on economic issues and anti-Communism, and that first began to court the Southern vote in the days of segregation, found that its best new troops had concerns other than race: prayer in the schools, abortion and opposition to gay rights. Prayer and abortion got more attention in national campaigns, but the anti-gay theme was there from the beginning. In fact, the crusade by Anita Bryant, a devout Southern Baptist, against a gay rights ordinance in Miami in 1977 was an early rising of what came to be called the religious right. 
 The fundamentalists won that contest, reversing the ordinance by referendum, and the two movements -- evangelical Christians and gay rights -- have been in collision ever since. For the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who first brought evangelicals back to politics, and for James Dobson, their newest spokesman, Bible values are absolute. If homosexuals are condemned in scripture, as the fundamentalists say they are, then they must be condemned in society as well. The leaders of conservative religious organizations have been pressing the case with Republicans on Capitol Hill lately, and the effect has been plain to see.
Mr. Lott, the Senate majority leader, said last month that homosexuals are sinners. In Greenville, S.C., the pastor of the Choice Hills Baptist Church went him one better. They are "a stench in the nostrils of God," the Rev. Stan Craig declared. As Kevin Sack reported at length in The Times this week, that kind of sentiment has become the fashion among Republican politicians in several South Carolina towns. "The time has come to take a stand," a local school board chairman who was running for state superintendent of education proclaimed. He was talking about banning the Indigo Girls from singing at a high school because of complaints that they were lesbians. He got the Republican nomination. The new Republican mayor of Myrtle Beach won office by campaigning to stop the opening of the city's first gay bar. The bar opened anyway. But near Lancaster, S.C., a lesbian named Regan Wolf was twice beaten unconscious and tied spread-eagled on her porch. "Jesus weren't born for you, faggot," a spray-painted message said.
American history is replete with examples of the connection between the politics of bias and violence. Republican leaders ought to take stock of what is happening in their party leaders' press conferences and in its new areas of grass-roots primacy. The party of Lincoln, which freed the slaves so long ago, should not be sowing the seeds of a new hatred on Southern ground.

HEADLINE: G.E. Posts 13% Rise in 2d-Quarter Profits

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., July 9

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said today that its second-quarter profit rose 13 percent, driven by record sales at the maker of everything from light bulbs to loans.
Net income rose to $2.45 billion, or 74 cents a diluted share, aided by higher profits from its NBC television network and its aircraft engine unit. G.E.'s revenue rose 14 percent, to $25.1 billion. 
 Under its chairman, John F. Welch Jr., G.E. has built its 12 biggest businesses into market leaders. Meanwhile, G.E. surpassed other old-line manufacturers by pushing into financial services and expanding its business of servicing products.
"The diversity of businesses is working for them," said Russell Leavitt, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
G.E.'s earnings were not lowered as much as those at other United States companies by the Asian economic crisis because it makes less than 4 percent of its profit from the region.
G.E., based in Fairfield, was expected to earn 74 cents a diluted share, the average estimate of analysts polled by the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. The company earned $2.16 billion, or 65 cents a diluted share, in the second quarter of 1997 on revenue of $22 billion.
G.E.'s profits have climbed an average of 12 percent a year in the last five years. Investors responded by bidding up the company's shares. On Tuesday, G.E. became the first United States company to reach a market value of more than $300 billion.
G.E.'s profit was led by gains at GE Capital, the company's finance unit, as well as its aircraft engines, medical systems, and transportation units.
Profit at GE Capital rose 17 percent, to $933 million, as sales rose in specialty financing and insurance.

HEADLINE: Senators Back Sale of Wheat To Pakistanis

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from farmers, the Senate today unanimously agreed to exempt food exports from sanctions that the United States imposed on India and Pakistan after the two countries conducted nuclear tests in May.
The Senate's vote, 98 to 0, lifts the largest and most painful economic penalty that Washington inflicted and leaves almost no meaningful sanctions in place to punish India and Pakistan for the tests, which drew international opprobrium. 
 Restrictions on military aid remain, but there was never much to begin with. The World Bank has resumed aid to India, with the Administration's support. And India and Pakistan are small markets for American non-farm goods at any rate.
Senators said they are still deeply troubled by the threat of a new arms race. But looking ahead to the November elections, they also have important farming constituents to consider: Foreign grain dealers eagerly lined up to take orders from Pakistan after American farmers were sidelined by the sanctions.
"Whether the Pakistanis buy U.S. wheat, Canadian wheat or some other country's wheat isn't going to make a difference on a dinner table in Islamabad, but it sure will in Topeka," said Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican of Kentucky who helped write today's bill.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, rushed the bipartisan bill to the floor today on short notice, bypassing the usual committee review.
There was reason to hurry. Pakistan plans to buy 350,000 metric tons of wheat next Wednesday. If the sanctions law is not changed by then, American wheat farmers could not bid on the sale, which agricultural experts valued at $37 million.
Wheat prices have plunged to a seven-year low because of excess supply, causing many farmers from the Dakotas to the Pacific Northwest to give up their land, and today a parade of farm-state Senators took to the floor to urge approval.
"Washington State wheat growers need this bill," said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Her state sends 37 percent of its wheat to Pakistan, shipments valued at about $500 million a year.
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, voiced even more distress: "We in the Pacific Northwest are six days away from disaster."
House Republican leaders have promised to whisk the Senate bill through when the House returns from recess early next week. Mr. Clinton, who had called the Indian tests "a terrible mistake," indicated today that he supports the bill.
The deal nearly fell apart earlier today when Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who wrote the original sanctions legislation, balked at an early draft that gave President Clinton the authority to exempt other sectors in addition to agriculture.
Supporters of that provision, which would have been effective only through March 1999, said it would have given Mr. Clinton a diplomatic carrot to entice India and Pakistan to sign treaties to restrict their nuclear testing.
"It would have dumped out everything on sanctions, and given the President complete carte blanche without Congress being involved at all," said Mr. Glenn, who voted for the bill once the proposed waiver authority was dropped.
The Arms Export Control Act of 1994 punishes countries that test nuclear tests by cutting off trade credits, private bank loans, support for loans from international institutions and loan guarantees.
But in recent weeks the World Bank has resumed aid to India, with Washington voting in favor. Administration officials cited an exemption in the law for humanitarian aid, a category the White House apparently defines to include most of the bank's activities in India.
The new World Bank loans are aimed at projects to insure that more children complete primary school, to train health workers and to pay for immunization and nutrition services for pre-school children and pregnant and nursing women.
The sanctions that will remain after House action on today's bill include a longstanding provision that cut off all arms sales and military aid to Pakistan after Washington determined in 1990 that Pakistan had nuclear devices. Among other things, it halted the sale of 28 F-16 fighter jets, for which Pakistan had already paid $600 million.
Military sales to India are tiny.
The legislation today, the Farm Export Relief Bill, exempts from the sanctions Government-guaranteed credits to American farmers for food products and fertilizer being sold to India and Pakistan.
"Food should not be a weapon of foreign policy," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. "When sanctions are unduly rigid and automatic, they become a roadblock to diplomacy."
Indeed, Congress has been having second thoughts lately about the merit of sanctions in general, one of lawmakers' favorite foreign-policy cudgels. Senator McConnell leads an 18-member bipartisan group that is to review the effectiveness of scores of sanctions the United States has imposed over the years; their report is due in September.
Many free-trade advocates, like Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, argue that unilateral sanctions inflict no pain on their targets, who buy their wares elsewhere, and hurt American businesses in an increasingly global marketplace.
Senator Fred Thompson, a Republican from Tennessee, summed up the reservations of many lawmakers, saying, "We need to keep in mind that while we're bashing sanctions, we've not made a distinction between countries who pose a threat to us and those who do not."

Take Away the 'Acting' Label: Selig Is Baseball's Commissioner

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 9

 BODY:
On Bud Selig's 2,130th day as acting commissioner, Major League Baseball club owners looked at him and liked what they saw. So today they elected him quickly and unanimously as the sport's ninth commissioner.
Although Selig will shed the "acting" from his unofficial title Aug. 1, he is not expected to alter the way in which he has performed his role since Sept. 9, 1992, two days after the last commissioner, Fay Vincent, resigned under pressure. Indeed, the owners don't want him to change. 
 "Bud knows how to get things done," said Drayton McLane of Houston, who, with Carl Pohlad of Minnesota, led the effort that persuaded Selig to accept the job. "He is the most effective political leader I have ever met. Every owner trusts him."
Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox had been portrayed by other owners and officials as opposing the idea of an owner being commissioner, but he voted for Selig and said afterward: "I don't think there's anybody in America who could do the job that he can do. The only alternative was bringing in an outsider. That just didn't make any sense at all."
Selig, who will turn 64 on July 30, was elected as quickly as it took the owners to take a roll-call vote, having previously voted to dispense with the requirement that election be done by written ballot. He was elected for a five-year term with his salary to be set by the executive council.
Selig currently earns $2.5 million as council chairman and is expected to begin his full-time job with a salary of at least $3 million a year. As the man in charge for the past 70 months (his tenure matching Lou Gehrig's one-time record for consecutive games played), Selig has already served longer than four of the previous eight commissioners: Peter V. Ueberroth (1,643 days), Gen. William Eckert (1,129), Vincent (1,091) and A. Bartlett Giamatti (154).
As the first team owner to become commissioner, Selig will be replaced as the trustee of his approximately one-third share of the Milwaukee Brewers, before he officially takes office. The club's board of directors is expected to elect Wendy Selig-Prieb, his daughter and current vice president, as president.
Selig said he will move out of his office at County Stadium and open a new office in downtown Milwaukee, dividing his time between there and the commissioner's office on Park Avenue in New York.
Saying he was sensitive to possible conflicts arising from his position as an owner, Selig told a news conference that after 28 years as club president, "It's time for me to go now."
"If I really believed in my heart and mind that I couldn't do this, if I'm not capable of making that very emotional and very sensitive shift, then I should have had the decency to say I just can't do that," he added. "But I know that I can."
Selig's election surprised absolutely no one, not on management's side, not on the players' side.
"For a long time it has been clear that eventually the owners would formally name Bud to be the commissioner," said Donald Fehr, the union chief, whose relationship with Selig has improved since it reached its nadir during the labor dispute in 1994-95.
Even Sue Selig, the new commissioner's wife, said today that she "knew in my heart" probably since the labor dispute was resolved that he would accept the job. Her husband, however, had steadfastly said he did not want the job, although never ruling out that he would take it.
A search committee, meanwhile, considered hundreds of candidates, and Jerry McMorris of Colorado, the chairman, had whittled the list to four names, including Leonard Coleman, the National League president.
But an increasing number of owners told Selig he was the only man for the job. "We've been working on him as long as I can remember," Pohlad said. McLane added, "Bud has stiff-armed us for over a year."
Selig said today that he was driving in his car one day and said to himself, "You're going to do this." He did not say when he had that conversation, but another owner said Selig disclosed his decision in late May or early June.
A key factor in his decision, Selig said, was the presence of Paul Beeston as baseball's chief operating officer for the past year.
"Paul will do much more of the day-to-day, operational things," he said. "I'll do more global things."
Included in the global area is the problem of resolving the economic disparity between large- and small-revenue clubs. That issue and lasting labor peace are the two most important matters facing Selig.
"We need to reduce the acrimony from this equation once and for all," said Selig, who was in charge of the owners' labor committee in the sport's last three work stoppages. "We've never been able to do that. We've had eight work stoppages. We have to make sure that the next generation doesn't have to endure any work stoppages."
The owners have responded positively to Selig's consensus-building style and seem to feel he will be a "safe" commissioner because he never acts in a precipitous or controversial manner.
Jerry Colangelo, managing partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks and the National Basketball Association Phoenix Suns, compared Selig favorably with David Stern, who has been considered the most successful commissioner of a professional league.
"They're two different individuals with different personalities and different methodologies," Colangelo said. "Each in his own way has been very effective."
During Selig's tenure as acting commissioner, the owners have adopted interleague play, three-division leagues and wild-card teams for the playoffs, greatly increased their revenue sharing and approved a limited form of realignment, shifting Selig's Brewers into the N.L.

Japanese Banks Cutting Back on U.S. Presence

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 9

 BODY:
Overcome by bad loans in their home country, Japanese banks and other financial institutions are in a broad retreat from the United States market, closing offices and cutting back on their lending to American companies.
The situation represents a sharp reversal from the late 1980's and the early 1990's, when Japanese banks were expanding rapidly in California and elsewhere in the United States, gaining market share by aggressive lending at low rates and even raising some concern that the Japanese would dominate banking as they did consumer electronics. 
 Now, Japanese banks are wary about making new loans or renewing old ones. "Basically they're gone, on the sidelines," said an executive at an American bank in charge of making syndicated loans to corporations who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Japanese banks accounted for less than 10 percent of the syndicated loans provided to American companies with investment-grade credit ratings in the first quarter of 1998, down from 26 percent in the comparable quarter a year earlier, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation, a market research firm in New York.
Japanese banks are pulling out of the United States altogether or consolidating operations in New York. The number of Japanese banks with offices in New York has fallen to 55 from 70 in the last few years, according to a compilation made in February by Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper. The number with offices in Los Angeles has dropped to 17 from 25, and to 16 from 21 in Chicago.
Some Japanese banks are also selling part of their American operations. Fuji Bank raised about $1 billion by selling a minority stake in Heller Financial Inc., a finance company in Chicago, in an initial public offering at the end of April. In March, Sumitomo Bank sold Sumitomo Bank of California to Zions Bancorp of Utah for $546 million. It also sold off pieces and shut down the rest of its operation that made loans to small and medium-sized businesses.
The Japanese banking crisis is also accelerating the sale of Japanese-owned hotels, office buildings and golf courses in the United States, many of which were bought at exorbitant prices in the late 1980's. Nikko Securities, for instance, just agreed to sell the Watergate Hotel in Washington to the Blackstone Group for $39 million.
"It's like a fire sale," said Shuhei Okuda, president of Mitsui Fudosan U.S.A., the American arm of a Japanese real estate company. "They have to sell, especially when the bank presses the borrowers who own the property to sell and repay the money."
The sharp retreat from lending by Japanese banks has contributed to a modest increase in interest rates paid by American corporate borrowers, bankers and analysts said. Some big financings have taken longer to arrange. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Trust took longer than expected to arrange more than $7 billion in loans to finance its acquisition of the ITT Corporation in part because Japanese banks, which in the past would have provided a big chunk of that money, declined to participate. The delay in financing even prompted speculation that the takeover might fall through.
But by and large, the retreat from the American market by the Japanese banks has had little effect on the American economy because there are many other sources of credit for companies. This contrasts sharply with the situation in Japan and in other parts of Asia, where cutbacks in lending by Japanese banks have contributed to a credit crunch that has driven some companies into bankruptcy and worsened economic downturns.
In the United States, the pullback from lending by Japanese banks has been counterbalanced by financial deregulation in Japan, which has made it easier for Japanese to invest overseas. With the dollar strong and interest rates higher in America than in Japan, Japanese money has moved into American stocks, bonds and banks, helping keep interest rates low and stocks high.
One big fear has not materialized: that the crisis would force Japanese Government and financial institutions to sell off huge portions of their United States Treasury bonds, causing American interest rates to rise and slowing the economy. A hint of such a sale by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto caused the United States stock markets to plunge one day last year. But Treasury bonds are still attractive to Japanese and other foreign investors.
The most important effect of the Japanese banking crisis on the United States is likely to come not from cutbacks by Japanese banks in the United States but more indirectly. The banking crisis is plunging Japan into recession, which hurts American exports and also is making it difficult for the rest of ailing Asia to recover. United States officials have said they fear a drastic downturn in Japan could set off a worldwide recession.
Thus far, the most obvious effect in the United States is less lending by Japanese banks. Beset by at least $600 billion in problem loans tied to Japanese real estate, Japanese banks are struggling to maintain capital levels equal to 8 percent of assets, a requirement for international banks. With their capital eroding from loan losses and the weak Japanese stock market, the banks are having to reduce assets, which generally means loans.
"Their capital base is so eroded they have to reduce assets any way they can," said Richard Koo, chief economist for Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo.
In the United States, assets held by Japanese-owned bank branches dropped to $347 billion at the end of 1997 from $404 billion at the end of 1994, according to the Federal Reserve.
Without a big base of dollar-denominated deposits, Japanese banks and other finance companies generally borrow from other banks to obtain the money they then lend out in the United States. But because of fears about the health of the Japanese banking system, Japanese banks have had to pay higher rates for this borrowed money than American or European banks do. The banks can no longer profitably pursue their old strategy of lending at low interest rates to gain market share.
"We're priced out of the market for U.S. companies," said Edward W. Bjelke, executive vice president of Sanwa Bank in New York. The bank's outstanding loans in the United States have fallen to about $40 billion from $72 billion a few years ago, he said. This week, Sanwa said it would liquidate the Sanwa Securities (USA) Company, which has been a dealer of United States Treasury securities, and refocus its investment banking activities on the more profitable derivatives business.
The Mitsui Leasing Capital Corporation, a leasing and finance company in New York that is part of the Mitsui Group, recently laid off four of its six American professionals and is sending four Japanese staff members back home as it reduces its loans and leases and sells real estate in Hawaii and New York.
"We haven't been booking new business," said Jeff Fishman, a vice president who was laid off nine days ago. "We're in a holding pattern right now." Masato Utsumi, the president, said Mitsui Leasing was shifting to higher-risk loans and leasings with potentially better returns because its borrowing costs are now higher.
Two other Japanese leasing companies, Ryoshin Leasing, which is part of the Mitsubishi Group, and Crown Leasing, owned by the troubled Nippon Credit Bank, have shut their American offices entirely.
The Japanese banks pulling out of the American market so far have been mainly smaller, regional banks. The giant nationwide commercial banks are retrenching as well, though they generally are not leaving the United States entirely. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank recently closed its San Francisco office. Sanwa Bank is shutting offices in Boston, Cleveland and Atlanta.
The head of the Los Angeles office of a big Japanese bank said that with fewer loans being made, decision-making was being concentrated in New York. "In the past, I enjoyed the freedom to develop the business on my own in the 14 Western states," he said.
The beachhead of Japanese banking in the United States has been California, where the Japanese opened retail banking branch networks, not just corporate banking offices like those in New York. By the late 1980's, Japanese banks owned 4 of the 10 largest banks in the state.
But the Japanese banks by and large have performed more poorly than competitors, and fears of Japanese dominance have subsided. The merger of two of the Japanese-owned California banks and the sale of Sumitomo Bank of California leave only two big Japanese-owned banks in the state, both of which are now the focus of speculation that they might be sold.
One is the Unionbancal Corporation, which has about $30 billion in assets and is the third-largest commercial bank in the state, behind BankAmerica and Wells Fargo. With both of those big banks having recently agreed to mergers, Union, which is controlled by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, has become the biggest potential takeover candidate for an out-of-state bank looking to expand in California. The other bank is Sanwa Bank California, the state's fourth-largest commercial bank, with assets of $8 billion.
Both banks deny they are for sale and both have been performing better than Sumitomo. Tamio Takakura, president of Sanwa Bank California, said that with the deregulation of financial markets in Japan, the expertise his unit had from operating in the ferociously competitive United States market was more valuable than ever to the parent. The California unit, for instance, is helping to manage mutual funds offered to Japanese consumers.
"We are increasingly becoming a strategic unit for them," said Mr. Takakura, whose 50th-floor office atop one of the fanciest skyscrapers in Los Angeles symbolizes the ambitions Japanese banks once had in the United States. "They're expecting a lot from us, not just earnings."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about retrenchment by Japanese banks in the United States referred incorrectly to the San Francisco office of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. The office remains open. The bank has consolidated back-office operations of the San Francisco office with those in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell in June, Led by Decline in Energy Costs

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
Producer prices fell in June for the first time in three months as energy costs retreated, the latest evidence that inflation is not threatening the economy.
The Labor Department said today that producer prices dropped one-tenth of a percent last month. The core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, rose two-tenths of a percent. Absent a 3.2 percent increase in prescription drug costs, the core rate would have risen one-tenth of a percent, a Government spokesman said. 
 In May, producer prices over all and the core rate both increased two-tenths of a percent.
"Inflation is going to stay low as long as Asia remains in a recession," said Suzanne Rizzo, an economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., a New York consulting firm. "That creates a huge supply of cheap goods for America consumers and producers, keeping prices down."
That also suggests that Federal Reserve policy makers will hold interest rates steady this year. A Fed governor, Roger Ferguson, hinted as much on Thursday.
"Continued strong economic growth with low inflation is not outside the realm of possibility," he said in a speech at the Atlanta Fed, "and by adopting a cautious policy posture, we may learn more clearly if that possibility is likely or remote."
Asia's economic crisis is contributing to the tame inflation outlook by depressing the value of Pacific Rim currencies against the dollar, sending import prices lower. The crisis has caused the prices of oil, food and other commodities to decline, helping to hold down interest rates in this country.
The June decline represents the first time in three months that producer prices have not risen. Before April, prices had fallen for five consecutive months.
In the year's first half, prices declined at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, compared with a decline of 2.4 percent during the first six months of 1997. Also during the first six months, the core rate rose at a 1.4 percent annual rate, compared with a decline of one-tenth of a percent for the first six months of last year.
By industry, wholesale energy prices fell 1.7 percent during June as the price of petroleum declined 12.3 percent. Crude oil prices have fallen from more than $18 a barrel at the start of the year to as low as $13 in mid-June.
Producer food prices increased one-tenth of a percent in June, and auto prices three-tenths of a percent.
Tobacco prices increased one-tenth of a percent in June. A 3.4 percent tobacco price increase in April accounted for half of that month's increase in producer prices.
Prescription drug prices rose 3.2 percent last month on the heels of May's record 10.7 percent increase.

Latest Letdown: Airport's Nosedive

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 10

 BODY:
It could not have had a more auspicious beginning, with inaugural flights by President Jiang Zemin of China and President Clinton, both of whom said they were duly impressed. But then, world leaders don't have to line up at check-in counters, claim their bags or sprint to far-flung gates.
For everybody else who traveled through Hong Kong's lavish new airport this week, the experience was less impressive than bewildering. Planes were delayed, gates were mixed up, baggage was lost, toilets backed up, flight information boards went dark and crates of seafood rotted on the tarmac. 
 To say that Hong Kong International Airport has had a turbulent takeoff does not capture the bizarre string of mishaps that have afflicted this $20 billion project since it opened on Monday. Nor does it evoke the outrage and embarrassment that people here feel about what was supposed to be the pride of Hong Kong -- and has instead become a colossal public-relations nightmare.
"It was complete chaos," said Peter D. Cleary, an American lawyer who has lived in Hong Kong for 14 years and takes pride in its reputation for brisk efficiency. On Monday Mr. Cleary landed at the airport at 10 P.M., was stuck on his plane for nearly two hours while the pilot tried to find a gate, and finally collected his bags at 4:30 A.M., after wandering the terminal for hours.
"I thought it was incredibly shoddy, and I'm not a grouch by nature," Mr. Cleary said. "To call this teething problems is farcical."
Today, under intense public pressure, Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, said he would appoint an independent panel to investigate the problems and determine who was responsible. In the meantime, Hong Kong's top civil servant, Anson Chan, pleaded with the public not to be too harsh on the airport managers, as they labored to fix the problems.
But the managers had the extreme misfortune of stumbling the week after Hong Kong's first democratically elected legislature since the handover took office. Grabbing a ripe opportunity for political theater, the lawmakers on Thursday hauled in the chief executive of the Airport Authority, Hank Townsend, for a 90-minute inquisition, during which he was repeatedly urged to resign.
"This was meant to be a first-class project, but it has turned into a ninth-class airport and a disgrace," said Lau Kong-wah, a member of Hong Kong's main pro-Beijing party.
"Our airport has become the laughingstock of the world," Mr. Lau said, shooting a baleful glance at Mr. Townsend, a 65-year-old American executive who came from the Bechtel Corporation.
Mr. Townsend did not return telephone calls, but a spokesman for the airport, Clinton Leeks, apologized for the foul-ups. He added that the problems in the passenger terminal were abating.
The trouble is, people here are not in a generous mood. Hong Kong's economy is sliding into its worst recession since World War II, with soaring unemployment, a swooning stock market and a crashing property market. Aside from a brief burst of enthusiasm during the visits of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Clinton, Hong Kong has had a listless year since it reverted to China last July.
The government clearly hoped the new airport would be a tonic for the city and a symbol of its brighter future. Certainly, the project has an only-in-Hong-Kong feeling to it: Engineers chopped the tops off two small islands, filled in the water between them, and put a massive airport on top. They also built a web of bridges, tunnels, and highways to transport people 21 miles into town.
The government even turned the transition from the old airport to the new one into a sideshow -- with a vast overnight move of equipment through Kowloon that officials delighted in comparing to D-Day.
"The government built up public expectations so much before the event that people were expecting perfection," said Ian K. Perkin, the chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
There was also a whiff of hubris. Malaysia opened a new airport two weeks ago in Kuala Lumpur -- with state-of-the-art technology similar to that in Hong Kong -- and suffered major problems. Yet Hong Kong plowed ahead with its plan to open its airport immediately after the first anniversary of the handover.
Mr. Perkin said the airport fiasco will hurt more than Hong Kong's image. The airport's largest cargo handler said Thursday that it was imposing an eight-day embargo on all imports and exports, except food, medical supplies and newspapers. Mr. Perkin estimated that the embargo would cost Hong Kong nearly $800 million in lost exports.
At a time when people here believe Hong Kong must fight to retain its status as a special city within China, they say it can ill afford such a loss. The prospect of companies bypassing Hong Kong because it does not have convenient transportation facilities is particularly galling to business executives here.
"People feel it is shameful for Hong Kong to have spent so much money and so many years on that project," said Peter Lam, the co-host of "Teacup in the Storm," a popular radio call-in program in Hong Kong. Mr. Lam said he was deluged by calls from listeners eager to fix blame for the troubles. "Callers feel that the Airport Authority has been arrogant," he said.
For all the hand-wringing in Hong Kong, outsiders have been more understanding about the airport's woes. Neil Sogo, a 37-year-old Japanese businessman who arrived here on Wednesday on a flight from Tokyo, said he waited more than an hour for his bags, which he found only after reading a handwritten sign. Still, he said, "I'll give it six months, and come back and try it again later."
Besides, Mr. Sogo added, the line at Immigration was short. "Nobody is coming to Hong Kong," he said with an apologetic smile.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Swamped by Asia's Wake;
Nations That Export Commodities Feel Shock Waves

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Brace yourself. It's time for the Asian aftershocks.
When East Asia was hit by its economic earthquake a year ago, the shock waves quickly reverberated around the globe through the world's hair-trigger stock and currency markets. 
 But the more powerful impact is working through a slower-moving and less visible force: the markets for basic commodities like oil, metals and timber. And that helps explain why the ripples from the Asian financial collapse are continuing to hit hard at countries as far-flung as Canada, Chile, New Zealand and Mexico, yet the effect has remained unexpectedly benign in the United States and Europe.
For nations that depend heavily on selling raw materials and basic goods globally to generate growth and to support their government budgets, the pain has been sharp, contributing to job cutbacks, lower currency values, shortfalls in government revenues and ballooning trade deficits.
Over all, commodity prices are down almost 10 percent since February.
"There is no question that the weakness in certain commodities is reverberating in markets around the world," said Desmond Lachman, managing director of emerging markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.
Drops in the prices for copper have hit Zambia and Chile, while New Zealand has felt the impact of lower timber prices. Australia is suffering from a decline in wool prices; Canada bears the pain of lower coal and timber prices.
But the United States and Europe are in significantly different positions than most other countries. Even though exports from Europe and America to Asia have dropped sharply and the United States also sells a lot of its own commodities abroad, their economies are far less dependent on them. In addition, generally affluent consumers in the world's two biggest economic entities have received a big boost -- similar to the effects of a substantial tax cut -- because of the decline in commodity prices. This has largely cushioned the Asian fallout so far here and in much of Europe.
Consider the impact of lower oil prices, which have fallen from a high of $22 a barrel in the last year to a low of $11.56 a barrel last month. While not all of this is a result of the crisis in Asia, a major portion is because the Asian economic engine has stopped racing ahead and has gone into reverse.
That has translated into about $14 billion in lost income this year to major oil producers like Russia, Mexico, Venezuela and the Middle East and a nearly equivalent bonus for energy consumers. For the United States, which produced 6.4 million barrels a day in April but also imported 10.4 million barrels daily, the positive gain for consumers has far outweighed the negative impact on oil drillers.
Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics, is forecasting that lost growth from American exports and the substitution of cheaper Asian imports for products made here could cut as much a one full percentage point off the increase in the gross domestic product this year.
But, at the same time, he estimates that the overall decline in oil prices, by putting more money into the pockets of American consumers, will add back much, though probably not all, of the growth lost through worsening foreign trade.
And this is not the only stimulus from Asia. The flight of foreign investors from Asia's problems and into the haven of Treasury bonds has bolstered the dollar and pushed American long-term interest rates to 30-year lows. The near absence of inflation has been helped by lower commodity prices and cheaper import prices. All that has allowed growth to perk along without the inflationary pressures that would have normally forced the Federal Reserve to put on the brakes.
Both low rates and low inflation have helped keep the stock market rally alive, adding to the "wealth effect" from the market rally that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, among others, believes has kept the economy strong by stimulating spending.
For the United States, Mr. Sinai said, "It is possible that the positive byproducts could be more than enough to offset the negatives."
But for major commodity producing nations, the cushion has been less comforting.
In Canada, where commodities make up about 40 percent of exports, the Canadian dollar has been bouncing off record lows, largely because of the weakness of commodity prices. While the economy is still forecast to grow around 3 percent this year, Ottawa has abandoned its policy of raising interest rates to support the Canadian dollar. That has helped offset some of the Asian impact, according to Ram Bhagavatula, the chief financial economist at Citibank.
Analysts are forecasting that New Zealand's commodity-sensitive economy could tip into a short recession because of the falloff in the sales of lumber, fish, fruits, vegetables and the like. And if Japan -- one of the principal buyers of New Zealand products -- remains mired in recession, prospects could worsen.
In Australia, the Aussie dollar plunged to a 12-year low in June as new forecasts showed that total commodity exports should fall by 1 percent over the next year, after rising more than 7 percent the previous year. Like Canada, Australia may have enough domestic demand to keep it out of a recession. But some economists are scaling back their growth forecasts.
The continued low level of commodity prices means that many countries -- along with their financial markets -- will probably remain vulnerable to further shocks for some time. Even in Canada and Australia, where no recession is in sight, the weakened currencies will mean growing trade deficits and inflationary pressure as import costs rise.
Money in stock markets around the world can move quickly, often in anticipation of fundamental economic changes expected in the future. But a meaningful rebound in commodity prices will probably wait until the economies of Asia actually turn around and begin to consume more oil, copper, coal, fish and vegetables.
In a recent study, two World Bank economists, Guillermo Perry and Daniel Lederman, discussed the fallout from declining commodity prices, which they called real effects, and the fallout from declines in equity and currency markets, which they called financial effects.
Looking at the impact of Asia's downturn on Latin America, they found that the weakness caused by the real effects from lower commodity prices "may produce an increase in the financial vulnerability of countries."
Sure, there are other factors that explain some of the drop in commodity prices: El Nino and a warm winter contributed to the softness in oil demand, for instance.
But the key factor remains Asia. The International Monetary Fund, in its recent World Economic Outlook, concluded that the drop in primary commodity prices as a group was "to a large degree" a result of the Asian downturn.
Asia has had this impact, the report said, because the region had stopped increasing its consumption of oil, copper, rubber, zinc, nickel, wool and timber. For example, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, where the Asian crisis has hit hard, accounted for about a quarter of the growth of demand for copper between 1992 and 1996. With that demand now shrinking, copper prices have dropped almost 35 percent in the last year.
The copper fallout has been felt in Zambia, where the metal accounts for more than 80 percent of export earnings, and in Chile, where copper accounts for 42 percent of export earnings. A major share of Chile's exports go to Asia and the Government estimates that it has lost as much as $500 million in forgone Asian sales.
Last month Chile's Government announced $200 million in new budget cuts that bring the total for the year to $685 million. Interest rates have risen and the peso has fallen to record lows, forcing the central bank to drop policies that limited foreign investment and to use its dollar reserves to defend the peso.
In New Zealand, timber exports, which are about 10 percent of the country's total, collapsed with the weakness in the housing market in Japan, said Mark Benseman, an economist for Merrill Lynch in Auckland. He estimates that about 34 percent of the country's exports -- those going to Australia and Asia -- have been affected by the slump.
In Canada, the Japanese recession has had a stark impact. According to the most recent trade statistics, exports to Japan, measured in Canadian dollars, have fallen 43 percent since April 1997. The decline has been spread over most commodity groups, led by softwood lumber. In the first quarter, exports of coal and related products to Japan fell 84 percent. There also have been significant declines in commodity exports to South Korea and Taiwan.
Over all, the value of agricultural and fishing exports are down 8.5 percent since April 1997 while energy exports are off 17.5 percent and forestry products are down 2.7 percent.
But the biggest impact of all has occurred in the oil markets. Mike Rothman, Merrill Lynch's senior energy analyst, estimates that consumption of oil this year has been cut by as much 300,000 barrels a day in developing Asia and even more by the recession in Japan.
There are 25 countries that count on petroleum revenue for 20 percent or more of their foreign exchange earnings, according to the International Monetary Fund. There are also five oil exporters that count on oil revenues for 40 percent or more of their government budgets.
In Mexico, oil represents only 12 percent of total exports, but it supports 40 percent of Government spending, according to Merrill Lynch. In Venezuela, oil is a double whammy, accounting for 77 percent of exports and 57 percent of Government spending.
The value of the Mexican peso has fallen 10 percent this year. And even though the economy is growing briskly, the Government has just approved a third package of spending cuts, slicing $3.7 billion in all.
In Russia, which is a major exporter of commodities from oil to precious metals, the oil price drop hit in two ways. First, oil accounts for more than 20 percent of export earnings, but Russia has had to cut production by 350,000 barrels a day because the cost to extract and transport the oil is now more than the market price.
In addition, oil prices have foiled, so far, the sale of Rosneft, the last large state-owned oil company, undermining the Government's effort to raise needed cash.
Oil prices have shot up recently on the hope for significant cuts in production. But the two leading commodity indexes, the Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities and the Goldman Sachs index of 22 commodities, are only slightly above their recent lows.
And Japan, the key to the revival of the rest of Asia, has yet to prove it can get its economy or its currency back on track. So a commodity upturn is still more of a hope than a reality for the countries that sell them. "The problem we face," said David Bassanese, senior economist at Bankers Trust in Sydney, Australia, "is that the export recovery still hasn't arrived."

HEADLINE: The House and the I.M.F.

 BODY:
Playing politics with the International Monetary Fund may seem good sport to House Republicans, but their games now imperil international financial stability and the future growth of the American economy. When the House returns to work next week, it must approve America's long-delayed $18 billion contribution to the I.M.F.
The fund is the world economy's front-line defense against the financial problems that threaten to spread from Asia's developing countries to Japan, Latin America and now Russia, where President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to Western leaders for swift international assistance. America's own economy risks serious damage if the I.M.F.'s ability to respond to this spreading turbulence is impaired. 
 The Senate has already approved the I.M.F. spending request in full. But in the House it has been blocked by the philosophical misgivings of some Republicans about financial bailouts and the insistence of others on attaching anti-abortion language to any I.M.F. appropriation. Last month, Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested that he would try to get some I.M.F. money through the House this summer. One idea under discussion involves slicing off a $3.5 billion piece of the Administration's request for quick approval while continuing to hold the rest hostage to Republican political demands. That is not much help, since the remaining $14.5 billion is needed for immediate lending.
Approval of that $14.5 billion from the United States would quickly bring in a further $65 billion from other countries under the I.M.F.'s standard payment arrangements. Passing up the chance to have other nations contribute that much money to future bailouts would be irresponsible. The monetary fund's reserves are now perilously low when measured against current lending commitments and will decline even further without timely House action. Mr. Gingrich and the Republican House leadership must end the maneuvering and round up the votes to pass the Administration's full request.

HEADLINE: Fallen Taboo: Frank Talk On Viagra Is About Cost

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Health plans cite lots of reasons for denying coverage of specific drugs and procedures. The procedure can be labeled cosmetic (breast reconstruction) or medically unnecessary (in-vitro fertilization). The remedy might be called experimental (bone marrow transplants) or dangerous (some diet pills). But there is one reason that health plans never cite: cost.
Indeed, Dr. David Eddy, an expert on medical technology who advises many medical organizations including Kaiser Permanente, has coined the term "cost taboo" to express the prevailing notion that costs should not affect treatment decisions. 
 But earlier this month, Kaiser Permanente, the California-based health plan that covers more than nine million people across the country, shattered the cost taboo when it refused to cover Viagra, the wildly popular new pill from Pfizer Inc. that treats male impotence. In doing so, it cited the cost -- and no other factor.
Kaiser's candor was uncharacteristic for health plans, which often restrict or exclude treatments because of costs without saying so.
Kaiser conceded that impotence was a medical condition. It conceded that Viagra was an appropriate medical treatment. Ordinarily, such concessions settle the matter. Cigna, Oxford and several other plans have decided to cover the taking of at least four of the $10 pills a month.
But Kaiser said no. It estimated that this one drug would drive up its pharmaceutical bills by about 10 percent, or about $100 million a year -- far more than it spends on all antiviral drugs, including the expensive drugs used to treat H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
The problem for Kaiser is that it has no easy way to distinguish the few males whose impotence is caused by physical malady and the large number of males that it expects will demand Viagra to recapture the sexual frequency of their youth or achieve a frequency they deem desirable.
After a review process involving 40 health care experts inside and outside the organization, Kaiser decided that it would not raise premiums for all its members to pay for treatment of a nonlethal, noncrippling condition that almost all of its members could afford to treat on their own. Instead it will offer corporate purchasers of its health policies an option to cover Viagra at a premium that will compensate for the extra costs. That way other enrollees are spared a financial hit.
Kaiser's announcement was blunt and carefully considered. But was it proper?
Some health care experts think not. Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a watchdog group in Southern California, condemned Kaiser's decision by pointing out that Kaiser was cutting treatment for impotence even as it was increasing its advertising and marketing budgets. The big threat, other critics say, is that American health care will move to a two-tier system, one for those who can afford what they want and a lesser system for everyone else. California officials are investigating whether a state law that requires physicians to make decisions without regard to costs applies to this case.
But other policy experts applaud Kaiser's decision. Dr. Arnold S. Relman, former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, and Prof. Alain Enthoven of Stanford University, a leading advocate of managed health care markets, welcome Kaiser's assault on the cost taboo because, they say, in a world of limited resources, the act of showering money on hugely expensive treatments of secondary importance denies money for treatments of primary importance.
Though they cannot say so publicly, medical directors of health plans recognize that treatment decisions already reflect costs, even if the plans invoke code words -- experimental, cosmetic or risky -- to mask their motives. Several plans, including those of Prudential Healthcare and Humana Inc., announced that they would not cover Viagra because of concern for its safety, a reason that Dr. Relman dismisses as "hypocritical" because, he said, "We all know it is an economic decision."
Professor Enthoven hopes that Kaiser's frank approach will "provide cover" for health plans to limit costly high-technology treatments that do some good but also threaten to drive insurance premiums to unaffordable levels.
David Eddy points to examples that cry out for cost-sensitive decisions. His research shows that one drug, which would cost several hundred dollars a year, will decrease the chance that a typical 55-year-old woman will suffer a hip fracture by about one in 7,000. One of two liquids that can be used for internal X-rays, when introduced, cost 15 times the alternative, but cut the risk of a nonfatal reaction by only about one in 2,000 patients. New types of Pap smears would about double lab charges but, if done annually, would increase the life expectancy of a woman by only about seven hours.
Dr. Eddy asked "whether health plans should pay for these higher-cost procedures using shared resources, or should patients who want the costlier tests pay the extra money themselves?" In the case of Viagra, Kaiser answered no, deciding that the benefit of the new drug was not worth the increased costs to its members. The risk is that some people, especially the poor, will go without effective treatments of nonlethal problems. The risk in answering "yes" to Dr. Eddy's question -- covering every innovation that works -- is that insurance premiums will soar. Many employers will drop coverage and, as recent surveys document, workers will forgo coverage in exchange for higher wages.
Whatever the pros and cons of Kaiser's decision, it focuses attention on inescapable trade-offs that do, and will, plague every health plan. Should plans cover growth hormones only for children with well-defined genetic miscues or extend treatment to children who are genetically normal but happen to be extremely short? Should health plans cover potentially expensive drugs that might come along to combat memory loss associated with aging?
Beyond these tough questions lurks another. Who should make these coverage decisions? Now, health plans are told to offer complete coverage at affordable prices and, by the way, ignore costs when tailoring policies. Little wonder that they resort to circumlocutions. Another alternative would have government define the basic benefit package, explicitly confronting the trade-off between generous benefits and steeper costs.
The Viagra decision was made easier by the fact that impotence threatens no one's life and the remedy, at $10 a pill, is within the financial reach of most Kaiser members. Even still, reactions were sometimes furious. The cases to come will no doubt grow ever harder.

HEADLINE: Boeing Raises Base Prices of Commercial Jets

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Seeking to improve its long-term financial performance, the Boeing Company said yesterday that it had increased the base prices of its multimillion-dollar passenger jets by 5 percent, the first such increase since 1975.
But analysts and airlines immediately questioned the impact of the move since nearly all of Boeing's customers pay steep discounts on the company's list prices. 
 "If Boeing was hoping to impress Wall Street, I, for one, am hardly impressed," said Byron Callan, an aerospace analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York.
Boeing said that it had recently begun telling customers that orders negotiated after July 1 would reflect the new prices. Those prices previously ranged from $30.5 million for the 100-seat 717 jetliner to $176.5 million for the largest 747 jumbo jet.
Any new revenue Boeing would receive would not be booked until after 2000 because of the long lead time between ordering and delivering airplanes, the company said.
Boeing, which is the world's largest aerospace company and the country's single largest exporter, has been struggling since last fall to overcome production problems that last year resulted in its first annual loss in 50 years.
Some investors and analysts have criticized the commercial airplane division for cutting its prices too deeply to avoid losing orders to its rival Airbus Industrie, the European consortium. Yesterday's news appears to contradict Boeing's previous contention that the way to improve its profits was to cut costs, not raise prices.
"If you are raising prices, what does that say about your efforts to reduce costs?" Mr. Callan said.
Janice Hayes, a Boeing spokeswoman, said the increases simply brought Boeing's base prices more in line with those of Airbus, which she said were 2 to 6 percent higher than Boeing's.
Boeing also changed the formula it uses to adjust its prices for inflation between the time an airline places its original order and when the aircraft is delivered, a period that can be several years with large orders.
While Ms. Hayes acknowledged that Boeing regularly gave its customers discounts, she said the new base prices would raise the starting point of the negotiations.
But Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for United Airlines, which is about to place an order for short-haul jets, was skeptical. "If they start the negotiation from a higher point, that is their prerogative," he said. "We will see how it competes against Airbus."

HEADLINE: YELTSIN IN APPEAL DIRECTLY TO WEST FOR BILLIONS IN AID

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 10

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin went over the head of the International Monetary Fund today and urged Western leaders to support a multibillion-dollar package of aid to defend Russia's currency.
Russian officials say they are now seeking $20 billion or more, at least $10 billion of which they hope will come from the I.M.F. The total is $5 billion to $10 billion more than the Government previously said it needs, and the request to the fund is about twice what the fund has spoken of providing. 
 The higher request reflects Moscow's anxiety about a rapidly deteriorating economic situation that is threatening not only the stability of the ruble but also the foundations of Russia's political establishment.
In an extraordinary series of appeals, Mr. Yeltsin telephoned President Clinton, President Jacques Chirac of France, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. He also called Michel Camdessus, the director of the I.M.F.
After the call to Mr. Clinton, the Administration expressed support for the beleaguered Yeltsin Government, which has been locked in difficult negotiations with the fund. Washington said Russia needs to take firm measures to deal with its financial crisis, but also indicated that the fund needs to provide substantial loans to calm the financial markets and should keep its demands realistic.
"The United States Government certainly agrees that Russia needs an I.M.F. program that works," the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said, "one that the Russian Government is both capable of implementing and that addresses the country's most pressing financial and structural problems
"It's time for these negotiations to come to closure."
Moscow and the fund are in some agreement about the direction of economic reform but not the pace. The Russians say their markets are so shaky that they face an emergency and cannot afford long negotiations.
But the fund, having provided much bigger bailouts to Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia in the past year, argues that its funds are depleted and that it has to maintain ample resources for the next crisis. The fund has only $10 billion to $15 billion on hand.
The Yeltsin Government painted a bleak picture of the pressures that have forced it to go hat in hand.
"The situation on financial markets has gotten worse," Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said in the upper house of parliament. "Treasury bill yields are rising. Social tension is also growing. We are ready to consider any proposal, but we simply cannot fail to repay treasury bills," which represent money that the Government has borrowed from the buyers of the bills.
President Yeltsin spoke in even starker terms of social tensions, and warned against any "extremist" plans to exploit the financial crisis to dislodge him from power. In recent days, there have been repeated calls for Mr. Yeltsin's resignation, including from coal miners protesting over lack of pay. So far, however, there have not been any dramatic challenges to Mr. Yeltsin.
"We have enough force to cut short any extremist plans to seize power," Mr. Yeltsin said in an address to senior military officers.
Today's focus, however, was not so much on challenges to the President authority as on the economic assistance the Kremlin says is needed to maintain stability.
The loans that Mr. Yeltsin is seeking would be used for two purposes. The main one is to shore up the reserves of the Central Bank to permit it to buy rubles and maintain the currency's value. Another aim is to restructure the short-term loans that Russia has been forced to take at high interest rates.
The Russians are negotiating with several sources, seeking $10 billion to $12 billion from the fund, $1 billion from the World Bank, $800 million from Japan and $10 billion from commercial banks.
But putting together the package has proved to be very difficult. For one thing, the fund has made it clear that it will not disburse new loans unless Russia cuts its budget deficit and wins support for tax reform and revenue-raising measures in the Communist-dominated parliament. The parliament is to debate Mr. Yeltsin's plan next week.
In his talk with President Clinton, Mr. Yeltsin spoke of the difficulties he faced in winning support for his deficit-cutting measures and tax reforms from the Communists. He also underscored the steps he was taking to deal with the problem, including trying to collect taxes from Gazprom, Russia's biggest company.
Mr. Yeltsin did not ask for direct American assistance, but his aides have been looking to the United States Treasury for help.
"The U.S. Treasury Department is pushing the I.M.F. to get a swift but firm agreement in order to avoid devaluing the ruble," said Anders Aslund, an expert on the Russian economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "The Treasury Department understands how dangerous an economic meltdown in Russia would be."
John Odling-Smee, a senior I.M.F. official, arrived here for talks today, stirring expectations that a preliminary deal might be struck this weekend on expanded assistance. But initial discussions with Anatoly B. Chubais, the chief Russian representative, did not go entirely smoothly: Mr. Odling-Smee reportedly argued that the Government's revenue projections were off by $5 billion, Russian officials said.
Not all the difficulties have been with the fund; there have been problems with commercial banks as well. The Russians would like to use the funds they borrow without restriction, but some banks are insisting the funds be used to buy back the Russian treasury bills the banks hold.
Much depends on the Russian parliament, and today Prime Minister Kiriyenko strove to build support in the upper house. "We must pool our efforts," he said. "Failing that, we will be responsible for ruining the country."
The upper house, more pliant than the lower chamber, gave its support.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
The Rumors Grow: Rubin Will Leave

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
On Wall Street, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin is probably the only member of the Clinton Administration described in consistently admiring terms.
So it is no wonder that every time a rumor surges through the markets that Mr. Rubin, who grew up on the Street, is thinking of stepping down, traders tremble at their terminals. And there have been plenty of such rumors over the last four years. 
 These days, though, the rumors are emanating not from the trading floors but from some of the Secretary's Cabinet colleagues. Right or wrong, it is accepted wisdom among them that he is planning to leave Washington by the end of the year.
"The week after the midterm elections," predicted one.
"He wanted to go months ago," insisted another, "but he couldn't resign while Asia was coming unhinged."
A third said it was widely assumed that Mr. Rubin would leave although no one had heard that from him directly.
Inside the Treasury, midlevel officials are already handicapping the chances of prospective successors, particularly those of Mr. Rubin's deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, the onetime Harvard economist who is clearly tempering his quick tongue and toning up his sometimes haphazard attire to appear more, well, Rubinesque.
Mr. Summers does not have a lock on the job. Some give an edge to James A. Johnson, the longtime Washington power broker and departing head of Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home mortgage association. There is also lingering talk of Franklin D. Raines, who recently resigned as director of the White House Office of Management and Budget to succeed Mr. Johnson. Mr. Raines was reportedly eager to leave the Administration but might find Treasury irresistible if President Clinton asked.
Mr. Rubin hates to travel, and some view his recent journey surveying the economic devastation in Asia and a weeklong trip to Africa that begins on Saturday as farewell tours.
The Secretary himself is not exactly clarifying the situation. Talking to him about his future is a bit like trying to extract from him an inkling of when the United States might next intervene in the currency markets. Good luck.
He will tell you what his wife, Judy, thinks: Her dislike of Washington and its pretensions is legendary, and she has voted with her feet for the last five and a half years, remaining in New York. (Mr. Rubin travels frequently between the two cities, by either shuttle or executive jet.)
He might also muse, but briefly, about the merits of staying or going, about his continuing fascination with this moment of bewildering global market instability and about the personal toll of what he terms a difficult life style.
"There are a lot of important and interesting issues I'd like to be involved in going forward," he said. "On the other hand, there are countervailing considerations."
Then, borrowing terminology from the deliberate obfuscation he employed last week in talking about when to prop up the Japanese yen, he added, "I'll do what seems to be appropriate and not do what doesn't seem appropriate."
His closest confidants say Mr. Rubin will decide in the next few months, perhaps while fly-fishing this summer. Some in the Administration believe that he can be persuaded to remain with some combination of Presidential arm-twisting and fears that his departure could further unnerve edgy markets. In fact, his aides try to dissuade reporters from writing about the rumors of his departure at all, for fear that the articles alone could uncork the Dow.
"Mr. Rubin has become the market," one top Japanese diplomat complained the other day during a visit to Washington, arguing that the Secretary's thumbs up or thumbs down on Japan's latest economic contortions was the only signal investors were looking for.
All this argues in favor of Mr. Summers's candidacy. He has long played the role of Mr. Rubin's alter ego and debating partner, and has become an increasingly fervent believer in the Rubin world view that the power of markets must be respected by governments.
But Mr. Summers's relationship over the years with Vice President Al Gore has reportedly been rocky, and Mr. Gore will presumably have a major voice in who sets economic policy during his run for the Presidency. Further, Mr. Summers angered many in Congress during the bailout of Mexico with his lectures about America's responsibilities as the guardian of the global economy.
Since then, however, the Deputy Secretary has become a much more careful political animal. He also got a major boost recently when Mr. Rubin talked to The New Yorker about what a fine Treasury Secretary he would make someday, comments that added fuel to the latest round of Rubin rumors.
There is another reason Mr. Rubin might go: Much of the time, the Treasury Secretary's job is not much fun these days.
Twice in the last two months, Federal judges have rejected the Treasury's effort to create a "protective function privilege" for the Secret Service that would have kept Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, from questioning agents who guard Mr. Clinton about what they might have seen occur between the President and Monica S. Lewinsky.
Then there was the embarrassment of the hearings on the Internal Revenue Service that resulted in legislation forcing the Treasury to share authority over the I.R.S. with an outside board. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers made clear their distaste for the bill last fall, then did a complete turnabout when the inevitability of its adoption became clear.
But Mr. Rubin's biggest frustration has been the unwillingness of Congress to increase the American contribution to the International Monetary Fund, the international agency battling the global economic contagion sweeping from Asia to Russia to Latin America.
"His patience with the Hill is a lot thinner than it was," one aide noted recently.
Still, as another Administration official who works with Mr. Rubin often points out, reading his mind is like forecasting the markets, and just as risky.
"He loves his job," this official said. "He remains fascinated by what he does and shows no sign of any intellectual apathy. You can't say that about many people in Washington."

HEADLINE: Minor Loans Giving Major Help;
Microcredit Catches On With Entrepreneurs in Need

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
When Eddy and Ivette Alvarez went into business together almost five years ago, they had skills: Mr. Alvarez knew how to make plaster statues, and Mrs. Alvarez knew how to paint them.
They also had a product: a small copy of the Infant of Prague, the statue of the baby Jesus that some believe works miracles. 
 But they did not have money, at least not enough to buy plaster. Even if they had had the know-how to borrow from a bank, they had nothing to put up as collateral.
Today, Mr. and Mrs. Alvarez, who met a decade ago while working at a figurine factory, have a workshop of their own in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they and five employees turn out thousands of plaster statues of everything from coiled cobras to Indian chiefs, along with dozens of different religious figures. They can do so, Mrs. Alvarez said, thanks to several small loans they have received from an organization called Accion New York, based in Williamsburg.
Accion makes tiny loans -- as little as $1,000 -- to impoverished entrepreneurs including seamstresses, hairdressers, grocers and bakers, many of them in the Spanish-speaking enclave in Williamsburg. By helping people to become self-employed, Accion hopes to help not just individuals, but also a whole community.
This kind of loan program is known as microcredit, and it has helped combat poverty in developing countries like India and Ecuador, according to the World Bank. While variations of the concept have occasionally been tried, with limited success, in developed countries, microcredit is now winning a growing number of converts in the United States, especially in New York. Philanthropists who have made their fortunes from Wall Street are particularly attracted to the idea of giving "a hand up, not a handout" to budding entrepreneurs.
Among the efforts they are supporting is the first significant foray into the United States by Grameen Bank, which started the microcredit movement two decades ago in Bangladesh. Grameen, which has opened a mutual fund to raise money from Americans, has just signed contracts to manage its first two programs in the United States, in Harlem and Tulsa, Okla.
But as Accion and other groups like it have found, it is not so simple to adapt a program designed for Bangladeshi villages to the very different cultural and economic situation in the United States. Although there are a lot of microcredit programs in America -- as many as 300, by one count -- only a few have made more than a handful of loans.
Even programs like Accion, the largest in New York City, are struggling to get big enough to make a real difference. Lenders have sometimes had trouble reaching potential clients, and it is also much harder to keep tabs on a borrower in New York City than in a rural village.
"We haven't been able to grow as fast as we want," said Robin A. E. Ratcliffe, a vice president of Accion International, which runs several programs in the United States based on its much larger program in Latin America. "Some people thought that you could take that model, go clunk and make it work here," she said, "but that is not our experience."
In principle, microcredit programs are simple. Borrowers take out very small, very short-term loans; if they repay the loans on time, they become eligible for bigger ones. The loans, which might be as small as $5 in Africa but in the United States tend to start at $500 or $1,000, might help a villager buy chickens to start an egg business, or a city dweller to buy vegetables to sell on a street corner.
Many programs use what is known as peer lending, in which first-time borrowers form a group that takes responsibility for the repayment of all its members' loans.
In fact, few people default. At Accion International, for example, the default rate is just above 2 percent. Because almost all the money gets repaid, it can be reused, making microcredit programs very cost-effective, proponents say. Some programs even make enough money from their lending to cover their costs.
The concept is being promoted by the Clinton Administration, and more than a thousand people working in the field met late last month in Manhattan at the second annual "summit meeting" on the movement.
It has also been embraced on Wall Street, which is becoming a source of both expertise and financial backing. Terri Ludwig, the president of Accion New York, is a former executive at Credit Suisse First Boston, the big investment bank; her boss, Michael Chu, who runs Accion International, is a former limited partner in the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.
The Bankers Trust Corporation, which caters to companies and wealthy individuals, has set up a fund that last month made its first loans to microcredit lenders, including Accion New York. The $500,000 in the fund came from the bank and some of its well-to-do customers.
"I don't believe in the old social system," said Scott Reardon, a venture capitalist and chairman of the Bankers Trust fund. "The reason I want to do this is that it allows me and my family to contribute in a way I am highly confident will work."
Some of the success stories are striking. When Carlos Aldana came to the United States from Ibague, Colombia, 11 years ago, he worked at three jobs, including delivering packages, he said recently through a translator. His first $1,000 loan from Accion helped him buy a van to make deliveries; later, larger loans helped him buy a tiny cafe in Corona, Queens, and to expand the production of corn cakes known as arepas.
Today, Mr. Aldana employs 11 workers in his arepa factory, where with the help of some small machines they turn out 7,000 corn cakes a day, he said. His latest $15,000 loan helped him buy equipment that should let him double production of the arepas, which he sells to supermarkets and bodegas for $1.50 for package of five.
The factory runs 24 hours a day, and Mr. Aldana is there at least 15 of those hours, he said. His wife and two youngest children, age 8 and 6, are often there, too; his eldest son, who is 18, is a student at the University of Colombia in Bogota.
"It's very important, what Accion does," Mr. Aldana said. "For banks, it's very hard to see small-business men -- they are too strong with their rules and regulations."
Banks are generally not in the business of writing tiny loans, because they are as expensive to process -- and far less profitable -- than larger loans. And bankers can be reluctant to base their lending on a borrower's character, rather than collateral. Major banks generally do not make business loans for less than $25,000.
Some Asian and Caribbean immigrants raise money for their businesses through so-called lending circles. Members of these circles agree to contribute a set amount each month into a pot, and each month a different member gets to use all the money in the pot. Immigrants from Korea, Vietnam, Trinidad, Jamaica, Barbados and Ethiopia all have similar programs, said Ivan Light, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has studied informal credit networks.
But many would-be entrepreneurs turn to loan sharks. Adalberto Espinal, who runs a bodega in Williamsburg, said loan sharks charge $200 a month on a $1,000 loan -- an interest rate of 140 percent a year. He turned instead to Accion to borrow so that he could keep the store shelves well stocked; he used up his $14,000 savings to make a down payment on the store, which the previous owner lost because of his heavy debts to loan sharks.
Accion charges 16 percent a year, which is more than an established business might pay, but less than many Americans pay on their credit cards. In 1997, the New York program had 344 active borrowers who took out $1.4 million in loans.
Ms. Ludwig, the program's chief executive, says she thinks that it should be far larger. "In New York City, 26 percent of the population is living in poverty," she said. A program like hers has the potential, she said, "to make an impact in an economically viable way, to get at the root of the problem."
But there are challenges to running a program in New York, challenges that are not faced by lenders in rural villages. Getting the word out about the program is difficult; many potential borrowers, especially women, do not think of the baby-sitting or cleaning they do to make a little extra cash as a formal business, Ms. Ludwig said. So she is trying to work with organizations like churches and job-training programs that might send borrowers her way.
Meanwhile, the borrowers she has are not all within walking distance, as they might be in a developing country; she has assigned one person to do most of the on-site inspections of potential borrowers' businesses, so that her two loan officers do not spend all their time on the subway.
And because people are more mobile here, they seem to find it a little easier to walk away from their loans. Accion New York, for example, has had the most trouble with its loans to taxi and livery drivers because they move around so much, said Evelyn Lassalle, one of the loan officers.
Accion is also trying to use American methods to its advantage. Ms Ludwig's former colleagues on Wall Street have donated computers, which should make loans easier to analyze. Last year, the program became the first microcredit organization to sell a package of loans to an investor, a transaction that is common on Wall Street but almost unknown elsewhere.
"We need to reinvent the whole approach so as to develop a new U.S. model," said Mr. Chu, the president of Accion International.
But the founders of the microcredit movement worry that Americans have already tampered too much with the original model. That is one of the reasons Grameen has decided to manage some programs here, said Alex Counts, director of the Grameen Foundation in Washington.
For one thing, some American programs -- though not Accion -- tend to emphasize formal training over lending, Mr. Counts said. "It's very typical, and close to universal, to require 10 weeks of business training before you can talk about getting a loan," he said. "People who are running a business or are serious about starting one don't have time for that."
Mrs. Alvarez certainly does not. She and her husband used to work until 3 in the morning making statues, she said; now that they have hired employees, they have to work only from 8 in the morning until 10 at night.
But she is not complaining. She and her husband are now starting to save to buy a house, she said. "And we started with zip."

HEADLINE: Political Briefing;
Illinois Democrats Spur Their Candidate

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Some leading Democrats in Illinois are worried that Representative Glenn Poshard's campaign for governor is flagging, and they have begun urging him to pick up the pace and sharpen his attack.
A few weeks ago, State Representative Carol Ronen of Chicago, a member of the Democratic State Central Committee, sent Mr. Poshard a letter in which she warned that many liberal voters in the Chicago area, often the key to Democratic success in statewide races in Illinois, "might fail to support your candidacy without some assurance that you are interested in their votes and open to their concerns." 
 She urged Mr. Poshard, a social moderate from rural southeastern Illinois, to "reassure voters that you are in the mainstream, not on the fringe," by forcefully speaking out for family planning, early childhood education and health care, "reasonable" gun controls and strong anti-discrimination laws.
At about the same time, a number of the state's top Democratic campaign consultants and union representatives, along with some aides from various state legislative offices, sent Mr. Poshard a similar message. They warned that if he did not move more aggressively, there was no chance he could overtake the Republican nominee, Secretary of State George Ryan, and end 22 years of Republican occupation of the Illinois executive mansion.
Mr. Ryan, a mainstream Republican, is much better financed than Mr. Poshard, who refuses -- to the despair of some supporters -- to take money from political action committees. Further, Mr. Ryan faced no serious primary opposition, while Mr. Poshard struggled through a divisive primary against tough black and staunchly liberal opponents.
Responding to his critics a few days ago, Mr. Poshard said he was trying to "build back bridges" after the primary and had begun to buy advertising time on television and radio. He also said he would reconsider his opposition to building a third major airport south of Chicago -- opposition that has disappointed many unemployed blacks in that area, along with their Congressman, Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr.

HEADLINE: Japan's Political System Freezes Out Reformers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Recent articles about Japan's economic crisis have called attention to the fact that Japanese political leaders lack the power to change Government policy radically. As a July 9 front-page article on Japan observes, Japanese bureaucrats hold much of the power that in other countries is wielded by elected officials. This is partly because the prime minister can appoint only Cabinet leaders and cannot remove the bureaucrats below them. Prefectural governors can make less than a handful of appointments. 
 The United States has rightly been criticized for relying too much on the spoils system; political appointments abound at every level of government. Although this can lead to the appointment of unqualified people, it also means that a change in political leadership can result in changes in the bureaucratic leadership that will allow for the implementation of new policy. This does not happen when Japan elects new leaders.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
Religious ideas, leaders, organizations and appeals have been an integral part of American reform politics. Turn-of-the-century progressives and even many socialists were imbued by liberal Christianity and influenced by the Social Gospel movement. The labor movement and the welfare state drew heavily on Jewish and Roman Catholic communal traditions. Black churches were the birthplaces and command centers of the civil rights movement.
Now an eminent philosopher, whose maternal grandfather, Walter Rauschenbusch, was the theological genius of the Social Gospel, has issued a vigorous plea for the reconstitution of a broad, pragmatic and reformist left in the United States. And one of the most interesting things about this plea is the place it makes -- or does not make -- for religion. 
 "Achieving Our Country" (Harvard University Press, 1998) is the plea, and its author is Richard Rorty, a scholar often called the leading gadfly of contemporary philosophy. This may be an understatement, like calling the lethal iceberg the leading gadfly of the Titanic.
The heart of "Achieving Our Country" is Professor Rorty's critique of the "cultural left." Barricaded in the university, this left has isolated itself, he asserts, from the bread-and-butter issues of economic equality and security and the practical political struggles that once occupied the American reform tradition.
Professor Rorty, who is leaving the University of Virginia to become professor of comparative literature at Stanford, sees leftist intellectuals as launching increasingly abstruse and theoretical assaults on the original sins of Western society, from capitalism to heterosexism.
Clearly, controversies are seeded like land mines in every paragraph of this short book. Conservatives have already fumed over Professor Rorty's nearly total silence about conservative ideas, as though it were beyond the thinkable that grappling with them might have anything to do with reconstituting a vital left.
An even more intriguing absence in Professor Rorty's vision of a renewed left is religion. One might say that while "Achieving Our Country" never rules out a place for religious forces in a reformist coalition, it simply does not allude to them. But the truth is still more complicated.
In the book's first chapter, the author expounds a concept of legitimate national pride that he hopes could reanimate a reformist left. This national pride springs from a vision of America that Professor Rorty ascribes to Walt Whitman and John Dewey, a utopian vision in which a nation, free of caste and class, would "replace God as the unconditional object of desire." For the poet and the philosopher, America and democracy meant "a new conception of what it is to be human -- a conception which has no room for obedience to a nonhuman authority."
It requires no complex reasoning to recognize why such an animating vision would create problems for religious believers. Indeed, for Jews, Christians and Muslims, some of this language seems to meet the technical definition of idolatry.
Professor Rorty is not at all unaware of the power of religion as a moral force in the United States. In a recent telephone conversation, he acknowledged that "in the foreseeable future the churches are as likely to be on the right side as the wrong side" in political struggles. But that cannot alter his conviction, he said, that "in the final stages of democracy we won't need religion anymore." He added that such a conviction may be "off-putting, but I deeply believe it -- I find the idea inspiring."
This conviction is, of course, consistent with Professor Rorty's longstanding position that all efforts to seek rational grounding for moral claims, whether in some objective facts "out there,"some common human nature or some universal principles, are futile hangovers from immature longings for religious certitude.
So it is not surprising that religion does appear in "Achieving Our Country" after all -- as a term of condemnation. Whenever Professor Rorty wants to chastise the "cultural left," he accuses it of abandoning secularism, getting religion or turning metaphysical.
What is most interesting about all this is the tone. Despite protestations of pragmatism, there is no sense that Professor Rorty has assessed the realistic prospects of making "Whitmanesque hypersecularism" the centerpiece for building a broad reformist coalition in the United States.
Nor is there any sense that the author has decided to rally academic leftists at the cost of alienating religious ones, who might understandably resist enlisting in a battalion that has already emblazoned religion's epitaph on its banners. Instead, the anti-religious sentiments of "Achieving Our Country" are matter-of-fact, presented in the untroubled tone that people often use in criticizing a group they cannot imagine is even in the room.
Is this the reality? Does religion -- except in a negative sense -- simply fall outside the horizons of discussions about the intellectual left and its future? Perhaps not too much should be concluded from a one-of-a-kind thinker like Richard Rorty. It is interesting, however, that when asked whether anyone else had raised questions about his book's treatment of religion, Professor Rorty said no.

HEADLINE: Young, Vulnerable And Violated In the New South Africa

BYLINE: By Suzanne Daley; Donna Ferrato, a New York-based photographer, is the founder of the nonprofit foundation Domestic Abuse Awareness. Suzanne Daley is the Johannesburg bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
The girl in the plain dress stares at the floor. She pulls on the ends of her short-cropped hair. She twists her feet.
Inside the police office at Baragwanath Hospital on the edge of Soweto, the sprawling black township, it is time for Masindi, 9 years old and small for her age, to tell her story. The police officer presses. What happened after you got him the cigarettes? 
 "He grabbed me and started to do these funny things to me," she says.
And then? "He forced me to lie down on the bed."
And then? "He took out his penis."
These days there is a steady stream of children -- boys and girls -- coming through the doors of this drab barracks-like building, where doctors and social workers examine abused children and police officers begin the long and often unsuccessful process of trying to get a conviction.
The children usually arrive dressed in their Sunday best, the hair ribbons and the starched shirts contrasting sharply with the sordid details and the pain they describe. Some are too young to talk; it is torn flesh and venereal disease that tell the story.
A growing incidence of rape -- child rape in particular -- is one of the ugliest aspects of the new South Africa. Reported cases of sexual assault against children under the age of 18 have more than doubled in four years, to 20,333 in 1996 from 9,786 cases in 1993. And experts believe the actual numbers are far higher. South Africa may have the highest incidence of reported rape in the world -- 120.6 rapes for every 100,000 women in 1997, compared with 71 in the United States in 1996.
There are any number of reasons for the explosion of sexual assault. The success of the liberation movement left thousands of young men without a cause, uneducated, unemployed and accustomed to violence. At the same time, the breakdown of the apartheid laws triggered widespread migration, with millions of blacks flocking from the homelands to squatter camps in the cities. Privacy is nonexistent among the shacks, alcoholism is rampant and law enforcement erratic. And it is difficult for even the most attentive mother to watch over her children.
Moreover, women traditionally are held in low regard, and children, in general, are taught to be extremely submissive to adults, even strangers. In recent years, the fear of AIDS has also made young girls attractive to predatory men; for a time, there was even a rumor that sex with a virgin would cure the disease.
The workers at Baragwanath complain that they have never seen so many young victims of rape, and that it wears on them. "Sometimes it is just too much for us," says Rexina Maruping, the chief nurse. "These are very hard times."
The police are so understaffed that an accused rapist may not be arrested until months after the crime is reported -- and the victim may live near him and see him every day. One 1996 study found that nearly two-thirds of suspected offenders were never prosecuted. Of those, only 7 percent went to prison.
Soweto police officers arrest child rapists in weekly roundups. In a convoy of unmarked cars, they speed through the dusty streets in the dead of night, rousting whole families to drag out the accused. Arriving late at night improves the chances of catching the suspect at home.
On a recent night's sweep, each officer had more than 80 assigned cases, and the team picked up 10 men in five hours. One was accused of raping his 2-year-old daughter, and one was a teen-ager accused, with six classmates, of beating and raping his 12-year-old cousin and leaving her for dead, half-buried in a fresh grave. But most were neighbors of the victims.
In many ways, Masindi's case is typical. Her mother, who is separated from her father and is struggling to raise three children, works as a maid four days a week, traveling more than an hour to her job. She earns about $4 a day, $1 of which pays for transportation. While she is gone, Masindi is more or less on her own.
The man Masindi says raped her and left her with syphilitic ulcers so severe that she could hardly walk was an unemployed neighbor known as Banny, who befriended her over a long period of time and gave her food. Masindi's mother, barely literate and a recent arrival from a village in the hills of Kwazulu Natal, says she never suspected trouble. She was glad that someone was taking an interest in her child. "I am thinking he likes Masindi," she says. "This is good."
Six months after his arrest, Banny remains in jail, awaiting trial in September. Masindi, meanwhile, is having trouble at school. She is forgetful and sometimes has nightmares. She refuses to go out at night.

HEADLINE: Betsy McCaughey Ross Is Not Kidding

BYLINE: By Adam Nagourney; Adam Nagourney is a political reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Betsy McCaughey Ross is settled in the back seat of her Chevrolet Suburban, her stockinged feet curled in a swirl of papers, pumps and candy wrappers, a Hershey bar in one hand, a car phone in the other. She has a question. She has just spoken at a Planned Parenthood meeting in Albany and is now focusing on her next campaign appearance, a speech to the Nassau County Democratic Committee at Hofstra University on Long Island. "What do I say?" she asks an aide back at campaign headquarters, then lets out a sharp burst of awkward laughter.
In truth, the Lieutenant Governor of the State of New York -- and candidate to unseat the Governor (and her boss), George E. Pataki -- sounds more quizzical than worried as her vehicle hurtles down the Thruway. McCaughey Ross presents herself less as a politician than a writer and an academic -- "I believe in the power of ideas," she often says -- but ideas are not on the agenda at the Democratic meeting tonight, and she knows it. Clicking off the phone, she turns to an adviser next to her in the back seat. "I don't think I should give a stump speech with policy in it, do you?" she asks. "Should I give my regular pre-K, H.M.O., pro-choice, economy speech?" As she fidgets in her seat, a bundle of nervous smiles and energy, it soon becomes clear that she does know what to say, and she begins to preview her speech right there. "I believe that every family should have affordable day care for their children so that women have a right and opportunity to succeed in the workplace," McCaughey Ross declares. "Does the Republican Party believe that? No." Her eyes are closed tight and her face is shining as she imagines the audience response. 
 At Hofstra, the auditorium is half-empty. These are Democratic regulars, and their evident lack of enthusiasm at McCaughey Ross's arrival suggests that they know her history: how she ran as a Republican with Pataki in the 1994 campaign and helped topple Mario M. Cuomo. How she battled with Pataki from the outset, quit the Republican Party last September and within months announced that she would run for Governor, eclipsing a cast of Democrats -- including Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker; Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, and James L. Larocca, a former state transportation and energy commissioner -- whose allegiance to the party was not in doubt.
But here is McCaughey Ross, 49, a woman who has never voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate in her life, unapologetically taking the stage. "I'm proud to be a Democrat and I'm proud to be running as the next Governor of the State of New York," she declares. And then she is off, building into her rhythmic cant. "I believe in fighting discrimination of any kind -- against racism, against religious bigotry, against gays and lesbians. Does the Republican Party believe that? No!" Her thin voice sounds almost lusty as it bounces off the walls. Before long, the crowd is joining her shouts -- "No! No! No!" -- and McCaughey Ross displays her white flash of a smile and thrusts an arm in the air, her diamond-encrusted watch glittering in the spotlight. More than half the audience rises in applause. She strides off the stage, oblivious to the local politicians waiting to speak, and with a jerk of her head, announces to her aides: "Let's go."
There has, in the peculiar history of New York State politics, never been anyone quite like her. A consensus has emerged about this woman, at least in New York's political community, which is that McCaughey Ross is -- to put it directly -- a little loopy. It is a perception that has been explicitly promoted by Pataki's office, which has needed to account for the fact that, were it not for the efforts of Pataki and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, McCaughey Ross would almost certainly be unknown to most New Yorkers today. (In her more chivalrous moments, Zenia Mucha, Pataki's communications director, describes the Lieutenant Governor as "an irrational person.") And it is a perception that McCaughey Ross has encouraged with her bouts of unorthodoxy: the staff bloodlettings; the fact that she remained standing, rather conspicuously, throughout Pataki's 1996 State of the State speech; her frequent defiance of her sponsors, D'Amato and Pataki; her awkward public bearing.
Still, there is little evidence that this portrait of a loopy lieutenant governor is widely known, much less shared, by voters. It is also not completely accurate. McCaughey Ross may be erratic, and she may be given to bursts of naivete and non sequitur. But she is also singularly intelligent, driven and charming -- and accustomed to getting what she wants.
She has been in politics for only three years, and it was nothing she ever considered, much less aspired to. But she is learning the business. Having seen her opportunity -- a weak field of male Democratic candidates, the stronger ones having been scared off by a formidable Republican incumbent -- she seized it. She now finds herself the only woman in the race, closely identified with the potent issues of health care and auto insurance, her campaign largely financed by her wealthy husband, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., an investment banker. (As of her last financial disclosure, she had raised $2.4 million, $2.25 million of which came from Ross.) Whether it is a result of cold calculation or beginner's luck, there are many political experts who, as of today, believe that she will win the Sept. 15 primary -- even if her prospects of unseating Pataki, like those of all the Democrats, are decidedly bleak.
Governing, though, is another matter. McCaughey Ross may well have the discipline to keep her eccentricities in public check through the comparatively brief span of a campaign. But for a number of reasons -- a management style that can only be described as disruptive, an ignorance of the history and habits of Albany and a lack of grounding in any of the political parties -- McCaughey Ross would seem to be particularly ill suited for the job she is seeking. Even her friends, who have high praise for her intellect and heart, take pause at the thought of Betsy McCaughey Ross running the government of the third-largest state in the union.
"Have I told you about the withhold?
McCaughey Ross, a glass of red wine standing untouched at her elbow, has been talking for nearly half an hour about the regulation of health maintenance organizations. The withhold, it seems safe to say, is an unfamliar term to most voters. (It is the practice by which H.M.O.'s withhold part of a doctor's payment as a means of keeping down costs.) Here at dinner on the Upper East Side, as the details pile on, it becomes easy to appreciate what happened the first time McCaughey Ross had brunch with Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. As McCaughey Ross tells the story, she started chatting about health insurance legislation even before a drink had been ordered, and Bruno raised both of his hands. "Just don't talk policy!" he pleaded.
No one who has worked with McCaughey Ross challenges her intellectual rigor or depth. In fact, a complaint made by her ever-changing stable of political advisers is that she spends too much time on policy. "I can't win by just being in places, shaking hands, being a regular pol," McCaughey Ross says. "I'm going to win because of ideas. So it's really important for me to stay home and read the reports and write the policy things and do the ideas."
She has always been this way: studious, competitive, an overachiever. It is sometimes easy to forget -- with her two marriages to investment-banker husbands, with her Park Avenue apartment and tailored suits -- that McCaughey Ross was not born to wealth or success. She grew up in a working-class family in Westport, Conn., to a father who was a janitor and a mother overcome by alcoholism. McCaughey Ross won a boarding-school scholarship, then went on to Vassar College and received her doctorate in constitutional history at Columbia University. In 1972, she married Thomas K. McCaughey, and spent the 1980's raising three daughters, now all in their teens, as well as writing for academic journals and teaching constitutional history at Columbia.
Though McCaughey Ross puts more emphasis on the professional side of her resume, she was arguably more of a socialite than an academic back then. In any event, she says that the prospect of being a "very well cared for, very affluent wife of a Wall Street financier" made her restless. "I just wasn't cut out to be a, I don't know, a plantation madam," she says. McCaughey Ross lets out a gust of self-conscious laughter. "Don't use that word! 'A country-estate lady.' It's not my thing. I like to work hard, I like to be engaged."
By 1992, McCaughey Ross had divorced her husband and joined the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank where she began writing articles that contributed to the demise of President Clinton's proposal for universal health care. This accomplishment earned her the attention of Senator D'Amato, who was looking for a woman to run with Pataki in 1994. It is testimony to the haste with which McCaughey Ross was recruited that Pataki was taken aback when his new lieutenant governor started flooding him with single-spaced policy papers (footnotes included), and sharing her often-dissident views with reporters. "I'm the quarterback of this team," Pataki told her brusquely, in one of their only face-to-face meetings. McCaughey Ross's political advisers reminded her that lieutenant governors are meant to be neither seen nor heard. McCaughey Ross ignored their advice, and Pataki ignored his lieutenant governor.
"Don't you think it's odd not to get any answers?" she asks now. "I didn't realize that these memos would antagonize them. I thought they were very helpful." She is not being disingenuous. The result is that the second-ranking official in New York is today almost incidental to its governance. She and Pataki have not had a substantial conversation in more than a year. "I would have liked to have known him better," she says. D'Amato and Pataki are now said by associates to view the recruitment of McCaughey Ross as the single biggest mistake they have ever made in politics. The two men, normally eager to talk to reporters, did not return calls for this article.
McCaughey Ross's defiance earned her a punishing wave of stories and gossip, much of it generated from Republicans, designed to portray her as a buffoon. In that regard, her insistence on directing almost every discussion toward policy seems intended to establish herself intellectually, to rebut the portrayal put forth by those who brought her into politics in the first place. "Have you read my reports?" McCaughey Ross asks in one interview, her voice brittle, repeating a question she has posed before. "I wrote them myself."
The door of the suburban opens at the corner of 11th Avenue and 57th Street, and McCaughey Ross emerges for a sidewalk news conference on her plan to lower auto insurance rates. Suddenly she stops, picking out a dark-eyed young man with a tape recorder who is trying to blend in with the reporters. "I've never met you before! Who are you?" she says, pumping away at his hand, not letting go -- as is her style -- until the encounter turns awkward. He says that his name is Adam, and that he's a college student, and McCaughey Ross responds: "Oh, you're working for one of the other campaigns!" And Adam, looking a little embarrassed at being discovered, acknowledges that he is indeed working for Peter Vallone.
McCaughey Ross has encouraged the perception of herself as a political novice. And in many ways she is. This, after all, is the woman who did not recognize Al D'Amato when she first met him in 1993. The subject of politics often bores her. One day in May, when Stephen J. Sabbeth, the Nassau County Democratic leader, started talking about the coming state Democratic convention, McCaughey Ross distractedly flipped through her black-and-white composition book (which has "Betsy" scribbled on the front). When Sabbeth stopped speaking, she piped up, "It's a beautiful day for a luncheon!"
It is this kind of disconnected behavior that leads many political people to dismiss her. That would be a mistake. In Sabbeth's office, she took close note of a sign on his wall -- First get elected, then do good -- and was soon quoting it approvingly. Indeed, there is ample evidence that she long ago absorbed the wisdom of Sabbeth's sign. She has taken few positions that might be considered electorally problematic. No one is likely to argue against her proposition that auto insurance rates should be lowered, or that people suffering from cancer should not be denied insurance coverage for experimental forms of chemotherapy. Her emphasis on health care, its merits notwithstanding, is clearly a pre-emptive defense against Democratic attacks over her role in undercutting President Clinton's health-care plan -- and an attempt to distance herself from a position that came under attack as intellectually slipshod.
Even in an era of ideologically indistinct politicians, McCaughey Ross stands out: in six years, she has already managed to associate herself with the Conservative, Republican, Democratic and Liberal Parties. Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan, an Upper West Side Democrat who has endorsed her, calls her "a progressive in formation," while Ann Northrop, a friend since Vassar and a leading AIDS activist, says McCaughey Ross is politically consistent and "the most radical person in the race." McCaughey Ross presents herself as "the most socially progressive" candidate, even though she stood by as Pataki pursued a historically conservative agenda, advocating cuts in welfare, Medicaid and education spending, and the revival of a death penalty. "I think of myself as fiscally responsible and socially liberal," she says. "But more than anything, as an honest, call-them-as-I-see them person. A problem solver. For example, I support gay rights. A lot of people don't. I'm unequivocally pro-choice." There is an unusual amount of antipathy toward McCaughey Ross among her three Democratic rivals, who believe that she is little more than an opportunist. "What is her rationale for running for this job, other than that she doesn't like George Pataki?" asks Charles Hynes. McCaughey Ross dismisses such talk, asserting that the only reason she is running is to serve the people of New York. But this is a woman who became a celebrity literally in the space of the 20 minutes it took her to accept the invitation to run for Lieutenant Governor. By all accounts, including those of the many consultants who say she instructed them specifically to get her name into the newspapers, this is someone who clearly enjoys the attention that comes with high office.
Betsy Mccaughey Ross is sitting alone in her huge, high-ceilinged office in the state Capitol. There is a plate of chicken bones on her otherwise orderly desk. It is lunch; breakfast was a Mounds bar, part of a regular daily diet that she accurately describes as "chicken and chocolate." It is less than a week since McCaughey Ross fired her campaign manager, Robert Becker, producing a round of headlines suggesting again that McCaughey Ross is unstable. Still, she seems startled when the subject is raised. "I wouldn't say anything negative about Robert," she said. "I just think it's inappropriate to criticize employees, no matter what they say. I made the decision that was in the best interest of the campaign." She sits back, looking anxiously at her questioner, as if she were a student awaiting a grade from an instructor. Does she consider herself difficult to work for? "I think -- well, yes," she says. "If I find a letter that has been sitting around for four months, I am not happy!"
Her former staff members, and there are many, say she is a relentless micromanager given to temper explosions, second-guessing, undercutting and disregarding the views of experts. "She was somewhere between difficult and impossible to work for," says Jay Severin, a Republican consultant. "No matter what I did, it wasn't enough."
The issue of her temperament clearly concerns her, and she raises it on her own one afternoon. "I set very high standards," she says. "That's not always true in government. And as you know, I never say anything negative about anyone who has ever worked with me. But I expect the people who have worked with me to share my high moral standards, my commitment to working hard and to producing the best possible product. And if they don't, I wish them well in some other job."
Ultimately, it is this imperious side of McCaughey Ross that most unnerves the politicians who contemplate her as a governor. And it disappoints the political consultants who have spun through her life, able at once to appreciate her political strengths -- her intelligence, her poise -- and the weaknesses that may ultimately be her undoing. "She is 90 percent perfection," says one consultant who worked briefly for her. Still, it is important to remember that the public sees a different McCaughey Ross, the one who brought a skeptical audience in Nassau County to its feet. From that perspective, the campaign by the Republican Party to discredit her might have the opposite effect. She cannot help but exceed the expectations they have set for her.

HEADLINE: And Luxury for All

BYLINE: By Holly Brubach; Holly Brubach is the style editor of the magazine.

 BODY:
Not all that long ago, the market for luxury goods consisted of people who lived in majestic houses with a full complement of servants, in some time-honored enclave of the privileged: they ordered their trunks from Louis Vuitton, their trousseaus from Christian Dior, their Dom Perignon by the case. Their taste was like their politics -- conservative -- determined largely by considerations of safeguarding their wealth and perpetuating the social conventions that ratified their sense of superiority. Their houses and their wardrobes were in the "classic" style, which abstained from fashion.
Lately, however, a new market has emerged -- one made up of people who, though they can't afford a house in Paris's 16th arrondissement or an apartment on New York's Park Avenue, have enough disposable income to buy a Vuitton handbag (if not a trunk) or a bottle of Dior perfume. They have a sense of entitlement that transcends social class, a conviction that the finer things are their birthright -- never mind that they were born into a family whose ancestral home is a tract house in the suburbs. These new customers are for the most part younger than clients used to be, and there are far more of them. The competition for their attention is intense. Though they may never have heard of Bernard Arnault, he understands them. 
 The 49-year-old chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Arnault presides with quiet authority over the most extentensive luxury-goods empire in the world at a time when shopping qualifies as a form of self-expression and brand names constitute a universal language -- a consumerist Esperanto spoken by increasing numbers of people in practically every country on every continent. Arnault is revising our notion of luxury and what it looks like through the combined forces of his various trademarks. Among them, amassed in the short space of a decade, are the fashion houses of Christian Dior, Givenchy and Christian Lacroix; the vintners Veuve Clicquot, Hennessy and Chateau d'Yquem; the leather-goods manufacturers Louis Vuitton and Loewe; the perfumer Guerlain; the airport-based retail network Duty Free Shops, and a new cosmetics emporium, Sephora.
If his renown is pretty much confined to business circles, it may be because, despite his youthful demeanor and striking blue eyes, Arnault is conspicuously lacking in charisma. Shy, cerebral, silver-haired, he is not, as the French say, mediatique, or suited to the media. Arnault's charm -- which, as it turns out, is considerable -- is perhaps too subtle for the 10-second sound bite; his story, too complex.
And, indeed, his treatment at the hands of the media in Europe has not been especially kind. He has been sharply criticized for introducing American hardball to the genteel realm of business in France. Early on, the French press nicknamed him Tintin, after the Belgian cartoon character whom he vaguely resembles with his circumflex-shaped eyebrows; the effect, in the end, was more pejorative than affectionate. Attempts to humanize him -- he plays the piano! loves Chopin! -- have for the most part failed in the bitter aftermath of hostile takeovers and forced retirements. Some critics dubbed him the Terminator for his ruthlessness as a corporate raider.
Ill at ease as the center of attention, Arnault readily deflects the spotlight, training it on John Galliano, the flamboyant English designer whom he appointed to head the house of Dior, and Alexander McQueen, another Englishman, angry and outrageous, whom Arnault installed at Givenchy -- Galliano and McQueen being particularly adept at making headlines. Though not mediatique himself, Arnault is frequently blamed for ushering in a new mediatique era in fashion -- one in which designers like Galliano and McQueen have risen to prominence, in which extravagant spectacles have eclipsed ordinary catwalk presentations, preposterous clothing is justified as a loss leader for perfume sales, success is measured in terms of press coverage and designers' reputations are often more in proportion to their oversize personalities than to their talent. Arnault was by no means the first to bring Hollywood-style promotion to the selling of clothes and dry goods, but there is no question that in many people's minds he has come to personify the change from the discreet, elitist approach that prevailed for most of this century.
Nevertheless, things are looking up for Arnault. He has earned the respect of his adversaries, who acknowledge, however reluctantly, that he is in many respects a brilliant, creative businessman. The pitched battle he waged with Robert Miller over the control of Duty Free Shops is over, and Miller, still on the company's board, says that their working relationship has proved to be harmonious. Arnault and his wife, Helene Mercier, a Canadian-born concert pianist, are much in demand, high on the guest list for private dinners, government functions and prestigious cultural events. At shows for Givenchy and Dior, where their presence in the front row is conspicuous, fashion veterans who once regarded them with suspicion now treat them with something approaching awe; members of the press come and pay them court.
Arnault's triumph has to a large extent been based on a simple premise he has acknowledged and acted upon -- that for those looking to set themselves apart from what used to be called the common folk, money is no longer enough. Too many people have it. "When you cannot differentiate yourself from others with money," he says, "then you must differentiate yourself with something that indicates that you know how to recognize the best." In the evolution of the luxury-goods business, the Era of Wealth has given way to the Age of Connoisseurship. The new elitism is predicated on taste, and it holds out an essentially middle-class notion: the promise of a meritocracy in which the hereditary ruling class is supplanted by an aristocracy of style.
Though he rarely grants interviews, Arnault consented to discuss the luxury-goods industry and his role in it in a series of conversations that took place over two weeks in Paris. The salon in which we met, a room expressly designed for receiving visitors -- the outer zone of the inner sanctum that is Arnault's suite of offices at Dior's headquarters -- had been decorated in the high corporate style, tasteful and impersonal: two large white couches facing each other across a large, low table; the walls painted Dior's signature gray; a portrait of Dior.
"When I was for the first time in New York, I bought a Christian Dior bathrobe at Bloomingdale's," Arnault recalls. He was on vacation, taking a break from his responsibilities running the family construction business in Roubaix in northern France, where he was reared. "When you ask a taxi driver in New York, 'What do you know about France -- do you know who is the President?"' Arnault says, "the answer is, 'No.' But he knows Christian Dior. Dior was in his day on the cover of Time magazine. He was already part of French culture, like the Eiffel Tower. To build a name that transcends the individual and becomes a symbol of France -- it's a phenomenon that happens very rarely. That's what got me into the luxury business, when I understood the potential of that name."
Like many French businessmen, Arnault spent the early years of the 80's sitting out the initial phases of Francois Mitterrand's socialism. He had returned to New York, this time to live, and was overseeing a real-estate concern in New Rochelle when, in 1984, he made a bid to take over Boussac Saint Freres, a troubled corporation in government receivership. Among Boussac Saint Freres's diverse holdings was the house of Dior (38 years before, Marcel Boussac, the company's founder, had bankrolled Christian Dior's decision to open a couture house); it was Dior that Arnault wanted. Concetta Lanciaux, now director of human resources at LVMH, remembers her job interview in his office on the Avenue Montaigne. Still negotiating for Boussac, Arnault gestured out the window in the direction of the Dior building. "That is the company that will interest us in the future," he told her.
Madeleine Vionnet, Jean Patou, Elsa Schiaparelli -- other fashion designers had been famous in their time, and when they died, the businesses that bore their names closed their doors. Dior was the first of the great French fashion houses to outlive its founder, who died in 1957 at the age of 52; even then, it was clear that the name was worth too much to be abandoned. Dior's 21-year-old protege, Yves Saint Laurent, was elected to succeed him. The king is dead, long live the king. When, three years later, Saint Laurent was inducted into the French Army, Marc Bohan, the designer who ran Dior's operations in London, took his place. Bohan stayed the course for more than 20 years, producing clothes that were becoming and discreet, if not particularly innovative; he cultivated a loyal clientele. Arnault replaced Bohan with Gianfranco Ferre, the Italian couturier, and later, after Ferre's departure two years ago, he installed Galliano.
Should a designer's name be kept alive when the designer is long gone? That depends on how much of fashion is art and how much of it is commerce -- a distinction that seems increasingly quaint. "If it's a big business, why not?" Karl Lagerfeld says. "The name can be a guarantee of quality." In 1983, Lagerfeld was hired to put the house of Chanel back on the map, which makes him the first in this latest wave of mercenaries. This season alone brought the debuts of no less than seven young high-profile recruits for established houses, of which three -- Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors at Celine and Narciso Rodriguez at Loewe -- were Arnault's appointments (at Lanciaux's recommendation).
Like Arnault, Lanciaux has grafted a business education (in her case, an M.B.A.) onto an artistic sensibility (a background in art and film). And like him, she believes that the time has come for big fashion companies to undergo a transition from the family-run personality cults that they have been since their inception to brand-name public corporations. "This has been one of Bernard Arnault's clear visions," she says, "this passage to a new era when the company's name is no longer identified with the designer and becomes a brand." But for that to happen, Lanciaux says, a company must have a marketing strategy -- an unpopular concept in France, where a designer's creativity is no less miraculous and mysterious than a painter's talent. "I do instinctive marketing," Karl Lagerfeld declares.
Arnault's strategy for Dior and the other fashion houses he has subsequently acquired is not original (Gucci, for one, has followed the same plan): to hire designers capable of attracting attention and forging a brand identity, then to establish a consistent image by gaining control of licensed products and their distribution. These days, Arnault says, "it's very important for a brand to offer the same products in the same setting all around the world, so the customer can recognize your products. Also, people are more educated vis-a-vis the brand. Even in the 80's, even in the U.S., it was very easy to sell products on the strength of the name alone. Today, it's different. Today, people are more interested in a product's quality and its design." Now when Arnault talks about the house of Dior, it is with the pride of a man who has single-handedly rescued a national treasure and restored it to working order.
The thanks he gets are few. Many of Arnault's detractors contend that he is a reckless powermonger, swallowing up fashion houses with little or no regard for their well-being. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph in January, Hubert de Givenchy discussed his reluctant exit from the house he founded and his heartbreak over what had transpired there since. "I used to be very happy to get orders because I knew that the more orders we had, the more work there would be in the atelier and that the heart of the couture house would continue to beat. Now they don't care.. . .They just want their collections to be talked about as mad and extravagant so they can sell perfume and licenses." (In response to a request for an interview for this article, Givenchy declined through his secretary, who explained that he didn't want to concern himself with these matters any longer.)
What is at stake is nothing less than the fragile culture of the haute couture, a centuries-old tradition that sprang up around the mastery of a craft. Ferre talks fondly of the workers at Dior, of their extraordinary skills. The real task for him, he says, was to design something that would "carry them over, to push them forward. These are people who needed someone to encourage and support them. They have been raised in a tradition -- all they know is how to sew. These are not people who participate in the fashion system or live the life of the clients." It is perhaps sad, but hardly surprising, that Arnault does not share Dior's -- and Ferre's -- legendary reverence for the petites mains, the famous "little hands" that could take his ideas and render them to perfection with invisible stitches and intricate beading. "It's a loss, Dior," Ferre says with tears in his eyes.
With so many brands at his disposal, Arnault has turned out to be a kingmaker. His appointments have been sensational and controversial, a subject of great debate even before the designers produced their first collections. Like a Hollywood casting director, Arnault sums up the talents of each of the stars he has hired in a single sentence or less. Galliano, whom he initially placed at Givenchy -- an arrangement that lasted a year before Arnault transferred him to Dior -- is, he contends, "perfect" for Dior because, like Dior himself, Galliano is "a romantic." Whereas Givenchy, he explains, was a designer who built a house based on "structure" -- which makes McQueen, with his background in Savile Row tailoring, ideally qualified to take it over. Jacobs has a talent for "chic sportswear," Arnault says, which is just what Louis Vuitton needs.
On the subject of Michael Kors and Narciso Rodriguez, Arnault sounds a bit vague; in their cases, he says, he was less involved in the selection process. He defines what Kors brings to Celine, a bastion of European bourgeois traditionalism, as "classicism with a touch of modernity." As for Narciso Rodriguez at Loewe, the leather-goods house based in Madrid, "Obviously, it's a Spanish company, and he has Spanish links." (Rodriguez, born and reared in New Jersey, traces his origins to the Canary Islands.) "Anyway," Arnault adds, "I was very impressed yesterday. He was on the front page of Le Monde -- his face was on the cover."
Though previously successful, each in his own right, all five of these designers occupied the fringes of fashion until Arnault placed them smack in the middle of the establishment, throwing the weight of a big corporation behind them: the manufacturing facilities, the distribution network, the marketing expertise, the advertising budget. Skeptics have wondered aloud whether Galliano and McQueen -- at 37 and 29 -- are perhaps too young and inexperienced to take over the leadership of the haute couture. (Both were ready-to-wear designers.) They have been handed their glory without having to earn it, defying the industry's tradition of picking up pins by the side of some acknowledged master and rising through the ranks. Thanks to Arnault, each has gone straight to the head of a large organization, one that took somebody else a lifetime to build.
"When you run a fashion house, you are looking for a future, not a past," Arnault argues. "You have to attract a new clientele and take the risk of bringing in some new ideas. So you take the creativity where you find it, and designers, like painters, are more creative when they're in their 30's."
But to Arnault's mind, talent alone is no longer enough (if ever it was), in fashion or in any other field. "Today's world is a media world," he says without apology. "In order to be successful, you have to be well perceived by the media and have a personality that speaks to the public." Long before being hired by Arnault, Galliano had established himself as one of fashion's more outrageous characters; a fashion chameleon currently in a Roaring Twenties tango-dancer phase, his antics have consistently made good copy. McQueen had already embarked on a career as a provocateur, making fashion history with his "bumster" pants, cut so low as to expose the cleavage of the buttocks. And Jacobs, while never outrageous, had been the fashion editors' darling, his career furthered to a great extent by the attentions of American Vogue.
The fact that neither of the designers on whom Arnault has bestowed a couture house is French has not gone unremarked at a time when French fashion has come under fire for being stuck in a rut, unable to adapt to the changing social climate. "I would have preferred to hire French designers for French names," he admits, "and the only reason I did not is that I thought there was no one who could fit in easily. In a way, it's a pity, because for too much time the design schools of other countries have been more creative than ours."
Lanciaux agrees: "At some point, the capacity of the French brands outstripped the capacity of the French schools to generate designers. There are lots of schools in France that do one thing -- it's an approach that is still artisanal. There is not enough synergy. Each of them is so singular, so limited: they produce designers who are good in one area but disconnected from the conception of the product itself and from the business."
It's not that French fashion isn't powerful, Arnault insists. "Today, French names are very strong -- and I think a talented designer can express the French point of view, even if he's British or German."
According to Pierre Berge, Yves Saint Laurent's business partner, the designers' nationality isn't the issue. "Nobody gives a damn where they come from. The problem is that they're not cut out for haute couture. On the one side, there are two couture houses, called Christian Dior and Givenchy, and on the other there are two designers, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen. Who have a lot of talent, who make fashion, who could legitimately exist for an entire career. But neither has anything to do with what those houses, respectively, stand for. They are completely miscast. If Mr. Arnault loves fashion, which I very much doubt, if he likes young designers, which I very much doubt, why doesn't he set them up in their own houses and open boutiques for them in neighborhoods that correspond to what they do -- in the Marais, for example, or on the Left Bank?"
In fact, Arnault did just that in 1987 with Christian Lacroix. "We are the only brand that he started from scratch," Lacroix says. Now, Lacroix remarks wryly, at 47 he finds himself the oldest designer in the LVMH stable and the only one who is French.
Lacroix came to fame at the height of the 80's as the inventor of the pouf skirt, a style that perfectly captured that decade's excess and exuberance -- a silhouette in the shape of a bubble. And then the economy burst, the Champagne went flat and Lacroix found himself out of step with the times. The arrival and departure of a series of managing directors in quick succession (one, Lacroix recalls, came from carpet manufacturing) illustrated the dangers inherent in running a fashion house according to the principles routinely applied in other kinds of companies. "Impatience," Lacroix says, "has been the group's biggest flaw for years, trying to turn a profit very quickly. On account of which we sometimes made deals that were less than wonderful -- in Japan, for instance. But I'm an optimist. Those days are over and done." Lacroix acknowledges that he and Arnault have had their differences, including one long rift that ended only when a friend interceded. More recently, their relations have been warm and pervaded by mutual respect. Even so, Arnault seems less enthralled with the house Lacroix has built with his backing than with the houses he has acquired. Though he regularly attends the Dior and Givenchy shows, he turns out for Lacroix only on occasion now that the clamor has subsided.
Fashion people -- French fashion people, in particular -- like their businessmen erudite and protective, like Berge, or genteel and deferential, like Jacques Rouet, who founded the house of Dior in conjunction with the designer himself. Right up until his retirement in 1984, Rouet was famous for knowing the name of every employee in Dior's atelier and for giving elegant parties in the spacious apartment where he and his wife lived near the Etoile -- parties attended by many of Dior's couture clients. "Dior was always the boss," Rouet says; he put his own expertise in the service of Dior's talent. And Dior, for his part, put his talent in the service of his workers' skills with a humility that manifested itself whenever he encountered an employee, however lowly, in one of the house's narrow corridors. Invariably, Dior would step aside to let the employee pass.
Arnault reportedly keeps walking, head down. He has not taken the time to get to know the people at Dior -- people like the directrice of the showroom or the vendeuses, with whom he has no direct dealings, or for that matter anyone in the atelier except, of course, the designer. The word that recurs in conversations about his management style is "aloof." One former employee depicts Arnault closeted in his office, logged onto the Internet: "I think he is much more fascinated by the financial aspect of Dior, by its performance on the stock ex-change, than by what goes on inside the house."
Arnault's peers in the French luxury-goods business -- merchant princes like Alain Wertheimer, the magnate whose family owns Chanel, and Jean-Louis Dumas-Hermes, the fifth-generation president and artistic director of Hermes -- are routinely perceived as far more sympathetic. Wertheimer is exceedingly private, with a low-key management style that looks to the long term. "The Wertheimers have a business they inherited," Lagerfeld says pointedly, "so they are used to being rich." Dumas-Hermes, affectionately dubbed Jean-Louis XIV by his employees on account of his grandiose schemes, combines an expert's rigor with a child's enthusiasm. A hands-on executive, involved in every aspect of the business, he got his own start in the company in the 60's. Though his recent hiring of Martin Margiela, the innovative Belgian designer, prompted the inevitable comparisons with Arnault's appointments, Dumas-Hermes is quick to draw distinctions. Margiela is "an accomplice," he says, "not a paid star in my music hall."
Throughout the 80's, while Wall Street was dominated by cutthroat maneuvers that changed the rules once and for all, the French could still pride themselves on the gentlemanly tenor of their business dealings. Then along came Arnault and off came the gloves: he bought companies (Celine, Givenchy) and then sent their founders into exile; he divided families or drove a wedge between business partners in order to acquire their holdings (Chateau d'Yquem, Duty Free Shops). Hubert de Givenchy told a friend that Arnault, having named McQueen to succeed him at the house he had built over the long course of his career, didn't even have the decency to introduce them. Arnault's tactics in these and other instances have earned him the adjective "American." He shrugs. "When you live in a country and do business in it for some time, you try to be influenced by it," he says matter-of-factly, "especially when you do business in the paradise of business, which is America."
Arnault's steep rise has revived the old antagonism between art and commerce, as if his methods had contaminated fashion -- as if fashion had ever been pure. He invokes Dior as an example of a designer who, even 50 years ago, regarded business not as anathema but as an extension of the creative process. "We must make a little Bergdorf Goodman in the Avenue Montaigne," Jacques Rouet recalls Dior saying about the site of his Paris boutique. Soon after, Dior signed the first of the many licensing agreements that would become the foundation of his international empire and embarked on a plan of progressive expansion, opening boutiques in cities all around the world, offering his clients the Dior imprimatur on a wide range of products. (A great gourmand, he briefly considered putting his name on hams.) Rouet believes that with the recent renovation of the Dior store, which now houses departments for linens, china and crystal, cosmetics, jewelry, shoes, handbags and men's wear in addition to women's ready-to-wear, Arnault has fulfilled Dior's dream.
On a Tuesday morning in March at the news conference during which LVMH announces its annual results, Arnault steps up to the podium. It's a tough audience, full of analysts and reporters whose business it is to be skeptical. Prognostications have been dire: LVMH, it is presumed, has been hard hit by the collapse of the economy in Asia, and some 400 people have turned out to hear Arnault reveal the extent of the damage. But in the end, the news is not all bad. "I remain persuaded that our presence in that market is invaluable," Arnault says in conclusion, reading from a prepared statement, "and that the desire to consume our products is absolutely intact."
He is followed by Yves Carcelle, the president of Louis Vuitton, who outlines the company's strategy for reclaiming its lost prestige by cleaning up an image that had fallen victim to a kind of "visual pollution." Patrick Choel, president of the LVMH fragrance and cosmetics division, singles out two Dior products for special praise -- Diorific, a long-lasting lipstick, and Mascara Flash, a hair mascara that he calls "a little revolution." Givenchy, he declares, has had "an excellent year" thanks to its new perfumes, Organza and Amarige. Myron E. Ullman 3d, the chairman of DFS Group, which runs Duty Free Shops, offers a plan for the development of a "galleria" concept -- a collection of stores in a downtown setting bringing "the best brands in the market all together in one location . . . with a profitability well beyond" that of airport stores. Every DFS Galleria, he says, will be "an entertainment destination, stimulating multiple visits."
Bringing up the rear of this solemn parade, a succession of executives in suits, is Daniel Richard, the C.E.O. of Sephora Europe. Tieless, with long hair pulled back in a ponytail, he recounts the company's brief and spectacular history. Nearly five years ago, the first of Sephora's shops opened, stocked with a comprehensive selection of fragrances and cosmetics. The flagship store on the Champs-Elysees -- conceived as "a temple," Richard says -- features books about perfume, quotes from Rilke on the walls and computer terminals from which customers can send E-mail free of charge. This summer, Sephora opens the first of three stores in New York (in SoHo), with plans for 15 more American outposts not far behind.
Arnault fields questions from the floor. For a business that traffics in merchandise whose appeal is ineffable and fleeting, LVMH comes across as remarkably solid. Its performance testifies to Arnault's achievement in extending and diluting luxury's reach to include Midwestern debutantes, noveau-riche Muscovites, Japanese yuppies, Argentine jet-setters and tourists everywhere. The audience punctuates his closing remarks with applause. He has won them over against their better judgment. By the end of the week, the share price has risen 10 percent.
People who have worked with Arnault speculate that his experience as a musician has given him an insight into the creative process that is rare in a businessman. Christian de Portzamparc, the celebrated French architect who designed Louis Vuitton's new headquarters in New York, a 23-story tower going up on East 57th Street, speaks admiringly of Arnault as a collaborator -- of his good eye, of his manner, which was both exacting and supportive. "He took the time to make me improve the design," Portzamparc says with sincere appreciation.
Arnault once aspired to a career as a concert pianist, an ambition he gave up when he was in his teens. "I play not bad, but not well enough," he explains. These days, he practices regularly whenever his schedule permits. He has always leaned toward the romantic repertory -- Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, flashy virtuoso pieces. When in 1991 the French and American Chambers of Commerce elected Arnault Businessman of the Year, he decided to forgo the acceptance speech at the awards banquet and instead played a Gershwin song as a duet with his wife.
Helene Mercier, whom Arnault married in 1991, was born in Montreal and trained as a pianist at the conservatories in Vienna and Paris and at the Juilliard School in New York. Today, she says, she plays some 20 engagements a year and practices five hours a day. If music is a language, it is one that she and Arnault share. They met eight years ago at a dinner in Paris. "I thought he was just a businessman interested in music," she recalls. He invited her for lunch at his office.
The first time he played the piano for her, Mercier says, he was so nervous that he was shaking. "I was very impressed when I heard him play because then I understood that he really loves music and that he had taken it very seriously. When you're young and you spend a lot of time alone with the piano, you get to be a certain kind of person with a certain interiority -- someone for whom communication doesn't go through words necessarily. And that's what seduced me. Because he was so sensitive in his playing, and I thought, Well, there must be something very deep in him." Eight months later they were married (in his case, for the second time). Asked whether that didn't make for a rather speedy courtship, Mercier replies, "He really knows what he wants."
A slim blonde with wide-set eyes and a stunning profile, she is dressed in a cashmere twin set, black leather jodhpurs and crocodile loafers. The room in which she receives a visitor in the house where she and Arnault live with their two young children is outfitted with Louis XV furniture upholstered in crimson damask, Aubusson carpets, crystal chandeliers and paintings by Ensor, Dufy, Monet, Leger, Dubuffet and Braque -- everything in conscientious good taste. The decor reflects a certain cautiousness in Mercier's manner, a painstaking effort to be correct.
When it comes to esthetic decisions concerning lvmh products, Arnault often consults his wife, his daughter, Delphine, now a student at the London School of Economics, and their friends -- a small circle of women who have become his own private focus group. He brings home a perfume or a handbag and asks them what they think. Galliano, McQueen and Jacobs all credit Mercier with enormous influence, and it's easy to imagine that her own casual style has helped to pave the way for Arnault's hiring American designers who specialize in sportswear. Mercier is, she claims, a North American at heart, more straightforward and independent than most of the Frenchwomen she meets. She is also, one imagines, an advocate for the way women actually live. "I'm not going to put on a suit to practice the piano," she says.
It's still too soon to tell whether the changes Arnault has introduced at the luxury-goods houses he acquired will turn out to be financially profitable. To take matters even harder to gauge, the only figures Dior and Givenchy release are their year-end totals, which are skewed by perfume sales. But the speculation has been that neither collection has met with much demand on the part of the customers -- particularly the haute couture, with the exodus of many well-known clients to the houses of Yves Saint Laurent and Balmain. Arnault claims that Givenchy sold twice as many couture dresses this spring as last fall. "Women's Wear Daily announced that they sold four outfits last season," Berge says dryly. "So that makes eight."
But if success is measured in terms of the ruckus they have caused, then Arnault's designers have succeeded brilliantly. The attention of the press may at times seem too important to Arnault, possibly for lack of any firsthand fashion background; he forms his opinions on the basis of other people's. Even so, it would be hard to overestimate the media's role in reinventing the image of a fashion house these days. "The media is what makes things contemporary," Marc Jacobs says. "Seeing a picture of something in a magazine is what makes people want it." Arnault's preoccupation with press coverage, coupled with his apparent unconcern with the clothing's actual sales, seems to corroborate what many people in fashion have long suspected -- that in his big corporate picture clothes are a mere front for the perfume and cosmetics, where the biggest profit margin lies.
At Dior and Givenchy, Arnault has decreed that now, as in the past, the brand's identity begins with the haute couture, in an arrangement that seems curiously anachronistic given the changes that have taken place since Dior's heyday in the 50's. The so-called "laboratory of fashion," the couture then served as fashion's R&D division, responsible for new silhouettes, colors and trends, which were taken up first by a clientele of socialites and movie stars, then copied by women everywhere who aspired to look like them. The news trickled down. But fashion hasn't worked that way in years. With most designers finding their inspiration in the street and everyone, rich and not-so-rich alike, walking around in Nikes, the haute couture has been increasingly relegated to the sidelines as a made-to-measure service for wealthy clients. Arnault's investment in the couture, which as recently as five years ago looked doomed to extinction, has been mistakenly hailed as a revival.
The conditions that have made for the current flurry of excitement can be traced to the rise of cable TV in the 80's. With the sudden hunger for footage of supermodels in tight dresses to help fill all those channels came a new kind of fashion, more highly theatrical and outlandish than anything that had been seen on a runway before, as designers began to play directly to the cameras. "Do they actually expect people to wear that?" was most people's reaction, and, indeed, the answer was no. Unlike the ready-to-wear, which is still obliged to sell clothes, the haute couture is no longer accountable to women's lives. "We are here to sell dreams," Arnault explains. "When you see a couture show on TV around the world, you dream. When you enter a Dior boutique and buy your lipstick, you buy something affordable, but it has the dream in it."
A marketing strategy that favors publicity stunts over what the industry calls "real clothes" and views fashion shows as entertainment, staged for the benefit of other products, threatens to sever the already tenuous connection between fashion and reality. Commendable though they may be as exercises in virtuoso dressmaking, Galliano's odalisques on laudanum and McQueen's Dallas Cowgirl dominatrixes are clearly removed from the realm of most women's experience, existing in a mediatique world of their own devising.
Arnault has borne the brunt of the outrage over these changes, but it would be hard to argue that he is responsible for them personally. Fashion, like every business, mutates in order to go where the money is, and in retrospect much of what has happened so far seems inevitable, with or without Arnault. In Dior's day, the clothes came first; in ours, they appear to be the most precarious aspect of the fashion enterprise, while perfumes and other products conceived as spin-offs have gained the upper hand.
In a photograph from one of Louis Vuitton's recent ad campaigns, a beautiful young woman wearing sunglasses, a scarf and a mink coat is perched on a motorbike, her Vuitton train case and hatbox strapped to the back. The picture is framed and hanging on the wall in Concetta Lanciaux's office, a reminder of the mythological customer that the people at Louis Vuitton have in mind: somebody young and rich with a wanderlust. In March, Marc Jacobs proposed a wardrobe for her, in Vuitton's first ready-to-wear collection since its founding 144 years ago by the royal clothes packer for the Empress Eugenie.
At the show, members of the American press, seated opposite Arnault, kept stealing glances at him, trying to gauge his reaction. The French journalists seemed perplexed. There was a certain reverse snobbery in the extreme at work in items like plain white cotton poplin raincoats (this is luxury?) with no visible indication of their provenance: the logo, as it turned out, was on the button's underside; the signature tape was sewn into the lining. As if to insist that the clothes -- cashmere sweaters, double-face skirts, narrow pants -- be seen on their own terms and not as a backdrop for the house's accessories, there were none: no Vuitton bags or anything else that might enable an onlooker to make the connection.
Intentionally or (more likely) inadvertently, this was a collection that called our motives for buying luxury goods into question by posing a challenge: are you willing to embrace a product that makes recognizing the brand difficult, if not impossible? This absence of all the usual indications -- with the logos hidden, with no design element so distinctive and consistent that it could serve as a signature for the brand (as quilted leather has for Chanel) -- elevated connoisseurship to a secret code. Only someone who was really in the know could trace these clothes to Louis Vuitton. It's a small club.
Over the course of the past few decades, trademarks like Ralph Lauren's polo player, Chanel's back-to-back C's, Gucci's G's and Louis Vuitton's initials have become status symbols that come at a price. But now that even the most inexpensive products are strewn with corporate graffiti and a plain version of practically anything is impossible to find, it's not so hard to imagine a time when we might prize the product that is logo-free as the rarest and most precious of all. And, in an ironic reversal, we might even be obliged to pay more for it. When every product is conceived as an advertisement for its manufacturer, with some blatant trademark as a part of the "design," consumers who refuse to serve as human billboards will have to compensate the company for the attendant loss of publicity.
"Luxury has been wrongly associated with the unattainable," Andree Putman, the French interior designer, has said. Wrongly, but understandably. Among the various utopian notions perpetrated in this century, several have been intent on bringing good design to the masses. This was one of the early modernists' most cherished goals -- this vision of an egalitarian society in which beautiful things could be enjoyed by everyone, not only the rich, and we would all be better people for it. The idealism that informed their landmark efforts has waned, however, and the impulse to spread the material joy around has lately given way to the cynical conviction that the finer things aren't simply one of life's many rewards -- they're the only reward, as each of us makes a grab for the best toys.
To Jean-Louis Dumas-Hermes's way of thinking, the purpose of Hermes is to help people "to become a little more themselves." I shop, therefore I am, and here is who I am: the Manolo Blahnik shoes, the Hermes bag, the Fendi coat, the Michael Kors sweater, the Dolce & Gabbana pants form a constellation of brands that we use to define ourselves -- to ourselves and to other people.
We are witnessing the democratization of luxury: the trophies that once beckoned to us from the highest shelf have been brought dowm to eye level. But, of course, they're worth less for being that much more accessible. Asked what role luxury goods now play in people's lives, Berge replies: "Real luxury doesn't exist anymore. Real luxury was for the 'happy few,' and there is no more 'happy few.' Or, there is 'the few,' but they're not 'happy."' In a world in which so many different brands compete for our attention, the prestige of one seems to cancel out another, and "the best" is the latest, the hottest, the most talked about.
When the young fashion-conscious tourist with a three-hour layover at Heathrow comes upon a Louis Vuitton bag designed by Marc Jacobs, she remembers that she saw it featured in last month's Vogue. The monogram pattern is familiar -- a latticework of L's and V's -- but instead of the standard, stenciled beige on brown, it is embossed, white on white, on patent leather. Between the traditional version and this new monochromatic rendition lies a world of difference, to this young woman's way of thinking: it is the difference between her parents' friends and her own friends, between the commonplace and the rare, between mere wealth and taste. She buys the bag, secure in the knowledge that it positions her a cut above the old Louis Vuitton customers.
The pleasure she takes in it will derive as much from the aura that attaches to it as from the design and the workmanship -- until in time our restless imaginations leave the bag behind and it loses the power it once had, divested of what Arnault calls "the dream." Robert Browning said that a man's reach should exceed his grasp, which for years described most people's relationship to life's biggest prizes. But that was before Arnault brought luxury to the masses. Now, with his help, we grasp at the trappings of happiness and discover that it's a moving target, changing before our eyes.

HEADLINE: Socko Finish

BYLINE: By Thomas Lynch; Thomas Lynch is an undertaker in Milford, Mich. A book of his poems, Still Life In Milford, will be published in September.

 BODY:
My son and I were moving caskets -- an oak with Celtic crosses on the corners, a cherry with a finish like that of our dining-room table, a cardboard box with a reinforced bottom, caskets that could be buried, burned, blown into space or set adrift. (The boomers who are buying funerals now do better with a broad selection.) I was talking to him about " protection," about condoms and careful choices and coming of age. He'd been out too late the night before.
But my son has heard this speech already; he and his siblings, all in their 20's, occupy a place where pleasure and risk intersect, so they are experts in cautionary tales. In a display room full of caskets and cremation urns, he would rather talk about his future. 
 He says he wants to be a funeral director. He wonders if I'd ever sell to S.C.I. -- Service Corporation International, the Barnes & Noble of the funeral biz. They're buying up firms like ours across the globe: Frank E. Campbell's in Manhattan; Kenyon's in London, which used to bury the royals. Closer to home, in Michigan, they bought out our nearest competition last year. The talk in the trade is that they raise prices, cut services, put in a fleet of telemarketers to push "preneed" sales and pay their shareholders handsomely. They are aggressively positioning themselves for the baby-boom years, the next 20 or 30, when the number of annual deaths in the United States will grow by a million compared with today. The boomers' presence is already being felt, of course -- some are dying, many more are buying funerals for their parents.
 "The only problem is they buy your name," I tell my son. "It's all you really have." The name on the sign -- ours says Lynch & Sons -- is the one they call in the middle of the night when there's trouble. It's the one that makes you accountable to the community you live in, the one asset we can't replace and dare not sell.
My father taught me about protection. It was the late 1960's, early 70's. We'd go into the casket-selection room at the funeral home. He'd play the undertaker -- no stretch for him. I'd be the bereaved client with a dead mother -- pure theater for me. My mother was going strong back then, full of life. I was floundering between college and career, not quite certain about my "future," interested mostly in Irish poetry and Italian women. I worked at the funeral home to finance my travels and indecision. I caught the phones at night, slept in the apartment on the second floor, kept my passport handy, my bag packed.
"The first one you show them is very important," my father said. "It establishes the mid-range, the average. You know, not the most expensive and not the least." He stopped beside a steel model called Praying Hands, named for the applique in the cap panel. He lifted the velvet overlay to expose the rubber gasket. "The most important difference between one casket and another has to do with its protective qualities," he said earnestly. "Most of the metal caskets in this room are what we call sealed caskets, because of this gum-rubber gasket that runs around the perimeter of the shell."
"Who cares?" I'd say, playing the doubting Thomas. "Isn't she dead?" He showed me the crank used to seal the lid shut, and then he handed me this "key."
"To some families protection is very important." He paused. "To others it means nothing at all." The message was obvious: which kind of family are you from?
Then he displayed the various materials: mahogany, oak, cherry, steel and the top-of-the-line, one that shone like a bright new penny. "This is solid copper, a permanent metal. Unlike steel, which might rust or corrode, copper oxidizes with age. It gets stronger and stronger. These
precious metals are the best value in protective caskets." The room hummed with anticipation as I thought it through.
Stronger, protective . . . Mom?
Protection and permanence were organizing ideas of my parents' generation. Children of economic collapse and a planet constantly at war, they were schooled against waste and letting down their guard. There was general, low-grade anxiety over "exposure" and liabilities. Well-engineered tampons, movie ratings, underarm deodorants -- each offered defense against some contagion, embarrassment or invader.
In the years that have passed since my father taught me caskets, I have sold my share of them. We don't push protection anymore. "Choice" is the buzzword. Everything is customized. The generation now in the market for mortuary wares is redefining death in much the same way that, three decades back, it redefined sex and gender.
If my father sold caskets on protection and permanence, I offer choices, options, New Age alternatives. Where he occupied a world of black and white, custom and tradition, moral certainty, my fellow boomers still see our rights and wrongs as relative; we roll our own orthodoxies.
Always the demographic bullies on the block, boomers are now grieving and dying, so grief and death are all the rage. The market is bullish on ritual and metaphor, for acting out our hurts the way our ancients did. Whether we burn or bury our dead is less important than what we do before we dispose of them. Boomers are hustling to reinvent the rituals that got our parents and their parents through age and sickness and sadness and loss, in case, just in case, it could happen to us. Faced with the deaths of the ones we love, we are stuck between the will to do everything, anything and nothing at all.
Back at the funeral home the hot topics (forgive me) are cremation and designer funerals. Members of my parents' generation, in their 70's now, are behaving as their boomer children once did -- fast and mobile, they're buying motor homes and time shares in casino towns, and they do not want their lives or deaths to be a burden to their kids. They do not want to be "grounded" to the graves they bought when people stayed put and always came home. Their ashes are Fed-Exed around the hemisphere in little packages, roughly the weight of a bowling ball. Not nearly the life-size burden of a casket, not nearly the bother or expense. They get sent back from Florida and Phoenix, to old homes in the cold north and Rust Belt states.
Still, their sons and daughters, in receipt of these tiny reminders, are beginning to wonder: Is that all there is? Is it enough to get out our cell phones and our Gold Cards and have our dead elders disappear with no more pause than it takes to order up sushi to go? Can we distance ourselves entirely from the physical realities of death and still expect to enjoy the physical wonders of life? Is a good bargain on a funeral really such a good deal if it doesn't do the job of properly commemorating death? Even the late Jessica Mitford, that priestess of simplicity, whose "American Way of Death Revisited" is due out from Knopf next month, had a lavish multimedia farewell in London last year.
Hence, more and more, we boomers care for our own dying. More and more we are making up new liturgies to say goodbye. More and more we seem willing to engage fully in the process of leave-taking. We rise early to watch the televised departures of princesses and modern saints. We read the obituaries every day. We eulogize, elegize and memorialize with vigor. The trade is brisk in wakes and funerals that offer a personalized touch. My father's generation did copper and concrete and granite memorials. We do biodegradables, economy models and ecofriendly cyberobsequies. He sold velvet and satin and crepe interiors. We do urns that look like golf bags and go to cemeteries with names like golf courses. You can buy a casket off the Internet, or buy plans for a self-built "coffin table" or one that doubles as a bookshelf until you "need" it. There's a push for "do it yourself" funerals -- as if grief were ever anything but. Cremated remains can be recycled as memorial kitty litter, sprinkled on rosebushes, mixed with our oil paints to add texture to fresh masterpieces.
We have, as the Batesville Casket Company calls its latest marketing approach, Options. And as the demographic aneurysm gets nearer to bursting in two or three decades, the marketplace is readying for another boom. Soon, every off-ramp on the interstate across the continent will have a Burger King, Barnes & Noble and Funerals "R" Us. Telemarketers are busy interrupting our dinners, selling us choices from the ridiculous to the sublime, from bang to whimper, and everywhere between. The fashions change. The feelings seldom do.
The facts of life and death remain the same. We live and die, we love and grieve, we breed and disappear. And between these existential gravities, we search for meaning, save our memories, leave a record for those who will remember us.
I am the age my father was when I was my son's age. Figure that. Halfway between the half a century between those two -- sometimes it seems that we repeat ourselves. I hear my father's caution in the way I caution him about life's changes and dangers, about drugs and drink and being "sexually active." We talk about making responsible choices, safe sex, committed relationships, condoms and consequences: permanence and protection come round again.
One of these days I'll have to teach them caskets.

HEADLINE: On Language;
Ratcheting Up the Periscope

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
Anticipating tension among the heirs to Frank Sinatra's estate, Joshua Hammer wrote in Newsweek about Ol' Blue Eyes' will, "It's certain to ratchet up the family feud even higher."
A puzzled Marie Balandis of Houston writes: "My dictionary defines ratchet as a noun meaning 'a pawl, click or detent for holding or propelling a ratchet wheel.' Will be looking for your column on ratchet." 
 Here it is, and you need a newer dictionary.
Every mechanic knows that a ratchet is a toothed wheel or bar used to prevent a gizmo from moving backward. That sawlike catch is what gives us all confidence in elevators and the courage to jack up a car to change a tire. But this word (from the Old German roccho, "spindle") has been reborn with new senses.
The ratchet effect has seized economics, and to ratchet up -- "to move upward in increments" -- is a verb phrase that has thrust aside the previously voguish escalate. (Raise was long ago lowered, and increase has shrunk.)
Prof. James Duesenberry of Harvard launched ratchet effect in a 1948 doctoral thesis that became a seminal macroeconomic book the next year: "Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer Behavior." He took the ratchet to be a device that enables something to move easily up but prevents it from moving easily all the way down, and applied that metaphor to the way we spend our money. In 1979, Daedalus magazine described the theory as beginning "with the common wisdom that prices go up more freely than they go down."
But that's only the beginning. I asked Prof. William Doyle of the University of Dallas to simplify Duesenberry's theory for me, and it boils down to this: "It's easier for a household to adapt its expenditures to an increase in income than to a decrease in income. When income increases, consumption spending increases; but when income falls, consumers who have come to view their standard of living as 'normal' are very reluctant to decrease consumption spending." That's the ratchet effect: when you've been up there, you tend to spend as if you're still there -- even when you can no longer afford it. Reached in Boston, the emeritus Professor Duesenberry recalls: "I think the ratchet I was familiar with was a car jack. I thought about the ratchet on a car jack and thought of it as an analogy to what was happening. It's an asymmetrical response."
According to Merriam-Webster, the editor of Barron's magazine, Robert Bleiberg, first used the phrasal verb ratchet up on April 10, 1972: "In a striking reversal of policy, the Fed in recent weeks has ratcheted upward the repo a collateralized short-term loan rate to 4 percent." Five years later, Britain's Margaret Thatcher, on her way to becoming Prime Minister, latched on to the image: "Britain is no longer in the politics of the pendulum, but of the ratchet."
Economists still love the saw-toothed image, but came to use it in a broader sense. "If you build in wages and other benefits based upon an exaggerated Consumer Price Index," warned Paul Volcker when he was Fed chairman in 1981, "you ratchet up inflation."
Now it calibrates any rise. "Tension in the border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea," reported Agence France-Presse a few months ago, "ratcheted up a notch."
And Michael Kelly, in his column enlivening the weekly National Journal, dreamed up ways that Democrats would continue to try to embarrass Republicans with anti-tobacco bills, concluding, "The pain level ratchets up, and sooner or later, the theory goes, the G.O.P. caves."
Needed: a phrase meaning "to lower by degrees, to decrease in increments." Ratchet down may be justified mechanically, but it doesn't do it metaphorically.
 
SLOW BOAT TO JAPAN
Never underestimate the ability of dour business executives to come up with colorful word pictures. A system allowing interest rates to rise or fall only within a narrow range was called the snake in the tunnel; a stock rally doomed to be short-lived is a dead-cat bounce.
Japan has the Gososendan-hoshiki. To break it down, Goso means "shipped with protection"; sen is "ship"; dan is "group." Hoshiki is "system." English translation: "the convoy system."
When Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin decided to intervene in the currency markets to support the yen, he had just been assured that Tokyo would take action against the convoys. Last month David Wessel wrote in The Wall Street Journal that Japanese officials promised "that Japan finally will abandon what is called the 'convoy system,' which essentially involves strong companies bailing out weak ones -- often under pressure from regulators -- so that everyone stays afloat."
Vivid metaphor. A convoy is a group, usually of ships, organized to move in a way that best protects the whole group. In World War II "action in the North Atlantic," Allied convoys supplying Britain were assembled to ward off Nazi submarines, and it became a truism that "a convoy moves as slowly as its slowest ship."
In the current Japanese trope, the Gososendan-hoshiki consists of strong and weak banks; the strong banks hold afloat the weak ones. By breaking up the convoy, central bankers around the world hope to allow the Japanese banks weakened by bad loans to sink and the strong to survive.
The hero-villain metaphor has been reversed; in this case, the good guys are the U-boat commanders busting up the self-protective convoys and picking off the laggards. Ratchet up that periscope. Fire Vun!

HEADLINE: Big Tobacco's Endgame

 BODY:
When I was 13 years old, growing up in the tobacco-growing region of southern Georgia, I cropped tobacco by hand for $5 per day and all I could eat for lunch. In my community, tobacco put shoes on kids' feet, bought the four pairs of blue jeans they needed to get through the school year and eventually sent them off to college to build a new life that didn't involve breaking their backs, in three-digit temperatures, to pay their way.
When I was 29, I stood at my father's hospital bed when his internist told him he had an oat-cell-type cancer growing in his left lung. 
 At 31, I buried him. He had been a lifelong Winston smoker, 43 years -- not counting the two years he quit while undergoing chemotherapy and waiting to die.
At 40, I was feeding and clothing my own kids with commissions I earned from selling magazine advertising space to RJR Nabisco. When I would sit in the company's offices in Winston-Salem and refuse an offer to enjoy a Camel over a business discussion, a little voice kept whispering "hypocrite" in my ear.
No one has to explain to me the conundrum in which this nation and the tobacco companies find themselves. Tobacco's tentacles reach as deep into this country's economy as the cancer it causes does into humans. Its use metastasizes in our society from adults, who should know better, to young people, who think they will never die. But it has fed families and educated children, too.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
A Composer's Lament: The Music Goes Soft

BYLINE: By MATTHIAS KRIESBERG; Matthias Kriesberg, an American composer, lives in New York.

 BODY:
ONE morning some 25 years ago, the composer Chou Wen-Chung regaled those of us in his music analysis class with reports of musical life in China. So pervasive was the application of Maoist doctrine, we were told, that music was written by committee. When a piece was completed, it was presented to the farmers' collective for criticism. We all had a good laugh.
Now consider this sentence from an article by a composer formerly in residence at a top American orchestra, describing a response to a commission: "I walked through my community, knocking on doors, and asked people what sort of piece they would like." (Good thinking: this composer went to the farmers before writing the piece.) 
 I have often imagined my response if I had received that knock at my door: "You know, I've always been fond of intricate relationships involving E flat, F sharp and C sharp." Or: "You're the composer. You got the commission. Now go home and write the piece you believe in, and don't worry about what I expect."
But to suggest today that writing music is about more than pleasing an audience is to commit the most horrific cultural crime of the late, late 20th century: "elitism." There is broad agreement across the political spectrum: wisdom resides in the will of the people. Granted, our embrace of the collective philosophy we used to mock has a new twist; yesterday's masses are today's marketplace. And since the power of the market is the flip side of democracy, you can't challenge one without ostensibly opposing the other. So even contemporary classical composition -- not exactly in the mainstream of everyday life -- becomes validated in proportion to the number of people served.
Responsiveness to audience demand has become an obsession. Some months ago, a successful composer described his compositional process in a radio interview: "When I write, I imagine being in the audience and ask myself what it would feel like to hear this passage." Another composer, quoted in The New York Times, stated that his highest ambition was to make new music "accessible."
Partisans of accessibility flaunt their righteous anger. Some weeks ago in these pages, Peter Gelb, the president of Sony Classical, made the perfectly reasonable case that he has a fiduciary obligation to his company to issue recordings that are likely to make a profit, and that he is entitled to advocate the music he believes in. Then he declared, "Serialism will have to start sharing space on concert hall programs with new music of broader appeal." When he delivered the same message to those of us attending the Salzburg Seminar in Austria, last December, he was asked incredulously which composers were supposed to step aside.
After all, the most frequently performed American composers today seem comfortable with the notion that audience response is a legitimate indicator of musical value. Yet for the last 15 years -- at least since the New York Philharmonic's 1983 new-music festival, "A New Romanticism?" -- we have been tirelessly informed that a cabal of composers continues to dominate concert programming and that the public has yet to be liberated by composers daring enough to write music people love. Even now, a generation after the routing of the Gang of Serialists, the battles are recited breathlessly, as if at this very moment we are in mortal danger of succumbing to the forces of elitism. Why keep pumping bullets into the dead?
It is telling that this "liberating" musical style is defined by audience response rather than in musical terms. The old new music, we are told, disdained the audience; the new new music does not. (For the record, the opposite is closer to the truth. The bad-old composers naively believed that audiences would eventually hear what the composer heard; the good-new accessibilists assume that audiences are unimaginative and impatient.)
What no one wants to acknowledge publicly is that the current stylistic evolution in contemporary classical music may have more to do with economic forces than with purely musical considerations. Here is part of a letter I received from someone in a position to know the state of mind of one of our prominent New Romantic composers: "His experience as composer-in-residence was an important matter. Once he found that if the conductor, the orchestra, the critics and the audience liked a piece, it was worth 30 or 40 thousand dollars a crack; he and his wife drove better cars. Isn't the long-term problem of every serious composer how to write music that satisfies oneself while making a living doing so?"
Actually, no. These are separate problems, and they should not be confused. A surgeon has an obligation to perform surgery only when it is appropriate. That he or she may also need to pay off the mortgage on a fine home does not mean that the doctor's "long-term problem" is how to get patients to require expensive surgery. (Such a distinction is especially important if the doctor in question is yours.)
The trouble is, we are in love with two contradictory principles. One is that a composer should write music that flows unimpeded from his or her imagination. The other is that "user-friendly" products are superior. It is no accident that the last 20 years have seen an ever stronger demand that composers make their music more directly useful to the needs of the "community." In America today, authority and wealth are won by the endorsement or purchasing power of vast numbers of people. Our decision makers, even in the arts, increasingly come from the ranks of those who find popular success and intrinsic value indistinguishable, who consider successful marketing synonymous with freedom of expression. Uncomfortable with the uneasy fit of serious music into contemporary culture, they proclaim the need to redefine classical music.
You can't have it both ways. Remember the official in the Reagan Administration who, seeking to cut school lunch subsidies but confronting the requirement that lunches include two vegetables, proposed redefining ketchup as a vegetable? Markets generate great wealth, but that doesn't mean that artistic principles can be rewritten to accommodate them. (Granted, the urge to try can be irresistible. Nowadays a composer practically has to be world-famous just to pay the rent.)
A few years ago, I was in an airplane awaiting takeoff, idly looking at one of those "calm-the-mind" videos. It was a meandering sequence of nature images with a soundtrack of watered-down Minimalism. As it turned out, the flight was held on the ground so long that the film ran right through to the credits, and I learned that the parties responsible were Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass.
In the early 80's this filmmaker and composer created "Koyanisqaatsi." That memorable and original work inspired Francis Ford Coppola to produce a sequel, "Powaqaatsi." Geared to wider appeal, it lacked the imagination and emotional weight of its predecessor. Now comes "Anima Mundi," commissioned by a company that markets videos to the airline industry.
It is an evolution worth pondering. Because Mr. Glass's Minimalist style imparted cohesion to whatever medium it was attached to, his music became eminently desirable to choreographers, theater directors, filmmakers and producers of television advertising. This statement implies no lack of integrity on the part of the composer. It is simply a characteristic of his music that it is an ideal passenger on other creators' vehicles. Ten minutes of largely redundant gestures in the medium of sound make what you see in another medium appear very convincing.
Mr. Glass's music is now a useful commodity. Its capacity to flatter has brought it to the attention of a much larger audience than would otherwise have encountered it. Since audience size is vital to the media and music industries (both consumed by the task of capturing a market), Mr. Glass is celebrated as a composer who "broke out of the box."
Such a successful career obscures the fact that American composers no longer control the direction of contemporary music with an authority comparable to that exercised by creators in other art forms. True, composition is a relatively dependent art form to begin with. The serious money in music is generated by performance, not composition. Writers produce manuscripts, painters produce canvases, but composers typically respond to commissions. Most of our contemporary music is either neo-conservative or neo-populist. It almost begs for acceptance.
Let's recall what drove a century of glorious achievement in painting and sculpture. A relatively small number of collectors followed their own taste and convictions and bought work they believed in. Painting and sculpture are tangible commodities, but the essential point is that artistic success was not achieved because millions of people purchased reproductions. Individuals with the ability to make a difference exercised creative artistic judgment.
The same could happen with contemporary composition if even a few people of wealth, appreciating what was at stake, dedicated themselves to the future of serious music. The Los Angeles music patron Betty Freeman should serve as an inspiration to those able to wield the powerful combination of conviction and money. The key is engaging actively in the direct support of creative choices: not leaving to others the selection of composers to support. Only direct involvement will empower composers to resume a position of leadership in their profession.
And that's exactly what is going to happen. The triumph of popular judgment over the power of artistic worth cannot be sustained forever. Sooner or later, individuals of financial means will step forward out of profound dissatisfaction with our parade of new music and its split agenda: to be art and to be nice. The market economy that has obliged new music to conform to popular protocols has also generated nearly unimaginable wealth. It's a safe bet that some of that is in the hands of people who don't want all their music soft.

HEADLINE: FILM;
The Fits-and-Starts Education Of a Movie-World Beginner

BYLINE: By BARRY YOURGRAU; Barry Yourgrau's new book of fiction, "Haunted Traveller," will be published next year by Arcade.

 BODY:
IN late 1994 a film was made that centered on me and my dark whimsies about romance and heartbreak: "The Sadness of Sex," from my book of the same name. Here's my sorry tale of how this odd independent movie was brought briefly to the screen -- and then to the shelf, where it now sits, maybe for good. The story is my two cents toward the updating of "Candide" that famously takes place when a neophyte like me gets involved in the mad, bad world of glamour-grabbing and economic hardball that is the film business.
And it even stars Peta Wilson. 
 "Spalding Gray is like Woody Allen; you're like -- Fellini!" cried Rupert Wainwright, a director of big-money television commercials, that night in February 1994. He had just seen my spoken-word act at the Luna Park club in Los Angeles and had been inspired then and there to scratch notes for a performance movie.
Yes, I remember his effusions exactly. As a bicoastal bohemian -- a creature of Paris Review salons and hipster cabarets like Luna Park and New York's Fez, plus a few minutes on "MTV Unplugged" -- here I was finally going to draw my ticket to the commercialization of a career: my own "Swimming to Cambodia." At 45, I made a somewhat hoary Candide.
On the other hand, for Rupert, in his mid-30's, the project was a mad pure-hearted stroke to save his esthetic soul from Ballpark Franks spots, Michael Jackson promos and "Home Alone" knockoffs. Sure, he had a Grammy for his Hammer videos. But big, blond Rupert was also an Oxford English-literature grad.
Looking back, I see that the pathos surrounding both our ambitions wags the tale of "The Sadness of Sex" -- as do our brands of hubris and naivete. Yet credit Rupert for a real miracle, which is the one of getting our unconventionally unconventional movie made at all.
Yes, we began so miraculously, before the farce to come last year in Los Angeles, where the film had a short run, and the shock in New York this spring, when to top everything I got called a "smug lecher" in a review, even though the film ended up not opening at all.
For two glorious, brutal weeks we shot in Toronto's chill fall of '94. A Canadian commercials-production firm had put up half a million dollars -- finally, in what I would come to know well as the film business's puckish, yes-no, yes-no style. Under Rupert's lash I took to the stage and hammed to the camera the stories he and I had shaped into my surreal romantic history.
Then on location for story re-enactments, I did a screen kiss, heart pounding, with a young blond Australian ex-model. A couple of years later, she would be widely known as the star of television's "La Femme Nikita." To my shock -- that word again (the script called for body doubles) -- Peta Wilson and I wound up in a closed-set naked love scene. I had another shock, on another closed set. Outdoors, dressed like Sam Spade, I climbed a shaky fire ladder to fetch a runaway vagina up a tree. I shook, myself, in fear and authorial jubilation.
"This film makes 'Swimming to Cambodia' look like an infomercial," some bumptious soul cackled in post-production.
Oh, indeed. Fully assembled, it was a cross between MTV and "Aida," plus a splash of Hallmark cards. The photography was sumptuous, with Peta blazing in negligee and angels' wings; an editor from "Natural Born Killers" had kaleidoscoped my 90-minute solo with live-action sequences, animation, video footage and photo stills, and Rupert and the big-time music supervisor from "J.F.K." had brought in a marquee-worthy original soundtrack for a pittance.
On screen, "The Sadness of Sex" was a grandiose, double oddity: a quirky little art film cranked to a fare-the-well by loving, Hollywood-savvy hands. It blinded any grainy indie stereotype.
Was I, the author, happy with this extravagant movie version of me and my whimsies? Today, I might hem about sensibilities. At the time, happy wasn't the word. I was thrilled.
The film festivals weren't. All the majors and many minors -- including the hometown event in Toronto -- turned us down.
Because we didn't look cheap enough, snorted one of our distribution agents, trying to steady my distress. These agents had been crucial in attracting financing. They were big in feature-to-television rights ("Robocop" the series); at selling movies like ours, they were new.
Finally the Hamptons festival threw open its arms. Rupert jetted in from the Great Wall of China, where he was filming a commerical. We had buzz, a journalist told me (though he hadn't seen the film). A wisecracking 20-year-old from Brooklyn who showed part of a rough-cut on video got one of the extra jury awards. The glories of "The Sadness of Sex" got no award -- and no distribution offer. Rupert could have taken the boat.
He and I sat our version of an indie post-mortem at a TriBeCa restaurant, with Richard Harris, father of Peta's boyfriend. The Irish film star stroked the tiny dog that was snuggling inside his shirt, gave Rupert thumbs up and burred on about "the great Joe Losey." Misty-eyed, Rupert swore to me that whatever it took, he would find us a distributor.
Such grand moments fortified for a while, until the mixed review in Variety. I barely registered "original and often provocative," "excessive MTV-like style," "commercial prospects skimpy" and "tech credits nothing short of stunning" because I found myself referred to, prominently, as Peta Wilson. First I had given up credit, on screen, as an author (no mention of the underlying book, only "written by Barry Yourgrau and Rupert Wainwright") -- and now, in the industry trade paper, I had vanished as a performer! Who'd God put in charge of movies, Don Rickles?
But what's a few flying pies, when a whole cruel bakery awaits.
Nothing came of Slamdance, the counter-festival to Sundance; nothing of San Jose, where our sumptuous reels showed in wrong order. Rupert perched away gallantly in distributors' offices with a line about "another 'Il Postino.' " No one agreed, for months on end.
I wasn't handling it well. I hadn't the nerves. I couldn't understand: we had people who loved the film whenever we screened it; why wouldn't somebody take a chance on us?
"Because, Barry," blurted David Lancaster, our senior producer, "it's still essentially 90 minutes of one guy talking. Spalding Gray already had a name, from theater!"
I could feel my Big Break slipping away. Frantic, I became someone who showed up at dinner parties with a video clip.
Enter, magically it seemed, Tara Releasing, with the original Dutch thriller "The Vanishing" to its release credit. It was, of course, a so-called "micro-distributor." Its president mainly ran a canoe-rental business.
"The Sadness of Sex" opened in its glory at a reputable Los Angeles art house in the spring of '97, right after April Fools' Day -- appropriately so, given the wincing Hollywood sendup of independent-film ambitions to follow.
Comic highlights: Rupert rushing the two of us, plus cell phone, around Sunset Strip in his new Jag convertible, to Scotchtape our homemade deluxe mini-posters onto mailboxes and lamps, beneath the towering billboard of my "Sadness" lovemate, now far off being Nikita to millions; literary bohemian movie star riding public transport daily to Rupert's grand suite on the Sony lot, to publicity-monger on the phones, which was all the author-performer really did anymore.
More comic highlights: director and movie star roaming supermarket lots and pedestrian malls with Xeroxes of glowing review ("a striking film" -- The Los Angeles Times), getting chased at high speed out of the Directors' Guild parking garage for plastering windshields; anguished studio-lot conference calls to a northern California canoe-rental shop, pleading for posters, ads, promotional help; hangdog bohemian movie star ("ideal for the camera" -- The Los Angeles Times) and resolute linen-suited millionaire director ("expands the boundaries of cinema" -- New Times) trudging side by side, night after night, from windshield to windshield down the winding curbsides, the Hollywood sign looming in the dark behind them.
It was, altogether, a triumph of leafleting. "Thought you guys already had a distributor," someone wondered at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival, as we worked the lobby.
Tara drifted out of business, slowly and over dim months of nothing, without announcement. "The Sadness of Sex" became ours again. Lucky us. We had a jazzed-up one-man movie with a great Los Angeles Time review, other fine blurbs -- and a feeble couple-of-weeks run featuring a box-office gross to make any distributor laugh and claw his hair.
By now Rupert and I were the only ones with anything really to gain from an opening in New York, instead of going right to video, with Peta on the box cover. But Rupert and I would not give up on the New York prestige, the attention. I was desperately sure we'd find our audience here, where our incorrect blend of high gloss, absurd poetic poignancies and young beauties in lingerie would be treated as, say, a sexy European-style vision (more like Fellini, perhaps, than "Il Postino").
"Not European," a Spanish journalist friend calculated subtly. "Australian."
Rupert finagled a small self-release budget from our television sales to eastern Europe (as part of a package with "The Last Don" mini-series). Screen space in Manhattan art houses is a jungle, ruled by Miramax and other big beasts. But there we were, booked prettily at a venerable showcase for quality unaffiliated eccentricities and sexy European features. Peta agreed to fly in for promotion. I went into hyping overdrive.
On Feb. 13, a Friday (when else?), the polling came back from our first press screening. "Shocking" won't do it. Few major reviewers had attended, and none had tipped their hands, but the viewers who did were united in a hiss of contempt. It was as if our glam literary bauble had committed a cultural outrage of criminal pretentiouness. The second screening was hardly better. We were aghast.
Rupert -- Rupert, who I would boast had switched agents to make this film, who had never given up, who had kissed me at the end of filming for giving him back his life -- Rupert, my champion, had just been green-lighted for a big-budget Hollywood movie. It was his first studio project since Disney's "Blank Check" in '94. I could hear the struggle in his voice. Tortured conference calls revealed his overriding concern: a bad review of "The Sadness of Sex" must not appear in The New York Times on the Friday we opened. He would not risk a review then -- at all.
I heard myself sputtering heroic cliches: he was captain of our ship (I'd just seen "Titanic"); we were proud of what we'd done, should ride it to its end and keep courage. Rupert informed me, tautly, that those metaphors meant nothing to him.
Finally he gave in to having "The Sadness of Sex" open -- on the condition that no reviewer from The Times would see it in time for Friday review. He canceled the remaining screenings (which he had been paying for; he had already called off the premiere party), and schemed a delay in screening cassettes going out to the news media. Our publicity agent informed me that she was in the business of publicizing films, not hiding them.
I had always cleaved to Rupert, out of gratitude and because I felt that he had the most power of us all and that his ambition ultimately served mine. Now I found myself in a nightmare, joining with the producer Lancaster, who was as appalled as I was, in not interfering as screening cassettes went out as normal. I waited in mutinous double-dread for the premiere.
The theater, which knew none of this, trumped all this amateur gore by canceling on us, four days to go. I heard the punch line as I stood with The New Yorker in my hands: "The Sadness of Sex" was featured in its film listings that week with "The Big Lebowski." I was due on radio in an hour.
It was something about us not spending enough on ads and missing a round of them. There was nothing we could do or say. Another film was already in or slot. Imploring got us nowhere.
So, ads had to be pulled frantically; desperate calls had to be made, appealing that reviews be held -- especially to the weeklies, which were already going to press. "If a bad review shows up in a weekly, no one else's going to book us; it's over!" cried Lancaster. What a setup line.
The next day, on cue, The Village Voice finished its review in this way: "Yourgrau hogs the camera, oozing lecherous self-satisfaction." On line, the headline was positively waggish: "15 Short Films About a Smug Lecher." Some epitaph for a movie about a man walking around sighing and being sad a lot.
In the aftermath, the owners of the theater, as distinct from its booker, were chagrined to learn what had happened. They have offered an open, certain date. But our release budget has been pretty much exhausted. I'm informed that Anthology Film Archives seems interested. And a video deal may be forthcoming. I told an indie-filmmaker friend from Los Angeles the whole story, and she laughed and said she would probably have done as Rupert did.
I rang him up just now, to note that I was writing my candid take on our movie-to-screen experience, and wondering what his reflections might be. We hadn't spoken since early March; he had been busy, I gathered, with "Toby's Story,' his religious thriller for MGM.
I must say our talk wasn't pleasant. Rupert insisted vehemently that his New York actions were solely to give "The Sadness of Sex" a chance in the theater, before the critics tore it to bits, as seemed their wont. What's more, after all the toil, all the money he had spent on our film, he felt hurt and outraged at what he saw as the possibility of my stabbing him in the back.
Which shows that a sense of betrayal in the movies is a feeling not exclusive to anyone. That grand Hollywood term "lawsuit" floated over the telephone wire.
Maybe that's the inevitable place to end a film-world tale. But let's try for a happier finis. Me, I've actually had another book optioned -- by a studio. Dennis Hopper tantalized briefly, on something else. Billy Bob Thornton, too. No new Candide-ian miracles yet. But at least I get to change topics from you-know-what.

HEADLINE: POP/JAZZ;
A Burst of Rock, Bright as the Rising Sun

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IT is a decrepit and smoky basement club, but the place is jammed with girls screaming for the Outsiders, a band led by a charismatic long-haired guitarist who shakes his mane as he puts one foot on a stage monitor and lets rip a thunderous solo that shakes the room. Terri MacMillan, a music manager, watches with a banana grin, convinced that she has found a future superstar. She can picture him headlining arenas to mobs of guys playing air guitar and teen-aged girls screaming his name. She is literally jumping up and down in rapture. Only we are not in New York, Seattle or Omaha. We are in Tokyo. And Ms. MacMillan is the only other American in the club.
"I'm convinced that this is happening," she says excitedly, "but the problem is convincing everybody else. It's just like Britain all over again, only everyone is afraid." 
 Ms. MacMillan is referring to the explosion of Japanese pop and rock music. For the past two decades, Japan has been home to the world's second largest music industry behind America's, but only recently, in the face of economic crisis and sweeping social change, has it reached the diversity and originality necessary to find an audience in the West.
"We've been trying to break Japanese bands overseas for 10 years -- 10 long years," says Tom Toeda, Ms. MacMillan's partner in a music management company here, Chibiya. "Now, finally, we feel we're in the right time and at the right place."
Japan today is in some ways like England circa 1960, when Americans thought of British music as just a substandard imitation of American pop. But then came the Beatles, proving that the British weren't just copying American rock and rhythm-and-blues but coming up with their own interpretations, starting a British invasion that has continued, ebbing and surging, to this day. The situation is similar in Japan: pieces of American, British and even French, German and Swedish popular music are being fused into something Japanese.
"With cars and stereos, those things are invented somewhere else," Mr. Toeda says. "Then they come to Japan; we redo it our own way and make it a little better and then put it out. So maybe that's what's happening in the music scene."
Though the Western music audience is too fragmented for another pop juggernaut on the order of the Beatles to emerge, in nearly each splinter of rock and pop there are Japanese bands good enough to rank among the upper echelons. Ms. MacMillan and Mr. Toeda, who have already taken two Japanese bands, Pizzicato Five and Buffalo Daughter, from obscurity to college-rock favorites in America, believe that all it would take is for Japan to export a handful of slightly more successful bands to bring the country closer to ranking alongside America and England as a pop and rock capital -- especially in this time of creative stagnation in popular music in America and increasing openness to Asian pop culture. Their business plan is to find unknown bands in Japan and make them stars in America before anybody has heard of them at home and then bring them back to Japan as conquering heroes. This scenario may be possible within 5 to 10 years. But is the American pop public ready?
Many American music executives are doubtful. "It will never happen," barks one label president, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "They look different than we do. They speak different than we do."
OTHERS, however, have no doubt. Besides Ms. McMillan, there are people like Steve Pross, the obsessive, excitable 42-year-old head of Emperor Norton Records, an independent label based in Los Angeles that is owned by Peter Getty, the grandson of J. Paul Getty. Three days after the Outsiders show, Mr. Pross is at a much larger club in Tokyo, proudly watching the newest addition to his label's roster, the Zoobombs, thrash on stage before a sold-out house. A great garage, punk and blues-rock band, the Zoobombs play funky grooves that explode into guitar-bashing choruses made up of single catch phrases. As the singer and guitarist Don Matsuo -- equal parts Elvis Presley, James Brown and Beck -- spits out lines like "You need to get mo' funky," some 1,000 fans pogo up and down in response.
"I think the next Beck or the next Paul McCartney is going to come from Japan," Mr. Pross says as he observes the scene from the club balcony. "And I want to be the one to find him."
Mr. Pross is in Tokyo preparing to release three albums by Japanese bands -- the Zoobombs, Takako Minekawa and Fantastic Plastic Machine -- in America as well as to find more Japanese bands to license. For Mr. Pross, one of the few American music executives actively looking for Japanese bands, running around to record stores and labels in Tokyo feels like striking oil. And he is rushing to stake a claim on as much as he can before the big corporations move in.
"After talking to you," he tells the head of one Japanese record label during a meeting, "I think my record company is going to do better licensing Japanese bands and selling them in America than licensing American bands and selling them to Japan."
So what does Japanese pop music sound like?
Going to Japan to write about its music scene is not like going to France to write about the electronic music boom there or to China to write about its rebel rockers, because there isn't a scene in Japan; there are hundreds of scenes. For those who like the testosterone-happy American rock bands Rage Against the Machine, 311 and Everclear, there are the Japanese counterparts Mad Capsule Markets, Backdrop Bomb and Thee Michelle Gun Elephant. If your tastes run to Alanis Morissette, Tori Amos and Tracy Chapman, there are Cocco, Bonnie Pink and Ua. And most of them aren't mere knockoffs. Singing in Japanese, English and "Japlish," these acts have come up with a fusion of their own, albeit one influenced by American and European bands. What's surprising is that it's not excellence in recent American music that has inspired this flowering of Japanese bands; rather, many Japanese musicians say it's the staleness of new imported rock that has given them confidence in their own music. In fact, Western music has slipped from a majority market share in Japan to less than 25 percent as Japanese bands have matured.
There are three types of Japanese musicians attracting small audiences in America. One is made up of obscure, uncompromising Japanese avant-garde bands -- psychedelic rockers like Ghost, improvisational guitarists like Keiji Haino and noise bands like Merzbow -- who have been heroes in the American underground for years. The second consists of bands that fit into niche genres -- punk, ska and especially electronic dance music, which doesn't depend on lyrics and language -- in which fans feel part of an international community of music-makers. Some of the top acts in these genres, like the punk band Hi-Standard and the techno musician Ken Ishii, already have American record deals and have sold tens of thousands of albums overseas.
The third type of Japanese band emerging in America is the most interesting because it doesn't fit into an existing style. These bands are evidence of an emerging Japanese sound and esthetic. Like reggae in Jamaica -- an attempt to replicate American rhythm-and-blues that turned into its own genre when the musicians got the beat wrong -- the Japanese sound has roots in a failed imitation. Sometimes referred to as Shibuya kei, after Tokyo's busy youth shopping district and home to foreign record chains, the Japanese style is a pop tsunami swamping everything in its path and washing it ashore in a jumble. Think of the music as an aural equivalent of Japanese commercial slogans like "Calcium loading. Get! In! Hold!" (for the drink Kirin Cadi). Its cultural appropriations bend logic, break rules and inadvertently come up with new and likable turns of phrase.
"Even the artists themselves will admit that so much of the style is built on a misinterpretation of American culture," says Bryan Burton-Lewis, who plays the music as a host on the Osaka radio station FM802 and the cable channel Space Shower TV and who also helps write lyrics for Yoshinori Sunahara, Kahimi Karie, Chara, Bridge and Cornelius. "They'll build an entire world around a few albums, TV programs and movies -- and then they finally get to America and England and find out that it's completely different than they imagined. But in the end they've created something original, a world of their own, which therefore they like better."
In a youth culture in which keeping up with trends insures popularity, coolness is a function of obsession, a trait that has helped make Japanese record stores the most extensive and impressive in the world. Some of the best Japanese bands making inroads in America -- acts like Pizzicato Five and Cornelius on Matador Records in New York, Buffalo Daughter on the Beastie Boys' label, Grand Royal, and Fantastic Plastic Machine on Emperor Norton -- are indefatigable record shoppers who mix and match every genre that interests them in their music. They worship at the altar of classic pop groups like the Beach Boys, soft-pop acts like Burt Bacharach, film composers like Ennio Morricone, rappers like Public Enemy, psychedelic rockers like Pink Floyd and French singers like Serge Gainsbourg. (Mr. Gainsbourg's use of American pop-culture phrases in his songs could be seen as evidence of a very Japanese esthetic, as could the quotation-filled music of Beck and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.)
I ALWAYS thought I was just making Western music," says Cornelius. "But now that people all over the world are listening to it and I'm able to get their reactions, they're telling me that they see my music as Japanese sounding. The way the information is overloaded -- even the copycat imagery -- people say is very Tokyo, very Japan. When I was told that, I realized that was true."
But there is more to the current flowering of Japanese pop and rock than simply the sound of one collector collecting. Shingo Sugiyama, an independent producer who is working with a musician whom Ms. McMillan wants to take to America -- a young, raw singer named Kayoko -- believes that Japan may be on the verge of a period analogous to the late 60's in America, when a young generation began to question the wisdom of its elders. As Japan is learning the economic lesson that the summit is the point closest to the precipice, a drop-out culture of people who don't want to join companies after graduation is growing.
"These kids making music now were born in Japan's richest time," Mr. Sugiyama says. "They were spoiled. If they wanted a guitar or a sampler, their parents would buy them one. But as they began to reach the age when it was time for them to enter the workforce, the bubble burst, and they began to feel helpless. The companies their parents worked so hard for were dropping; they started asking questions like: 'What are we working for? Where are we heading?' "
Whether the music will begin to matter in America depends on a number of variables. In the music's favor is the fact that over the last few years American culture has slowly begun opening up to Asian culture. There's the popularity of Hong Kong film stars like Jackie Chan, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat; Hollywood Asian-derived blockbusters like "Mulan" and "Godzilla"; Japanese video games like Parappa the Rapper and Street Fighter and Japanese animation. One American record executive, Karyn Rachtman at Interscope, says she has an 8-year-old son who reads only Japanese comic books and whose ambition is to make a movie in Japanese when he grows up.
Since American popular music was introduced to Japan after World War II, pop has occasionally leaked out of Japan and into the Western consciousness. There were, for example, "Sukiyaki" (the first and only Japanese song to hit No. 1 in America) in the 60's; the pioneering electronic music group Yellow Magic Orchestra; the novelty duo Pink Lady in the 70's, and the heavy-metal group Loudness in the 80's. But these success stories were aberrations.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle that Japanese music has to overcome is one of credibility. Since the 1970's, the music that has dominated the Japanese charts has been made by cheesy, over-produced musicians more talented at personal grooming than singing. These manufactured acts -- pin-ups like B'z, Glay, Speed, Smap and, the most fun of the lot, the classic-rock quoting duo Puffy -- are known as idols. Though the public taste for idols is beginning to wane in Japan, as the music industry is struggling with flat sales and losing touch with its audience, the Japanese bands that have put the most effort into making it in America have been the idols. And yet despite the tons of money that have been poured into marketing campaigns for stars like Seiko Matsuda and Toshi Kubota on Columbia Records, they have failed miserably in America, doing more to tarnish the reputation of Japanese music than to help it. As a result, many record labels in Japan are cynical about breaking acts in America.
"It's no good for business when a band goes to America, because when they come back their Japanese audience is gone," says Osamu Sato, chairman of BMG Records Japan. "So it's nice to have a dream, but a dream and business are not always the same."
What befuddles Japanese record executives the most is that despite their efforts to market popular Japanese artists in America, the Japanese bands that end up building a fan base there are obscure ones like the cutesy female rock trio Shonen Knife. "We all want to know why bands like B'z and Glay don't do good internationally, but bands like Pizzicato Five and Cornelius do," says Tomonori Satoh, the head of artists and repertory at Nippon Columbia's Triad label.
Keith Cahoon, the head of Tower Records Asia, believes that he has the answer. "Foreigners like Japanese bands that smell Japanese," he says. "The reason Toshi Kubota is not interesting to most people in America is because they can see a guy doing covers of black music at a corner bar. Kubota does a good imitation of soul music, but it's still an imitation. But if you see Shonen Knife, they sing about Japanese things like crowded trains, obsessively buying Louis Vuitton luggage and eating ice cream after a bath. Ryuichi Sakamoto and Kitaro use distinctively Japanese melodies. The many Japanese noise bands reflect the intense lives and pent-up anger of Japanese culture."
THOUGH Virgin Records in America is gearing up for a campaign for an English-language record by the Japanese pop band Dreams Come True, most labels are beginning to catch on. Sony recently hired a representative from Japan, Archie Meguro, to figure out how best to bring Japanese bands into the American market. His plan, he says, is to work with small underground acts -- like Ken Ishii, the hip-hop musician DJ Honda, the trip-hop artist DJ Krush and a Japanese equivalent of the Chemical Brothers called the Boom Boom Satellites. What is interesting about DJ Krush and DJ Honda as well as other dance-oriented Japanese acts like Natural Calamity and Silent Poets is that they sidestep language differences by working with American and European singers and rappers.
Perhaps one day the sound of Japanese vocalists singing in English and mispronouncing their r's will begin to sound as cool in America as a British accent, and Japanese-language songs will seem as romantic and beguiling as a French chanson. For this dream to come true, however, it is not Japanese music that will have to change. It is American myopia.
"In England and Japan, people have been listening to American music since the 60s," says Daisuke Kawasaki, who runs an indie-rock magazine, Beikoku-Ongaku, and record label. "But in America they're just starting to catch up to all the Japanese and European music we've been listening to. So maybe it is the American mind that is different now."

HEADLINE: Furious Fabricators of a Faust for the Digital Age

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: BARCELONA

 BODY:
LA FURA DELS BAUS is as unusual a name in Catalan as it is in English: the Ferret from the Baus. But there was method to the fantasy of the five young street performers who chose the name of their new experimental theater company in Barcelona in 1979. The ferret, which can be trained but not tamed, appealed to their anarchic instincts, while the Baus is the name of a dark ravine near their hometown of Moya, 30 miles north of Barcelona, where the five would hang out before they moved here in their late teens. So it sort of made sense.
The group has offered other, perhaps fanciful, translations in the past. But by now the name has long outgrown deconstruction. Today, at least to its legion of fans across Western Europe, La Fura dels Baus is synonymous with an unorthodox, multidisciplinary form of theater that uses loud music, violent movement, bizarre machinery and almost no words to create a near-apocalyptic atmosphere. It likes to perform before a standing audience in nontheatrical spaces like plazas and warehouses, frequently taking the action into the crowd. It has even spawned a Spanish adjective, furero, to describe its special lenguaje furero, its Furan language. 
 It seemed appropriate, then, that Carlos Padrissa, one of La Fura's founders, felt a need to explain, even justify, the break with tradition represented by its latest work, "F@ust, Version 3.0," which will be performed July 22 through 26 at the New York State Theater as part of this year's Lincoln Center Festival. The company has not surrendered to convention. Yet, for the first time, it is presenting a theatrical work before a seated audience using a written text, in this case inspired by no less than Goethe. Over the past two months, the play has been performed here, mainly in Catalan, at the National Theater of Catalonia. In New York, the show, which lasts 99 minutes without a break, will be in Spanish with English supertitles.
So could it be that success is corrupting the enfants terribles of La Fura into respectability? Or is the lenguaje furero now so persuasive that it is penetrating mainstream theater? The way that "F@ust, Version 3.0" came about suggests the latter. In 1996, the Granada International Dance and Music Festival invited Mr. Padrissa and another company member, Alex Olle, to try their hand at musical theater. Their production of Manuel de Falla's "Atlantida" was seen by Gerard Mortier, the director of the Salzburg Festival, who promptly invited them to direct "The Damnation of Faust" by Berlioz in Salzburg in 1999. It was as a result of this commission that they turned their attention to the legend of Faust, and "F@ust, Version 3.0" came about.
"I had read Goethe's 'Faust' as a kid, but only Part I," recalled Mr. Padrissa, a wiry, balding man of 39. "We began to read it again and saw it would work for our language because Goethe was the first to break with a linear sense of time. If the character of Faust was eternally unhappy, he would be still unhappier at the end of the millennium. So we decided to do a theater version of 'Faust,' but using our own methods. We remain loyal to the spirit of the work, but the form is new."
Having seen "F@ust, Version 3.0" here last month, Mr. Mortier has now asked La Fura to take it to Salzburg along with "The Damnation of Faust" next summer. How German and Austrian audiences respond to this information-age reworking of Goethe's masterpiece, in which the work's very name plays upon the language of software, may be one of the more interesting footnotes of the 1999 festival. "Our Faust is not a post-Renaissance elitist," Mr. Padrissa explained. "Today, with the Internet, anyone can have access to information. Goethe's Faust had wisdom and was unhappy. Today people become dissatisfied through information. That's why there are more Fausts today. Faust can be all of us."
Working with the non-Furans Pablo Ley, who adapted and wrote the text, and Magda Puyo, who directed the eight actors brought in for the play, Mr. Padrissa and Mr. Olle present their "F@ust" as a secular morality play: the combat is not between God and the Devil, but between the good and evil sides of Faust's personality. Mephistopheles appears, but he may also be Faust's imaginary alter ego. Even Faust's ill-fated teen-age mistress, Margarethe, is cast as the universal victim of all violence against the weak.
FAUST, who has cultivated reason all his life, is unhappy and tries to kill himself," Mr. Padrissa said, summarizing the plot. "When he fails, his neglected instinctive side says to him, 'Give me your life and I will give you happiness.' That's the pact. But when his base instincts take over, he kills Margarethe's brother, he leaves her pregnant, she kills her baby and Faust's unhappiness grows until he finally shoots himself. In Part II, while Goethe has him sleeping in a field in the Alps, our Faust lies paralyzed on a hospital bed. With no body and only a mind, he now hallucinates being visited by mythological figures. Finally, when he awakens, he understands that thoughts can be as dark as, well, you know, sex, drugs and rock and roll."
This story is told in lenguaje furero, with Faust's struggle lived out through images taken from the Internet, television, advertising and live video and projected on a giant screen, accompanied by electro-acoustical music (with breaks for Mozart's "Requiem") played by a disk jockey acting the part of conductor. Mr. Padrissa and Mr. Olle cannot resist including a few machines, like one that spins Faust head-over-heels as if in training for a space walk. And, as always, they come up with striking visual effects: Faust hanging in a water-filled plastic bag as an unborn embryo, or Faust and Margarethe courting as they climb a net of thick rope, their shadows magnified on a screen.
"People take time to absorb everything," Mr. Olle, 38, said after a warmly applauded performance here one recent evening. "The hope is that the images stay with them, maybe return to them later."
Like Mr. Padrissa, Mr. Olle is a company veteran, although he was not one of the five original founders from Moya whose theatrical roots were very much in the tradition of village fiestas. By the time he joined in 1981, La Fura was growing rapidly -- at one point it had 30 members -- and was putting on improvised shows at alternative sites across Barcelona. Then in 1984 the company was reduced to just nine young men, because only nine would fit into a small van, and began touring Catalonia.
"The moment was important," Mr. Padrissa said. "Franco died in 1975 and suddenly everything seemed possible. But by 1984, the fight for freedom was over and economic recession had set in. The dream was over for those who thought the world would change. The reality was a lot of unemployment. The fiesta element of our work evaporated. We created apocalyptic scenes to make people react, like electric shock treatment. We'd smash cars, set off explosions, burn sets, whatever. All to music."
With its first formal creation, "Accions," in 1984, La Fura established its theatrical language. And this was developed in five other works that have been described as spectacles of controlled techno-mayhem: "Suz/o/ Suz" (which was part of the New York International Festival of the Arts in 1991), "Tier Mon," "Noun," "MTM" and, most recently, "Manes." All of these have toured widely in Europe, with the company winning a particularly strong following in Germany and France.
From 1992, La Fura began to strike out in new directions. Until then, its members did everything: directing, composing, building machines and performing. However, when they presented a spectacular show to accompany the globally televised opening of the Barcelona Summer Olympics in 1992, they needed a cast of 1,500. And since then, the company members -- there are seven now, all men -- have taken to hiring actors to perform their pieces, leaving themselves time for further diversification. Pera Tantina -- he and Padrissa are the only members of the Moya Five to remain in La Fura -- is involved with "Manes"; Miki Espuma is concentrating on composition; and Hansel Cereza, Jurgen Muller and Pep Gatelli are currently preparing new shows.
Mr. Padrissa and Mr. Olle have evidently taken to musical theater, having already directed Debussy's "Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian" as well as Falla's "Atlantida." After "The Damnation of Faust" in Salzburg next year, they have also been invited to direct a new opera based on Cervantes' "Don Quixote" to be presented in Barcelona's opera house, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, in 2000 (the opera house, which burned down in 1994, is being rebuilt and will reopen for the 1999-2000 season).
"We'd next like to do a movie version of 'Faust,' " Mr. Olle noted. "We'd like to have done 'Faust' in three forms -- opera, theater and cinema."
After New York, though, "F@ust, Version 3.0" should still have a long life ahead of it. Traditionally, La Fura's pieces tour for at least three years, and this production already has dates in a score of Spanish cities through May. What is different about it, though, is that it appears to be drawing a slightly older, perhaps more staid, audience than some of the company's wilder earlier shows.
"Some people were a bit put off by the way we would engage the audience by wandering and performing among them," Mr. Olle said with a laugh. "I think they feel a bit safer now."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Golf-Course Growth Raises Environmental Issues

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THE huge popularity of golf is concerning environmentalists and conservationists in Connecticut. Proposals for new golf courses on environmentally sensitive land, most paired with housing developments, are being prepared around the state.
At the end of last year the state had 183 courses for its 169 towns. Twelve new courses have been proposed, almost 12 more are being planned, and at least seven are being expanded. New proposals are being announced so rapidly here and around the country that the National Golf Foundation in Jupiter, Fla., is scrambling to keep track, a spokeswoman for the group, Judy Thompson, said. 
 One reason for the activity, said Jeffrey R. Dugas, president of Wellspeak, Dugas & Kane, a real estate and golf course consultant in Cheshire, is that "the investment community is seeing that golf is a viable real estate investment."
"The baby boomers are getting older," Mr. Dugas said, "and older people have more time for golf, creating a demand."
Two-thirds of the proposals for new courses are not attached to housing developments, he said. Eight of the 12 proposed in Connecticut, however, have 44 to 264 housing units included in their plans.
"We are playing catch-up to supply the huge demand that began in the late 80's and was damped down by the recession," said Chad Ritterbush, a spokesman for the Chicago-based Society of Golf Course Architects. "The reason golf and housing are such a strong combination is that people like living on golf courses, even if they don't play. You have a beautiful view that you don't have to maintain, and economically these houses hold their value better than most.
"More municipalities want to provide golf courses as amenities," Mr. Ritterbush said, "making use of land that is not much use for anything else. In fact, golf courses have been saluted for preserving green space. Normally they are disputed for environmental reasons. But golf course superintendents are better at dispensing fertilizers and pesticides than homeowners."
That idea was not accepted in two Connecticut towns that have examined plans for courses. Last month a plan for a course and 100 $1 million houses on 730 acres of excess watershed in Easton was aborted when the state, the Aspetuck Land Trust, the Nature Conservancy and the Audubon Society agreed to buy the site for open space. The state will use a $160 million fund for acquiring open space.
In Branford the Representative Town Meeting refused to sell a town parcel to be combined with parcels of unused watershed and private property for a golf course and 44 luxury houses. A grass-roots movement is under way to buy the tracts for open space.
"We intervened in the Branford case," said Carolee Hall, a lawyer at the Connecticut Fund for the Environment in New Haven, "because the golf course was proposed on a site where it would fragment 1,200 acres of undeveloped open space, an unusually large piece for Connecticut. It would have taken about two-thirds of it, displacing all species of birds, animals, amphibians and plants dependent on that habitat."
"The state, Audubon, and open-space groups agree that a golf course is not the same as open space," Ms. Lee said, adding that it was increasingly difficult to find sites for courses in a small state like Connecticut without harming the environment.
Development commissions, town officials and some residents see courses as a way to broaden tax bases without major strain on municipal services, even when accompanied by housing. People who can afford the high prices of golf course houses are rarely first-time buyers with schoolchildren.
"Our economic development commission views a golf course as a life-enhancement issue," said Harry Eberhart, Town Planner in Haddam, which has rejected a course two times and is reviewing the plans again. "You will never be over-golf-coursed in Connecticut. You can't get tee time anywhere."
"I think a golf course is a wonderful amenity for the community" said Mayor Arthur J. Peitler of New Milford, the largest and one of the fastest growing municipalities in the state, covering 64.8 square miles.
The United Water Company is planning a course and 75 houses on 350 acres of excess watershed in New Milford that the utility had planned to develop entirely with housing. But Mr. Peitler, whose town has one course, suggested an additional one, he said, as a way to avoid overdevelopment and preserve open space.
But opposition is mounting over concerns that United Water is withholding 13 acres on which it could build 75 additional housing units, said Roger Moretz, co-chairman of Common Sense, a homeowners' group opposed to the course.
"The town has already approved up to 950 new homes," Mr. Moretz said. "At this rate the new high school under construction will be obsolete before it's finished."
The utility is also decommissioning four reservoirs at the site while planning to increase the population.
ULTIMATELY, the State Department of Public Utility Control determines whether watershed land proposed for development is required for service to customers.
"Many of the companies have sold off large tracts," a spokeswoman for the department, Beryl Lyons, said. "With modern filtration systems they don't need to hold as much land as they used to."
One designation that many people find troublesome in terms of water needs, Class 3, "is up for debate," said Environmental Protection Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque Jr. "The Legislature determined it to be surplus and established the right of first refusal to the state and municipality."
Class 3 lands "have no impact on drinking water," said Dr. Gerald Iwan, Water Supplies Chief in the State Public Health Department. "Water companies can do what they like with them, within local zoning regulations."
Several towns have turned to the Connecticut Environmental Review Team, a quasigovernmental agency in Haddam that gauges environmental effects. The agency is reviewing plans for golf courses in Branford, Haddam, Harwinton, Hebron, Litchfield, Middlefield, Middletown and Milford, among other areas.
"Our reports are nonregulatory," said Elaine Sych, the head of the team, "part of a federally sponsored program in research, conservation and development, with funding coming through the state. Many calls come from concerned citizens seeking assistance.
"A lot of golf courses are going in where people have private wells," she said, "and they are concerned about contamination from pesticides or changes in drainage and irrigation, creation of ponds and the digging of new wells, wondering how much water will be used."
Plans for the Great River Golf Course and 234 houses in Milford and a section of Orange would cover 265 acres next to the Housatonic in an area that requires sewers.
A builder from Middletown, Robert Fusari, wants to erect 80 of the 360 houses in his Riverbend development on a 163-acre golf course proposed by Mark Quattro, another local developer.
Middletown has already approved a 160-acre course on private land at Pistol Creek.
In Wallingford, 158 acres of a former town-owned watershed are in neighboring Durham, which is eager to buy the site because it fears that Wallingford will sell it to a developer for housing, creating a tax burden for Durham. "We would keep it in open space or develop it as a limited golf-training facility for junior golfers," Mayor Raymond Kalinowski of Durham said.
In other situations, a retired wine importer, Frederick S. Wildman, has put his 462-acre dairy farm in Colebrook up for sale, asking $2.9 million. "It can support a golf course and 94 houses under zoning," said Mr. Wildman, who is ailing.
Robert J. Ferrarotti, a developer who wants to build a municipal course on 163 acres in Harwinton, sued the town's inland wetlands commission in April in Superior Court in Litchfield. The commission approved his application, but attached conditions that he said made construction impossible.
In Litchfield an application is to be submitted to the wetlands commission this summer for a course, with no housing, on a former dairy farm. A reconfigured plan for a course and, possibly, housing on 250 acres has been submitted in East Lyme.
East Haddam is one of the few towns to approve a course, with 55 housing units, in an environmentally sensitive area, subject to obtaining a state permit.
"We have an interest in the need for future water supplies," Commissioner Rocque said. "And it's hard for a large-scale development to go forward without somebody calling us who objects to it. From a regulatory standpoint we have pretty good standards. Currently we are less concerned about surface-water supplies than ground water contaminated by gas stations, dry-cleaning establishments and other sources."

In a Healthy Economy, a Squeeze in Retail Space

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THIS year is shaping up to be another good one for New Jersey's retail sector, giving rise to a burst of new and renovated shopping-center projects across the state.
A robust economy continues to increase consumer spending, and financing for development is available. Some retailers are consolidating or closing stores, but others are expanding and new ones are entering the state. This has resulted in an increase in demand for space at a time when the vacancy rate in the 11-county northern and central New Jersey market is low, developers and industry analysts said. 
 Underscoring the activity are four projects, together totaling 1.3 million square feet of new and renovated space, that are moving forward or are soon to begin in Clifton, Bridgewater, Riverdale and North Brunswick.
"What we are seeing now are development deals coming on line after two very strong retail years with the growth spurred by a number of aggressive retail tenants," said Matthew Harding, senior vice president of Levin Management, based in North Plainfield.
His concern, which manages some 4.6 million square feet of retail space in New Jersey, puts the retail vacancy rate in centers in northern and central New Jersey, excluding regional malls, at 5 percent, down from 7 percent last year.
Ted Kraus, who heads TKL/The Dealmakers, a retail consulting firm in Mercerville, puts the vacancy rate even lower, at 3 percent. "Despite the competition Jersey continues to be a great retail state because of the vast amount of shoppers and buying power that exists here," he said. He added, however, that the upshot was that "weak tenants shall perish."
The Rickel Home Center chain, for example, filed for bankruptcy last year and closed its 53 stores, 42 of them in New Jersey. Most, however, have since been leased by Staples, the office-supply retailer. At the same time Lowe's, another home-improvement chain, based in North Wilkesboro, N.C., is making a foray into the state with a store planned as part of a 421,000-square-foot shopping center under way in Piscataway, while Home Depot continues to add new stores. Over the last 18 months Home Depot opened seven stores and plans to open three more by next July for a total of 29 in the state, said Katrina Blauvelt, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based chain.
Meanwhile, other "big box" retailers like Wal-Mart and Target, the discount department store chain and a relative newcomer, are also expanding in the state. Their growth, in turn, has pushed up rents; Mr. Harding of Levin said the rents have risen 5 to 8 percent over the last year depending on store size. Large blocks of 100,000 square feet or more average about $15 per square foot a year, up 7 percent from 1997, he said. He added, however, that while he does not see "any abrupt changes in the market in the near future there could be flattening in rent increases."
The amount of retail space in the state has also increased, putting some downward pressure on retailers' sales volume. Data compiled by Grubb & Ellis, the national commercial brokerage, show 144 million square feet of space in 1994 in all shopping centers, excluding regional malls, with retailers averaging $150 a square foot in annual sales. As of Jan. 1, 1998, the latest figures available, there were 158 million square feet and retailers were averaging $139 a square foot in sales.
Despite the fact that retailers are making less money, they continue to open stores, "keeping the market healthy," said Jerry Putterman, senior vice president at the West Orange office of Grubb & Ellis. But, he said, if interest rates rise and money gets tight there "could be a real reversal, spurring more consolidations within the industry."
Until then, construction continues. Brokers said that along with big-box retailers the big space takers are supermarkets and movie theaters. They are being constructed in free-standing locations like the one on West Central Boulevard in Palisades Park where a 65,000-square-foot Shop Rite opened last month or they are moving into key spots within retail centers, often as anchors.
BUT sites for new centers are becoming more difficult to find, prompting the recycling of land once occupied by industrial or office buildings into retail use. In the process "new retail pockets," are being created, said Arthur E. Weiss, senior retail associate at the Teaneck office of CB Richard Ellis, the national commercial brokerage. The creation of such a location, he said, is occurring on 33 acres along Route 3 in Clifton.
There, a 285,000-square-foot retail-entertainment center is rising on 11 acres formerly occupied by Automatic Data Processing offices and 22 acres of the adjacent 62-acre property once used by ITT for its headquarters. Called Clifton Commons, it is the first phase of a larger 73-acre mixed-use project planned by Related Retail Corporation, an affiliate of the Related Companies, a large Manhattan development company.
"The site is the hole in the retail doughnut between Paramus, Secaucus and Wayne," said James M. Jarosik, executive vice president at Related Retail, adding that whatever the market, "having land with frontage along Route 3 is irreplaceable."
Clifton Commons, scheduled for completion next spring, has been nearly fully preleased and will be anchored by an 80,000-square-foot, 16-screen General Cinema complex along with a 65,000-square-foot Edwards supermarket, 130,000 square feet of stores and two restaurants. Eventually, the remaining 40 acres, now home to a 950,000-square-foot building that the avionics division of ITT Industries has leased back from Related Retail until 2002, will also be redeveloped into up to 1 million square feet of hotel, housing and additional retail uses, said Mr. Jarosik.
In Riverdale, construction is under way on a 240,000-square-foot open-air retail strip that replaces a former swim club on 35 acres along Route 23, one-half mile north of Interstate 287.
The center -- where Staples, Home Depot and BJ's Warehouse Club have signed on as tenants -- is being developed by Starwood Heller L.L.C., a joint venture of Heller Enterprises of Edgewater and Starwood Opportunity Fund IV, an affiliate of Starwood Lodging of Greenwich, Conn.
"It is a new retail location in a growing area not yet served by these types of tenants who see it as a way to increase their market share," said Todd A. Heller, vice president of leasing and marketing at Starwood Heller.
The partners also see Edgewater's Hudson River waterfront as another retail growth area and are planning to develop at least 250,000 square feet of stores as well as a 14-screen National Amusement movie theater in three projects along River Road there, said Mr. Heller. A key reason, he said, is that more than 4,000 new residential units are under way or planned at the river's edge in Edgewater as well as nearby West New York.
In Bridgewater, site work began last month on a 625,000-square-foot shopping center on 70 acres at the intersection of Route 28 and I-287 that were once part of the American Cyanamid corporate campus. Bridgewater Promenade, as the center is called, will have a 75,000-square-foot hotel with up to 175 rooms.
"The area is in desperate need of this kind of mixed-used project and the site, in terms of location, access and demographics, can support it," said William G. Krame, president of Krame Development Company of Paramus, which is developing the center in partnership with the Kimco Realty Corporation of New Hyde Park, LI.
Mr. Krame said the project was fully leased to such big-box retailers as Target, Babies 'R' Us and Home Depot as well as to smaller tenants, including a bank, a video store and three restaurants. Completion is expected by the summer of 1999, he said.
OLDER centers are also being redeveloped to remain competitive. An example is the 145,000-square-foot North Village Shopping Center, on 12 acres where Routes 1 and 130 meet in North Brunswick, which Levin Management plans to begin renovating this fall. The center, built in the 60's, is now mostly vacant due to the closing of a 30,000-square-foot A. & P. and an 80,000-square-foot Bradlees.
The work includes reducing the size of the center to 130,000 square feet, dividing the former Bradlees for two or three users and giving the reconfigured center a new facade.
"We're taking outmoded space and renovating it into a 'mini-power center' to attract a few mostly big-box retailers," said Matthew Harding, Levin's senior vice president. He added that deals for that space were being negotiated with such tenants as a bookstore and an office-supply chain.

HEADLINE: Sprint Is Building Huge Headquarters in Kansas

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: OVERLAND PARK, Kan.

 BODY:
WHILE other telecommunications companies compete to pull off the biggest mergers and acquisitions, the Sprint Corporation can claim bragging rights of its own for the world headquarters campus it is building on 200 acres in this booming, affluent suburb of Kansas City, Mo.
With 3.1 million square feet of space -- at an estimated cost of $700 million over four years of work -- the campus is the largest corporate office construction project in terms of square footage ever undertaken in the Midwest, according to executives of Sprint and the construction firm, and the largest currently under way anywhere in the United States. A possible later phase, not yet approved by Sprint's board, would bring the total to 3.9 million square feet with space for 14,500 employees. 
 The campus will provide what Sprint and its employees say will be the ideal working environment for the new century, and it is highly reminiscent of a model that has been around for a long time: the leafy college campus with low-rise, red-brick buildings.
The work that began last July and is scheduled for completion in late 2001 will create 18 four- and five-story buildings, one of them a training center called the University of Excellence; a 175-foot clock tower; covered walkways; an outdoor amphitheater for 3,000 people; parking garages for 12,500 cars; athletic fields, and hiking and biking trails that connect to public trails outside the campus.
Some other amenities will take this project beyond the traditional collegiate model: a full fitness center, a child-care center, private rooms for nursing mothers next to the women's restrooms, "war" rooms, "solitude nooks" and on-line menus from the three food courts. Sixty percent of the site will be green space, for which there is a $10 million landscaping budget. The campus will have 5,000 trees and will require more than six million bricks.
That is not bad for a corporation descended from a little country telephone exchange that started business a century ago in Abilene, Kan. Today, Sprint has 51,000 employees worldwide and had revenues last year of $14.87 billion. It is the largest private employer in metropolitan Kansas City, with about 10,500 employees.
Though best known as the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier, Sprint also provides local service to 7.4 million customers in 19 states, the heritage of its small-town past, and it is a leader in wireless personal communications systems. It is proud of its all-digital, fiber-optic network and is a major carrier of Internet traffic.
Faye S. Manker, Sprint's vice president for real estate, said that many features of the design and facilities for the corporate campus emerged from employee focus groups and surveys and the more than 300 meetings she and others on the project team held with employees.
"In three surveys, we had them list things they wanted," she said, "in terms of amenities, parking, and technology. We had focus groups on retail, food and wellness facilities. We got great questions and ideas."
A video camera mounted on a pole overlooking the construction site allows Daniel A. Euston, project manager for the J. E. Dunn Construction Company, the general contractor, to observe the site from his office in the temporary building housing the project management team. He can zoom in on any worker or any place. Every hour, a picture is taken from the video and posted on the company intranet, allowing thousands of employees to check construction progress regularly.
A 5,000-square-foot mock-up of interior office space has been built in a warehouse a few miles from the site. Serving as a laboratory for office design, it allows the planners to try out ceiling tiles, lighting, movable furniture and other things.
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for someone in the construction business," said Mr. Euston, adding that the real size of the project could be better understood by taking into account that construction costs in this part of the country run 30 to 50 percent below those in the metropolitan areas of the Northeast and California, with cheaper land prices making an even greater difference.
Ms. Manker said this showplace campus will not only bring together employees now in about 60 buildings scattered over many miles of the bistate Kansas City area but "will have a physical presence that represents Sprint to our investors and partners." She predicted that it would aid in recruitment of employees, both locally and nationally. "Recruiting is very difficult today," she said. "It's a buyer's market. With only 2 percent unemployment in this area, we are pleased to see that there's been a lot of attention from potential employees interested in coming to Kansas City to work at the new headquarters."
Before plans were drawn, the project team -- about 25 people representing Sprint, Dunn, Hillier Group, which is the principal architect, and other architects, engineers and consultants -- looked for ideas by visiting 15 corporate headquarters around the country, including those of Microsoft, Monsanto, Ameritech and Sears, Roebuck. Much of the inspiration for the Sprint campus appears to have come from the collegiate-styled Microsoft headquarters, which is slightly larger than what the finished Sprint headquarters will be but was built piecemeal over many more years.
Ms. Manker said that a high-rise headquarters was ruled out "because communication doesn't happen as well when offices are vertical instead of horizontal." She also said the elevators will not be of the high-speed variety because the planners want to encourage employees to use the stairs, which is seen as another way to ease communication.
AS it occupies the new campus, Sprint will vacate 2.5 million square feet of leased space in several steps beginning August 1999 and continuing into 2002.
Many people involved in real estate in Kansas City and the suburbs fear that those vacancies will have an adverse effect on local real estate prices. Ms. Manker argued, however, that any damage will be temporary because the space is widely dispersed, most of it in areas with strong and growing demand for class A office space.
Beyond the question of the vacated space, however, Sprint's move is expected to give a huge boost to the already nonstop commercial and real estate development in the area surrounding the campus for several miles. Mr. Euston said at least five hotels are scheduled for construction or in the planning stages near the campus. Residential realtors said that many homes in nearby subdivisions, where most of the houses are 3,000 square feet and up, are being sold to Sprint employees. The upscale Town Center Plaza shopping area, with 73 shops, restaurants and theaters in 750,000 square feet, opened last year across the street from the eastern boundary of the Sprint site.
Mr. Euston said that 300 to 400 construction workers are now on the site, where three office buildings and four parking garages are under construction. By fall, he said, at least 12 buildings will be under construction, as the work force reaches 1,000. It will remain at that level for more than a year.
Noting the serious shortage of skilled construction workers in Kansas City and many areas of the country, he said it would be a constant juggling act to coordinate Sprint's lease expirations in existing buildings with the availability of craftsmen to complete new buildings.
Even cement, he said, is in short supply nationwide, with contractors in some areas able to pour cement only four days a week. Sprint has dealt with that problem by setting up its own cement plant at the site.
These headaches may help explain why Ms. Manker, even after talking about how exhilarating it was to work on such an ambitious project, said the wall chart that plots the progress of the undertaking had sometimes been referred to as the "wall of pain."

The company is now building a 3.1 million square foot complex, with plans to then enlarge it by another 800,000 square feet. When completed, as shown here, it will accommodate 14,500 employees and include an outdoor amphitheater for 3,000.

HEADLINE: Setbacks Challenge The Hudson

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
SO far, 1998 has been a long and dispiriting year for the Hudson River.
The first worrisome news came in February, when the Federal Environmental Protection Agency delayed its long-awaited decision on the cleanup of the river -- putting off until 2001 a decision on whether to order General Electric to remove polychlorinated biphenyls from a 200-mile stretch of the river, which is one of the largest Superfund sites in the United States. 
 Then the corporation -- on the defensive for dumping the industrial contaminant in the river from 1947 to 1977 -- started publicly challenging Government findings that linked the PCB's to an increased risk of cancer. At an April stockholders' meeting, John F. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Fairfield-based G.E., told the audience that new research indicated that the contaminants, long thought to be carcinogens, had no adverse health effects on humans.
And last month, New York State, bogged down by internal conflicts, failed to approve this year's allotment for the Hudson River Estuary Management Plan, a program that for 13 years has coordinated environmental work along the river. An initial $6 million for the plan in the budget was vetoed by Gov. George E. Pataki, and a separate bill, which followed, failed in the State Assembly.
"The Hudson River has become a victim of politics," John Cronin, executive director of Hudson Riverkeeper, a nonprofit environmental group based in Garrison, observed ruefully last week. "It is a sad state of affairs."
Against this somber backdrop of disappointments, many Hudson River advocates now await President Clinton's announcement, expected later this month, on the 10 waterways to be designated as American Heritage Rivers. A White House advisory committee has recommended that the Hudson be included in the program, which would encourage efforts for environmental protection, economic development and cultural and historic preservation.
"It is a bitter irony that these setbacks have occurred on the eve of the President's declaration," Mr. Cronin said. "We've always assumed that the Hudson would get its due, but the truth is that we have to continue to fight for every inch of the river every inch of the time." Perhaps the blow that struck hardest this spring and hit closest to home for those active on behalf of the river was the loss of state financing for the Hudson River Estuary Management Plan.
"What had not been a partisan issue became one," Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh and chairman of the Assembly's Environment Committee, said, bristling over the defeat of one of his pet environmental projects. Mr. Brodsky observed that the two separate estuary plan proposals -- in the budget and in a separate bill -- failed even in a year "when the state government is flush with cash."
The Hudson is the last estuary in the North Atlantic to retain strong spawning stocks of its traditional varieties of fish, and it is considered one of the richest estuaries on the planet. But as Mr. Brodsky, sponsor of the estuary plan bill, observed, the river's continued vitality cannot be taken for granted.
Studies, including those by the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service, show that between one and three pounds of PCB's a day leach from the river bottom at Thompson Island Pool, a six-mile section of the Hudson downstream from two General Electric plants in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls, about 45 miles north of Albany. The chemicals in turn contaminate fish and move up the food chain, affecting birds as well.
Among other things, financing for the estuary plan included money for habitat restoration along the river, testing of toxins in fish and provisions for recreational access to the river.
"The program was up and running, and suddenly everything came to a grinding halt," said Gary Sheffer, Assistant Commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
While aides to Mr. Pataki and Democratic leaders pointed fingers at one another for the failure to finance the Estuary Management Plan this year, Mr. Brodsky predicted last week that the story was far from over. He said he was optimistic that the Legislature would restore the money.
Meanwhile, General Electric, under pressure for its part in the river's decline, cited a study published last October in The New England Journal of Medicine showing no link between PCB exposure and breast cancer and another Michigan study from 1975 indicating no increased risk of cancer or other health effects in people who had eaten PCB-laden fish from the Great Lakes.
"More than 20 studies, conducted over 20 years mainly by academics, private institutions and government agencies, have shown that PCB's do not cause cancer in humans or other adverse health effects," a recent company publication said.
The publication also said that many of G.E.'s occupationally exposed workers who worked with PCB's on a daily basis for many years have shown little negative effects. "That's very powerful evidence," David C. Warshaw, a spokesman for the company, said.
For three decades, the corporation dumped at least 1.3 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls -- used as a coolant in electrical capacitors -- in the river at the two factories in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls. General Electric has spent more than $150 million since then in a continuing effort to seal those sites.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, General Electric is at least partly responsible for 79 or so Superfund sites in the United States, and PCB's are a substantial part of the contamination at 19 G.E. sites where cleanups are already under way. Most recently, PCB contamination was found in soil around homes near a General Electric factory in Pittsfield, Mass., and residents have since learned that the company had known of the problem as early as the 1980's.
This spring, a group of clergy members from New Jersey, New York and Connecticut that owns General Electric stock began urging other shareholders to press the company to improve its environmental record.
Sister Patricia Daly, a Dominican nun and director of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment, an association of 35 religious orders, called on the company to publicize the dangers of eating fish from the river and to stop fostering misleading studies.
Government studies have shown strong links between PCB's and malignant melanomas and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Some studies have indicated that the contaminants are considered toxic to the developing nervous systems of children and to immune systems. And there is growing evidence that PCB's interfere with the functioning of human endocrine systems.
Sister Pat, as she is known, compared the company's claims that PCB's are harmless with claims made by tobacco industry executives about the harmlessness of smoking.
Although Mr. Welch said that was an outrageous comparison, Mr. Cronin, the Riverkeeper, last week described G.E. as an even worse offender.
"To compare G.E. to tobacco companies is to insult the tobacco companies," Mr. Cronin said. "At least cigarette packs have warnings on them."
Since the early 1990's, the State Health Department and the State Department of Environmental Conservation have advised against eating more than one meal a month of a dozen types of fish caught in the Hudson south of Catskill. Children younger than 15 and women of childbearing age have been advised to eat none.
Nevertheless, favorite fishing sites throughout the county -- like City Pier in Yonkers and Croton Point Park -- remain crowded. And a 1992 study completed by the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a nonprofit group in Poughkeepsie, showed that despite regular warnings from the state, most Hudson River fishermen continue to eat PCB-contaminated fish because they are either unaware of the risks or they do not care.
Mr. Cronin said that in light of many of the health concerns, G.E. had undertaken a "brazen and irresponsible campaign" to discount studies implicating PCB's.
He also said that the Environmental Protection Agency, in delaying a decision on the cleanup, "had lost its political nerve" and was, at least for the moment, capitulating to a large corporation.
Cara Lee, the environmental director of Scenic Hudson, a nonprofit environmental group based in Poughkeepsie, said she believed the E.P.A. had "buckled under pressure."
She also observed that the delay -- "a big setback," as she described it -- had effectively pushed the decision on whether to remove the PCB's to the next Administration.
"And if it goes to then, it could be another five, six or even eight years until something is done," she said.
But Carol M. Browner, the Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, denied that General Electric had influenced her decision to study the cleanup issue further. "No large corporation has ever gotten to me," she said.
She said the delay was necessary to prepare an airtight scientific case for PCB removal, because General Electric would most likely challenge a cleanup order in court.
At the invitation of Mr. Brodsky, Ms. Browner was to speak at a hearing of the State Assembly's Environment Committee on Thursday -- "to set the record straight about the misinformation being put forward by G.E.," she said.
Governor Pataki, in two letters this year to Ms. Browner, urged the agency to move speedily ahead on deciding a course of remediation for the river.
"The Hudson River is important to all New Yorkers who enjoy its tremendous beauty and diversity," the Governor wrote. He said that in addition to state efforts to clean up the Hudson, many river communities were undertaking waterfront revitalization efforts now that state grants are available under the state's 1996 Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act and the Environmental Protection Fund.
Mr. Pataki said that while the state and New York's municipalities continued to move ahead, the Environmental Protection Agency was dragging its feet.
To remove the PCB's, most of which are in scattered spots in the river's sediment, General Electric would most likely have to dredge the river bottom. Costs for that could run as high as $2 billion. But the company has maintained that removing the PCB's might only stir up the contaminants and cause more harm than good.
Despite the latest setbacks, riverfront communities are say they are hopeful that the Hudson will run clean again and that they will be able to profit from tourism and recreation -- luring sightseers to historic sites, orchards, vineyards and picturesque villages along the shoreline.
"It's not all bad news," said Robert W. Elliott, Supervisor of Croton-on-Hudson and chairman of Historic River Towns, an economic effort linking communities from Yonkers to Peekskill.
"We'll lobby hard for the Estuary Management Plan -- it's not sitting on a shelf," said Mr. Elliott, who is also on the advisory board of the estuary plan. "We're also optimistic about the Heritage River designation, and we're moving ahead to restore our waterfronts."
In a related activity, the county's Planning Department sponsored a conference called "Waterfront Planning in the Post-Industrial Age" on June 16 at Marymount College in Tarrytown. The participants looked at current and proposed development along 49 miles of the river in Westchester, long-range planning, boat launches and marinas, ferry routes and development opportunities.

BRUCE RATNER made a big splash when he moved the 7.2-million-pound Empire Theater 170 feet on 42d Street to serve as an anchor for the entertainment and retail complex he is now building.
Cameras recorded the event as balloons resembling the comedians Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, who met at the theater while it was called the Eltinge, appeared to tug the building westward. 
 Mr. Ratner has other high profile Manhattan developments in the works as well. He is seeking approval to build a hotel on 41st Street over the complex and is about to break ground on an 460-room Embassy Suites hotel in Battery Park City.
While such projects have brought the former Commisioner of the city's Department of Consumer Affairs public attention, he has been quietly working at another, perhaps more significant, task -- developing modern retail and entertainment centers in the populous, but underserved, boroughs of the city outside of Manhattan.
Mr. Ratner, whose company, Forest City Ratner, developed the 11-building, 6-million-square-foot Metrotech office building complex in downtown Brooklyn, said he had become interested in retail development when it became clear that the overbuilding of the late 80's and early 90's would preclude more office development for a long time.
"The core of our business was office buildings, but over the last three to four years we have shifted to urban retail," he said.
"We did not think the office market would rebound," said Sandeep Mathrani, a senior vice president of Forest City Ratner and its director of retail development, "and we wanted to continue development in the boroughs. He said the company had conducted a study of stores and neighborhoods and concluded that there was a large market for modern stores.
"Our study found that there is a spending deficit in the boroughs of $10 billion a year," Mr. Mathrani said. "Three billion of that involves automobiles, so we set that aside. Of the remaining $7 billion, $3 billion leaves the city for the suburbs and $4 billion is not spent."
Brokers specializing in retail development agree that many parts of the city could support large, modern stores whose selections are more varied and whose prices are typically lower than the small stores that operate in many neighborhoods.
"Brooklyn and Queens are clearly understored," said Faith H. Consolo, a senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, a retail specialist. "Nobody thought the boroughs were chic and they were not developed for national retail. But now Ratner has done Atlantic Center and it shows the demand is there."
The development is a three-story, L-shaped structure at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues in Brooklyn that opened in the fall of 1996. Tenants of the 393,000-square-foot center include Pathmark, Caldor, Sports Authority, Old Navy, Office Max and Circuit City.
"Bruce Ratner was the first developer to recognize the strength of the middle class in the city," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty Services, another retail specialist. "For retailers the outer boroughs offer tremendous staying power and stability because there are families with combined incomes of $50,000 to $60,000 a year."
Indeed, Mr. Ratner's own research shows that there are about 130,000 people living within a one-mile radius of the Atlantic Center and that the average household income is almost $53,000 a year. Lengthening the radius to two miles encompasses 437,000 people, but the average household income drops to about $44,000 a year.
Mr. Ratner said the Atlantic Center site had been selected for a replacement for Ebbets Field before the Dodgers defected to the West Coast. "The land was cleared by Robert Moses, but it just sat there for 40 years," he said. He said city officials concluded that office projects would not happen and offered the site for retail development.
The results at Atlantic Center have been favorable enough that the company has recently opened a second center diagonally across the street. Called the Shops at Atlantic Center, its tenants are PC Richard & Son and Sneaker Stadium.
FOREST CITY RATNER, a partnership between publicly owned Forest City Enterprises and Mr. Ratner's company, now has projects under way in all five boroughs and in North Bergen, New Jersey. It has 1.1 million square feet of retail space in operation, 800,000 square feet in development and 725,000 square feet in the planning stages.
In addition to Atlantic Center, some of the projects currently in operation include a 175,000-square-foot Home Depot at Gun Hill Road and Ely Avenue in the Bronx; Maspeth Center at Grand Avenue and 74th Street in Queens, a 100,000-square-foot neighborhood shopping center anchored by an Edward's Supermarket; the Shops at Northern Boulevard on Northern Boulevard and 48th Street in Queens, a 214,000-square-foot center with Edward's Supermarket, Marshall's and Old Navy as major tenants and the Shops at Richmond Avenue at Richmond Avenue and the entrance to the Staten Island Mall, a 76,000-square-foot center with Circuit City and Staples as major tenants.
And if the boroughs outside of Manhattan were considered understored, they are also underscreened, Mr. Ratner concluded. So the company is building a combined bookstore and movie theater called the Heights, at Court and Schermerhorn Streets in Brooklyn, as well as two theaters on Staten Island, Hylan Cinemas, at 101 Quintard Street, and Forest Avenue Cinemas, at Forest Avenue and South Street.
One of the difficulties of building large stores in the city was to translate concepts that were developed in suburban malls to the urban environment. "We had to learn the business, because nobody had ever done it before," Mr. Ratner said. "There were issues regarding parking, security, financing and the micromanagement of goods depending on the neighborhood."
One conclusion was that it was simply not possible to provide as much parking as is available in the suburbs. A typical suburban mall has five parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet of shopping space. In the city that ratio is 1.5 to 3 cars per 1,000 square feet.
Another was that with land scarce and expensive, shopping was going to have to be vertical. Atlantic Center, for example is three stories high, with the Pathmark food store on the first floor and Caldor on the third, with Marshall's and Sports Authority in the middle.
Finding sites in the city is difficult, company officials said. "There are no vacant sites, you have to create them," said Mr. Mathrani. He said the company had videotaped the city by helicopter and identified major street and traffic patterns.
"Then it was a matter of knocking on the doors of people who own large tracts of land and convincing them to sell," Mr. Ratner said. None of the land was being offered for sale when the Forest City Ratner people came calling, he added.
Financing the projects was another obstacle. Since no one had done these types of stores in an urban setting before, there was no track record to demonstrate they could be economically successful. "Four years ago you couldn't gets banks to lend on these projects," said Mr. Ratner, adding that "we went to every one of them."
Finally, he said, Credit Lyonnais agreed to finance Atlantic Center, and the success of that undertaking has made financing less of a problem.
BECAUSE of the density of the population in the city, he said, many of the stores are doing very well compared with their suburban counterparts. He said one Caldor store in the city had $50 million in sales in one year, compared with $25 million to $30 million for a typical suburban Wal-Mart or $20 million to $22 million for a suburban K-mart. He said one of the supermarkets sold $800,000 of groceries a week compared with about $200,000 a week in the suburbs.
One of the advantages of developing in New York, Mr. Ratner said, is that the city has not lost population, like his hometown of Cleveland or Detroit. As people have moved to the suburbs they have been replaced by more recent immigrants eager to partake in the material aspects of the American dream.
"Thirty-seven percent of the city's population is made up of immigrants and it is 50 percent if you count immigrants and their children," Mr. Mathrani said. "Many of them have been deprived of basic necessities like television and a refrigerator, so they have a propensity to spend more than people who have been here for awhile."

Pitfalls In Luxury Decontrol

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
UNDER a law passed in 1993 and amended last year, rent-stabilized tenants who pay $2,000 or more a month for their apartments and whose annual household incomes were more than $175,000 in each of the two preceding years are not entitled to the protection of rent stabilization.
But as a result of strict interpretation of the luxury decontrol law by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal -- and some recent court decisions confirming that interpretation -- even tenants whose incomes are below $175,0000 can suddenly find themselves subject to luxury decontrol and its high free-market rents. 
 "I believe that this is one of the most serious issues facing tenants in the City of New York that I have seen in 30 years of practicing law," said Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan real estate layer.
Mr. Brett said that since luxury decontrol was signed into law in 1993, an increasing number of clients he has been asked to represent have had their rent-stabilized apartments deregulated despite the fact that their incomes were well below the maximum set by the law. And by reducing the limit from $250,000 to $175,000 last year, he said, the State Legislature placed even more tenants at risk of losing their regulated status.
"I've been telling everybody I know that if their rent is more than $2,000 a month they should put a lawyer on retainer and send him every piece of mail they get from their landlord or D.H.C.R.," Mr. Brett said. "And I tell them the advice stands no matter how much money they make."
The problem, he said, results from the complexity of the luxury decontrol law and the inevitable confusion created by the various forms and certifications that criss-cross back and forth among landlords, tenants and the D.H.C.R.
The process starts, Mr. Brett said, with the income-certification form that landlords send to tenants by May 1 of each year in an effort to determine whether any apartments renting for $2,000 a month or more may be eligible for luxury decontrol.
The form, Mr. Brett said, requires tenants to declare whether their total household income in each of the two preceding years exceeded the $175,000 limit. In most cases, he said, tenants complete the form and return it to the landlord within the 30-day time period as required by law. Some tenants, he said, even attach income tax returns to the certification as proof of their income.
The problem, however, is that though the form is sent by the landlord to the tenant and then back to the landlord, it bears the official letterhead of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal -- a factor that could lead a reasonable tenant to believe that the form, and the information it contains, will ultimately end up in the files of D.H.C.R.. As a result, Mr. Brett said, tenants who believe they are safe from decontrol and return the form on time generally forget about luxury decontrol -- at least until the next year's income certification arrives in the mail.
By law, however, landlords can dispute a tenant's income-certification by filing with D.H.C.R. an Owner's Petition for Deregulation. When the division receives the landlord's petition it sends another income-verification form to the tenant along with a request for supporting tax returns. The form also advises the tenant that failure to return the certification within 60 days of receipt will result in automatic deregulation of the apartment.
And that's when things get tricky.
"A lot of tenants ignore the second form," Mr. Brett said. The reason, he explained, is because the income verification form requests essentially the same information as the previous form that had been returned to the landlord. Thus some tenants believe that since they filed the initial form they do not have to bother filing a second time.
Failure to file the second form within 60 days, however, is considered a default on the part of the tenant and nearly always results in an order of deregulation being issued by the division. In some cases it may take several months for D.H.C.R. to issue an order of deregulation. In others, the orders may not reach the tenant until sometime in the following year -- overlapping new income certifications being filed for that year.
"It gets so confusing it can drive you crazy," Mr. Brett said, adding that what is most disturbing is that once a tenant has failed to file a required form on time, there is virtually no way for the tenant to rectify the error and avoid an order of deregulation.
"All you have to do is miss one deadline and you're out of luck," he said, explaining that the D.H.C.R. has consistently interpreted the default provision of the statute in the strictest terms possible.
In a recent ruling that was highly critical of the division's strict interpretation of the procedural requirements of the luxury decontrol law, State Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob wrote that the D.H.C.R. policy places a "heavy burden" on tenants.
"Failure to keep a hawk's eye on the mail for year after year into the indefinite future can cost any tenant the valuable protection of the Rent Stabilization Laws, without regard to what their income may be," Justice Gangel-Jacob wrote. "The continuing vigilance that is required to obtain and act on the form is daunting."
There were no responses to telephone messages left at the litigation section of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal seeking comment on the agency's policy. But Jeffrey Turkel, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said that as harsh as the division's position may seem, it appears to be simply applying the law as it is written.
"There's no question that a lot of tenants don't return their petition within the 60-day time period," Mr. Turkel said. "But what you have here is a statute that says that if a tenant doesn't respond within 60 days, the agency must issue an order of deregulation."
And while some State Supreme Court justices like Justice Gangel-Jacob have found in favor of tenants when it is clear that the tenants' incomes are below the statutory maximum, Mr. Turkel said, those cases that have been appealed have resulted in decisions upholding the D.H.C.R.'s strict interpretation of the law.
As a result, landlord-tenant lawyers say that at present the only way tenants can protect themselves from an inadvertent loss of their regulated status is to exercise the "continuing vigilance" referred to by Justice Gangel-Jacob.
"To me that means that tenants have to read and understand every single document they receive," said William Gribben, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants. "You have to become an expert on how the whole process works. You have to clear a space on your desk, get a nice clean legal pad and make a note of every docket number on every form and the dates when the forms were received and returned."
In addition, he said, every form should be copied and every form that is mailed should be sent certified mail, return receipt requested.
"You have to be incredibly diligent," said Mr. Gribben, "because if you make one mistake, it can all go down the drain."

Amid Glitter, a Down-Home Voice

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: MILLBURN

 BODY:
IF "The Will Rogers Follies" is not about the endearing old charms of the folkloric entertainer, "Oklahoma philosopher" and "poet lariat," then it must be all about the pizazz and the look of a big-time, old-time, good-time Broadway musical.
A mere seven years ago, the original conceit by Cy Coleman, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and Peter Stone affirmed both notions, extravagantly so. Fittingly playing the Palace, Broadway's symbol of vaudeville's glory days, "The Will Rogers Follies" revived the glitter of a bygone era, with Keith Carradine as the headliner and Tommy Tune as director and choreographer, emerging the winners in the show's two essential categories. In Mr. Stone's fantasy, more successful in concept than in writing, Will Rogers is conjured up in the here and now. Fate's messenger, Wiley Post, the aviator with whom Rogers died in a plane crash in 1935, watches the show, subtitled in "A Life in Revue") from out front, beckoning its hero to take that fatal flight. 
 One had every right to anticipate a grand first-class show instead of an enervated retread at the Paper Mill Playhouse here. If there is a theater with the resources to perpetuate the musical with a score, a story and a star, without writing it off as a costly artifact, Paper Mill -- New Jersey's major center for the preservation of unstinting musical-theater splendor and potentially the country's -- is the one. And if ever there was an artistic write-off at Paper Mill, "Will Rogers Follies" is it.
When terrific scenery looks tacky, don't blame the designer, and resist all impulses to kill the moving men. Reportedly transported intact, Tony Walton's original sets span the heartlands of the Wild West to celestial heights. (Rogers meets his wife on the moon in the Ziegfeld Follies manner, and his addresses to the audience are, after all, heaven-sent.) Evoking the polarities of down home, up above, and the downs and ups of show business, Mr. Walton's designs, from vaudeville-perfect backdrops to Ziegfeld opulence, desperately need refurbishing and invite recasting. A streamlined Ziegfeld ensemble may be an economic necessity, but the re-creation of Willa Kim's drop-dead costume designs, credited to Gail Baldoni as costume coordinator, is a poor off-the-rack substitute for designer originals.
Will Rogers, who rose from five shows a day in Cedar Rapids to worldwide star of talkies, radio and Broadway, was a bracing advocate of decency, prospering during the Depression, yet denouncing a country's wrong-headed values, stopping just short of radicalism.
But the political barbs and social consciousness of an American icon are here reduced to tired stand-up, coyly and mechanically delivered by John Davidson, who somehow turns the show's far-reaching settings into one state fair in the throes of a cotton candy overdose.
Mr. Davidson's attempts to change his image, in revisions of the failed 1987 Broadway musical "Teddy and Alice" and a one-man play called "Bully," about Theodore Roosevelt, are inoperative here. Mr. Carradine engagingly duped an audience into going with the show's theme song, "Never Met a Man I Didn't Like," even into walking out humming it, and his replacement, Mac Davis, pulled it off, too. Not Mr. Davidson, who makes us wonder just how many men Will Rogers really met.
Here, as on Broadway, the audience is spared Rogers's toughest comments, like his association of Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims, "who would give thanks every time they killed an Indian and took more of his land." (Rogers was one-quarter Cherokee.) It settles for safe flashes of pith, but this edition stoops to washed-out jokes about President Clinton in China and knee-slapping New Jersey slurs. (Don't forget Ken Starr and Monica Lewinsky and Viagra.) The more unsavory and stale, the bigger the laugh. Give Rogers a revelatory moment ("In an American election, nothing can hurt you more than telling the truth") and he gets no laughs. Can it be that the audience has been stunned into silent reflection?
When the real time to startle arrives in "Presents for Mrs. Rogers," the production's coup de theatre wherein bejeweled and bedazzling showgirls are stripped of their adornments and draped in burlap by a cost-cutting stage manager, the moment is clumsily timed. Worse, the house lights are supposed to go up, in startling dismissal of the feel-good aura of an entertainment for the affluent, jolting the audience into shocked awareness of economic reality and summoning unavoidable contemporary associations as Rogers delivers his hard-times radio address to President Hoover. Somehow the director, Mark S. Hoebee, avoids the unavoidable.
Ann Crumb succumbs to the vacuous role of Betty Blake, married to Will Rogers, "the best husband in the world." Given the showiness of Ziegfeld's Favorite, who is meant to propel, narrate and otherwise invigorate the musical, Pamela Jordan's lack of razzle-dazzle is an immense drawback. But Tom and Bonnie Brackney and the Madcap Mutts are really good. At its best, this production truly goes to the dogs, who save it for the moment.
Lowering the impact of a sumptuous spectacle and silencing the sounds of a fanfare for the common man, Paper Mill is serving up leftovers in a commonplace production.

Should Octogenarians Walk on the Wild Side?

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN 

 BODY:

Q. I am 87 years old and looking for investment advice -- not tax avoidance schemes -- specifically for my age group.
MARTIN FIELD -- Laguna Hills, Calif.
 
A. Hang on while I turn down the gramophone, fill up my fountain pen and grab a grape Nehi out of the icebox. If you think financial planners have passed you by in favor of those 60-something whippersnappers down the block, don't fret. Brokers may soon make cold calls based on black-market lists of videophiles who've rented Walter Matthau movies. 
 And why not? The number of Americans who are 85 or older is rising rapidly: The total jumped 51 percent from 1980 to 1996, and it is expected to climb an additional 32 percent by 2005.
Gerontologists, not to mention marketers, already call this age group the "oldest old" -- an unfortunate moniker that sounds only slightly better than "prime of geezerdom." Likewise, people in the 75-to-84 age group have been classified as the "young old" (though you'll find that many women still prefer "of a certain age," especially if you don't want a hatbox in the face).
Traditionally, many brokers have guided Generation A away from owning stocks -- and toward bonds, fixed-income securities and certificates of deposit. And if we're talking about the money you need to live on, that is probably sound advice.
Take it from Edward N. Polisher, a 96-year-old estate planning lawyer at Cozen & O'Connor in Philadelphia. "I wouldn't invest money in equities at my age," Mr. Polisher said. "First of all, my blood pressure can't take the gyrations of this market and second, if stocks go down, there's no time to make it back."
Mr. Polisher knows about plunging prices -- he was married on Oct. 29, 1929. Nearly 70 years later, he says, he puts his money in Government bonds or tax-free securities and "invests in people" -- in worthy causes like underwriting a lecture series at his alma mater.
A case can also be made, however, for taking some financial risks as you head toward the big double-zero. "The idea of putting money you don't need to live on in bonds and fixed-income securities is ludicrous," declared Venita VanCaspel, a former Houston stockbroker, in a feisty, Ann Richards-sounding, "I love you but cut the cards" Texas drawl.
Ms. VanCaspel, the author of six books on investing, argued that "for one, the bond market, like the stock market, fluctuates, and, two, you'll never keep pace with inflation."
What to do? "If you want access to a certain amount of your cash then use a money market account," she said. For the rest, she advises sticking with stocks. Ms. VanCaspel, herself of a certain age, said: "Pick a mutual fund with a lot of large-cap and blue-chip stocks. Most older people have other interests than the stock market" and thus don't have time to track individual stocks.
She recommended three funds for the older investor: Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors, both part of the American Funds, and Janus Worldwide. If you need monthly income, she suggests setting up a check-a-month withdrawal program.
She approves of buying individual stocks, as long as you have the time, training, temperament and money to diversify. "As we mature emotionally, we tend to clutch our money a little harder," she said, mindful of Jackie Mason's remark: "I've got enough money to last the rest of my life, unless I buy something."
Ms. VanCaspel advised steering clear of options and commodities and anything else with a prospectus that weighs more than the last issue of Modern Maturity magazine. For many people, she says, that means sticking "with companies such as Coca-Cola, G.E. and Wal-Mart -- makers or providers of things that people use all the time."
Owning high-technology stocks can be O.K., too, despite their volatility, she said. But if you want to trade them, she warned, "your timing has to be excellent." She suggests buying through a technology mutual fund like Seligman Communications and Information class A or T. Rowe Price Science and Technology.
Pierre L. Schoenheimer, a New York money manager, has an 89-year-old client who has used a simple, buy-and-hold approach to market success without reaching for his beta blocker pills. The client's portfolio consists of one corporate bond and 13 stocks -- mostly in phone, real estate and banking sectors. All 13 had returns above the market average last year.
James P. O'Shaughnessy, chairman of O'Shaughnessy Funds in Greenwich, Conn., and author of "How to Retire Rich" (Broadway Books, $25) offers a different conservative strategy: Go to the top-ranked stocks in the Value Line Investment Survey and buy the 10 that pay the highest dividends. This will net you mostly utility companies like Ameren, Allegheny Energy, Laclede Gas and New England Electric.
And Ms. VanCaspel is adamant that when it comes to Europe over the next two years, no one -- octogenarian or otherwise -- should sit on the sidelines. "They're doing all the things we did 10 years ago -- downsizing, restructuring, and getting more competitive," she said of the Europeans. "The common currency will be fantastic."
Yale Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac, also thinks it's folly to let dormant dollars gather prune-juice rings. But he suggests pushing the envelope further, into a hedge fund. Such funds can take long and short positions, use leverage and invest in derivatives, thus increasing potential risks and rewards. Mr. Hirsch, who is so coy about his age that I suspect he may know all of Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign song, "Happy Days Are Here Again," asks, "Why not increase your net worth as much as possible in order to pass it on to your heirs?"
For information, you may want to pick up "Fundamentals of Hedge Fund Investing," by William J. Crerend (McGraw-Hill, $55), or subscribe to MAR-Hedge, a monthly newsletter that ranks and tracks 1,300 hedge funds. (800 638-2525, $495 a year).
But before you set your sundial by all this information, consider a man who has decided to invest in his old age by investing in old age itself -- by trying to abolish it.
"Nine years ago I decided that I felt great and was happy and wanted to live much longer," said Miller Quarles, 83. In the American do-it-yourself tradition, Mr. Quarles, a Houston geophysicist, started the Geron Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company in Menlo Park, Calif., whose mission is to develop products for treating cancer and other age-related diseases.
"There must be a longevity gene in every living thing that determines the time of death for each species," Mr. Quarles said. "Or how else would you have butterflies which last only two days and down in the Galapagos Islands, turtles living for 200 years?"
Mr. Quarles is clearly aligning himself with the turtles. He has founded the Curing Old Age Disease Society (713 654-0194) in addition to offering a $100,000 prize to anyone who finds a cure for aging by 2000.
While the reward waits at Nationsbank, Mr. Quarles receives many letters asking him to first send the prize money and promising the cure later. No dice. "I wasn't born yesterday," he said.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
Mom, There Are Two Australians in the Bedroom!

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER 

 BODY:
JOHN and Raelea Sharpe of South Caulfield, Australia, wanted an unstructured vacation in the United States, but on one detail they were inflexible: no hotels.
"For the past 35, 40 years, I've been traveling internationally and staying in six-star hotels," said Mr. Sharpe, a retired clothing importer. "I'm all hoteled out. I hate hotels. I'm contemptuous of hotels. All they're interested in is taking your money off you and giving you a room to sleep in." 
 So they responded to an item in an Australian newspaper, and after a few faxes back and forth, agreed to stay in the home of a perfect stranger.
The perfect stranger -- Helayne Soloway Wagner, of Flatbush -- also turned out to be a pretty good hostess, at least in the Australians' eyes. "She's done everything for us, every little thing," Mrs. Sharpe said.
Ms. Wagner, a 42-year-old former curriculum writer for the New York City Board of Education, has always enjoyed being host for out-of-towners. So many Israeli friends of friends found their way to her Jackson Heights apartment when she was single that she called it the Israeli Settlement. Now married with three children, she turned pro in November when she founded Homestay New York. Her company aims to provide foreign tourists with inexpensive accommodations and to promote international friendships. Matches are based on shared interests as described in questionnaires that prospective hosts and guests complete.
"If I've done my job correctly, each guest and host have something in common," Ms. Wagner said.
This approach puts Ms. Wagner's singular operation somewhere between the bed-and-breakfast industry and student-exchange programs. But at the same time, Ms. Wagner said, it is a business and she wants to make money.
Homestay New York will place 40 to 50 traveling parties this summer, Ms. Wagner said. They come in waves, depending on when and where her press releases get picked up. First it was Australians, then Italians, now Germans. Ms. Wagner snared the Sharpes for herself because she was curious to meet Australian Jews.
Religion wasn't all they had in common. The couple arrived on June 6, the day of the Belmont Stakes, and "I found out Helayne's husband likes the ponies, like I do," Mr. Sharpe said. He once owned several racehorses and still has a share in one.
"He was in husband heaven," Ms. Wagner recalled. "I whispered to Raelea, 'They're bonding!' " The Sharpes wound up staying a week longer than planned.
This is Homestay's first summer season, and Ms. Wagner says she doesn't have enough homes to meet demand. Guests pay between $95 and $145 a night, double occupancy, depending on location, whether baths are private or shared, and how much cooking the hosts are willing to do. There is a four-night minimum and the hosts keep $35 to $95 a night, leaving $50 or $60 or so for Ms. Wagner. Hosts cannot have back-to-back guests, to prevent hospitality burnout.
What about Homestay's expenses? "My phone bill is high," said Ms. Wagner, who works alone out of her home. She helps her guests with vacation planning -- she found the location of Rachmaninoff's grave (Valhalla, N.Y.) for one couple arriving in August -- and that means lots of calls and faxes, both overseas and domestic. There are also many calls to foreign publications, to drum up publicity about her business.
Given the singularity of her operation, Ms. Wagner has legal questions to contend with, too. She retains one lawyer to advise her on business requirements, but as the recent increase in New York tourists has given rise to illegal bed-and-breakfasts, she sought the counsel of a real estate lawyer as well. The lawyer said there's nothing illegal about paid home stays, but as a precaution she may start collecting hotel tax.
Thus far, most Homestay-brokered visits have been in single-family houses in Ms. Wagner's neighborhood, Midwood Park, a three-square-block oasis of lawns, shade trees and wraparound porches in Flatbush. Midwood Park homeowners took to the idea immediately, said Peggy Wilkins, a resident, because the houses are larger than most families need. Hers has six bedrooms. Also, there is a local tradition of renting rooms to Brooklyn College students.
Ms. Wilkins and her husband like having foreigners around to teach their children a bit about the world, so they signed on with Homestay and have had two Australian couples, with some Italians on the way.
The Australian guests became instant pals. "I treated them like, well, better than I'd treat relatives," Ms. Wilkins said. One wife was a home economics teacher, and Ms. Wilkins sews draperies and slipcovers for architects, so they had the needle trade to talk about.
And their husbands?
"Well, they drank beer out on the porch," Ms. Wilkins said.
Paula and Gail Monroe said on their host questionnaire that they were interested in religions, so Ms. Wagner sent them an Australian pastor and his wife. "We're Russian Orthodox, which is kind of esoteric, and it's interesting to exchange ideas with another religious person," Mrs. Monroe said. One of the Australians' goals for their vacation was to attend an African-American church service, so the Monroes sent them to St. Jerome's, a nearby Roman Catholic church with many black and Hispanic parishioners.
The guests stayed in the upstairs suite the Monroes had renovated for visits from their son and daughter-in-law, both Marine captains. ("Now I have to make an appointment?" her son asked.) The visitors ate well. Mrs. Monroe, a caterer, is writing a cookbook, and needs subjects to try her recipes on. Chicken is expensive in Australia, so she had a couple of happy Aussies on her hands when she made them chicken in yogurt-and-lime sauce.
Ms. Wagner hopes to have a Homestay Web site designed by her husband, Leslie, up and running soon (www.homestayny.com). She has visions of hiring workers, expanding her business to domestic tourists and those from more non-English-speaking countries and even franchising her idea in other American cities.
If your place is no more than 30 minutes from Manhattan by public transit and you are interested in being a host, you can call Ms. Wagner at (718) 434-4433 and she'll visit. Clean before she gets there. Offering her a glass of orange juice wouldn't hurt. But whatever the condition of your house, she has probably seen worse.
At one home Ms. Wagner visited, several walls had collapsed, and an old woman wandered around aimlessly; the would-be host never introduced or acknowledged her. Ms. Wagner took the application anyway. "What was I going to say, 'I think you're a little psychotic and I don't think I can make a match'? Maybe if someone said they were traveling with an imaginary friend. . . ."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
When the News Is Bad, Analysts Feel the Heat

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE 

 BODY:
ALL STREET securities analysts occasionally deliver bad news on a stock. But it's unusual when they unequivocally call their past advice to buy it a blunder.
That is what David Snyder, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, did with regard to the shares of the Agco Corporation, a leading maker of farm equipment, whose stock has fallen by a third since March and is languishing in the $19 to $20 range. Mr. Snyder removed Agco from the firm's "recommended list" on May 30, saying the company had often fallen short of earnings expectations since 1996, when it began an enormous expansion overseas. Given that history, he wrote in a summary of Donaldson, Lufkin's stock picks, "investors are not likely to be very patient with any disappointments." 
 But Mr. Snyder went further. He wrote that Agco's stock valuation would likely remain depressed, and that "we have been terribly wrong on Agco's stock over the past two years."
Mr. Snyder subsequently left Donaldson, Lufkin, co-manager of the underwriting of Agco securities in 1996 and 1997, for Dawson Samberg Capital Management, a money management firm. Leslie Thompson, a spokeswoman for Donaldson, Lufkin, called Mr. Snyder's departure and the Agco downgrade coincidental. "A good analyst is an honest analyst," she said. "Mr. Snyder is a very well respected person. We have the highest regard for him."
Mr. Snyder did not return several telephone calls for comment.
Judith Czelusniak, vice president of corporate relations at Agco, said the company, based in Duluth, Ga., had only recently learned that Mr. Snyder had moved on, but she declined to comment on his departure.
Still, Mr. Snyder's downgrade of Agco to "market performance" -- considered a euphemism for "sell" -- was conspicuous because of its blunt, self-critical assessment of a perceived mistake. Against the backdrop of the voracious appetite for stocks in a seven-year-old bull market, a sell signal like that tends to stand out.
"He committed the unforgivable," said Marvin Roffman, a securities analyst at Roffman Miller Associates in Philadelphia. In the "sell side" world of stocks, Mr. Roffman said, "even using the word 'sell' is anathema."
 MR. SNYDER was not the first to lower his opinion of Agco. Eric Hunter, an analyst at S.& P. Equity Group, said he downgraded the stock from "accumulate" to "hold" in January, largely because the company was trying to maintain prices in Latin America, one of its most promising markets, while rivals were cutting theirs. "How long can you maintain that strategy until you lose customers?" he asked.
Others say the stock remains attractive. John Mackin, who follows Agco for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the decline in the share price reflected economic pressures in developing countries that have affected all companies trying to sell costly machinery abroad. His rating on the stock has been a "strong buy" for two years.
Downgrades of stocks have become unusual in the last several years, in part because of a marked change in the role analysts play in a stock's prospects.
These researchers once worked in relative obscurity to help determine which stocks clients should buy and sell. Now, firms compete more aggressively for the lucrative investment banking business of publicly traded companies, so it is in their interest to promote the stocks of those companies.
As a result, critics say, many stock analysts who work for Wall Street firms have grown too cozy with the companies they cover and have lost credibility -- effectively becoming cheerleaders instead.
That may help explain why recommendations to buy stocks vastly outnumber recommendations to hold or sell. The First Call Corporation, a Boston research firm that tracks analysts' opinions on 6,000 stocks, says more than a third are rated "strong buys," slightly less than a third are "buys," and most of the rest are "holds." Only 1 percent are "sells."
Chuck Hill, research director for First Call and a former securities analyst himself, said there was more fear now among analysts that they would offend their firm's investment banking departments or the companies they cover.
"There is some reluctance to put a sell on a stock," Mr. Hill said. "It's tougher now to be independent."
Others are far more indignant about what they regard as a high level of excessively optimistic analysis, which they say hurts investors' ability to gauge a stock's prospects.
"Unequivocally, what you'll see is that today, analysts are like the front guys," said Mr. Roffman, a former analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, a Philadelphia investment firm. "They can't tell it like it really is."
Mr. Roffman speaks from experience: He was dismissed by Janney Montgomery in 1990 after he refused to retract a negative report about the financial stability of Donald J. Trump's Taj Mahal casino after Mr. Trump had complained and pushed for Mr. Roffman's dismissal. Mr. Roffman then started his own research firm, unfettered by possible conflicts that might arise if he were also trying to generate investment banking fees. Mr. Roffman also sued Mr. Trump, contending defamation, settled the case for an undisclosed sum and was awarded $750,000 from Janney Montgomery in a New York Stock Exchange arbitration claim.
Mr. Roffman's case was well known in the industry, but there have been other, less publicized examples. Wall Street firms sometimes lose a client company's investment banking business because of a downgrade, and analysts have been ostracized by a company in retaliation for a downgrade. Sometimes, a company sharply curtails analyst access to management if it deems that a rating on its stock is too low.
In April, Michael L. Mayo, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, was excluded from a Mellon Bank analysts meeting. When he asked why, he said Mellon executives told him it was "because of your rating on the stock." Mr. Mayo rates Mellon as a "hold." Mellon declined to comment.
Even analysts who do not work for Wall Street firms can find it difficult to appraise a company's stock critically. Like others, they try to maintain cordial relations with a company's management to gain access to information that will help them evaluate growth potential.
"We have a lot more leeway than these guys on the Street. There's not much a company can do if we downgrade its stock," said Mr. Hunter of S.& P. Equity Group. Still, he said, issuing a downgrade "is never a comfortable situation."
Sometimes, however, a sell signal can make an analyst a hero. Andrew Shore, an analyst at Paine Webber, downgraded the shares of the Sunbeam Corporation in early April before the appliance company -- formerly a Wall Street darling -- began a plunge from the mid-$40's to the $10 level last month. Mr. Shore was also the first analyst to publicly question the capability of Albert J. Dunlap, Sunbeam's chief executive, who was dismissed on June 13 amid growing questions about the company's accounting practices.
"I don't think I had made a major sell call like this in my whole life," Mr. Shore recalled.
Immediately after he downgraded the stock, Mr. Shore said, he received some "extremely nasty phone messages." Weeks later, he said, some of those same callers phoned to apologize and to thank him.
Mr. Shore said that he felt vindicated but that any analyst who issued a sell recommendation had better be right.
"There's a lot more pressure when you say sell," he said. "Everyone who owns it at least listens when you say sell."

That On-Again, Off-Again Street Plan Is On Again

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
After more than a decade of stops and starts and unmet promises to begin work, it looks this month as if the on-again, off-again greening of Greenwich Street project is finally and irrevocably on. Again.
This time the word comes directly from Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, who called plan proponents right before the July 4 holiday weekend to give them the news. "He told me that they were going to go forward," said City Councilwoman Kathryn Freed, "and that work would begin right away" on the street-narrowing and tree-planting project that has been in the works, in one form or another, since 1987. 
 Officials of Community Board 1 and members of the Friends of Greenwich Street report receiving the same message, although no one knows the reason for the sudden announcement. The plan had been in administrative limbo ever since a round of winter meetings between its advocates and its detractors, notably Drew Nieporent, the restaurateur, and his brother Tracy.
The brothers, who operate the TriBeCa Grill on Greenwich Street and nearby high-profile restaurants like Nobu and Montrachet, were accused by some of "holding the neighborhood hostage," as Ms. Freed put it, to their desire for double and triple parking of their customers' limousines on the street.
This winter, however, plan proponents secured letters of support from, among others, Representative Jerrold L. Nadler and Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of the Travelers Group, whose headquarters are diagonally across from the TriBeCa Grill.
Mr. Millard declined to talk about the reasons behind the restart, although a spokeswoman for his office confirmed that bids would be taken this fall for construction next spring. In a prepared statement, he said only that he had been glad to help opposing parties come to a compromise. (Other E.D.C. officials, however, said the plan remains unchanged.)
The go-ahead was news to Tracy Nieporent, who said he has yet to hear officially of the city's decision. Still, he struck a conciliatory note. "We still think this is bad urban planning," he said. "But we hope now that we're proven wrong." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: In SoHo, as Galleries Depart, Temples of Beauty Are the Show

BYLINE: By JUDITH NEWMAN 

 BODY:
A PALE woman in black stands on the corner of Mercer and Prince Streets, twirling like a weather vane. "Lip liner?" she mutters, stepping forward, then abruptly swings around 90 degrees. "Or polish?" A young visitor from Denmark, she's in hot pursuit of beauty, but she's not sure where to start.
If she walks due west, she can nab a favorite lip liner at Shu Uemura. Then again, a silvery nail polish she likes -- called, she thinks, Obscenity -- is one block south at Face Stockholm. Later, she might have her skin exfoliated to the strains of Enya at Haven, a New Age day spa on Mercer Street. Her tattooed and branded boyfriend stares coolly into the distance, contemplating a nonexistent horizon. This was probably not how he planned to spend his day. 
 Something strange is happening in SoHo. The skin trade has moved in. Not the one Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani fumes about, but rather the kind that plies toners, moisturizers and other forms of hope in a bottle.
"The meatpackers have their district, the financial guys, the garmentos, the flower people -- they all have theirs," said Marcia Kilgore, owner of Bliss Spa on Broadway. "So why shouldn't we have our lipstick district?"
Within the rectangle bordered by Broadway, the Avenue of the Americas and Houston and Spring Streets, there are at least six day spas and nine beauty-product retailers, many of which sprang up in the last nine months.
With the flight of art galleries to Chelsea, beauty has become SoHo's new art -- or at least, that's how cosmetics retailers want consumers to think of it.
The stores are even designed like galleries, with soaring spaces and high-tech installations. And they want to offer a form of artistic satisfaction, which means visual excitement, spiritual enrichment and lots and lots of people-watching.
Why the onslaught? "The whole idea is to get individual brands out of the clutter of department stores," said John Ledes, editor and publisher of Cosmetic World, a trade magazine.
The biggest news along Skin Row, as the new cosmetics district has been dubbed by the beauty industry, is next week's opening of Sephora, France's largest perfume and cosmetics retailer. The first of 14 planned American outlets, the Sephora at 555 Broadway is a 9,000-square-foot behemoth selling strictly up-market brands.
The store's design is, to say the least, arresting: the womblike circularity of the displays; the black, white and red color scheme; the laptop computers (for finding product information on the Internet), and the cavernous space make the store seem like a cosmetics mother ship built by the engineers of the Starship Enterprise.
Sephora is only the latest and most ambitious of beauty retailers to head to the area better known for canvases by Eric Fischl than for facials. Outlets for Mac Cosmetics, Aveda and Origins -- all owned by the Estee Lauder company -- have been around for years, but since last fall, the competition has gone into overdrive. L'Occitane, a skin- and hair-care company from Provence, opened a branch on Spring Street in October.
Shu Uemura, a Japanese makeup artist, opened his high temple of beauty on Greene Street in November. And in May, Shiseido politely muscled in with 5S (that stands for "Five Senses") on Prince Street.
Elaine Good, a makeup artist who has worked in cosmetics retailing and teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology, says that the SoHo beauty outlets are setting themselves apart from department-store beauty counters by offering nonaggressive service. "In a department store, you're assaulted by women spraying you with perfume and almost forcing you into a makeover in an effort to sell, sell, sell," she said. "People are sick of it."
Allan G. Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a cosmetics industry trade publication, confirms the disaffection. "Since the early 90's, department-store traffic has continually slowed," he said.
The SoHo stores are going to great lengths to distinguish themselves in the eyes of consumers, even though almost every one, echoing the industry's marketing catch phrases, says it is "about color," "about choice" and "about creativity."
Makeup Forever, for instance, lures strollers inside with a woman whose indigo toenail polish matches the jeweled bindi on her brow. She sits in the window painting henna designs on skin.
It seems it's no longer enough for makeup to make a woman simply look better. "We're for the soul, as well as the body," Beth Ofier, Face Stockholm's store manager, insisted, echoing the sentiments of many others who hawk blusher.
Perhaps more than any other place, Shu Uemura takes this philosophy to heart. "Notice that everything in this store is circular," said Kim Ryan, the store manager, who sports a circular tatoo around her bicep that reads, "That which doesn't kill makes us stronger."
With black-lacquer packaging for everything from $20 lip glosses to inexpensive blotting papers, all displayed in calming, bone-color cases, Shu Uemura is perhaps the most starkly beautiful of the stores, if the most intimidating.
One shopper, a fresh-scrubbed 30-something woman, stepped tentatively into the store, eyeballed the modelesque sales personnel and fled.
But the creepy Zen calm is perhaps the appropriate ambiance for Mr. Uemura, a man given to pronouncements like, "Listen to the voice of your skin" and "There is a circle to beauty."
Every store has its gimmick. Shu Uemura has a set of recessed light simulation boxes in the wall where the shopper can see how makeup colors, tested on the hand, look in outdoor, fluorescent and other light conditions. L'Occitane uses Braille on most of its packages. "An effort to bring the benefits of natural beauty to blind and partially sighted people," the store's catalogue explains.
Origins is so environmentally friendly that one willowy blond shopper wondered aloud why the green-and-khaki-clad staff members were impersonating forest rangers.
Sephora promises a wall of more than 400 lipsticks, a skin treatment library, organized by problems and solutions, and a fragrance organ, a display where shoppers can dab and spritz at will. "And I promise you, men will feel comfortable shopping here," said Sherry Baker, vice president for international marketing.
Sephora's salesclerks, known as product consultants, are to be outfitted in unisex black tunics, and each will wear one black glove to "showcase the product, like a jewel at Cartier's," Ms. Baker explained.
All the SoHo stores maintain that they are places where a shopper can experiment and play, although the play is supposed to be serious.
At Shiseido's 2,700-square-foot 5S, a mid-price cosmetics line geared toward women in their 20's and 30's, there is the muted sound of running water coming from somewhere. Photographs of ethnically diverse models line the walls. There are magazines to read, and there is icy lotus tea to sip, as a "beauty partner" -- please, not a salesclerk -- materializes from seemingly nowhere to explain the 5S philosophy.
Perhaps someone will one day write a dissertation about this philosophy, but suffice it to say that it has to do with how you want to feel and knowing which products will help you feel that way.
For example, "energizing sense" products are for a woman who wants extra power and firmer-looking skin; "nurturing sense" products are for one who craves comfort and nourishment. If she might want a little of each -- comfort and firm skin -- presumably, she's on her own.
Jacalyn Lee, a woman with delicate dreadlocks gathered in a ponytail, hunched over one of the store's many computers the other day, her brow furrowed in concentration. The computer suggested words for how she was feeling, or wanted to feel.
Ms. Lee hesitantly clicked on phrases like "revive your spirit," "need willpower" and "empowering." Finally, "peace" and "smooth complexion" drifted by in little word bubbles. Ms. Lee eagerly clicked on both.
"That's what the whole world wants, really," she murmured. "Peace and a smooth complexion."
At this point, a confusing array of 5S products popped onto the screen. Ms. Lee ignored them, opting instead for the $10 bottle of Charm glitter powder she was going to buy to begin with. But she was pleased, and rubbing the powder on her arms, she returned sparkling to the streets of SoHo.
Whether beauty becomes as integral to SoHo as fish is to Fulton Market is an open question. "I don't think the single-brand stores can succeed economically," Mr. Ledes of Cosmetic World said, adding that Sephora seems to have the best chance in SoHo for long-term success.
"The American woman has one quote, unquote, failing, which is a love of selection and variety," he said. "The one-brand stores will have a great difficulty in surmounting that historic habit."
In the meantime, the great migration of single-brand stores to SoHo continues. By the end of the year, Helena Rubenstein plans to open a space on Spring Street, which will be both store and day spa. As Mr. Ledes put it, "SoHo is going to be so overburdened with beauty, you'll be lucky if you can find a grocery store."

Minding the Children While on the Road

BYLINE: By JULIA LAWLOR 

 BODY:
THE last time Rebecca Teiken left town on a four-day business trip, her 5-year-old son, Spencer, was cared for by a sitter. Ms. Teiken made sure Spencer had his favorite blanket and stuffed animals, called him every night to chat and counted the hours until she would see him again.
But one thing that didn't trouble her was the cost of Spencer's overnight care. Her employer, Amoco, reimburses workers for dependent care -- to a maximum of $1,500 a year -- when they travel overnight on business and there is no other family member at home to care for a child or, in some cases, an elderly relative. As a single parent who travels often, Ms. Teiken says the policy allows her to pursue a career she loves without sacrificing peace of mind. 
 "When I travel, this is one less thing I have to worry about," said Ms. Teiken, 40, a project manager for Amoco in Des Moines. In her area of the country, the going rate for overnight care is about $50 a day. "I know I can pay the caregiver well," she said, "and that reduces the stress on me so I can focus on the work."
Amoco is one of a relatively small number of companies offering such benefits to employees who must travel as part of their jobs. The Families and Work Institute, a research firm in New York, has found that 6 percent of companies with 100 or more employees reimburse child care expenses when workers travel on business.
In a global economy, travel has become a fact of life for more and more workers. In 1996, the most recent data show, 42.9 million Americans traveled on business, a 21 percent increase from 1991, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. One in five employees regularly takes overnight business trips, according to a 1997 study by the Families and Work Institute. What's more, the workplace is increasingly populated by single parents -- almost one of every five employed parents is single, the study indicated.
Even so, many companies that offer such a child care benefit say that relatively few workers take advantage of it.
"I don't use it that often," said Bonnie Anderson, vice president of employee relations for American Express Financial Advisors in Minneapolis. Ms. Anderson, 49, a single mother who travels once or twice a month for her job, usually arranges for her parents or close friends to care for her daughter, Sashi, 10, when she cannot be there.
But occasionally a backup plan can fall through, and she must pay for overnight care. About a year and a half ago, just before a trip to California, Ms. Anderson wound up hiring her daughter's regular day-care provider to care for her for two nights, and the $50 extra cost was reimbursed.
"This is not a huge economic benefit for me, but what I like about it is that the company wants to do the right thing," said Ms. Anderson, who lives in Robbinsdale, Minn.
Amoco, based in Chicago, began its program in 1993 as it started to see an increase in employee travel. Roughly 160 people used the benefit last year, out of a total of 28,000 employees in the United States, the company said.
"We want to help employees meet the balance between work and their personal lives," said Patricia Massucci, Amoco's director of corporate policies and work-life strategies.
Some employees, however, may question whether such a policy helps employees lead a more satisfying personal life, or simply keeps them on the job and away from home longer.
Employers should consider ways to structure their work so that travel is not always necessary, said Karol L. Rose, leader of the work-life effectiveness practice for Global Human Resource Solutions, a benefits consulting unit of Pricewaterhouse Coopers L.L.P., the accounting giant. A sales call might be made just as easily through a video conference, for instance, as through a face-to-face meeting.
"This benefit is fine as far as it goes," Ms. Rose said. "But there should be lots of options. Having the company pay for your dependent care when you're traveling is not the solution, but it may come in handy."
One business rethinking its expectations for employee travel is Pricewaterhouse Coopers. "We're looking at ways of doing for travel what has been done for child care," said Iris Goldfein, head of Global Human Resource Solutions. "We can't take travel out of our business, but we can make it easier."
The firm is testing a program in its Philadelphia office to reimburse workers for dependent care costs incurred while traveling. For the last year, a new policy in its management consulting division dictates that employees do not travel on Sundays. The firm is also considering whether to limit travel on Fridays.
"Plain and simple, we are trying to get people more time with their families," Ms. Goldfein said. Reimbursing workers for child care costs, she said, is one way of recognizing "that travel is an additional burden."
Some companies, like John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance in Boston and HBO, the premium cable division of Time Warner, reimburse child care expenses when employees are out of town only if their jobs do not normally require travel.
"This is not appropriate for a salesperson whose job is to travel three days a week," said Shelley Fischel, vice president of human resources and administration at HBO. "If you have to go to a conference once a year, you'd qualify."
Some employers also reimburse child care costs if a worker's business travel creates a need for additional child care during evenings or on weekends. Mark Majors, 34, a Chevron engineer in Pascagoula, Miss., was reimbursed a total of $500 last year for evening child care when he had to travel overnight and his wife, Kim, a pharmacist, worked late hours.
Peter Carter, 35, a lawyer for Dorsey & Whitney in Minneapolis, is reimbursed between $500 and $700 a year when he travels to cover the times he and his wife must hire a baby sitter, at $9 an hour, to watch their four children, all under age 7. Though Carter's wife, Dede, is a stay-at-home mom, she has volunteer commitments that keep her away from home on nights and weekends; her husband is often called out of town at the last minute.
 IN two of her last three jobs, Cynthia Ahart, 41, now a marketing executive for a computer trade publication, has been reimbursed for all or part of the child care expenses incurred because of her travel. A single mother of a 13-year-old daughter, Alexandra, Ms. Ahart says she travels 30 percent of the time and has spent as much as $150 a night for child care. One week-long trip to a conference cost her $1,200, with less than half of it reimbursed.
"Being able to travel and being visible is critical," said Ms. Ahart, a resident of Newton, Mass., who will soon be transferring to her hometown of San Francisco. "I hate leaving her alone, but I've been able to triple my income in five years. Much of what I do is sales-related. You have to be face to face with people. Management has to have the impression you're willing to go the extra mile for the client."
Before accepting one job, Ms. Ahart negotiated partial payment of her child care bills while on the road despite the fact that the company did not have such a policy. Still, the strain of traveling has made her want to cut back. After she moves to San Francisco, Ms. Ahart plans to leave her daughter with her parents or ex-husband when she has to travel -- and to be at home more.
"Now that she's a teen-ager, it's important for me to be there," Ms. Ahart said. "My next demand, instead of asking for more money, will be to ask for less travel."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: GOWANUS;
Dredging Up A Revived Waterway

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The muck-ridden Gowanus Canal, which dates to the 19th century and runs through Cobble Hill, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens, has been so smelly that for decades it's been compared to the River Styx, the mythological river of the dead. Many people who live nearby have all but given up hope of seeing something done about the odor. But now the city is set to take a step toward addressing the problem.
The New York City Department of Environmental Protection says dredging at the mouth of the Gowanus Canal, near DeGraw and Bond Streets, is set to begin this week and will last as long as five weeks. 
 The work is part of a $10 million city project to partly dredge the canal and flush cleaner water through it. That will involve putting an underground brick flushing tunnel, which dates to 1911, back into operation. The tunnel, which runs 6,300 feet from the Gowanus Canal to Buttermilk Channel, would bring water from New York Harbor into the canal.
But the tunnel hasn't been used since 1963, when the flushing device, which resembles a propeller, broke down and wasn't repaired. The muck in the canal -- mostly a combination of human waste, street refuse, oil and harbor silt -- got thicker and thicker until it resembled a giant clogged drain.
The propeller was finally fixed this year. But until the dredging is done, the city won't flip the switch to flush out the mess.
The dredging was supposed to be done in June. Why the delay? A D.E.P. spokeswoman, Cathy DelliCarpini, said the sediment had to be assessed for toxic chemicals (trace amounts were found) and an appropriate disposal site had to be located (it will be shipped to Delaware).
"There's been delay after delay, so we're worried," said Salvatore Scotto, the chairman of the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation and an advocate for more than 20 years of cleaning up the canal. "If it stretches past August, we'll just have to start picketing."
But John C. Muir, executive director of the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment, said, "This delay is merely a ripple."
Mr. Scotto's group wants the cleanup of the canal to be the first step in transforming it into a revived waterfront with elegant canal-side cafes and apartments. Mr. Muir's group and others favor bicycle paths and more park space.
Both groups hope to persuade government officials to dredge the entire canal of sediment -- perhaps 30,000 cubic yards, at least 15 truckloads -- instead of the 2,000 cubic yards at the mouth. More dredging, they say, would insure that the canal would stay clean.
Meanwhile, Place in History, a Manhattan arts group, is going forward with plans to raise about $7,000 for a series of viewing boxes to be set up along the canal in August. The viewing boxes would have historical photographs dating back to the 1860's, when the canal was built, to the early 20th century when the canal was an active waterway for barges. ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Some Inflation Protection For U.S. Savings Bonds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
UNCLES everywhere will sleep better.
The Government savings bond, that favorite gift of unimaginative relatives -- appropriate for birthdays and graduations, for a confirmation or a bar mitzvah -- has been embellished to keep up with inflation. 
 Last week, the Treasury Department announced that beginning on Sept. 1 it will sell Series I savings bonds, which will provide protection against a general rise in consumer prices. The interest paid will be pegged partly to changes in the Consumer Price Index. As with the current Series EE savings bonds, holders can defer tax payments on their earnings until a bond is redeemed. Based on current interest rates and inflation prospects, the bonds are expected to earn a real return of about 3 percent after inflation.
The bonds will supplement, rather than replace, the Treasury's offerings of Series EE savings bonds, much as the inflation-indexed Treasury bonds introduced last year gave investors a new option to invest in Government securities. Both offer a way to hedge against the erosion of principal from inflation.
Unlike the inflation-indexed bonds, which were at best a moderate success with individual investors, the new securities may help to revive sales of savings bonds, which in recent years have been losing popularity to stocks and mutual funds.
Savings bonds have a reputation as a sleepy investment, but they are one of the country's most widely held securities. Roughly one in three American households, and 55 million individuals, own Government savings bonds, with most of those investors buying the bonds through payroll deduction plans, said Daniel Pederson, president of the Savings Bond Investor, a Detroit-based information service for investors.
Despite the ubiquity of savings bonds, Americans' holdings have remained about $185 billion since 1995, according to the Flow of Funds report from the Federal Reserve.
Now, investors have a more compelling option for the conservative end of the portfolio, even if they don't believe that higher inflation looms.
"I don't think anybody will say that they'll give mutual funds a run for their money," Mr. Pederson said. "But they can earn two to three points better than inflation."
High-income individuals close to retirement are likely to be drawn to the new bonds. They are likely to want to protect their portfolios from inflation without generating more income, which would require payment of Federal income taxes.
The earnings rate of the new savings bond is a combination of a fixed interest rate, specified at the time of purchase, and an inflation rate, adjusted semiannually.
The Series I bonds will be sold at face value -- rather than at 50 percent of face, as Series EE bonds are -- in denominations of $50, $75, $100, $500, $1,000 and $5,000. Beginning in May 1999, denominations of $200 and $10,000 will be added.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Great Big Bounce For Bucks And Bonds

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Like a beach ball held under water and then released, the dollar popped up again last week. The dollar index, a measure of the value of the United States currency against 10 major world currencies, reached a high on Thursday of 102.46, a level unseen since 1989. The index closed the week at 102.03.
Currency traders, concerned that the Treasury might intervene again on behalf of the Japanese yen and sell dollars, were cautious about the move. Was it a blip or the start of a long dollar uptrend? 
 "We're seeing the birth of a new bull market in the dollar that won't peak out until 2002," said Martin Armstrong, chairman of Princeton Economics International, an advisory firm based in Princeton, N.J., that specializes in global economic issues.
Mr. Armstrong expects the dollar to hit 200 yen a year from now, up from 141.2 on Friday. And he expects the dollar to rally to 2.85 German marks, up from 1.82.
A strong dollar has implications for both stock and bond investors in the United States. Generally, a powerful currency is negative for stocks because it makes American goods more expensive overseas. Bonds, meanwhile, are helped by a rising dollar as investors the world over buy United States Treasuries to benefit from the currency's strength.
Last week, currency traders were waiting to see results of today's parliamentary elections in Japan. But the elections will have little impact on the three bases for Mr. Armstrong's forecast of a stronger dollar.
The first is Phase 2 of financial deregulation in Japan, set for Jan. 1, 1999, which will free Japanese pension funds to invest in instruments other than Japanese Government bonds. Because confidence in Japan's institutions is so low, and interest rates are less than 1 percent, the managers will find United States Treasuries attractive.
Mr. Armstrong says discussions with some of these managers lead him to expect that 15 percent of the $9 trillion invested will head for the United States bond market. That's more than $1 trillion. "The Japanese have the potential to be to the U.S. bond market what the Hunt brothers were to silver," he said, referring to the Texas investors.
This flood of funds, he says, will drive long-term United States interest rates to 4.75 percent from today's 5.62 percent. Funds will begin flowing in January; more will come in April, when Japan's fiscal year begins.
The second prod to the dollar relates to the economic meltdown in Russia. United States exposure is relatively small: of the $70 billion in loans to Russia, 10 percent originated here. Most came from Europe -- $30 billion from Germany alone.
Finally, the dollar will benefit from the chaos surrounding the introduction of the euro, the single European currency, next year. "Capital is pouring out of Germany," Mr. Armstrong said. "They have figured out that the value of the euro cannot be the value of the strongest currency in the basket. So they're moving out capital as a hedge." Where is it going? To the United States.
It all adds up to a mighty dollar and a bull move in bonds. As for stocks, Mr. Armstrong thinks European markets, up more than 35 percent this year, are very vulnerable. United States markets, concerned about the dollar's climb and the upheaval in Russia, may decline later this summer, he said. But Mr. Armstrong doesn't expect a correction greater than 20 percent. "With U.S. interest rates coming down," he said, "equities will recover."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
For Navajos, Charity Begins at the Post Office

BYLINE: By JON CHRISTENSEN 

DATELINE: GALLUP, N.M.

 BODY:
ON the nearby Navajo Indian Reservation, the Southwest Indian Foundation blends the determination of the Roman Catholic missionaries who have been active in the region for decades with the New West chic of trendy catalogues.
But this is no regular mail-order operation. In addition to selling merchandise nationwide, the foundation provides jobs for as many as 60 people during the peak holiday season and sponsors social services on the reservation -- an expanse as large as West Virginia known as the Big Rez. 
 The services include installing new coal-fired stoves in homes that lack safe heating, providing emergency assistance and food baskets to needy families and supporting alcoholism treatment centers, schools and shelters for battered women.
The Big Rez, in fact, is among the poorest communities in the United States. But it is the 64-page direct-mail catalogue, which sells turquoise and silver Indian jewelry, Navajo rugs, kachina dolls and clothing, that most of the outside world sees.
The catalogue is distributed eight times a year, and its circle is growing; last year, the Christmas edition was sent to four million households.
The foundation competes with Arizona Highways, Simply Southwest and Sundance, among others, for home shoppers who are seeking Southwestern fashions. But when someone buys a $19 turquoise tie-tack or a $295 squash-blossom necklace from its catalogue, 65 percent of the price is a tax-deductible contribution.
The other 35 percent goes to cover costs, including paying the local artisans who make the products. Customers can add tax-deductible donations, and about half of them do so. The appeal has transformed the once-obscure Catholic charity into a $10 million-a-year operation.
"We would not be able to do the amount of charitable work we do if it were not for the business," said William McCarthy, executive director of the foundation.
 THE mingling of the commercial and the charitable is among the most visible tensions in the world of philanthropy. The practice is almost always controversial because business operations tend to take on a life of their own.
The foundation has its share of critics. But others say activities intended to create jobs -- nurturing artisans, not merely dispensing handouts -- answer charity's highest call.
The foundation enjoys a sterling reputation on the Big Rez. "When we're not able to find resources to help our clients and we've exhausted our services, they help our clients in any way they can," said Lucinda Waseta, a supervisory social worker on the reservation.
There is also an appreciation for the business side. "That's a project that's generating jobs and revenues for our people," said Ferdinand Notah, executive director of the Division of Economic Development for the Navajo Nation. The foundation has 45 full-time employees, most of them tribal members; in the busy holiday selling season, the staff grows.
It also sponsors economic development by supporting small family-run handicraft enterprises, Mr. Notah said. "The families that are participating with or are employed by the Southwest Indian Foundation are enjoying a livelihood and are contributing to the local economy."
It is hard to come up with reliable economic statistics for the remote reservation communities that are home to about 175,000 Navajos. According to Mr. Notah's office, about 50,000 Navajos are counted among the active labor force, but about 40 percent are unemployed.
The annual per capita income on the reservation is estimated at less than $7,000. But Mr. Notah said that doesn't include a thriving second economy -- production of arts and crafts valued at up to $20 million or people who work in jobs outside the reservation, including at the Southwest Indian Foundation.
 THE foundation, meanwhile, has invested $300,000 in a renovated railroad station in the center of town, last summer opening a gift store, a cafe, an art gallery and a crafts museum.
Some outsiders, though, have cast a critical eye, questioning whether the foundation is a legitimate charity or a business hiding behind its nonprofit status.
The American Institute of Philanthropy, a watchdog organization in Bethesda, Md., gave the foundation a grade of "F" in its latest charity rating guide. Daniel Borochoff, president of the institute, called the foundation "a crafty project" in the institute's newsletter.
"Is it an employment project or just clever marketing?" Mr. Borochoff asked.
He added that the catalogue "paints a glowing picture of the charity. However, that glow fades quickly when one tries to review how the Southwest Indian Foundation is actually spending its money."
Mr. Borochoff said the foundation had not responded to repeated requests for detailed financial statements. The one-page statement of accountability that the foundation sends to those requesting it does not provide enough information for a good analysis, he said, and it lists the cost of buying and selling jewelry as an "employment project" under "program expenditures."
Mr. Borochoff contended that the jewelry expenses should be listed as "costs of goods sold" and be deducted from net revenue, rather than listed under charitable expenses. And in fact, that is how the jewelry business is treated in the forms that the foundation must file with the Internal Revenue Service to report "unrelated trade or business income."
How the jewelry expenses are accounted for, the foundation says, goes to the heart of its mission: to provide employment for native artisans. "This is a philanthropic charity, but at the same time, there is a business element that drives the energy," Mr. McCarthy said. "The amount of money that's being infused into our economy and the reservation economy in direct cash to artists and artisans is significant."
In its 1997 financial statement, the foundation reported spending $5.3 million on "program services," including only $1.8 million for charitable programs.
Indeed, the remaining $3.5 million was attributed to its employment project, that is, the catalogue: $2.3 million for buying jewelry and crafts from local artisans and $1.2 million for costs attributed to managing a business that sold some 250,000 pieces by artisans from 16 different tribes last year.
 THE foundation spent $3.6 million on "supporting services" -- fund-raising, management and overhead. Its payroll last year was $1 million. The foundation says its spending on its catalogue has helped the foundation's revenues grow from $2.2 million in 1987 to $10.4 million last year.
In the last decade, the foundation says, its income from jewelry sales shot up more than tenfold, and its total revenue rose more than fourfold. Spending on program services has risen threefold, but spending on charitable programs -- other than the jewelry employment project -- has increased only 32 percent.
Still, Mr. McCarthy said that each year the foundation has had more money to spend on social services and that its base of donors and buyers had grown from around 50,000 in 1987 to about 80,000 last year.
"You have to spend money to make money, and if you don't cultivate new donors, you die," he said.
The ratio of revenues to expenditures is within the guidelines of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, which recommends that a charity's total fund-raising and administrative costs not exceed 50 percent of total income.
"I don't see anything of particular concern," said Bennett Weiner, director of the council's philanthropic advisory services, which is analyzing the statements.
Other experts note that customary guidelines don't always assess the impact of charities like the foundation.
"A lot of nonprofits are hybrids," said Ann Kaplan, research director of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. "To me, this looks like a good organization. They're not making a huge profit on selling jewelry. They're using that as a way to reach out to other people."
The Southwest Indian Foundation occupies an old two-story brick building in downtown Gallup, a dusty windblown strip of a town, with service stations, motels and Indian jewelry and curio shops strung along the old Route 66.
Staff members, mostly people from the reservation, work in a half-dozen cramped rooms, taking orders on the telephone, processing thick bundles of mail orders and contributions, entering customer information into computer files and sending out merchandise and thank-you letters.
The rooms are stuffed with boxes, bubble packaging and shelves with more than 300 items of jewelry, pottery, clothing, books and compact disks.
The foundation was started in 1968 by the Rev. Dunstan Schmidlin, a Roman Catholic parish priest who raised money to build bridges and dig wells in remote villages on the Big Rez and to open shelters in Gallup to keep homeless alcoholics from dying of exposure.
In 1988, the foundation board hired Mr. McCarthy, who switched the organization to a fast track.
He decided that the foundation's mission could appeal to a much wider audience than a traditional Catholic base. "We have all this beautiful jewelry around," Mr. McCarthy said. "I thought, 'Why can't we sell it by the dozens?' My dream was to create a jobs program that could serve as a direct-mail piece and get out information on our other projects."
Like other sophisticated direct-mail operations, the foundation keeps detailed records of each donor's history of purchases and contributions. Both the catalogue and the fund-raising appeals feature stories about the people who benefit from the foundation's work. "People have a need to be part of philanthropy," said Mr. McCarthy. "We try to put a human face on it."
The foundation works with a few individual artists, though much of the merchandise comes from traders and wholesalers.
"Our jewelry is mass-produced but it's handmade," said Tom Elefson, the catalogue director. "The artists who make one-of-a-kind pieces go to Santa Fe. The people we work with are not the great artists. They are the blue-collar journeymen who desperately need the money. If they get an order for 300 pieces of jewelry, they're thrilled."
In nearby Milan, 30 Navajo women work in a small factory that churns out as many as 1,000 kachina dolls -- colorful costumed dance dolls representing sacred spirits -- a week in peak preholiday season. A third of those dolls are sold through the foundation's catalogue.
Julia Loley, 35 and a mother of four, makes as much as $60 a day decorating dolls that sell for as much as $169 in the catalogue. Most of what the foundation calls its employment program -- the money it spends on jewelry and crafts -- involves this kind of trickle-down economics.
The foundation works directly with some suppliers, even providing seed money for start-ups.
 AT the Rehoboth McKinley Christian Hospital in Gallup, 15 alcoholism-rehabilitation patients make pottery for the catalogue. They are paid minimum wage in a program intended to help them learn work skills and move on to other jobs. The foundation bought the kiln and molds to start the operation and buys all the candleholders, cups and wedding vases that the patients make.
"It's keeping me away from doing nothing and being out of a job, which might lead me back to drinking," said Conrad Thomas. Mr. Thomas, 36, paints geometric designs of his own invention on traditional Navajo vases, which sell for $69 each in the catalogue.
He is attending college part-time and works a weekend job as a nurse assistant, but keeps up his pottery painting.
"For a lot of people, it's just a start," said Petra Reed, coordinator of the ceramic workshop. "They will go on to school or find another job or go back to a job after showing their bosses that they're ready."
Ms. Reed, 32, was herself living on the streets and in and out of alcoholism programs before enrolling at Rehoboth McKinley. Now she has her own home and her children are living with her again. "Everything," she said, "has changed."

Life, Death and Real Estate

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
JANET WEIBUSCH, Miss Sarasota of 1980, still has her beauty princess looks at 44, but they are beginning to fray. She's worried about a place to sleep in New York while receiving outpatient treatments for a rare bone cancer in her leg. Ms. Weibusch and the 23 other cancer patients and care givers crammed last week into rooms and hallways of the Bethany Memorial Reformed Church on First Avenue and East 67th Street are caught in an increasingly bitter battle involving religion and real estate. Both sides belong to the same Protestant denomination. Each declares that God is on its side.
The battle began several years ago when the Collegiate Consistory, which handles the temporal affairs of the city's four Collegiate Reformed churches, decided to take advantage of the Manhattan real estate boom. A contract was signed to sell the land under Bethany to a developer, who would demolish the 88-year-old church and put up a 29-story apartment building. The $7.4 million sale price, said J. Thomas Liddle Jr., the retired insurance actuary who is chairman of the consistory, would help build a fifth Collegiate church, probably in a tonier neighborhood of the Upper East Side. 
 "We have a biblical obligation to harvest this economic resource," Mr. Liddle said. "Just as Christ sent out the disciples, we must expand our ministry." This was nothing if not "the power of positive thinking" made famous by the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, former pastor of the Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue. Dr. Peale is a favorite of many cancer patients, including Ms. Weibusch and her 76-year-old mother, Marjorie, who have read and re-read his self-help books through their worst days.
"I don't think this would happen if Dr. Peale were still alive," said Marjorie Weibusch, sitting next to Janet, her daughter, on one of the $10-a-night beds in the dormitory room they share with three other women. "I met him once, and he was so nice, so down to earth. You know that he supported Pastor Bill while he was alive. I'm sure he would help us now."
Pastor Bill is the Rev. William Hanousek, Bethany's minister for 21 years. In the early 80's, an informal custom of providing lodging for patients and families from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center across the street became "the cancer ministry." Pastor Bill said it became the core of his calling. "The stories I tell in Vacation Bible School, like the Good Samaritan, have more meaning than ever before," he said. "I would risk all to keep this going, and so would my congregation. Helping these people has deepened our faith. It's biblical to give your life for a just cause."
Two months ago, Mr. Hanousek seemed ready to bargain with Collegiate and the developer for more space in the high-rise than was originally offered, more money to leave, or another building nearby. The situation was edgy. Mr. Liddle said he thought it was "un-Christian" for Bethany to sue Collegiate over a 1917 church document that seemed to give it a 99-year-lease, and Mr. Hanousek called Collegiate "a feel-good" church unwilling to take on the sacrifices of a Christian life. But it seemed more about money than theology, and thus negotiable.
Last week, though, even as both sides waited for a Civil Court ruling on the old church document, the fires of righteousness flared. Mr. Hanousek said Bethany had decided not only to stay, but also to demand that the cancer ministry grow by 100 beds into an adjoining building on Collegiate property. In turn, Mr. Liddle described Mr. Hanousek as a "renegade," whom he had never seen as much of an administrator.
Mr. Liddle was particularly offended by four young Bethany members who distributed leaflets in front of Marble Collegiate last Sunday, asking worshipers to support the cancer ministry. The leaflets pointed out that any change would be a disruption for patients depending on beds, which are booked through this year.
Collegiate's own flier refers to those patients as "almost all from out of town," which enrages Mr. Hanousek, who asks, "Out-of-towners like Mary and Joseph at the inn, like the Wiebusches?"
Sitting on her dormitory bed, Janet Weibusch seemed perky and sardonic as she talked about her 18 years of surgeries and chemotherapy. She laughed as she described herself as the first Miss Sarasota to reign in a wig; she was bald from chemo. She didn't laugh as she told how the disease had wiped out her widowed mother's savings. In the years she has been Janet's caregiver and traveling companion, Marjorie Weibusch also became a Memorial patient, undergoing a mastectomy. She had to sell her house in Florida to pay for their travel and her daughter's treatment.
"Oh, who cares," said Marjorie Weibusch, squeezing her daughter's hand. "We still have you. That was just a building."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A Hot Fund Stumbles, and the Manager Feels the Turf

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
HE was the toast of the mutual fund industry. Every year from 1991 through 1995, Michael P. DiCarlo, manager of the John Hancock Special Equities fund, handily outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, often by wide margins. Since then, however, the fund has stumbled. It posted single-digit returns in 1996 and 1997 and has badly lagged behind its peers so far this year.
Now Mr. DiCarlo and the fund are parting ways: On July 1, John Hancock Funds announced that he was being replaced as the fund's manager because of its performance. 
 Mr. DiCarlo's exit was apparently amicable -- a rarity in today's high-turnover, rough-and-tumble world of mutual fund management.
"We respect and thank Mike for his efforts," said Edward J. Boudreau Jr., chairman and chief executive of John Hancock Funds. "In the end, though, we believe that to turn the fund around, the change in managers is in order."
What may be instructive for investors was the suddenness of Mr. DiCarlo's fall from grace. He took over the fund in 1988, but the fund's upward trajectory began in 1991, when it returned an amazing 84.5 percent. He then trounced the S.& P. index through 1995, when the fund returned a sizzling 50.4 percent.
Mr. DiCarlo achieved those returns in part by investing in technology stocks, a sector to which the fund is still heavily exposed. As of March 31, the fund was 23 percent invested in high-octane technology stocks, with an additional 38 percent in services companies, many of which have a big technology component.
His goal was to unearth small companies that could grow at annual rates of 25 percent or more. And he was willing to pay sky-high prices as long as a company's growth story was compelling. In December 1996, the fund's trailing price-to-earnings ratio was a stratospheric 50. (That has since come down somewhat.)
 AS one of the country's best-performing stock fund managers, Mr. DiCarlo was able to call the shots with his employer. He left John Hancock in 1996 to start DFS Advisors, a hedge-fund management concern in Boston, with the company's blessing.
Mr. Boudreau agreed to serve on the DFS board, and John Hancock became a minority owner in the company. Mr. DiCarlo at the time resigned most of his other duties at John Hancock, where he had risen to chief equity strategist, but agreed to continue running Special Equities for five more years.
It was around this time that the fund started stumbling badly, a combination of bad luck and bad stock-picking.
"To be fair, very aggressive small-cap stocks have gotten very beat up over the last few years," said Christine M. Benz, an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. "But he's also let some very weak stocks creep into his top holdings."
One problem stock was America Online, which in 1996 tumbled from a high of $35 to less than $12 as a result of worries about possible lower sales growth. A more recent example is the Cendant Corporation, the fund's third-largest holding in March. It has lost 36 percent so far this year, in part because of the disclosure of accounting irregularities. And many of his small health care stocks have not done well, either: Dura Pharmaceuticals, for example, has lost 52 percent this year.
For the year through July 3, the fund has returned 2.5 percent, versus 14.1 percent for the average mid-cap growth fund. Mr. DiCarlo attributes the underperformance to a robust economy and investors' resulting flight to bigger companies. "When we looked at how our universe of stocks has done, we're right in line with it," he said.
 HARD times aside, Mr. DiCarlo is sticking with his high-growth investment strategy in the hedge fund he runs.
"The S.& P. companies are now selling at more than four times their projected growth rates," he said. "Our companies are selling at half their projected growth rates, which are the lowest valuations in 30 to 35 years."
In his view, investors should be ready to pounce. "This is the time to be buying these stocks," he said.
He declined to provide performance data for his hedge fund, Integrity Partners, but said it was "doing well."
Laura J. Allen, who joined Hancock's small-cap investment team in March after 17 years as an analyst and portfolio manager at Wellington Management, has taken over Special Equities.

HEADLINE: A Highflier In an Uphill Battle

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
ROGER N. FARAH spends 40 minutes with a guest at lunch before he even mentions the company he runs, which happens to be one of the country's oldest retailers. He talks with profound affection about his children. He comments about his salad. He spins cheerful yarns about life in Atlanta, where he once lived.
All of this good nature and thoughtful banter are a bit perplexing, because Mr. Farah has the right to be an angry man. 
 When Mr. Farah became chief executive of the Woolworth Corporation in 1994, the company was nearly insolvent. Its inventory systems were so antiquated that Halloween candy sat melting in a storeroom in the middle of July. Its stores were not equipped to tally daily sales, unheard of in modern retailing. Its namesake dime stores were bleeding cash, as were many of its other divisions.
He was certainly aware of some of this when he signed on. But the sheer breadth of what needed fixing was not exactly what he had bargained for.
In a few short years, however, he has reduced the company's overall debt to $440 million, from $1.2 billion; winnowed its 41 widely disparate divisions down to 21 store formats by unloading most of the underperforming mall specialty stores; sold its elegant headquarters building in Manhattan, and, in perhaps his most dramatic move, closed its fabled dime stores.
Just into his fourth year, he has changed not only the company's name, to Venator Group, but also its century-old strategy; for all intents and purposes, Mr. Farah is now running a sporting goods holding company.
Its crown jewels -- Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker and Kid's Foot Locker -- are undergoing badly needed renovations. Three smallish acquisitions -- a pair of sporting goods chains and an athletic goods catalogue -- underscore the new direction. And a proposed big addition -- the 206-store Sports Authority chain -- is in his sights.
Yet for all that, the new Woolworth -- er, Venator -- cannot command the recognition that would seem appropriate for one of the largest restructuring attempts in recent corporate history. And Mr. Farah, 45, widely recognized as one of the most savvy and accomplished retailers in the country for his work at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Federated Department Stores, is now struggling for a measure of respect.
"Clearly, Farah has done things that badly needed to be done," said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a trade publication that closely follows Venator. "But the jury is still out. He hasn't shown results to date."
Indeed, insult has followed injury with depressing regularity lately.
Venator's stock has fallen 14 percent so far this year, even as the Standard & Poor's retail index soared nearly 55 percent. Last year, the stock was dropped as a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, and Fidelity Investments has cast off a large stake, according to the most recent filings. And despite its $6.6 billion in annual revenues, Venator is covered regularly by just a handful of analysts, two of whom have been relentless in issuing unusually negative reports.
There is more.
A large shareholder, Greenway Partners, has taken to regularly complaining that Mr. Farah is not moving fast enough, demanding that he unload more divisions. The proposed acquisition of the Sports Authority was roundly panned by investors, who responded with a mini-selloff. Even worse, an upstart sporting goods company in Denver, the Gart Sports Company, made its own offer for Sports Authority, a surprise that has Mr. Farah's investment bankers at Morgan Stanley scrambling for a response.
If all this sets Mr. Farah's hair on fire (an expression he is fond of using), there is no public face for his rage. "I don't think the Street understood how broken this company was, and I didn't think it was my job to report that to them," he said in an interview in his office in the Woolworth Building, where Venator is still based. "The progress here has been dramatically undervalued."
Yet Mr. Farah's challenge remains daunting. He is pushing ahead with a company focused on athletic wear when that business, largely because of depressed sales of sneakers, is in the dumps. His key supplier, Nike, has yet to show signs of improving its own battered fortunes.
He is remodeling, expanding and adding fresh goods to his 2,848-store Foot Locker division, but is still playing catch-up with competitors like Finish Line and Just for Feet.
Over all, Venator's sales continue to sag, and its profit margins remain weak. On Tuesday, the company announced that it expected to lose 5 cents to 10 cents a share for the quarter ending Aug. 1, and its stock hit a 52-week closing low, at $18.25. It continued to slip throughout the week, closing at a new 52-week low of $17.4375 on Friday. That wasn't just bad news for investors; it knocked roughly 18 percent off the value of the company's $570 million offer for Sports Authority.
All of which means Mr. Farah is in danger of getting some permanent bruises unless profits resume growing at Venator, which is Latin for "hunter."
"I have played Woolworth my whole 16-year career," said Michael Petersen, a portfolio manager with Security Distributors, a mutual fund family based in Topeka, Kan. He recently sold his fund's Venator shares in the face of weakened earnings and margins, as well as queasiness about the company's commitment to sporting goods. "I am a big believer that the numbers tell me everything I need to know about management," he explained.
These hard knocks present a big change for Mr. Farah, who has been used to much more glamour -- and success -- in business. Starting out at Saks, he went on to executive positions at Neiman Marcus and Federated, where he became, at 35, the youngest president ever of Rich's, a Southern department store chain.
Mr. Farah's department store career ended in 1993, when Macy's tried to lure him away from Federated's merchandise services unit, where he was chief executive. But Allen I. Questrom, then Federated's chief executive, stopped that cold, saying it would violate Mr. Farah's contract. Mr. Farah was served with legal papers as he boarded a ferry to Nantucket and, as a result, ended up spending only a few months as Macy's president.
 AFTER all that, few in the industry expected him to roll up his sleeves and dig into Woolworth, a sclerotic retailer whose most famous unit was a dusty purveyor of hard candy and Dippity-Do.
"When Farah came in, people were very surprised," said Kirk Palmer, who runs an executive search firm in New York. "Woolworth was one of those companies that none of us in the search industry ever looked at because, frankly, they were viewed as being really mediocre managers and retailers. But here came this Wunderkind that everyone loved, and they wondered what in God's name was he doing going over to Woolworth."
Mr. Farah may be wondering the same thing, but he says he is optimistic. "I thought it was a challenge to be taken," he said. "I thought there was value to be created."
In that spirit, comparisons to Arthur C. Martinez are inevitable. Mr. Martinez left Saks Fifth Avenue as chief executive to try a turnaround at the beleaguered, unglamorous Sears, Roebuck & Company in 1992. He, too, shut down a vaunted but ultimately unprofitable business, the Sears catalogue.
But even Mr. Martinez, who is otherwise impressed with Mr. Farah, was surprised when Woolworth stopped being Woolworth to become an athletic goods business. "We had a $4 billion catalogue business and a $16 billion store business," he said. "It was central to the history of the company but smaller to the economic picture. The Woolworth dime stores may have been too far gone, but those locations were magic. I think they have punched out the hole of the doughnut by closing them."
Mr. Farah acknowledges that he was not quite ready for how hard it would be to turn around Venator's fortunes. "In my wildest dreams, I was not prepared to hear that I could not get daily sales" reports, he said. "I have made more tough decisions in the last three years than in my entire career."
Many shoppers probably have no idea of Venator's components. Besides its Foot Locker division, the company owns Champs, a chain of large athletic shops, and Colorado, which sells outdoor gear like Patagonia jackets.
The company also runs the giant Kinney footwear chain and the smaller Footquarter. Then there are 860 stores in the Northern Reflections group -- mall stores that sell a casual look that favors items like lavender T-shirts with vine prints and cotton walking shorts. There are two other mall chains as well: Afterthoughts, which sells accessories for teen-agers, and the San Francisco Music Box Company. Venator does 37 percent of its business overseas, an unusually high level for an American retailer.
So what's the problem? In a word: sneakers.
Despite the fact that Woolworth was run like a 19th-century family business until Mr. Farah came on board, sneakers had traditionally been good to the company. For years, Foot Locker had few worries because of its paramount position at the mall, dominating the market with the latest Nike products.
But in the last two years, the appetite for Nike basketball shoes has waned considerably. In their stead have come other sneaker brands and products, including New Balance, skateboard shoes and hiking boots, which Foot Locker was slow to stock.
"During 1996, there was unprecedented momentum in the footwear business because Nike could do no wrong," said Faye Landes, a retail analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "But what was not really apparent then was that other concepts coming along would catch on. And in a mature business, there are competitors who are doing better."
Those competitors began opening stores across the mall from Foot Locker shops -- and typically in bigger spaces. Finish Line, for example, has 5,400-square-foot stores, compared with a 3,000-square-foot average for Foot Locker.
A larger store means two things: more room for suppliers other than Nike, and shelf space for marked-down goods, which Foot Locker was also short on.
"Close-outs are important to moms who are buying shoes for growing kids," said Mr. Horan, the newsletter publisher.
There are other problems. For years, Woolworth let Foot Locker more or less run itself and invested little in the upkeep of the stores, using its cash flow to support other chains.
Then there was the tricky issue of the supplier's upper hand. In 90 percent of retailing, the merchants call the shots. They choose what and how much to buy and put pressure on vendors to pay for advertising, give special deals for large purchases and buy back unsold merchandise. The sporting goods business is an exception. For years, Nike pushed the merchants around, telling them how much merchandise they would receive and when they would get it, often even commanding how it would be displayed.
 IN many ways, Venator's plan to buy Sports Authority is intended to change that calculus because it would help consolidate the fragmented sector. Venator already owns 16 percent of the sporting goods business in the United States. Add Sports Authority -- the combined company's sales would be about $5 billion -- and it would have a bigger opportunity to dictate terms to suppliers.
"As it stands now," Mr. Horan said, "Nike can live without Foot Locker far more than Foot Locker can live without Nike."
In a sign of how difficult the business is, at least a half-dozen sporting goods merchants have been shut or taken over by larger companies in the last two years, and many more may be on that path.
Mr. Farah sees trends in athletic shoes as cyclical and says sales can turn upward on a dime with a few hot new products.
"The business we had to build around was athletic," Mr. Farah said. "Would I have preferred to be in an up cycle when we were trying to grow our business? Absolutely. We will primarily rise and fall on that. But on the flip side, we think it is an opportunity to consolidate the business."
At the same time, Mr. Farah is trying hard to focus on areas of the business that are not worn on the feet. So far, 130 Woolworth locations are scheduled for conversion to Champs or Foot Locker, and the new Foot Lockers have the bells and whistles expected of a modern sneaker emporium. They are larger and brighter, with giant displays and huge video screens to lure customers. The new Kid's Foot Locker stores, including one in Nyack, N.Y., look like giant cartoonlands, with huge skateboards jetting from the ceilings.
But Mr. Farah's background is in apparel, and that is what he is trying to emphasize. Foot Locker has mostly dabbled in the licensed apparel business -- team jerseys and the like -- but will add private-label lines to its mix.
All these changes have not been easy. Large stores with complicated fixtures and features take much time and money to build, and they have opened more slowly than the company had hoped. Venator wanted to have well over 100 big stores by now in the Foot Locker family; there are just a dozen so far. And some company executives are upset that footwear may take a back seat to clothes.
So can Mr. Farah make this company turn the corner? His fans say that if anyone can, he's the one.
Most people who know Roger Farah agree on two things: his merchandising smarts and the almost obsessive way he studies a problem to find a solution. Call up some of the most respected names in the business, the kind of people who do not generally comment publicly about their peers, and be prepared to hear them bubble over about Mr. Farah.
James M. Zimmerman, chief executive of Federated, calls him "the complete deal." Myron Ullman 3d, the no-nonsense chairman of DFS Group, said that when he was chief executive of Macy's, Mr. Farah was the only man he wanted to hire. Matthew Serra, the chief executive of Stern's, who oversaw Mr. Farah at Saks, still recalls fondly how the younger man had the foresight to sell knock-offs of Gucci loafers in 1977, when few stores were willing to try that approach. Mr. Farah's loafers, which sold at half the price of the real thing, flew off the shelves.
"He was a brilliant 22-year-old," Mr. Serra said. "He had tremendous capacity to assimilate knowledge and information. I couldn't promote him fast enough."
Most great merchants are known for their intuitive skills, not their financial acumen. Mr. Farah is said to have both, poring over the smallest details until he feels he understands a business situation completely.
Thomas Shull, who worked with Mr. Farah at Federated and is now president of Barneys New York, remembered his taking a special trip to Asia to personally oversee some factories. His subordinates at Venator say he will tinker with store displays until he thinks they are right.
But there are downsides to all of this micro-managing. "Roger loves to ask questions, to probe, to get into people's heads," said a former Venator executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "But then it takes a long time to get answers."
When it comes to communicating with those merchants and managing and motivating them, Mr. Farah employs some special touches.
Linda Beauchamp, a buyer at Saks under Mr. Farah early in her career, recalled their first meeting.
"I had been looking at Saks as being very traditional, very classic," she said. "So Roger calls and asks me to meet him on the main floor. He walked me through Saint Laurent, Escada, Chanel and everything out there, giving me an awareness of who the Saks customer was, instead of asking me, 'Where are you going with all this traditional cashmere?' Here he was showing me feathered sweaters and sequined bags. It was a nice introduction to Roger's style."
There is tougher part to that style, she added. "Roger ruled with an iron fist in a velvet glove," added Ms. Beauchamp, until recently the president of men's wear at Donna Karan International. "Some people can tell you to go to hell, and you'll enjoy the trip. Roger had that ability."
But that ability, and all the others he may possess, will add up to little if sneaker sales don't turn around. "At the end of the day," said Ms. Landes, the analyst, "it comes down to the whims of a 14-year-old boy."
Mr. Farah obviously has a personal interest in the company's performance. In addition to his $1.5 million in base pay last year and $780,000 bonus, he received 800,000 stock options and 200,000 shares in restricted stock.
But if Mr. Farah is worried, there are no outward signs. After an interview, he went to meet the car that would take him to the airport. He was on his way to Oregon to meet with Nike executives.
He looked over the memo his office had given him for the trip: Portland, often rainy, would be sunny for his visit. With that news, he went smiling down the hall -- he might even have been whistling.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Thinking Rationally As the Web Goes Wild

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IT was a wild week on Wall Street for Internet stocks. But because many of these fledgling companies may be years away from actually making money, the sight of their stocks skyrocketing one day and plummeting the next is enough to make investors wonder if the Internet is paved with gold or just a high-technology version of the tulip craze.
There is not much doubt that people who have been riding the wave this year have done well. The Interactive Week Internet Index, a group of 50 companies, has risen 46 percent this year. After hitting a record last Monday, the index retreated but still ended the week up 1 percent. 
Internet stocks have been good for managers like Paul Cook, a former director of information technology at Munder Capital Management in Birmingham, Mich., who now runs the Munder NetNet fund, which invests in companies engaged in research, design, development and manufacturing related to the Internet.
Since it began in August 1996, this fund, with a maximum 5.5 percent load, or initial sales charge, and $33 million in assets, is up more than 57 percent on average per year. So far this year, it has risen more than 37 percent, excluding the load.
During a business trip last week to the Research Triangle of North Carolina, Mr. Cook took some time to talk about the current mania. KENNETH N. GILPIN
 
Q. What has been driving the big moves in these stocks?
A. I think a lot of it is driven by speculation about who will be the next company to get snapped up by a much bigger company from another medium as a way of buying their way on to the Internet.
Also, I think there has been a bit of a short squeeze on some of these stocks. And there are momentum players who are involved. I hear that this is a retail phenomenon, but I don't believe it. If it is, there are some awfully big retail players out there.
Q. Those sorts of conditions have pushed prices for a number of these stocks to very high levels. What do you say to an investor who either owns or is contemplating a purchase of a stock like Yahoo, for instance?
A. I think Yahoo is overvalued and has been overvalued for a while. But I would not short it. Anyone who did that in the last couple of months has gotten creamed.
Q. You own 50 stocks out of what you see as a universe of 600 companies. Are there really 600 Internet companies out there?
A. I would guess there are only about 25 pure Internet stocks, companies like Onsale, Inktomi, Doubleclick and Gravity.
But the fund is not a pure Internet fund. What we are looking for are beneficiaries of the Internet.
Q. What is your biggest holding currently?
A. Microsoft. And we also own companies in areas like finance, where companies like Charles Schwab, E-Trade and Ameritrade are giving their customers the opportunity to buy and sell stocks over the Internet.
Q. What other groups do you see as beneficiaries of the Internet?
A. Security firms who ward off hackers or insure that a transaction works. Hardware companies like Sun Microsystems, as well as anyone else making servers, like Cisco Systems. Content providers like Cnet. And consulting companies like Forrester Research, Medigroup and the Gartner Group. Those companies will be important in helping others construct their best Internet strategy.
We also like so-called portal stocks like America Online, a stock that has done extremely well. But we also like Worldcom and MCI. These stocks are pretty frothy, but I don't think they are fully valued yet.
Q. Your opinion on Amazon.com?
A. I own Amazon. I used to be overweight in the stock. Now I am underweight. But I think they have a real opportunity to leverage their brand to sell not only books and CD's but cigars and wine, to become the supermarket of the Internet.
Q. There are an awful lot of companies that are putting an awful lot of what they sell in other ways onto the Internet for free. When they start to charge customers for the information, isn't there a risk that customers won't pay the freight?
A. There is the risk that people will not buy what Internet companies are selling. But I think that over the long term, as more and more companies start building their own Internet presence, you will get a critical mass of customers.
Q. Much of the growth in the Internet has occurred during extremely good economic times. What happens when the United States economy turns down?
A. I think the digital economy is decoupling from the regular economy. The price of entry to get on the Internet is coming down. In my view, the forces for the digital economy will survive better than other sectors of the economy in a recession, because it is in the process of ramping up, with its own evolution.
Q. What advice would you give investors who are interested in sinking money into some of these stocks?
A. A lot of information about these companies is flying around out there, and a lot of it is rumor. I would stay clear of rumors. Try to make informed decisions. At the moment, I don't know how many investors are doing that. I think a lot of investors are just chasing these stocks up, and that scares me.
But at this stage it is too hard to pick winners and losers, which makes it difficult to pick one or two names. You should either create your own basket of stocks or buy a fund. That is why we created ours.

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH: STEFANIE POWERS;
Lights! Camera! Caution

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
WHAT was Stefanie Powers, the vivacious redhead who starred in "Hart to Hart" and "The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.," doing as host of a seven-part public-television series on personal finance sponsored by Merrill Lynch?
After all, the public knows Ms. Powers as either the strong-willed beauty in the 1979-85 TV show about a wealthy husband-and-wife amateur detective team, or as the mini skirted secret agent April Dancer in the 1960's spy spoof. Whether traipsing through mansions and five-star hotels in "Hart to Hart" or flying off to a Greek island with a dachshund whose fleas carried an antidote to an insidious poison in "The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.," she oozed glamour and independence, not investment expertise. 
 But there was Ms. Powers, now 55, on PBS last March, advising people how to plan their financial futures. And as a director on the boards of two multibillion-dollar mutual funds, she had some credentials that helped justify her appearance.
If her evolution from globe-trotting adventuress to financial sophisticate seems a bit odd, consider this: In both roles, she hangs out with reassuring mentors, picks their brains, listens attentively to their answers and can draw smart conclusions.
On the screen, she always managed to get herself out of tight spots by the end of the episode. In real life, Ms. Powers hasn't found it so easy to organize her own finances. But over the years, she has learned that asking many questions, even seemingly dumb ones, can pay off if she puts them to the right people.
Indeed, Jon B. Lovelace, vice chairman of Capital Research and Management, the investment manager of the American Funds family of mutual funds, credits her lack of fear in asking the most obvious questions with his decision to start two of the funds.
Ms. Powers was introduced to Mr. Lovelace in 1984, through a friend who worked in Capital Research's Hong Kong office. As she and Mr. Lovelace became friends, she queried him on ways to invest the assets of the William Holden Wildlife Foundation, established in memory of the film star who had been her companion; she is the foundation's chairwoman.
She was interested in investing some of the money in stocks, but didn't want to expose herself to too much risk, recalls Mr. Lovelace, now 71. "Like many people, she had the following objectives: she wanted a good level of income, but also growth of income to protect against inflation, but she wanted to minimize the risk if stock prices went down."
Mr. Lovelace has built American Funds into the nation's third-largest mutual funds family, after Fidelity and Vanguard, with $250 billion of assets under management. Yet for all his expertise, he was not put off by Ms. Powers's seemingly simplistic approach. On the contrary, his instincts told him that many other investors might be thinking along the same lines.
"I remember distinctly that I was at a meeting at Stanford University -- it was about 1986 -- where I was on the advisory board of the business school," he said. "I was thinking about Stefanie's objectives for the foundation, and for herself, and the idea came for a fund that would deliver above-average and growing income with reduced risk in declining market periods and reasonable participation in rising markets."
With those goals in mind, he began the Capital Income Builder fund in 1987. Six years later, the company started the Capital World Growth and Income fund. Each has nearly $8 billion in assets. Though both have trailed Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, they have outperformed the median returns for funds of their type in the last few years.
Moreover, concluding that she made a good representative for ordinary investors, Mr. Lovelace asked her to join the board of both funds. "A lot of meetings drift into jargon, and Stefanie is a very good question-asker," he said.
 AT first, Ms. Powers said, the prospect of taking on such responsibilities weighed heavily on her. But she soon overcame her nervousness and accepted the offer.
"I used to qualify my questions by saying: 'Here is this dumb question,' " Ms. Powers recalled in an interview at her ranch-style home in Benedict Canyon, a celebrity-filled area of Beverly Hills, Calif. Dressed casually in green tights and a green sweater, with her trademark red hair carefully tousled, she added: "I did not do it so much to make them feel better but because I was insecure about myself. Today I am less insecure. I am more able to say, 'Excuse me. I don't understand that, and if I don't, how can the average investor?' "
That kind of common-sense attitude is likely to resonate with many people in today's dizzying investment environment of more than 5,000 mutual funds and rampant fears that the seven-year-old bull market will soon stumble.
If it does, Ms. Powers's ingrained caution should protect her against disaster. She didn't even tiptoe into the stock market until the late 1980's, when she put some money for herself, as well as the foundation, in Capital's mutual funds. Since then, she has diversified by turning over the management of a large chunk of her assets to Barbara Tarmy at Warburg Pincus Asset Management, where the minimum portfolios are about $5 million.
In addition, she maintains extensive real estate holdings, including homes in London and Kenya and a part-interest in a horse farm on Long Island that is about to be sold.
Ms. Powers didn't specify her net worth, but indicated that it was in the area of $10 million. She says she earned less than $1 million on a deal she negotiated for a share of the profits of the later episodes of her best-known project, "Hart to Hart."
Ms. Powers bought her Benedict Canyon home on a half-acre acre lot in 1970 for $125,000; she estimates that it is now worth about $1 million. She says the mews house she owns in the upscale Anslow Gardens section of London is probably worth less than $1 million.
She is also a part-owner of a horse farm in Bridgehampton, N.Y. -- a result of a longtime passion for horses. That passion later bloomed into a love affair with polo, a sport she took up as part of a fund-raising effort for the wildlife foundation.
She and her partners are in the process of selling the farm, but she continues to maintain four polo ponies in Kenya and five in England.
Ms. Powers won't say how much she has spent on the ponies, but they don't come cheap. Judith Balaban Quine, co-author with Ms. Powers of a 1985 exercise-and-health book, said her friend had been "extremely methodical" in keeping down the costs of what can be an exorbitantly expensive hobby. Even so, Ms. Powers described her love of polo as "my one folly."
Otherwise, her financial endeavors have been defined by caution -- a caution with deep roots, including a rocky first marriage at age 21 to the actor Gary Lockwood. While she was making her name playing a secret agent, Mr. Lockwood, she said, played the head-of-the-household role that was expected of men in those days. "He dominated everything and made all the financial decisions," she said, and the couple ended up with "huge debt."
Their most disastrous move was to buy coastal land that was subsequently put under a state moratorium for development. They were forced to sell it at a loss to a state zoning commission, Ms. Powers said. "The commission ultimately paved it over with asphalt and made it into a parking lot," she said. "So much for ecology."
They had also bought houses in Malibu, which they planned to remodel and sell. That investment, too, suffered as a result of the development moratorium.
"When we were divorced, I owed a lot of money," Ms. Powers said. "I was 28 and I had nowhere to live. Luckily I was young enough to bounce back. Not everybody does."
The ordeal left her determined to achieve financial independence. As soon as she got her first post-divorce job in 1970, she bought the Benedict Canyon house that she still occupies and that she has filled with African artifacts and mementos of her trips around the world with Mr. Holden. (Ms. Powers is now married to a French businessman, Patrick de la Chesnais, who spends the bulk of his time in France but meets her periodically at one or another of their homes.)
She remembers to the smallest detail the financial circumstances of that first big purchase. The house, she said, was rented to David Steinberg, the comedian-director, and his wife. "But I put $25,000 down and took a mortgage for $100,000 in 1979 at 9.5 percent. They were paying $1,500 a month, so the rent covered the mortgage. I bought it was because I had signed contracts to do two plays, so I knew I had some money coming. So I took the money from the first job to live on and the second job for the down payment."
 ABOUT that time, her relationship with Mr. Holden began. Mr. Holden, who played romantic, manly figures on the screen, won an Oscar in 1953 for his role in "Stalag 17," but was perhaps best known as Gloria Swanson's ill-fated lover in the 1950 film "Sunset Boulevard." While Ms. Powers was his frequent companion, she was always careful to keep her finances separate from his. She also pursued a doggedly conservative investment course, avoiding stocks and buying mostly real estate.
"I had a town house on Lantau Island in Hong Kong" she said. "But we did not buy stuff together. He had had an apartment in Hong Kong and sold it. I had his enthusiasm, but they were my choices."
It was shortly after his death in 1981 at the age of 63 that Ms. Powers met Mr. Lovelace, whom she credits with "bullying' her into learning about investing.
"Jon would say, 'You can grasp it,' " Ms. Powers recalled. "And I would say that I wasn't educated in that way. And he would say, 'You have educated yourself.' "
While she began putting some of the William Holden Wildlife Foundation's funds -- which now total $3.7 million -- as well as some of her own money into mutual funds in the late 1980's, she waited until 1990 to open her account with Ms. Tarmy of Warburg. And Ms. Powers lost no time displaying the same inquisitiveness that had caught Mr. Lovelace's attention. "Any woman out working for herself and supporting herself is prone to ask a lot of questions," Ms. Tarmy said. "But Stefanie respects people's specialties and listens to the answers."
For example, Ms. Tarmy said, Ms. Powers recently proposed buying stock in Zonagen, a small Texas company that makes a drug to treat male impotence. Ms. Tarmy pointed out that Ms. Powers already owned shares of Pfizer, which makes Viagra, the wildly popular anti-impotence medication, and didn't need to increase her exposure in that field. "We did buy some Zonagen, but very little," Ms. Tarmy said. The investment didn't pan out and Ms. Powers quickly sold it, she added.
Another time, Ms. Powers, who speaks seven languages and travels widely, wanted to put some money in a private placement she had heard about from a friend; the move would have given her an interest in a deep-water port in Wuhan, a city in central China. Ms. Tarmy said no to the idea because such deals can sometimes tie up an investor's money for years.
"I have always encouraged Stefanie to be very liquid," Ms. Tarmy said. "I have seen too many people get involved in deals where they can't get their money out. In the entertainment business, which is so unpredictable, being liquid gives you freedom to make choices. Otherwise she might have to do jobs that are not good for her reputation or image."
 SOMETIMES, Ms. Powers hits a home run. Last September, she proposed buying stock in Dell Computer, Ms. Tarmy recalled, "and I agreed it was well positioned in its marketplace." Was it ever: Since then, Dell's stock has more than doubled, to $100.8125 a share on Friday from $43.
While the company of financial professionals like Mr. Lovelace and Ms. Tarmy has undoubtedly bolstered her self-confidence, Ms. Powers says she has also come to value her own opinions more than she used to -- in part because she has seen that experts in many arenas don't necessarily have all the answers.
"I certainly was not educated in anything financial," said Ms. Powers, who began studying acting at the age of 15. "But I learned that everything develops a mystique" at big institutions.
She said: "The attitude is, 'Oh no, you can't do that. Let us do it. We are experts. You must not do your own taxes because they are so complicated.'
"In my life, I have entered into the sanctum sanctorums of so many different places, but they really didn't know that much," Ms. Powers continued. "I don't want to blow too many people out of the water, but some years ago, I did a book for Simon & Schuster," referring to "Stefanie Powers: Superlife," the book she wrote with Ms. Quine. "I thought: 'Oh, gosh, I am at this great big publishing house. They know exactly what to do.' I can tell you they had not a clue about how to do things."
In recent years, Ms. Powers has kept her foot in the acting door. In 1996, for example, she starred in a revival of the 1970 musical "Applause" at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. And she is now considering starting a line of fragrances.
But more important to her than any future acting role or other venture is the realization that she needn't take up anything for money anymore because she has achieved financial independence. "I never wanted to be vulnerable to being the victim of other people's financial decisions," she said.
"I don't see myself as wealthy," she added. "I am comfortable as long as my needs are satisfied."

Labor Unrest Masks Peaceful Trend

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
THE United States may not yet resemble France, which is paralyzed every year or two by a strike, but suddenly American labor unions have taken to the streets in a way not seen in decades.
The monthlong walkout that has shut down General Motors is the auto industry's longest strike since 1970. An unusual two-day general strike threw Puerto Rico's economy into chaos last week as unions battled plans to privatize the government-owned telephone company, a move the workers fear will mean large-scale layoffs. And 12 days ago, 40,000 construction workers crippled midtown Manhattan by staging a sometimes violent rally against a nonunion contractor. It was the biggest, angriest demonstration by New York's normally docile hard hats in decades. 
 Some labor stalwarts who grew up singing "Solidarity Forever" hail these developments as a signal that union militancy, squelched in the Reagan years, is making a comeback. But other analysts suggest that this month's three-ring labor circus is a coincidental confluence of events that should be viewed as exceptions to the long, steady decline of militancy.
The most telling evidence of labor's waning belligerence is that the number of strikes nationwide has slipped to its lowest level since World War II. There were just 29 strikes last year involving 1,000 workers or more, about half the amount of a decade ago and one-eighth the level two decades ago.
 
The Reagan Factor
 Daniel Kruger, a professor of industrial relations at Michigan State University, said the recent turbulence did not signal an upswing in strikes or union aggressiveness. "Sure, we're going to have occasional strikes, but nothing of the magnitude we had in the past because it's very dangerous to go on strike. People see it's easy to call a strike, but hard as hell to end a strike and to win a strike."
Many factors are behind the decline in unions' strikes and stridency. Unions now represent 14 percent of the work force, down from 35 percent in the 1950's. Fears of layoffs engendered by repeated rounds of downsizing have made many workers scared to stand up to management. And union members often fear they will lose their jobs during a strike because management is increasingly using permanent replacement workers, as President Reagan did after dismissing the striking air traffic controllers in 1981. Unions are also shunning walkouts because they have seen several big strikes fail, like the one six years ago against Caterpillar.
Corporate officials attribute labor peace largely to improved labor relations. At many companies, there is increased employer-employee teamwork and managers are treating workers with more respect. With many employees receiving bonuses and profit-sharing, more and more workers feel allied to management, rather than opposed to it.
"There are many situations where labor relations have matured," said Douglas A. Fraser, former president of the United Auto Workers and now a professor of labor relations at Wayne State University. "Companies and unions are finding different ways to find solutions to problems."
Still, some labor experts insist that the recent militant actions are not exceptions, but instead reflect important changes in the labor movement and in the economy. Since John J. Sweeney was elected to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s presidency in 1995, he has urged the beaten-down union movement to stand up and be willing to confront management.
 
A Confidence Rebound
 With the lowest jobless rate in 30 years, workers are feeling more confident about job security, and union leaders are convinced it will be harder for management to find permanent replacement workers during strikes. In addition, many workers are bitter that their pay has barely kept pace with inflation while Wall Street and executive compensation have skyrocketed.
Predicting an increase in strikes, Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor relations professor at Cornell University, said union militancy was at a turning point. "What we're seeing is workers are fed up with being told that there is this great American economic boom and they're not sharing it, and their patience with Corporate America is waning," she said. "We see that at G.M. and we saw that last year in the U.P.S. strike."
Behind every strike is a unique set of circumstances, so it is often hard to tell whether strikes are one of a kind or part of an underlying trend. The G.M. strike began when the U.A.W. grew angry that the company had failed to make out a promised investment at a plant in Flint, Mich.
The New York construction workers rallied, shutting down most of Manhattan's unionized building sites, because they feared that the growth of nonunion contractors would cost them their jobs. Even though these actions differed in cause and means, some experts say they were both inspired by Mr. Sweeney's more muscular tone for labor.
"There's definitely a bottoming out of strike activity because it couldn't go much lower," said Greg Tarpinian, president of the Labor Research Association, a New York-based research group. "Given the tight labor market and the unhappiness with attacks on workers, people are finally starting to feel a little more confident about flexing their muscles."

HEADLINE: The World;
Angry and Beseeching, Nigerians Focus on U.S.

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria

 BODY:
AMID the turmoil here that has followed the abrupt death of the opposition leader Moshood K. O. Abiola, there lurks a simmering anger against the United States, which was so conspicuously present at the moment of Mr. Abiola's demise on Tuesday, but generally absent as Nigeria had slipped into the abyss.
"Where was America over the past four years while my husband was in jail?" asked a grief-stricken Mrs. Bosede Gloria Abiola as she mourned at Mr. Abiola's home. "America has done nothing and I find it very strange and suspicious that at the very moment when he died, American officials were watching." 
 Mrs. Abiola's sentiments are by no means isolated. Femi Falana, a prominent opposition lawyer well known at the American Embassy here, has gone as far as to demand the detention of the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Thomas R. Pickering, who was with Mr. Abiola when he died of what Nigerian authorities have called cardiac arrest. "He is needed here as a witness," Mr. Falana said.
Of course, grief and frustration are at fever pitch among Mr. Abiola's followers, and America may be no more than a convenient target. But the extraordinary shifts here over the past month -- from repressive dictatorship to tentative opening, from hope that Mr. Abiola would be freed to disorientation at his loss -- have underscored the challenge now being posed by Nigerians for America to rethink its relationship with Africa's most populous nation.
That challenge is being posed most clearly by the very people angriest about Mr. Abiola's death; beneath the expressions of suspicion and resentment they direct at the United States lies a sense that a closer involvement by Washington from now on may be Nigeria's best hope for assuring a passage to democracy. Put bluntly, there is a void here, and it seems that if America does not move to help fill it, an already tense situation could become more dangerous.
 
Imperatives
 While Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, the new military leader, is talking of "the imperative" of democracy, there are no credible political parties, scant recent tradition of democracy, no surviving figure with the breadth of appeal of Mr. Abiola and serious ethnic tensions.
"The whole transition will be treacherous and will require an international monitoring process in which the United States could play a leading role," said Clement Nwankwo, an opposition lawyer.
Nigeria lies at the distant antipode of Bill Clinton's "new Africa," the land of promise and economic change energetically showcased on the President's recent visit to several African states. Indeed this country, which Mr. Clinton avoided, amounts to towering testimony to just how deep into misery a potentially wealthy nation can be dragged by mismanagement, corruption and oppression.
There is no gas at the pumps here although Nigeria is a major exporter of oil, earning over $10 billion a year in hard currency from oil sales. Per capita annual income has fallen to about $250. Power cuts are frequent; some telephone lines simply lie collapsed on the street.
Street hawkers sell everything from bifocals to calculators in a bid to get by. Markets sell slabs of meat beside open sewage in central Lagos. The education system, once one of Africa's best, is falling apart. "Nobody wants to be a teacher," commented a weary Lagos resident. "Everyone wants to be a customs officer because of the bribes."
Such disintegration -- moral, social and economic -- reflects the five years of ruinous rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, who died suddenly last month of what was officially called a heart attack. The United States imposed sanctions on Nigeria while the the General ruled, and called periodically for Mr. Abiola's release after he was imprisoned in 1994.
Finally, with General Abacha already dead, Mr. Pickering came to press personally for Mr. Abiola's release -- but, in the words of one official here, "he scarcely managed to get past the formalities."
 
Omissions
 It is, however, what America did not do over the past few years that made some Nigerians simmer with the anger they expressed when Mr. Abiola died. While Mr. Abiola was in jail, American calls for his release were not accompanied by any insistence that Nigeria should respect the results of the presidential election that Mr. Abiola appeared to have won when the army annulled it in 1993. A certain American ambivalence about the opposition leader often seemed to prevail.
And the Clinton Administration avoided invoking the most potent potential weapon of protest -- American sanctions on Nigeria's oil exports. Indeed, American oil companies sharply increased their investments here to about $7 billion during the Abacha years.
"The anti-Americanism is a source of concern," said one official here. "It is not that widespread, but it is more widespread than I would like to see it."
Clearly, for many Nigerians, the most tangible contribution the United States could now make would be to coax General Abubakar to adopt a fairly rapid timetable for a shift to democracy and then oblige him to stick to it. The General has made clear that he wants to get sanctions lifted -- particularly those that prevent Nigeria from buying military spare parts. That seems to give the United States some leverage.
Nigeria's new ruler attended military training programs in the United States and officials said he is generally viewed as well disposed toward Washington. For now, he appears to have convinced American officials of his good faith.
 
The Test
 But what appears to loom for the Clinton Administration, in this nation of 105 million people, is a critical test of the relative weight it gives to its political and economic interests. The American investments here in oil are huge, and to be viable they depend on stability. But the promised Nigerian shift to democracy will be an inherently unstable process.

HEADLINE: The World: Bolivia Falls Short;
When Even an Economic Miracle Isn't Enough

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia

 BODY:
ALL around Latin America, book stores are well stocked with new texts about free markets and global free trade. Such books brim with hope for the future, and they are beginning to appear even in this backwater capital high in the Andes. But here, they still have to share shelf space with a rather depressing best-seller that carries a very different message.
The book, first published in 1937, is Alcides Arguedas' "A Sick People," and it seems at times that every literate Bolivian has read it. It indicts Bolivia's history and national character as a blight of corruption, provincialism and racial hatred, a synthesis of "laziness, poverty, barbarism." That conclusion, and the book's abiding popularity, highlight the challenges that the global free-market revolution faces here. 
 As that revolution is increasingly accepted around the world as the wave of the future, Bolivia's experience also can serve as a lesson for other countries -- Cambodia and Congo, for example -- that are also plagued by intractable geographical disadvantages, caste structures and unstable political histories. The lesson is the limits of the miracles promised by global free enterprise.
 
Not Enough Growth
 Carlos F. Toranzo Roca, a prominent Bolivian economist, sums up the lesson this way: "You don't eradicate centuries of structural social inequalities with 4 percent growth rates."
That, however, is exactly what a series of Bolivian Governments has tried to do since 1985, with the help of American economic advisors including Jeffrey D. Sachs, the director of Harvard University's Institute for International Development.
In a number of ways, the results have been spectacular. First, the Government tackled a 24,000 percent annual inflation rate by slashing its budget and subsidies, and instituting property and value-added taxes. The inflation rate was reduced to single digits virtually overnight.
Per capita income, which had fallen by 30 percent between 1985 and 1990, began to climb an average of between 4 and 5 percent a year, and with economic stability came political stability. The nearly ritualistic annual coups that Bolivia had suffered through for more than a century were replaced by a series of clean, peaceful elections.
The last Bolivian Government ceded a controlling share of the Government oil, railroad, electricity, telephone and airline monopolies to foreign corporations and overhauled the country's tax and pension systems, diversifying the economy and boosting savings rates in the process. Hoping to soften political opposition to the privatization, the Government put large minority holdings in the firms into a private pension trust fund that is beginning to pay all Bolivians older than 65 a modest annuity. Foreign investment is blossoming, and a new pipeline will soon deliver natural gas to Brazil.
Signs of globalization are popping up in the most unlikely places. Indian trinket stands in La Paz are beginning to accept American Express cards. Peasant union leaders now wear cellular telephones on their belts. A fading mural depicting a defiant Che Guevara on the campus of the national university now pales alongside a bright new Coca Cola advertisement. Bolivia, where most people still drink coca tea and a high-octane maize liquor called chicha, is even beginning to export wine.
Still, the results remain mixed for the great majority of poor Bolivians.
The average Bolivian still earns $900 a year, less than one-fifth what the average Argentine or Chilean earns, and few of the poor can expect to live long enough to see the benefits of economic growth trickle down to transform their existence into anything like a middle class lifestyle.
 
Too Little Schooling

While the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz are booming with new condominiums, banks and McDonald's franchises, the rural Indian highlands continue to fall behind. Foreign investors can't be enticed to build factories in mountain areas where shipping costs are prohibitive, where even a third-grade education is unusual and where only 1 percent of the people have finished high school. More than half of all Bolivians speak Indian dialects as their first language and many speak no Spanish at all. Forty percent of the children in La Paz are chronically undernourished.
That is not to say the lower classes have made no progress. While life expectancy at birth remains a miserably low 60 years, that is a major improvement over the 42 years that an infant born in 1960 was expected to live. Only 55 percent of the population currently has access to potable water, but in 1975 only 34 percent did.
Still, this amount of progress is not enough to stem the widening of the income gap between rich and poor, and particularly between city dwellers and rural Indians -- although it apparently has helped lend Bolivia a semblance of stability.
"The key to sustained economic growth is education, and you can't educate a country overnight," conceded Vice President Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ramirez.
The new Government of President Hugo Banzer Suarez is planning a rural literacy campaign, and has proposed steps to help poor people acquire loans. But with the region's economies beginning to slow in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, no new economic boom is anywhere in sight.
Another intractable problem is Bolivia's virtual inability to ship by sea, given the fact that its access to the Pacific Ocean was lost in a war with Chile over 100 years ago, and the two countries have not forgiven each other. Bolivia and Chile still do not have diplomatic relations, leaving Bolivia dependent on unreliable mountain roads and expensive air traffic to export its goods.
"There are probably not any more economic policy dials that can be easily turned in Bolivia," Mr. Sachs acknowledged. "You can do marvelous reforms, but still have very significant problems in achieving a rapid improvement of living standards."
 
Too Much History
 One thing economic reform can't change is history.
Bolivia's Andean remoteness protected its Indians from the European smallpox and plague that decimated most of Latin America's indigenous populations. So a large Indian population remained to be exploited by the Spanish colonizers as miners and tenant farmers, and what emerged was a highly stratified society wracked by class strife.
Bolivia was so unruly with caste and Indian wars that its namesake, Simon Bolivar, fled it in disgust after he wrote a constitution inspired by the most enlightened European ideals. The constitution survived on paper, but the society went through more than 250 rebellions and military coups over the next 150 years.
A longstanding joke among neighboring Argentines compared Bolivia to a long-playing record: "33 revolutions a minute."
The quip now seems as dated as the phonograph itself, but many vestiges of class conflict survive.
According to the United States Government's 1997 human rights report on Bolivia, "some rural indigenous workers are kept in a state of virtual slavery by employers who charge them more for room and board than they earn." A system of child servitude known as criadito survives in which Indian parents indenture their pre-adolescent children to middle- and upper-income families to perform household chores. Many of the children are badly abused.
"Bolivia has made tremendous progress," said Herbert Klein, a Columbia University historian who specializes in Bolivia, "but it starts from an incredibly backward base compared to everyone else in Latin America." And with virtually every other country in Latin America following the same successful economic policies, there is no reason to believe Bolivia will catch up with its neighbors any time soon.

HEADLINE: How a Swiss Bank Gold Deal Eluded a U.S. Mediator

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Late on a Friday night two weeks ago, just before months of bitter negotiations between Switzerland's three major commercial banks and Holocaust survivors collapsed, one of the Clinton Administration's most senior diplomats placed an urgent call to the President of Switzerland, Flavio Cotti.
The diplomat, Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, told the Swiss President that the two sides were narrowing their differences. But after rounds and rounds of talks in New York and Washington, neither side was willing to move further. 
 The Swiss Government, Mr. Eizenstat said, had the power both to speed a settlement and to end a 50-year-long chapter of its history that tarnished Switzerland's reputation around the globe. He urged Mr. Cotti to reverse a long-held position and have the Swiss Government contribute to a "global settlement" with Jewish groups and with Holocaust victims and their heirs.
He even suggested a figure: more than $300 million, a large sum but only a fraction of the $2.8 billion in Nazi gold, measured in today's values, that a Swiss historical commission recently concluded was received on behalf of Nazi Germany by the Swiss central bank.
Mr. Cotti refused.
While Mr. Eizenstat declines to discuss details of the discussion, he said "no common understanding was reached" in the conversation. "It is our impression that the cycle of accusation and counteraccusations had substantially hardened opinion in Switzerland," said Mr. Eizenstat, who has led the State Department's efforts to settle the contentious issue.
Thomas G. Borer, the Swiss ambassador for Holocaust issues, was even more direct.
"The mood in Switzerland has changed in the past year, and Mr. Cotti explained this," Mr. Borer said in a telephone interview. "Most Swiss don't even want to talk about a global settlement. They know that whatever we do, no one gets credit."
Several participants in the negotiations now say that Switzerland's hard-line position -- a refusal even to consider joining the private banks in settling the legal claims -- helped scuttle an agreement in late June. And while a settlement is not dead, it is clear that announcements this past spring that a settlement was in the offing were premature. There are indications that talks could resume in a few months, as New York and California begin to carry out sanctions against Swiss businesses operating in the United States.
But Mr. Eizenstat's unusual, direct appeal to Mr. Cotti, and lower-level talks between American and Swiss diplomats, had echoes of an earlier time. Nearly two generations ago, in 1946, the State Department tried to get Switzerland to disgorge the huge profits it accumulated when it served as banker to Nazi Germany, taking in stolen gold, jewelry, art and other property.
The result was an agreement called the Washington Accord, now regarded as a diplomatic fiasco, in which Switzerland agreed to turn over a small part of its holdings to repay countries invaded by Germany and to aid refugees. But it never fulfilled major parts of the accord, and it has resisted several efforts in the years since to settle the accounts. The Swiss central bank did make a contribution of more than $70 million to a humanitarian fund, but it has said that was a one-time act of compassion -- not something that will be repeated under legal pressure.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who has led the investigations into the Nazi gold questions, has scheduled hearings for later this month on the question of whether the United States should try to reopen the Washington agreement, a step the Clinton Administration has been loath to take, saying that it would irreparably breach the American relationship with the Swiss.
Mr. Eizenstat has been scurrying for more than a year now to avoid that. This spring he turned out a detailed study of how other neutral nations dealt extensively with the Nazis during World War II, a study that seemed intended to make the Swiss seemed less of a lone target.
All spring, he acted as a go-between in the negotiations between the three big private Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse -- and the fractious group of plaintiffs who are suing them. In early June, just before the New York State Banking Commission was supposed to consider an application for the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, the banks began to offer larger settlements.
But they had a condition: before Mr. Eizenstat could convey their offer of several hundred million dollars, the banking commission had to approve the merger. The commission had suggested earlier in the year that it might hold up the American approval -- critical to operating on Wall Street -- because the banks had not been diligent enough in tracking down Holocaust-era accounts.
"We believe that there was no legitimate regulatory objection to the merger," said Roger Witten, the lead lawyer for the banks, "and we wanted to make sure that we were free from efforts to use that process to extort a result on another front."
Mr. Eizenstat called the World Jewish Congress to say a major offer was on the way, and sent a letter confirming that he was in possession of "a firm and concrete offer from the banks for settlement of the class action litigation" that would be conveyed after the merger was approved. With that assurance, the Jewish groups said they would drop their past objections to the merger.
The banks, pushed further by Mr. Eizenstat, ultimately offered $530 million for a "rough justice fund" that would pay the plaintiffs and be used to help indigent survivors of the Holocaust.
"We came up with a reasonable estimate, based on the very limited dealings the commercial banks had with German gold," Mr. Witten said, and then multiplied the figure several times, he said, explaining how the banks came to that number.
The Jewish groups, however, were looking for something closer to $1.5 billion, and dismissed the banks' offer as insulting. (In addition to the $530 million, the banks have previously pledged to pay any amounts mandated by an independent commission headed by Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, which is reviewing long-dormant wartime accounts in Swiss banks.)
Bitter charges were exchanged. Some of the plaintiffs charged that the banks, having received the merger approval, were no longer motivated to increase their offers significantly. The banks, in turn, charged that the Holocaust survivors and Jewish groups, which have fought among themselves over strategy, were trying to obtain more money with threats of bad publicity and possible economic sanctions against the banks.
In fact, a meeting to impose sanctions -- headed by Alan Hevesi, the New York City Comptroller -- loomed in late June, prompting Mr. Eizenstat to call President Cotti. He offered a rationale: the Swiss National Bank, which is Government-owned, received more than 85 percent of the gold deposited by Nazi Germany. Commercial banks got just a fraction.
But Mr. Cotti refused even to bring the issue in front of the legislature, saying it would only further inflame public opinion.

HEADLINE: For Las Vegas Locals, Heavy Action Is at the Buffet

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., July 11

 BODY:
Any outsider would have mistaken Ty Seedig for a waiter, so nimbly did he balance three full-size dinner plates in one hand, so fleetly did he hurtle toward a table in the rear of a restaurant at the Main Street Station hotel and casino here.
But any local resident would have caught the longing in Mr. Seedig's eyes and the delight on his lips and known exactly what he was: a buffet hound, practiced at the trick of maximizing each trip down the trough. 
 On his latest foray, he had netted what looked like an entire bed of clams, a wedge of ahi tuna, a slab of trout and, of course, a huge steak, this being T-bone night, which jacked up the price all the way to $10.99. Normally, it was $9.99, already a tad steep by Las Vegas standards.
"I do about six buffets a week," Mr. Seedig, 38, said Tuesday night as he rotated the plates before him to get a better angle at the T-bone, which was obstructed by several red potatoes and an ear of corn. His trimness suggested a metabolism worthy of scientific research.
"For being fast and cheap," he mumbled between forkfuls, "you can't beat a buffet."
That could be the motto for this desert city, the nation's capital of gorging as well as gambling.
Overstuffed, underpriced smorgasbords have long been a staple of Las Vegas's tourist trade, an enticement and reward for spending money in casinos. But a lure for heavy rollers is becoming a life style for heavy eaters as the city's resident population swells.
Most of the people who line up at the buffets in casinos away from "the Strip" live in Las Vegas, and the buffets they patronize are growing more absurdly, insanely bountiful.
The one at Main Street Station takes so many twists and turns along its odyssey from iceberg lettuce to carrot cake that a person would be wise to leave a trail of multicolored cheese cubes to find the way back.
But Marvin Faleck and Anthony Ippolito had no trouble with their bearings. Since moving to Las Vegas from Long Island two years ago, they have been on something of a buffet safari.
It has taken them to more than a dozen buffets both off and on the Strip, including an Oktoberfest event at the Nevada Palace that featured vats of sauerkraut and a polka band, all for $6.99.
"But I don't think we've done the MGM buffet," Mr. Faleck, 40, said on Tuesday night as he munched on some of Main Street's undeniably tasty fried chicken.
"The Oz buffet?" Mr. Ippolito, 38, responded, nibbling pizza. "Yes, we have."
"Luxor and Excalibur -- feh!" Mr. Faleck said, dismissing two buffets with one syllable. "It's $5.99 at Excalibur; you figure, how can you go wrong? Feh!"
"Monte Carlo wasn't feh," he added, "it was eh."
One of their friends, Danny Schaeffer, 28, swallowed part of a burrito and chimed in that an unfortunate episode several months ago left him wary of how long the food is maintained at safe temperatures.
"After that experience," he said, "I never say a buffet is good until I've gone home, slept through the night and gotten up in the morning without anything going wrong."
Perhaps the most ardent pilgrims to the buffets are retirees, who get coupons, discounts and other breaks that often put the price of a limitless meal for two below $10. That includes non-alcoholic beverages and as much pie, cake and pastry as a body can manage.
The buffet mavens of Las Vegas manage a lot. And they know exactly when and where to go.
"The Gold Coast only charges something like $5.30 for its lunch buffet," said Ted Morgenbesser, 61, who took an early retirement from his insurance job in Manhattan last year and moved here with his wife, Vicki.
"But it serves until 3," Mr. Morgenbesser said. "So if you get there at 2:30 and have your big meal for the day, it's basically $5 a person. The price goes up at least a dollar for dinner."
Like the bigger houses and lower taxes that help lure thousands of transplants to Las Vegas every month, the buffets feed newcomers' faith in greater bounty and possibility here. That expectation is grounded partly in reality, and partly in myth.
While most of the buffets do essentially give away much of the food each patron consumes, losing money in the process, they easily make up the difference in the coins that patrons cannot resist dropping in the thicket of slot machines they must penetrate to get to the make-your-own-taco bar.
Mr. Ippolito and Mr. Faleck blew $17 on slots as they left Main Street Station. But Mr. Faleck explained that the appeal of buffets transcended mere economics.
"What they are is a goof," he said.
There are Chinese buffets and Japanese buffets, breakfast buffets and lunch buffets, buffets that operate 24 hours a day and buffets that span half the distance of a football field.
The Carnival World Buffet at the Rio Suites Hotel and Casino is at least that long, and it has more than seven ethnic sub-buffets. Even at 9:30 P.M. Tuesday, hundreds of people were zipping -- or, it must be said, waddling -- from Italy to Mexico and back again.
Some old-timers scoff at such clutter, preferring to stick with what they know and like best. For Erne D. Vining, 64, that's fish, and he nightly heads to whichever buffet is having its weekly seafood special.
"On Monday I go to Orleans," said Mr. Vining, who has lived in Las Vegas for more than three decades. "On Tuesday, Boulder Station. On Wednesday, Fiesta. On Thursday, Sunset. On Friday, Fremont. Sundays is Silverton."
And what of Saturday? Does he fast?
"Sometimes," Mr. Vining conceded in an almost apologetic voice, "I cook."

HEADLINE: Common Ground Is Missing In Battling Plains Farm Ills

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
With the national economy booming, lawmakers have begun to focus on one of the few places in the country where times are bad: the Northern Plains, where wheat and livestock prices have plunged and many farmers are desperate.
"This is an especially bad year in terms of wheat prices," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee and who helped rush through the Senate on Thursday a bill to allow farmers to sell wheat to Pakistan. 
 Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said the situation on the farms in his state, South Dakota, was the direst in 15 years and was becoming worse. "We've got to take action now," he said. "It must be done this summer."
But while Republicans and Democrats have weighed in with proposals to meet what both sides describe as a crisis involving an important election-year constituency, they are addressing the situation from entirely different angles.
Republicans like Senator Lugar favor a free-market agriculture policy and believe the Government can best help farmers by staying out of their hair and promoting export markets for their products.
That was the basis of the legislation approved by the Senate on Thursday to exempt food exports from the sanctions the United States imposed on India and Pakistan after those countries conducted nuclear tests in May. The House Republican leadership has promised to follow suit in time for American farmers to bid on Wednesday on a large Pakistani order for wheat.
Democrats like Senator Daschle believe that it is more important for the Government to restore some Government farm subsidies that were developed in the New Deal and repealed by the Republican Congress in the 1996 farm bill. Democratic lawmakers promised this week to press for more Government assistance for farmers.
President Clinton plans to meet on the situation early next week with Democratic senators. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in an interview that the Administration would announce its response to the farm problem in the next week or two.
The matter could come to a head next week, if the Senate takes up the agriculture appropriations bill. The outcome could affect the Congressional elections this fall.
Few other issues so vividly illustrate the fundamental split between the parties on the proper role of Government in the society.
Generally, politicians from the same state but different parties vote alike on questions that are of primarily local concern. In New York, for instance, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, walk in tandem on such issues as mass transit and acid rain.
But in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska and Washington -- states with mounting trouble on the farms and with one Republican and one Democratic senator each -- the senators are walking the party lines and taking opposing positions on farm policy.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, described the division this way: "They have great confidence in Washington bureaucrats. We have confidence in Iowa farmers to manage their own destiny."
But Iowa's Democratic Senator, Tom Harkin, has a completely different view.
"For Republicans, the 1996 farm bill is like holy scripture, and any change would show they were wrong," he said. "I simply do not believe you can trade your way out of a farm disaster. I think the Government has got to step in."
Nationwide, the farm picture is not entirely bleak. Corn farmers in Indiana, Ohio and Illinois are anticipating a good year when their crop comes in this fall. Cotton producers in Arkansas and Mississippi are doing well. Rice growers in the South are prospering.
But so many farmers lost money in North Dakota last year that net farm income was down 98 percent from 1996, and the situation has deteriorated this year. Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said that in his state, auctioneers had to be called out of retirement to handle all the farmers who were selling out.
The problem is also severe in South Dakota, western Minnesota and the other states along the Canadian border to the Pacific.
Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said her constituents were facing "the worst crisis ever seen in the Pacific Northwest."
The farmers' troubles stem from several unrelated events: farm exports are way down, mainly because of the staggering economies in Asia; wheat production is strong because of warm weather worldwide, driving down prices; many farmers in the Northern Plains have not recovered from last year's floods; a disease called scab has affected much of the wheat in the Middle West.
"Prices today for wheat and corn and soybeans and barley are at a level equal to what they were when I was born, 50 years ago," said Senator Daschle. Farmers, he continued, are expected "to live on salaries and income that was generated right after World War II, and you can't do that."
Democrats hold that the plight of farmers has been worsened by the Republican legislation Congress approved two years ago called the Freedom to Farm Act. The law reduces crop subsidies in increments until they no longer exist, after 2002, and gives farmers freedom to switch crops in response to market demand. Most Democrats voted against the measure. President Clinton signed it with serious reservations, he said at the time, because he feared the bill would not "provide an adequate safety net for family farmers."
Now, Democrats want to roll back that legislation by raising the ceiling on Government-guaranteed loans to farmers and by introducing a new emergency-relief program that would help farmers affected by floods, drought and other natural disasters.
Their prospects for success do not appear to be strong. Senator Lugar said he and his fellow Republicans would fight hard to preserve the 1996 law. Farmers, he said, "should rely on a market approach, not a political fix."
In the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich promised last month that he would promote legislation to stimulate farm exports. He said he would press to renew the President's fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements, an authority that Congress failed to re-enact last year. He said he would also seek financing for the International Monetary Fund and continuation of normal trade relations with China, both of which would presumably help farm exports.
The Democrats are sure to turn this conflict into an election issue in a year when they need a swing of only 11 seats to regain control of the House. In Montana, for instance, Robert Deschamps, the Democrat challenging the state's only Congressman, Rick Hill, a Republican in his first term, is making changes in the 1996 farm law a major part of his platform.
According to the Congressional Quarterly, Republicans hold nearly two-thirds of the 57 Congressional seats representing districts in which at least 60 percent of the population lives outside metropolitan areas. A clear majority of these districts favored President Clinton in 1996.
But John Morgan, a Republican political consultant, said he did not think his party needed to worry on this score. "There aren't that many seats left that turn on farm issues," he said.
Russell Ross, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Iowa and a specialist in rural politics, agreed with Mr. Morgan's assessment that farm issues would not cause many Congressional seats to change hands. "The cities and the small towns," he said, "that's where the votes are."

HEADLINE: Sides Are Squaring Off on Raising Retirement Age

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Given that people are living longer, many politicians and economists think that gradually raising the retirement age to 70 or even higher is a fair means of reducing the financial strain that threatens the Social Security system.
Given that her bones ache after decades of hard work, Beth Hamilton of Exeter, R.I., thinks otherwise. 
 At the age of 62, Ms. Hamilton works full time in a group home for mentally and physically disabled adults, lifting, bathing, dressing and cleaning up after them. It is difficult and dirty work that takes its toll; earlier this year she contracted pneumonia from one of the people she looks after.
Even if it was implemented so slowly as to not affect her, Ms. Hamilton said, raising the retirement age would be unfair to her younger colleagues and to future generations of people who do not have the luxury of working behind a desk.
"We've had all sorts of injuries," she said. "Our backs are hurting. We've been bitten and had hepatitis shots. The idea of doing this until 70 is too much."
As they begin examining details of various plans for restoring Social Security's long-term financial health, Clinton Administration officials, members of Congress and interest groups say few issues will be more passionately debated -- or subject to demagoguery -- than proposals to raise the age at which retirees can claim full benefits.
"It's a very visceral issue for a lot of people," said Warren B. Rudman, the former Republican Senator from New Hampshire who is co-chairman of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group that favors a gradual increase. "A lot of people can't conceive of the notion that they will have to spend more time in their jobs than they planned."
Although the impact of any change could be substantial -- on individuals, employers and the economy -- the issue has gotten relatively little attention so far in Washington.
Many people appear unaware that, under changes adopted in 1983, the age at which retirees can claim full Social Security benefits is already scheduled to increase. From 2003 through 2008 it will gradually rise to 66 from 65. Then, from 2021 through 2027, it will rise gradually to 67. (The early retirement age would remain 62, but the benefits available at that age would decline as the full retirement age increases.)
Some of the plans being considered in Washington would accelerate the existing timetable. Others would push the retirement age even higher. A comprehensive plan developed by a bipartisan commission working with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research group, recommended in May that the retirement age be raised to 70 by 2029, and be raised as needed after that to account for further increases in life expectancy.
Given that tough tradeoffs are going to have to be made to insure Social Security's long-term survival, increased life expectancy alone makes raising the qualifying age for full benefits fair game, said Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican who was a member of the bipartisan commission. Life expectancy for males, which was about 60 at the time Social Security was created in 1935, is almost 73, meaning that people are spending many more years in retirement.
But Senator Gregg said the commission's plan offsets the increased retirement age in other ways, including removing the cap on how much money retirees can earn before the age of 70 without reducing their Social Security payments. That change might lead some people to choose early retirement at reduced benefits in the expectation that they would keep working part time.
Moreover, he said, the centerpiece of the commission's plan -- private accounts that allow workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the stock market -- will provide a pool of wealth beyond Social Security benefits that retirees will be able to tap starting at age 60. Advocates of such accounts say they will more than offset any reductions in benefits.
And since the change would not take place for decades or affect anyone near retirement age now, those who are affected will have plenty of time to prepare, Mr. Gregg said.
The proposal "is tied to a system that gives you many more options so that you can have a quality life style if you retire early," Mr. Gregg said.
"On substance," he said, "this is a heck of a good approach. On the demagoguing aspect, Social Security has always been demagogued by people who are absolutely irresponsible and only look to the next election."
Labor unions, as well as some Democrats in Congress, said it is not a matter of demagoguery at all, just of understanding how strongly working people feel about the issue.
"We've done focus groups in which people reject resoundingly some of the ideas that are taken for granted around here, like raising the retirement age," said Gerry Shea, assistant to the president for government affairs at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "People don't realize it's already going to 67, and when you tell them about proposals to move it up to 70, their reactions range from incredulity to, 'Who came up with that idea'?"
Democrats in the House see the issue as a potent one as they draw distinctions between how they and the Republicans would deal with Social Security. They are drafting a comprehensive Social Security proposal that would not call for any further changes in the retirement age.
But for many people the issue is complicated, involving the kind of work they do, changing cultural assumptions about when old age begins, the value put on youth in the work place and their own goals for financial security, career accomplishment and leisure time.
Rosemarie Cola, a 65-year-old retired employee assistance worker from New York City, said she thought raising the retirement age might be a reasonable way to help insure that Social Security will be around in the future. But she wants to hear more about the tradeoffs, and she said she wondered whether employers would be in step with a movement toward having people work until they are 68 or 70.
"Older people are being pushed out of their jobs," she said. "They have the biggest health benefits, the most vacation, the biggest salaries. Employers want you out."
The group that has the most at stake in the debate -- generally those who are 40 or under and would be most likely to feel the full impact of any further changes -- appears most ambivalent.
"How can I know where I'll be when I'm 65 or 67?" said Mary Ann Mroz, a 35-year-old college administrator from Somerville, Mass. "I don't think it's been fully thought through."
Mr. Rudman said that as the population ages, employers will face a shortage of workers, and will increasingly seek to lure retirees back into full- or part-time work. Moreover, he said, many people realize when they reach age 65 or 67 that they are not ready yet to stop working entirely.
Yet although there are signs of more retirees from white-collar jobs looking for full or part-time employment, a trend toward longer working lives would reverse decades in which there has been a pronounced trend toward early retirement. In 1965, 30.2 percent of the men who applied for Social Security retirement benefits were under age 65. Since 1985, the figure has been around 66 percent, and is much higher for women.
Ms. Hamilton, who attended a recent conference on Social Security as part of a contingent of union members brought in by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said she had been working since she was 14, and had been eager to cut back to part time this month when she turned 62.
But when she went to her local Social Security office, she found that her benefit would be $550 a month if she retired now, instead of $730 if she retires at 65. Feeling that she could not afford to live on the reduced benefit, she decided to keep working full time, but is already counting the days until July 2001.
"If I had a job like Andy Rooney, I'd work until I'm 75," she said. "But right now I'm disappointed."

HEADLINE: Alabama Resort Fears Potential Ban on Red Snapper Catch

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspaper Group 

DATELINE: ORANGE BEACH, Ala.

 BODY:
Accustomed to weathering the occasional hurricane that barrels out of the Gulf of Mexico, this bustling resort is now bracing for a potential catastrophe of a different sort.
Federal officials, saying the Gulf's signature red snapper is as overfished as it is delicious, are threatening to close down recreational angling for snapper as early as Sept. 1. It is a decision that could have a devastating economic impact on this community that bills itself as "the red snapper capital of the world." 
 "That would put me out of business," said Neal Grube, a veteran charter captain who earns $750 a day and more from sports anglers on his his 38-foot boat, the Catch-it.
He is not the only one. About 100 charter boats run out of the marinas dotting the waterways of this fishing center on the eastern end of the 32-mile island reaching from the Florida border to Mobile Bay, informally called Pleasure Island.
World-class fishing and sugar-white sand have helped Orange Beach and the adjacent Gulf Shores blossom into a full-fledged tourist destination. But fishing drives the economy, and tourism officials are busy estimating the potential losses in an effort to persuade officials of the National Marine Fisheries Service to keep the season open even if the agency determines that too many red snapper are being killed in the nets of commercial shrimpers.
A 1994 study put the direct financial impact of charter fishing on the local economy at $35 million annually with $10 million to $15 million more attributed to the ripple effect.
Once abundant, the snapper supported a thriving commercial fishing industry as far back as 100 years. But in the 1980's, the take of red snappers reached historical lows and worried Federal fishery managers began searching for solutions.
The National Marine Fisheries Service imposed quotas on commercial and recreational fishing. This spring, after a decade of deliberations and $10 million in research, the service went after what it believed to be a major cause of the declining snapper stock: the trawls of commercial shrimpers that ensnare and kill inch-long snappers.
To eliminate what it estimates is the loss of 35 million juvenile snappers a year in shrimp nets, the fisheries service in May began requiring shrimpers plying most Gulf waters to use a special device that is supposed to let trapped fin fish escape. If agency officials determine it is not sufficiently effective, they could reduce or shut down recreational snapper fishing. Commercial snapper fishing -- already suspended -- would not be allowed to resume this year.
"The stock is seriously overfished and I think you have to put the emphasis on the word seriously," said Andrew Kemmerer, southeast region director for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
But the charter boat captains say their experience suggests otherwise. They say passengers on their boats easily catch their daily four-fish limit of snappers. On this day, Captain Grube's party included a trio of young Mississippians who brought in an impressive catch, running as large as eight pounds each.
Mr. Kemmerer and conservation advocates concede the snapper stock appears to be recovering. But they say continued limits are necessary to give the new fish the chance to reach their prime reproductive years.
"Four snapper a person to me is fair," said Ben Fairey, captain of the Necessity. "But when you are talking about a closed season in the middle of our tourist season, that is economic disaster for us."

HEADLINE: Low-Key Bidding for State-Sponsored Credit Card Raises Questions

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
In late 1995, the Pataki administration, looking for innovative ways for the state to promote and profit from its image, decided to sponsor an "I Love New York" credit card. The idea was to sell the rights to the slogan to a bank, which would emblazon it on a standard Visa card or Mastercard along with pictures of scenic New York.
The contract went to the MBNA Corporation of Delaware, a large credit card issuer that in the last four years has been one of the biggest political contributors to the New York Republican State Committee and to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. 
 It is perhaps no surprise that MBNA received the contract, since it was the only bidder. While the administration went through a formal process to solicit bids, an examination of the way it was handled shows that officials did not aggressively pursue other credit card issuers, raising questions about whether they got the best deal possible.
The Department of Economic Development said it solicited bids from only nine banks. Two of them are so small that they do not issue credit cards. Those two, as well as three others, said they had no record of having received a bid request. While the department said that it had hoped to give the contract to a bank based in New York, it did not solicit bids from several obvious candidates, like Chase Manhattan and Citibank.
MBNA received the three-year contract on March 15, 1996. The following month, just as the credit card program began, it donated $50,000 to the Republican State Committee, according to disclosure records.
Since that time, MBNA has distributed 109,000 of the "I Love New York" credit cards, officials said, making it a successful line for the company's so-called affinity card business.
Banks typically produce affinity cards in partnership with a range of groups, from alumni associations to sports teams to government agencies. The number of "I Love New York" cards ranks it as a medium-size affinity issue, marketing experts said.
The Pataki administration, MBNA and the Republican State Committee said there was no link between political contributions and the contract.
The Department of Economic Development defended the method that it used to find a card issuer, saying that it was fair and impartial. The department said it had to award the contract to MBNA because no one else had bid.
The department's Commissioner, Charles A. Gargano, used to be Gov. George E. Pataki's chief fund-raiser, but he said he stopped raising money for the Governor and the state party after Mr. Pataki took office in 1995.
A spokeswoman for the department, Caroline Quartararo, noted that the state had collected $388,000 in fees from MBNA. The company pays the state $1 for each new card, $1.50 for each card that is renewed and 25 cents for each charge.
The department said it sent applications to eight banks in New York and to MBNA. Among them was Olympian Bank of Brooklyn, which has only two branches.
"I don't recall ever seeing such an application," said Joseph A. Baldasare, senior vice president of Olympian Bank. "We don't offer credit cards ourselves. We are a very small, little bank in Bay Ridge."
The department did not request bids from a number of out-of-state banks that, like MBNA, issue affinity cards.
Several big banks in the state and elsewhere said they did not know whether they would have bid on the contract had they been notified about it, and some pointed out that affinity cards were not their focus.
But they all said they would have considered it.
"There are a lot of programs that we look at, and there are probably very, very few that we would reject out of hand," said George McCane, a senior vice president for corporate affairs at First USA, which is based in Delaware and is the biggest rival of MBNA in the affinity market.
Asked to explain how it chose the banks that received the applications, Ms. Quartararo said at first that the eight banks in New York were all the banks that were chartered in the state. She said MBNA was asked for a bid because it was a major issuer of affinity cards.
"We wanted the business to stay in New York if possible," she said.
When told in a subsequent conversation that more than 150 banks are chartered in the state, Ms. Quartararo said she had been mistaken, explaining that the department had sent out applications to the largest banks chartered in the state.
It was then pointed out to her that some of the banks that received the applications are very small or have their headquarters in New York but are not chartered in the state. "What can I tell you?" she responded. "There is this bureaucrat who works in our finance office who just did it like that. It sounds ridiculous, but that's what happened."
Ms. Quartararo declined to identify the employee in the department's finance office.
She added that the department had announced the bidding in a newsletter published by the state that lists available state contracts. Any bank that had seen the listing and asked for an application could have bid, she said.
In addition to the $50,000 contribution, the Republican State Committee has received two others from MBNA: one for $20,000 on Oct. 22, 1996, and another for $100,000 on March 5, 1997. MBNA and its executives have also given more than $300,000 to political committees controlled by Mr. D'Amato. The Senator is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, giving him great influence over any banking legislation that MBNA supports.
In response to questions about the card contract, Terry O'Brien, a spokesman for the Republican State Committee, said in statement, "The State Committee does not involve itself in governmental or policy decisions, nor will it."
David Spartin, an MBNA vice chairman, said there was "absolutely no connection" between the contract and contributions.
"The fact that we were selected is not that unusual," he said. "We have 5,000 organizations that endorse us." But he acknowledged that the "affinity market is very competitive."
While Ms. Quartararo said the search for an issuer was done properly, some credit card consultants disagreed. Michael Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting Group in Westbury, N.Y., said it was likely that other issuers would have sought the account.
"If they did it right, they would have gotten a lot more than one response," Mr. Auriemma said. "In order to guarantee that you get the best deals, you want to talk to different players."
Other credit card issuers said they would not discuss the fees they paid for affinity cards, or comment on those in the "I Love New York" deal.
But when South Orange, N.J., began sponsoring an affinity card a few years ago, it received $5 for each new card in the first year or so of the deal with Valley National Bank, said the village president, William Calabrese. New York receives $1 per new card.
After the first year, South Orange's fee has been 1 percent of sales on the card.
In 1995, the Giuliani administration considered sponsoring a New York City affinity credit card, though it eventually decided not to because it was concerned that people might think that the city was the actual issuer of the card or was responsible for debt on it.
But before the plan was canceled, several issuers had said they would consider bidding for the card, said John S. Dyson, a senior adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"There was a healthy interest in it," Mr. Dyson said.

HEADLINE: In a Post-Nuclear Town, Some Adjustments Hurt

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: WISCASSET, Me., July 9

 BODY:
Things change when a place goes post-nuclear.
Almost a year ago, Maine Yankee, the state's only nuclear plant and once New England's biggest electricity producer, stopped generating power here for good, to the joy of nuclear opponents, the regret of the townfolk who depended on its taxes and jobs, and the pain of its hundreds of workers.
The 25-year-old plant had long been one of the most divisive issues in Maine and had survived three referendums on closing it over the years. But ultimately, it was stopped not by politics but by economics: plagued by safety concerns and with electricity deregulation coming on, it could no longer operate competitively, its owners decided. 
 That ending was also the beginning of a new phase, one that is becoming ever more common in host towns around the country as aging nuclear plants shut down and the nuclear industry withers.
Tensions dissipate, these towns find, but new problems arise, from economic woes to worry over nuclear waste.
The closing of Maine Yankee brought heartfelt relief to those residents who had worried that the warning sirens would break the coastal calm here with a nuclear alert.
But the towns that are home to the country's remaining 107 nuclear plants might do well to note what Wiscasset and more than 20 other spots where plants have been closed are finding out: all is not resolved with the flick of a switch.
Some of the adjustment is economic. In Wiscasset, the uncomfortable pinch of belt-tightening comes across even through Maine stoicism.
"No one is jumping out of windows," said Robert Blagden, Wiscasset's First Selectman, the closest thing the town has to a mayor. "It's not like a stock market crash."
But Maine Yankee used to pay something like 96 percent of the taxes for Wiscasset, a town of 3,500 on Route 1 that bills itself as "The Prettiest Little Village in Maine" and may not be too far off, with its fine old sea captains' houses and seaweed-podded old pilings. This year, Mr. Blagden said, the plant will go from paying Wiscasset nearly $13 million to about $6 million, and townspeople's taxes will rise to make up much of the gap. Property taxes are expected to double if not triple.
So great was the town's dependence on Maine Yankee's jobs, purchases and taxes that Raymond Shadis, the plant's nemesis and spokesman for the anti-nuclear "Friends of the Coast-Opposing Nuclear Pollution," bitingly calls Wiscasset a "cargo cult," willing to worship the nuclear plant in exchange for its bounty.
The bounty was plentiful. Wiscasset schools spent a luxurious $12,000 per pupil, the town has a new multimillion-dollar community center, it had free ambulance service and its roads have been thoroughly rebuilt.
"It was like living in fairyland," said John Chester, a local freelance writer who serves on a community panel advising Maine Yankee on its shutdown. "Everything you wanted, you got."
Not anymore. The most direct losses have fallen to the plant employees themselves. Maine Yankee had 480 full-timers when it closed. Their numbers have been reduced to 166 employees who are maintaining the plant and preparing it for decommissioning, said Maureen Brown, the plant's spokeswoman. About 100 of those who left retired, she said over lunch at "Fission Chips," the plant's little restaurant. In general, she said, about 60 percent of those who found new jobs have moved away.
In what used to be Maine Yankee's information center -- and was rapidly converted into its career center last August -- paper balloons tacked to the wall list the names of former workers who have had to go on to new lives, and most of them carry destinations linked with other plants far away: Point Beach in Wisconsin, Millstone in Connecticut, Vermont Yankee.
The plant held 78 job fairs and hundreds of counseling sessions, Ms. Brown said, and in general is determined to make its decommissioning a model for other plants, both technically and in human terms.
But there are still workers like Jim Weast, a 27-year veteran of the plant, an engineer, licensing expert and its former assistant operations manager, who says he has found, "No one wants to hire a 50-year-old." He has had a chance to work at the Millstone plant in Connecticut, which was recently permitted to reopen after safety concerns shut it for two years, but "that would be out of the frying pan into the fire," he said.
"Nuclear power is dead, has been dead for a long time, and the public doesn't realize it," Mr. Weast said, sounding more sad than bitter.
For Wiscasset and the surrounding area, the economic losses include not only jobs but the money that employees would have spent locally, along with the occasional influx of hundreds of contractors when the plant was preparing to re-start, and its purchases of incidentals like office supplies.
"There's a huge ripple effect," said State Senator Marge Kilkelly, who heads the community panel on the shutdown.
Though life styles must change, she said, that ripple will fade eventually, and Wiscasset's nuclear era will pass quietly into history just as its shipping heyday and railroad heyday passed: "So be it," she said.
But the biggest Maine Yankee concern now is a problem that will not pass so easily: the high-level radioactive waste that the plant produced. It does not seem as if the Federal Government is going to find a repository for it any time soon. At this point, plant officials say, the Government has promised to begin picking up Maine Yankee's high-level waste a decade or two into the 21st century, but many do not count on it.
Until then, despite the Federal obligation to dispose of the 1,432 spent-fuel assemblies weighing more than 1,500 tons, it stays here, where it is Maine Yankee's, and Wiscasset's, problem. Maine Yankee is suing the Government over the waste, but the many here expect the plant to become one of more than 100 unexpected waste dumps around the country, wherever plants are.
W. Donald Hudson Jr., a member of the community panel and president of the Chewonki Foundation, a major environmental education center that with 150 workers may soon employ more people than nearby Maine Yankee, predicts the waste will be here long, long after 2050. If that is the case, he said, it is up to the plant and Wiscasset to figure out how to store it safely for hundreds of years.
"The drum I keep beating is, how are we going to come up with a system of managing something for a minimum of 500 human generations?" Dr. Hudson asked. "The pyramids are only 150 human generations old, and we've got to make something to last at least 500."
Waste storage, however, is only one of the issues to arise in the complex process of decommissioning. Mr. Shadis, a sculptor who is probably Maine's best-known and most unrelenting opponent of nuclear power, has raised handfuls of other concerns. They range from the possibility that "hot" waste had been trucked to the town dump (none has been found) to questions about whether the plant's eventual demolition would involve blowing up concrete structures that could contain radioactivity "and you wouldn't know until you had a cloud of concrete dust sailing across the river."
But, Mr. Shadis said, some of the fire has gone out of the fight, and Maine Yankee has become more open than ever before, even allowing him to read its file of "Radiological Incident Reports" of spills over the years. His side has lost ardor, as well, he said: When the plant was closed and he sent out invitations to a celebration, out of a mailing list of 7,000, only 200 or 250 responded.
And recently, he said, as he pressed a point at a community panel meeting, a top Maine Yankee official told him to let go, adding, "Ray, you've won."

HEADLINE: Engines Roaring, Pagers Beeping;
Middle Class Leads a Renewed Romance With Biker Culture

SERIES: RITES OF SUMMER: Urban Riders

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It was not exactly the biker image Hunter S. Thompson described in "Hell's Angels": gangs of burly guys flashing earrings, armpits and chain whips, barreling through traffic "like a burst of dirty thunder."
The dozen riders who roared through the West Village one night last week included a surgeon whose leather jacket has a special pocket for his hospital beeper; an engineer from Pennsylvania with two small children, and a former New Jersey police officer turned computer analyst wearing a "Ride Nude" T-shirt. Vicki Rossetti, 36, who works for an insurance company, was along and not on the back of her boyfriend's bike -- she commands her own black Harley-Davidson Sportster. 
 Weaving through taxis, Jeffrey Hicken, an advertising art director, turned to the rider on the back of his Harley and yelled, "To tell you the truth, I don't even know who a lot of these guys are."
The Hooligans, a loose collection of middle-class motorcycle fanatics, had picked up a crowd. And it was not the first time since the weather turned warm. It happens nearly every time they roam these days around New York, a city in the middle of a renewed romance with biker culture.
Steve Manes, a Web site developer who sometimes rides with the group, calls it "the summer of the motorcycle in New York," and there is ample evidence to support the claim.
Consider: More than 100 bikers from around New York descended on the Guggenheim Museum one night last month for the opening of "The Art of the Motorcycle," an exhibit of motorcycle design from the 1860's to the present that runs through Sept. 20. The museum's well-heeled neighbors on the Upper East Side complained that the patrons were racing their motors.
In many neighborhoods, garage space reserved for motorcycles is full, because more people are buying motorcycles and because the city has begun to crack down on an increasing number of motorcycles illegally parked between cars and on traffic islands.
Classes for the city's best-known motorcycle safety course are booked through the summer, and the school's director, Gasper Trama, who has trained the likes of Liam Neeson, Matthew Broderick and Alan Alda, said the demand is the highest he has seen in several years.
Manhattan's motorcycle-friendly bars -- Hogs and Heifers in the meatpacking district, the Ear Inn in SoHo, Red Rock West in Chelsea, American Trash on the Upper East Side and Barcode in the East Village -- are all seeing larger crowds of bikers.
And, in perhaps the quintessential confirmation of a New York City trend, people are angry. Those who live within earshot of the biker bars have begun to complain about the noise, particularly the screams emitted by motorcycles with illegally altered mufflers called drag pipes, which are loud enough to trigger car alarms.
Hundreds of Chelsea residents along 10th Avenue signed a petition to the police complaining about the noise. Arthur W. Strickler, the district manager of the community board that represents SoHo and the West Village, said the board is considering asking the City Council to ban motorcycles from the neighborhood altogether, though it admits such a ban would probably never work. Short of that, he said, the board is pushing for fines even steeper and stricter than those enacted by the City Council last year for excessive noise.
Mr. Strickler calls drag pipes, which he concedes are used by only a loud minority of bikers, "one of these macho, sicko ways of saying, 'Here I am, look at me!' "
But why, so many years after "Easy Rider," does motorcycling suddenly seem to be cool again in the city?
Veteran riders, for whom it has never been uncool, say interest has actually been building in New York for the past four or five years, driven by some of the same factors that have pushed motorcycle sales up 43 percent around the country since 1991.
The hellbent-for-leather image of biking has softened, and the pastime is now attracting a new segment of older, more affluent riders eager to motorcycle through the midlife crisis or see the country. The healthy economy also means more money is available to consumers for such expensive toys. (Brand-new motorcycles can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000.)
But in New York, riders say, the popularity has also grown as parking and maintaining a car in the city have become more expensive and traffic has become more nightmarish. Motorcyclists cannot only squeeze -- sometimes illegally -- right through midtown gridlock, but they can roll into the country on weekends while cars are still crammed in the tunnels. And they can do it at 46 miles to the gallon or better.
"Basically, we're just ordinary taxpaying citizens trying to save a little on gas and get where we're going," said Susan Buck, the East Coast editor of Thunder Press, a monthly Harley-Davidson enthusiast magazine.
Then, of course, there's the fact that it is just undeniably cool to be riding a motorcycle on the streets of Manhattan. Mark Novitz, a 30-year-old computer analyst who bought his first BMW motorcycle three years ago, vowed never to use it to get around the city because he considered it too dangerous, "but that fell apart in a couple of weeks," he said.
"Going through the Helmsley Building tunnel on Park Avenue or up Riverside Drive to Grant's Tomb -- on a bike it's just a completely different thing," he said.
Kyrie Collins, an aspiring entrepreneur who waits tables at Moomba, the West Village restaurant, said simply and only somewhat facetiously: "I know I look good on my bike."
Ms. Collins, 35, has been riding for 11 years and despite being seriously injured four years ago while touring California, she said she never really considered not climbing back on her sleek gray Moto Guzzi. "People ride in New York because it makes them unique," she said recently, her bike lined up with about 40 others during a regular Tuesday night conclave at the Ear Inn. "It makes me run solo in a city of eight million."
She added: "It's also deeply erogenous. It's always been a male bike to me. So I guess what I'm saying basically is -- it's all about sex."
Diane Howells, who took up motorcycles two years ago and loved them so much that she recently made a documentary film about women riders, said motorcycling, at the very least, makes the city friendlier. "People come over and talk to you about your bike," she said. And suddenly, "you're part of a clique."
Of course, the cliques don't always see eye to eye. The rivalries are much gentler than those between, say, warring Hell's Angels. But longtime riders are often disdainful of new riders with a tendency to show off. Riders who spend their weekends on road trips through Pennsylvania or upstate New York disparage those who buy bikes to cruise slowly around Manhattan bars.
Riders who buy lightning-fast, colorful sport bikes -- such as Italian Ducatis and British Triumphs -- sometimes depict Harley-Davidson owners as passe. Middle-class riders tend to refer to younger, inner-city riders -- who are usually on smaller street bikes, dressed in T-shirts and shorts, and prone to popping wheelies -- as "squids."
And, while no one will admit to being one, everyone seems to disparage riders they call RUB's -- rich urban bikers -- who buy $40,000 custom-made specialty bikes like Titans or Californias simply because they can afford them.
"English Don" Cornwallis, a well-known New York motorcycle builder, blames RUB's for the growing sentiment against motorcycles in many neighborhoods. "In recent years the motorcycle has become the new gotta-have toy for the urban classless rich," he wrote in a city biker newspaper. "These idiots are the perpetrators of the loud pipes and ridiculous showboating around these bars."

HEADLINE: Few in Van, If Any, Wore Seat Belts

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
A van that crashed Friday evening on a Pennsylvania highway, killing two Brooklyn girls on their way home from a day-camp outing, was overcrowded and none of its occupants were wearing seat belts, camp counselors who were in the van and state troopers said yesterday.
The accident, on Interstate 80 in Jackson Township, Pa., about 80 miles northwest of New York City, killed two girls, age 6 and 7, who had been crowded with 18 other children and 4 adults into a van designed to carry only 15 people, the Pennsylvania State Police said. Most of the occupants were asleep and many were thrown from the van when the driver fell asleep and lost control of the vehicle about 5:25 P.M., witnesses said. Only one person in the van, Najier Matthews, a 6-year-old girl, was uninjured. 
 As the state police continued their investigation, parents, including the father of one of the dead girls, questioned whether proper safety precautions had been taken. "Grieving is going to take a long time," said the father, Michael Channell, describing the loss of his daughter Michael Marie Channell. "But after we are done grieving, we are going to address whether there was overcrowding on the van and if there was a lack of seat belts."
The other girl who died was Janine Ocean, 7, the Pennsylvania State Police said.
The state police identified the driver of the van as Gary R. Huggins, 24. He was not injured. Officials at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation in Brooklyn, which operates the day camp that the children attended, described him as an employee on the corporation's security and transportation staff. He has a valid chauffeur's license and a clean driving record, according to records at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Mr. Huggins returned home to Brooklyn and, distressed by the accident, was placed under sedation, the officials said.
Seven children and two counselors remained hospitalized in Pennsylvania yesterday, said Roderick Mitchell, the president of the restoration corporation, a community development group. All nine were expected to recover, he said. Hospital officials said one child remained in critical condition while the others who remained under care were in stable or satisfactory condition. The other passengers were treated and released and they returned to Brooklyn yesterday afternoon.
Among them was Nickida Amsterdam, 7, whose left arm was broken in the crash and was put in a cast. Her mother, Fiona, traveled to Pennsylvania on Friday night with other parents to be with their injured children. "I went out last night and after seeing what happened, I believe my daughter is lucky to be alive," Ms. Amsterdam said. "Right now she is in shock. She hardly says anything."
One camp counselor, Patricia D. Parrish, 22, said that the adult supervisors had given little consideration to the number of children in the van and that it had not appeared to be overcrowded. The van held the youngest campers, most between the ages of 5 and 8, she said, while older campers had ridden in a school bus that was not involved in the crash.
"They were small children -- they all fit," Ms. Parrish said in an interview at Community Medical Center in Scranton, Pa., where she was waiting to have surgery on her left hand, which was broken in two places.
"Now I think there should have been less kids," she said, holding her daughter, Shaquasha Chambers, who was slightly injured in the crash. "But it wasn't uncomfortable."
The campers had spent the day at Knoebels Amusement Park in Elysburg, Pa., and many were still wet from the park's water rides when they climbed aboard the blue Ford Econoline van for the drive home. Witnesses said that most of them were asleep when the driver also nodded off, ramming the rear of a Saturn sedan.
The van spun wildly out of control, slammed into an embankment and flipped onto its side.
Mr. Mitchell and other officials with the Bedford-Stuyvesant development group declined to comment on reports that the van had been overcrowded and that the children had not worn seat belts, saying they first wished to read a complete accident report by the Pennsylvania State Police. Mr. Mitchell also expressed gratitude to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Office of Emergency Management, which helped transport parents to Pennsylvania.
Donald S. Sutton, a spokesman for the corporation, said the driver of the van, Mr. Huggins, had a long affiliation with the group and had attended the same camp as a child.
"As best we can see, he is an experienced driver," he said. "He is under sedation. He is obviously very, very distressed about what has happened." The driver, he said, had not been charged "with any infraction in Pennsylvania."
A state police dispatcher said no more information would not be released until the investigation into the accident was completed.
Mr. Channell said he had identified his daughter's body at Lehigh Valley Hospital, where he had first seen a pastor. He said he had asked the priest, "Do I need to prepare for the worst?" When the priest nodded, Mr. Channell said, "I knew then that I had lost my little girl." Mr. Channell said his older daughter, Danielle, had also been on the trip but was riding in the bus, not the van.
Describing his daughter Michael, who would have turned 7 on Tuesday, Mr. Channell said: "She is a very sweet, very special little girl, so full of love. She looked forward to everything. She would say, 'I love you, Papa Bear,' and I would call her my baby bear. She and her sister were always making friends, always outside playing. Michael was just so full of love."
"Michael knew she was always supposed to belt herself in," he said. "We always belted our kids in. We didn't want to lose either of them. We want to start finding out what happened and why."

HEADLINE: YIELDING TO WEST, I.M.F. WILL DOUBLE RUSSIA LOAN OFFER

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 11

 BODY:
The international effort to calm Russia's shaky financial markets began to fall into place today, as negotiators sought to complete talks on more than $12 billion in new loans.
The International Monetary Fund has informed Russian officials that it is now prepared to lend about $11 billion, Russian officials said. About half the sum would be provided up front and the rest would be disbursed by the end of this year. 
 I.M.F. officials initially discussed $5.6 billion in new loans. But the fund increased its financing package under pressure from the United States Treasury Department and Western investors. Russian and I.M.F. officials said they hoped to complete their talks before the financial markets open on Monday.
In parallel talks, the World Bank and Russian officials hammered out an agreement today on a new loan that will range between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, Russian and Western officials said.
The World Bank accord requires the Russians to introduce more competition in their gas and electrical sectors, which have been dominated by powerful monopolies. It also lays the groundwork for the reform of Russia's railways and encourages further privatization of state-owned enterprises, among other measures.
Reflecting the urgency of Russia's financial crisis, Michael Carter, the head of the World Bank office here, finished talks with his Russian counterparts at 1 A.M. The accord was then E-mailed to Washington at 4 A.M. for formal approval by the World Bank's management. The intensive round-the-clock negotiations have taken place against a background of deep concern over Russia's financial crisis.
Anxiety over rising interest rates, the backlog of unpaid wages and shrinking Central Bank reserves has become so great that it has begun to rattle the Kremlin. President Boris N. Yeltsin has gone so far as to issue public warnings against coup attempts, asserting that he commands enough loyalty from the military to put down any "extremist" challenges to his power.
Concerned about the deteriorating Russian economy, the Clinton Administration has prodded the I.M.F. to increase the size of its loan, to keep its demands on the Russians realistic and to bring the negotiations to a close. Washington's main fear is that a devaluation of the ruble would unleash a fresh round of inflation, undercut Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his team of reformers and destabilize Russia.
But to negotiate agreements with international financial institutions is just part of the problem the Kremlin has been facing. The Yeltsin Government must still win approval of its deficit-cutting and tax-reform measures from the Communist-dominated Parliament. It is also trying to negotiate $10 billion in loans from Western commercial banks, in hopes of bringing the total financial package to more than $20 billion.
President Yeltsin met today with top aides to discuss strategy. The aides included Prime Minister Kiriyenko; Sergei Dubinin, the chairman of the Central Bank; Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov; and Anatoly Chubais, the lead negotiator with the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
"The President on the whole approved the progress of the talks and instructed a completion of the talks in a compressed period," a statement from the Kremlin said.
The main focus today was on the talks with the I.M.F. The lead fund negotiator, John Odling-Smee, arrived in Moscow on Friday evening, and appears to have been locked in intensive negotiations ever since.
Russian and I.M.F. officials are near to settling a paramount question of how much and how quickly to cut the federal deficit. They have been trying to resolve differences over amendments that the fund insists be attached to the tax code submitted to Parliament.
When Russia's financial crisis began to deepen in May, Mr. Odling-Smee was openly skeptical of the need for more assistance. And he was described by one person in the talks as negotiating "efficiently but without much pleasure."
The World Bank accord concluded today seeks to advance market reforms in several respects. But it would not require the breakup of Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly and one of the last symbols of Soviet power. Suggestions that Gazprom be broken up to foster competition have been denounced by the Communists as a Western plot to destroy what remains of Russian industry.
The World Bank accord would, however, change the tax system to make it easier for other gas producers to enter the market.
To make the company's finances more transparent, financial accounting of Gazprom's gas production operation are to be separated from the accounting for its pipeline operations. The World Bank accord also aims to open Russia's electrical sector to private investment.
To encourage more privatization, the accord would reduce the number of so-called strategic state enterprises that cannot be sold off.
Many of these reforms will take months, if not years, to carry out. Achieving them will be the litmus test for the young Kiriyenko team."The Government has been given a chance," one Western specialist said. "But now it has to make a sustained effort. The key thing is to make this work."

HEADLINE: Kennelly Talks Openly About Her Campaign's Problems

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: WILTON, Conn., July 10

 BODY:
United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, the Democratic candidate for governor of Connecticut, has startled supporters and opponents alike by breaking a cardinal rule for surviving poor poll showings. Instead of dismissing them, she has acknowledged bluntly that they spell trouble, and has agonized publicly about how to fix them.
"It's going to be a long summer," she told a group of supporters recently. "Has it been rough? It's been rough and tough." Later, when a caller to a statewide radio program told her it was time to get moving on her campaign, she asked: "What would you suggest I do?" 
 Mrs. Kennelly, 62, is challenging the one-term incumbent, John G. Rowland, a Republican, who at 41 is the nation's youngest Governor. The governor's race will officially begin Monday, when Mr. Rowland leads a caravan on a four-stop tour to formally announce his candidacy. Saturday, Mrs. Kennelly is to be nominated at the Democratic State Convention. But Mrs. Kennelly is already quick to acknowledge problems.
Last Thursday, financial reports revealed that Mr. Rowland had broken the state record for fund-raising for a gubernatorial campaign, collecting $4.3 million, more than twice as much as Mrs. Kennelly. During the last three months, normally a time to hoard money for television commercials in the fall, Mrs. Kennelly's campaign just broke even.
Mrs. Kennelly, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, started her race in a dead heat with Mr. Rowland. But recent polls showed Mr. Rowland with a huge lead in a state where registered Democrats substantially outnumber Republicans. A University of Connecticut poll taken June 23 to July 1 showed Mr. Rowland leading Mrs. Kennelly 55 percent to 27 percent and a Quinnipiac College poll taken June 16 to 22 put Mr. Rowland at 56 percent and Mrs. Kennelly at 32 percent.
Munching calamari during a break in 14 hours of campaigning on Tuesday, Mrs. Kennelly (pronounced (ken-NELL-ee) said that polls are more significant to candidates than most let on. "Everything runs off the polls," she said. "They drive media coverage, and they drive fund-raising. The cliche is that the election isn't held until November. But that isn't modern politics."
Dennis W. Johnson, the associate dean of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University in Washington, said it was very unusual for a major candidate to offer such a pessimistic public face. "Voters don't want to hear a candidate whine," he said. "Voters like a leader who's tough and breaks through the barriers," he said. "You're not going to catch fire if you make it sound like it's over."
Mrs. Kennelly, a lifelong Hartford resident, is no political novice. Her father, John M. Bailey, was the national Democratic chairman under President Kennedy. Her husband, James J. Kennelly, who died in 1995, was Speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives, and her brother, John M. Bailey, is the Chief State's Attorney. After raising four children, she was elected to the Hartford City Council in 1975 and as the Connecticut Secretary of the State in 1978. She won her seat in Congress in 1982. She was so happy working behind the scenes in the House that she did not have a press secretary for the first 13 of her 16 years on Capitol Hill.
On Tuesday, Mrs. Kennelly announced that Joseph D. Courtney, a former state representative, had agreed to run as her choice for lieutenant governor, after a string of better-known Democrats had taken themselves out of the running during her long public search. The announcement should have generated political excitement. Instead, Mrs. Kennelly faced a grilling on Tuesday night at the monthly meeting of the Democratic committee in Wilton.
Bruce Redman Becker, an architect and developer in Wilton, began the question-and-answer session by saying, "What I'm eager to hear is what magic strategy you have to shake things up." Mrs. Kennelly replied that she and Mr. Courtney "both love substance; we love policy."
"It's very difficult with the press to get attention in that direction," she said. "We're trying very, very hard. I wish I could buy $1 million on New York City television right now."
Michael A. Slutsky, a Wilton lawyer, said he appreciated her support for education and the environment, but he added, "I'm looking for a defining issue." Mrs. Kennelly responded by talking for the first time that night about transportation problems.
Mrs. Kennelly's supporters complain that she has not aggressively worked the state's 169 Democratic town committees. Mrs. Kennelly blames her straits on what she sees as Mr. Rowland's recent attention to issues she has been pushing all along, including health care for poor children, the preservation of open space and ways to rein in the cost of attending state colleges. "He's done a 180 on everything," she often tells audiences. And she says, "He has the bully pulpit."
In an interview, Mrs. Kennelly said her candor was deliberate. "I am not a politician's candidate," she said. "What your political pundits would say is my problem is I don't spin. What you see is what you get. What you hear is what it's about. I'm probably brutally honest, with myself and with others."
Political analysts, however, said that few candidates can survive the combination of a vague message and poor delivery. Terry P. Michael, the executive director of the Washington Center for Politics and Journalism, a nonpartisan group, said Mrs. Kennelly's candor could be effective. "You can be unslick," he said. "Voters relate to that -- that's a good message. But you have to communicate that as a strategic message."
State Democratic leaders had spent months persuading her to run, believing that her connections, her record in Congress on health and children's issues and her wide margins of victory in her Congressional district would enable her to unify their party.
These party leaders had believed that she could give Mr. Rowland a tough battle by publicizing assertions that he has used state resources to benefit his supporters. Even some strategists for Mr. Rowland at first had feared Mrs. Kennelly's entry, worrying he might be vulnerable to a candidate who is a woman.
But Mrs. Kennelly had been warned otherwise by none other than President Clinton, who revealed at a fund-raiser last month that he had tried to dissuade her.
"You've virtually got to have a lobotomy, and you can get re-elected if the economy is good if you're governor," Mr. Clinton said in his remarks after a lunch at Martha Stewart's studio in Westport. (He did hasten to add that he meant no offense to Mr. Rowland.) "I told her the truth. I said, 'This is like rolling a rock up a hill if the economy is good.' "
It has not been an easy campaign. For all her experience, Mrs. Kennelly's speaking ability has never been tested in a campaign because she has not faced serious opposition in the First Congressional District, which is centered in Hartford. Mrs. Kennelly has now become known for her convoluted and sometimes puzzling sentences. "I've been everywhere in Connecticut, and everywhere is wonderful," Mrs. Kennelly said at one point. Another time, she observed, "Now we have to figure out if we have to get beyond what we have to get beyond."
She often speaks so rapidly that she can be hard to understand, and she frequently employs the stuffy vocabulary of the bureaucracy.
Mr. Rowland, on the other hand, is a voluble pol who plays up his pizza-and-beer image. But Mr. Rowland said he did not think voters would base their decision on personality. "People are going to see that this race is about the past versus the future," he said on Thursday.
Mr. Rowland was calling from Block Island, R.I., where he was vacationing at his family's summer home. He had just caught a 38-pound striped bass, and called himself "happy as a clam at high tide."
And he has plenty of reason. The state's economy has rebounded, although not as smartly as the nation's, and most state taxpayers are getting rebate checks this summer. In his announcement speech on Monday, Mr. Rowland plans to tout a record of "tax cuts, balanced budgets, job growth and prosperity."
Mrs. Kennelly's aides settled this week on a media strategy that they consider risky but necessary. While Mr. Rowland blitzes the state with television advertising about "building a better Connecticut," she plans to buy little advertising time until September. Throughout the summer, she hopes to attract news coverage of her challenges to Mr. Rowland on the issues of education, ethics and the environment.
Taking a break from fund-raising calls this week, Mrs. Kennelly said she is "obviously not what the press wants, but I think when I get out on Main Street, I'm very much what they want."
"I really thought the state could do better, and I think we're not preparing for the future as we should," she said, sounding wistful. "I thought I could come home and discuss the issues and say what I thought was not going well and what could go better. And that's what I'm doing."

H.M.O.'s Pull Out of Medicaid And Medicare in Some States

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

 BODY:
Employers give health maintenance organizations the credit for stopping inflation in the cost of their workers' health benefits, and Congress and the Clinton Administration want them to do the same for their big benefit programs -- Medicaid, for the poor, and Medicare, for the elderly. 
 But blaming inadequate reimbursements for their services, leading H.M.O.'s have been pulling out of at least 12 states. Aetna U.S. Healthcare has dropped Medicaid programs in Connecticut and New York, leaving only New Jersey with one. Medicare beneficiaries are losing programs in 10 California counties and 22 in Ohio.
The move is more a trickle than a flood, with most of the managed care organizations still operating their programs. But President Clinton called the trend "disturbing."
The abandoned elderly have no choice but to return to more costly fee-for-service medicine, and the poor to "Medicaid mills" that provide inferior care. PETER T. KILBORN

A U.S. Bond That's Pegged To Inflation

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration rolled out a new type savings bond that it billed as inflation insurance for small investors -- or just folks searching for the right birthday/wedding/new baby gift.
The bonds' returns will rise and fall with consumer prices, eliminating the risk that inflation will wipe out the value of a 30-year security. 
 The new securities, which have all the tax benefits of traditional savings bonds, are to be sold in eight denominations from $50 to $10,000. Most of them, bearing the likenesses of such people as Helen Keller ($50) and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King ($100), go on sale this September. JAMES BENNET

HEADLINE: The Goodwill Games: Here Comes the Crowd

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
AT the Empress Diner in East Meadow, Mike Panagatos has canceled his staff's vacations and put on extra help as he braces for what he calls "organized bedlam."
"It's going to be like a Super Bowl type of thing," Mr. Panagatos said. "I've been to four Super Bowls. It's hard to get reservations and at every place you have to wait. We're expecting something like that. We have no convention center on Long Island, so we have never had anything like this before." 
 "This" is the Goodwill Games, which are coming to Long Island July 19 through Aug. 2. A total of 1,500 athletes from 60 countries will compete in the 15-day invitational event. Three Nassau County sites -- the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, the Mitchel Athletic Field in Uniondale and the new Goodwill Games Swimming and Diving Center at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow -- will be used for 9 of the competition's 15 events. The 6 other events will be at sites in Manhattan and Staten Island.
"We're going to be a very busy place for two weeks," said Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau. "This will be perhaps the biggest international event on Long Island, and the largest event the bureau has been involved with in our 18 years."
County and state officials have been planning for the onslaught, and several officials took pains to reassure county residents that they would experience little or no inconvenience from the games.
"I don't think Long Islanders are going to be inconvenienced," said John Kiernan, commissioner of Nassau County's Department of Recreation and Parks. "Traffic should not be a problem because of the plans that have been developed."
He added that more people have attended concerts in Eisenhower Park than are expected to attend the games at any one time.
Neil S. Yellin, president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Long Island Bus, was more circumspect. "We want to reduce the headache for everyone and make the games as convenient as possible," he said. But he did suggest that for Long Islanders not wishing to attend the games, it might be a good time to "go to the Hamptons."
The Goodwill Games, which have been held every four years since 1986, are the creation of Ted Turner, who wanted to repair some of the damage done by the tit-for-tat cold-war boycotts that marred the Summer Olympics in Moscow in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984.
He also wanted to fill air time on his Turner Broadcasting System, which will offer daily prime-time coverage in the United States and provide feeds to more than 130 countries. In addition, CBS and HBO will carry some events.
Such extensive coverage will affect Nassau County's attempts to woo other major sporting events and the big bucks they bring to the local economy. So it would help the organizers if the pool doesn't spring a leak and the athletes and fans aren't stuck in horrific traffic jams on the Meadowbrook Parkway.
The pool, which has been open since May, seems a safe bet. The traffic situation is a little dicier. Mr. Yellin said that fans are expected to file through Long Island turnstiles as many as 250,000 times during the games.
"The first five days will be the busiest because all three venues will be in use those days at about the same time," Mr. Yellin said. "Some start and finish close to each other. The challenge is moving spectators to and from the events during a short period of time. We have little flexibility because these events are on television and they have to start and conclude on time. I'm sure the big-name athletes will compete during prime time."
He was referring to such track stars as Michael Johnson and Jackie Joyner-Kersee and the figure skater Michelle Kwan.
Because most of the weekday events are scheduled to be held in prime time, Mr. Hollander said that he believed games-related traffic would not overlap with the evening rush-hour and that Long Island commuters would feel little impact.
Mr. Yellin said he had been working with the Nassau County Police Department to develop traffic mitigation programs. It includes deploying 18 to 20 message signs to direct people to the proper location, having a strong police presence to direct traffic and keeping tow trucks standing by to assist motorists in need.
Mr. Yellin said that because all of the venues can be reached from major roadways, the events should not disrupt local road traffic. But he suggested using the Southern State Parkway instead of the Long Island Expressway or Northern State Parkway to avoid traffic headed to or from the games.
Mr. Yellin said a key concern was parking. The venues themselves have a large amount of parking spaces, he said, and additional parking areas are being made available from which free shuttle buses will operate.
The organizers are estimating that only 12 percent of those attending the games will take public transportation. To encourage spectators to use public transportation, the Long Island Rail Road is to provide free passes to the Hempstead and Westbury stations; free buses would then take passengers to the events.
A spokeswoman for the L.I.R.R., Susan McGowan, said free passes are distributed with the purchase of any event ticket costing more than $10. But she cautioned that the rail pass must be requested at the time the sports ticket is purchased and that it must be exchanged for a regular ticket at staffed Long Island Rail Road ticket offices. The passes themselves will not be honored by conductors, she stressed.
Ms. McGowan said that there are currently no plans to add extra trains for the games, but that such service might be added if it is warranted by ticket sales.
Regardless of how smoothly they are handled, the crowds will mean some Nassau County merchants will make a bundle.
Mr. Panagatos hopes to be one of them. His 215-seat diner at 2490 Hempstead Turnpike is close to all three venues.
"We expect an influx of people from the local area and from out of town," Mr. Panagatos said, adding that a lot of money will be pumped into the Island's economy during the 15-day event "and we hope to get a piece of it."
Hoteliers seem assured of a good two weeks. "Every hotel room in Nassau County is booked for a three-week period," Mr. Kiernan said. There are 8,000 hotel rooms in the county. An additional 4,000 to 5,000 hotel rooms in western Suffolk County are also booked, Mr. Hollander said.
Frank D'Andrea, director of group sales at the Long Island Marriott in Uniondale, says the games brought the hotel its single largest group sales contract since it opened in 1982. The $1.3 million contract is to feed 25,000 individual meals to 1,700 athletes and staff, about half of whom will be staying at the hotel, over 18 days.
Joseph P. Cilia, general manager of the Roosevelt Field mall, said sales have been good this summer "and we hope the additional traffic from the games will add to it."
He said a directory listing the location and phone numbers of all 270 stores at Roosevelt Field would be distributed to area hotels, and that additional personnel have been assigned to information booths at the mall. He noted that hotels in the area already provide free shuttle buses to Roosevelt Field.
The mall, he said, can handle the added volume. "We're one of the largest malls in the country," he said. "We average 40,000 visitors a day."
Just how much money the Goodwill Games will generate for the Long Island economy is uncertain, according to Mitchell Pally, vice president of the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization. He said that when Nassau County and New York City jointly bid for the games in 1991, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey did a study that estimated the event would bring $250 million to the region.
"At the time, we weren't sure how many events would be on Long Island, and since then no other study has been done," Mr. Pally said. "But we see two impacts: it will put Long Island on the sports map for future events, and it will bring money to Long Island from visiting tourist-spectators and the Turner people."
To help make a good impression, visiting officials from national and international sporting organizations will be feted with a cocktail party and luncheon and each will get one of the 1,500 gift packages to be distributed to VIP's attending the games, according to Hilary Hartung, director of marketing for the Coliseum and hospitality co-chairwoman of the games. The packages will include pens, hats and shirts bearing the words, "Long Island 98, Good for You and the World."
The idea is "to get to the decision-makers who will decide to bring their athletes here in the future," Ms. Hartung said.
The new Swimming and Diving Center appears to be a prime candidate for repeat business from the purveyors of athletic extravaganzas. The heated pool, which is 68 meters long and holds 1.6 million gallons of water, is the second largest in the world, according to Nicholas A. Dellisanti, deputy commissioner of Nassau County Department of Recreation and Parks. By rearranging some moveable bulkheads in the pool, a diving competition could be staged at the same time two 25-meter swim meets are held, he said. There are 1,800 permanent seats at the pool and room for another 1,200 portables. The $30 million facility cost New York State $24 million; Nassau County paid the rest.
Indeed, the Swimming and Diving Center has already begun snaring other events, including the Girls High School State Swim Championships next fall, the Philips 66 Senior Swim Championships next March for those who will compete in the Olympics in the year 2000 and the Synchronized Swim Championships next spring, Mr. Kiernan said.
"We're building a sports infrastructure that will be part of the economic base of the county in the future," Mr. Kiernan said.
The athletic complex, newly refurbished at a cost of $22 million, has also started to pay off for the county. Mr. Pally said it helped snare the Empire State Games to be held next July. A total of 6,000 high school and college athletes will participate in the event.
"We never hosted them in their 20 years of existence," said Mr. Pally. "But they decided to come because they see what we can do."
Situated just one block west of the Coliseum, the athletic complex has a seating capacity of 12,000, half of which are permanent seats. It was used for the International Games for the Disabled, which attracted 3,500 athletes from 57 nations in 1984. But Mr. Dellisanti said the track, which was obsolete for this year's competition, was replaced with a nine-lane, 400-meter track. "We are going to be a sports mecca," he predicted.
Of the three venues, the Coliseum is the largest but perhaps the least inviting. Its main tenant, the Islanders hockey team, has been pushing for construction of a replacement for the old arena, which manages to be cavernous and too small at the same time. Nassau County has begun negotiations with the owners of the Islanders to develop a plan for a new arena-convention center.
"It's true that we could use a new facility," said Mr. Hollander of the Convention and Visitors Bureau. But, he insisted, "that does not get in the way of us being a sports mecca, because of all the other things we have."

HEADLINE: The Art of Crafts

BYLINE: By DIANE NOTTLE 

 BODY:
THERE are crafts fairs, and then there are crafts fairs. At many, all it takes to set up shop is a booth and some handiwork to sell. Then there are the juried shows, where exhibitors must convince judges that they do quality work before they're allowed to put the work on display (and up for sale.)
At these fairs, there are no bread-dough ornaments, no floppy-eared bunnies in old-fashioned dresses (well, relatively few). Instead, you may find handsome soft-sculpture mermaids, or wooden coat hooks carved and painted in the form of ballerinas in arabesque or Folies-Bergeres girls doing high kicks. 
 "The line has been erased as to what is art and what is craft," said Hortense Green of Westfield, who was the crafts coordinator of the State Council on the Arts for 15 years before leaving to work with the American Craft Council. "I hate labels, and there are many, many craftspeople who work in fiber or glass who are true artists."
Asked to estimate how many might be working in the state, Ms. Green said, "I honestly couldn't." With a laugh, she added: "I say we're going to sink from either potholes or crafts. New Jersey has been extremely active, and it's a marvelous area for crafts. We also have a very receptive and sophisticated audience."
The arts council last did a study of craftspeople in the 1980's, when Ms. Green identified 5,000 working in the state, said Carol Coren, director of communications for the arts council. Since then, the council has "focused our energies on a broader assessment of people who characterize themselves as working artists," Ms. Coren said, and today 47,000 New Jerseyans say they derive their primary income from the arts, including crafts.
At the turn of the century, the Arts and Crafts movement promoted the values of beauty and functionalism in fine handiwork. Now, as the 20th century comes to a close, some crafts artists see a revival.
"Little did I know I was on the edge of that," said Jim Fiola, a woodworker based in Branchville. When he started his business more than two decades ago, "there was nothing out there to show that other people were doing this," he said. "Then, starting in the mid-70's, these shows began to develop. They gave a market to thousands of people in all different types of media."
Today, "it's a very competitive business," said Mr. Fiola, who now exhibits only at juried crafts fairs. "Some shows have only 200 spots for 2,000 applicants, and they all do good work. You put up your slides, the judges sit there and sometimes they have less than five minutes to look at a piece and judge it. You have to make an impact in a very short time."
Crafts have found their way into galleries and museums. Mrs. Green helped develop the New Jersey Arts Annual exhibitions, involving six museums and equally divided between fine arts and crafts. New Jersey Designer Craftsmen, a nonprofit group founded in 1950 to promote fine craft work, has its own gallery in the New Brunswick Cultural Center and participates in other exhibitions statewide. Among them is "Handmade at the Shore," the current show of home furnishings and pottery at the Asbury Park gallery Cleopatra Steps Out.
Within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Layton, Sussex County, the Peters Valley Craft Education Center has seven working artists in residence, a full program of classes, and an annual juried festival, scheduled for Sept. 26 and 27 this year. On Tuesday, Governor Whitman visited the Peters Valley school as part of her efforts to promote tourism.
Despite its growth, the state's crafts industry remains essentially a collection of cottage industries. Artists by nature tend to work alone or in small groups. And most have traveled distinctly individual paths to their metiers.
 
CERAMICS
Out of the Military And Into Flowers
Back in the 1970's, while the crafts movement was burgeoning, Debra Betancourt was sitting at a computer panel where she "ran the war" for the Strategic Air Command during her eight years in the United States Air Force. These days, she sits behind a potter's wheel, shaping clay into lilies, orchids, peonies and especially irises, of which she recently finished No. 1100.
Last year, Ms. Betancourt won the best-in-show award in the ceramics category of the Lincoln Center Crafts Festival from the Montclair-based American Concern for Artistry and Craftsmanship. Her "Summer Vine" and "Marchioness" were displayed last spring as part of "Flora '98," a juried exhibition at Macculloch Hall Historical Museum in Morristown.
Her vases, candles and mugs are done in a style she considers "strictly sculptural and not strictly functional." Many of her vases, for example, are not closed containers. "Some of my customers are not ready to make the big leap, so some hold a little water," she said.
Her delicate-looking art actually grew out of her military life. "Because I had such a high-stress job, I was told to find a relaxing hobby," she said. "They did a profile on me, and I had always been good at art in school, so I was sent in that direction." After leaving the Air Force, she found that she could combine her career, her family life and her hobby into a workable package. By the time she was laid off from her job in 1991, she was ready to go into ceramics full time.
Recently she moved from a tiny 300-square-foot work space in Manville into a 1,400-square-foot storefront in Bound Brook, where she can be seen working in the window. She sells to 60 or 70 retail stores and galleries and now appears at major wholesalers' shows as well as 12 to 15 crafts fairs a year. Her prices range from $10 for mugs to $49 to $250 for irises to more than $1,000 for peonies and special pieces.
And she goes on inventing. "Pottery has been done to death," she said. "I like to think my work is right on the cusp."

METALWORK
Entomologist Manque With Wings of Silver
You might almost expect to see one of Ricky Boscarino's creations alighting on one of Ms. Betancourt's. Mr. Boscarino, of Luna Parc in Sandyston, Sussex County, makes bugs -- that is, finely wrought insects, mostly of sterling silver and bronze, to be worn as jewelry. And why not? He always wanted to be an entomologist.
"When I was a kid, I was really into biology," said Mr. Boscarino, 37, who was born in Paterson and grew up in Piscataway. "I always had a fascination with insects. I was going into it as a vocation, but I guess the right side of my brain took over, and years later, this is how it came out."
When he was about 14, he said, he became an apprentice to a jeweler in Summit, and by the time he entered Rhode Island School of Design, he was ready to major in metals.
The traditional metal smith's techniques he learned there were so time-consuming that "unfortunately, there's just no way of making a living," he said. Now he uses an ancient process called repousse, working with the metal on a bed of heated pitch, "like a gooey black tar."
"You can hammer into it and it gives," heo said. "It holds and forms the metal."
He estimates that only 1 percent of the metalworkers at crafts shows work in repousse. "It's so mysterious no one uses it," said Mr. Boscarino, who considers himself more of a sculptor than a jeweler. "That's why my work stand out. It's so voluptuous."
Besides insects, he also does a shoe line: "I happen to have a shoe fetish myself." His best, he said, is a saddle shoe in mixed metals. The shoes sell for $40 to $100, the insects from about $150 to $500.
A personal project right now is a garden of illuminated sculptures at his home, which he started about seven or eight years ago. "Some are quite tall, maybe 10 feet, and each one lights up in some way," he said. Who knows? Perhaps his illuminated sculptures will attract moths.

WOOD
A Career Devoted To Making Better Boxes
Saws can be heard buzzing in the background when someone answers the phone at Designer Craftsmen in Branchville, Warren County, where Jim Fiola and his two full-time assistants created the "Empress" chest seen all over Manhattan on posters for the Lincoln Center crafts festival in June. Despite the high visibility, Mr. Fiola describes his work in simple terms: "We make boxes."
Jewelry boxes make up 70 to 80 percent of the business; the rest consists of items like humidors, floppy disk holders, CD-ROM boxes and pen chests.
The "Empress" looks imposing on the poster, but in fact it measures only 20 by 14 by 9 inches. It sells for a hefty $650. Prices range for $36 for small boxes to $1,200 and up for what Mr. Fiola describes as "borderline pieces of furniture." Although more than 60 galleries throughout the country handle his work, he estimates that 70 percent of his sales are direct. "What makes it so interesting is not only the design and making of it, but putting it into the customer's hand," he said.
Like many craftspeople, Mr. Fiola is essentially self-taught. He wasn't sure what to do with his 1970 bachelor's degree in history, so like so many other young people in the 70's, he entered "the graduate school of life," traveling around the country. That led him to homesteading, which led to woodworking.
The early years were a struggle, Mr. Fiola admits, and "after 24 years, I feel I'm just getting the hang of it." "I still get a kick out of it. It's a labor of love."

GLASS
Little Pieces, Big Pieces: How They Fit Together
Rosemarie E. Mazzei makes glass. Michael Grant Solomon sometimes likes to break it.
Ms. Mazzei, who runs Distinguished Art Glass Studios in Great Meadows, works in fused glass. That means she takes layers of window glass; paints on them with ground glass and pigment, which turn to liquid at more than 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, and shapes them over terra-cotta molds. The glass pieces form a single piece when they cool, resulting in bowls, plates and lamps of clear glass with flowers and other designs apparently captured inside.
"I've painted all my life," said Ms. Mazzei, formerly an office manager for her husband's construction company. She has had no formal training beyond high school art classes. In 1990, on vacation in Maine, she walked into a fused-glass artist's studio and walked out with a calling.
She bought a kiln and spent a year experimenting. "I learned, 'This is not acceptable; this blows bubbles; this cracks,' " she said. "It took years before I had anything to take out of the house." When she did, she started going to crafts shows. Now she has five kilns, sells wholesale to galleries and is represented in the Museum of American Glass at Wheaton Village in Millville and other museums.
"Plates are what a lot of people buy, but what attracts me are the larger pieces," she said. Among her favorites are a large vase, about 13 inches high, with a variety of flowers, and her lamps.
Mr. Solomon calls his business Reflective Art, and he means it literally. The centerpiece of his work is usually one or more mirrors, framed by stained-glass mosaics or window frames with patinated finishes. Recently he showed two examples of the latter: "For the Roses," a window frame covered with three mirrored panes and three containing dried roses ($300) and "Winner Longest Drive," with six mirrored panels, one of which has been shattered by the golf ball still embedded in it ($250).
"They give those out as prizes for losers at tournaments," Mr. Solomon said. "The people who appreciate that that don't necessarily appreciate what I'm doing now with glass, but they smile."
Working with glass was "a hobby that just evolved," said Mr. Solomon, who taught himself the craft while working as a salesman for a printing company.
Feedback at crafts shows has been instrumental to the evolution of his work. "You're there and you're naked and you're in their world and their environment," he said. "And that pushes you to try and please them. It presses the evolution."

TEXTILES
Like Making Potholders, But What a Difference
"I'm on the road so much I don't know my neighbors," says Barbara Bass, a fiber artist who drops by her homes in Ocean, and Arizona between the juried crafts shows to which she travels every weekend. But even in hotel rooms, she works, carrying with her the frame on which she makes her Creations by "B."
"I do all types of fiber work, not just weaving or crocheting or knitting," she said. "I like to use very unusual yarns -- wools, mohairs, silks, linen, metallics." From them, she makes jackets, shawls, hats, scarves, collar hoods and fringe necklaces.
"It's very unique because I do everything on the frame, not a harness loom," she said. "It's like making potholders. I think the texture is very sensual. It's also very feminine."
Ms. Bass used to teach second and third grades but has been in the fiber business for 21 years now. She started with wall hangings, but "when the economy got bad, I found women would put things on their backs before their walls," she said.
Anyone who doubts that a little booth at a craft fair can turn into a big business might ask the proprietors of Blue Fish Clothing. In 1985, 17-year-old Jennifer Paige Barclay founded Blue Fish in her parents' garage "with $100 and a T-shirt and a block print," said Susan Flynn, the company's public affairs director. Now Blue Fish is the largest employer in Frenchtown, with 200 workers nationwide and five retail stores.
Ms. Barclay started at crafts fairs and she still goes to about a dozen selected fairs a year, including the local shad festival.
"We have customers who look forward to seeing us every year," Ms. Flynn said. "It's a way to bring a little of our retail operation to their backyard."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Bright Arrival At Kennedy

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
THE all-new Terminal 1 at Kennedy International Airport has already garnered critics' praise for its architecture. The people who built this international terminal for the owner airlines, Air France, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa and Korean Air, and those who work in it, seem in love with it. They stop frequently to point to views through certain windows, particular pieces of design, giant new gadgets.
The departure area is dazzling in its light and loftiness. The interior balcony offers good people-watching. But how will the terminal work for passengers at the airport where, as the signs all over Kennedy say, "America Greets the World"? 
 It is usually true that departing passengers see the best of an international airport, according to William N. Bodouva, the principal architect. Arrivals enter on the lower level -- the equivalent of steerage.
Since the departure level is dictated by the height of the airplane door, Mr. Bodouva said, getting people aboard without climbing is possible only from an upper level. The baggage removed from the plane is handled at ground level and so, then, are its owners.
At Terminal 1 passengers still arrive downstairs in the so-called sterile security-sealed lower corridor. But they do not set foot on United States soil in a windowless wooden-walled corridor with no light at the end, as has been the case at the old International Arrivals Building.
The inbound concourse leading to the Immigration and Customs area at Terminal 1 has a moving sidewalk along one wall, and windows along the other with a view over runways and the aircraft parking area. The ceiling is undeniably low -- "the sterile corridor is always a squeeze, but we softened it a little," Mr. Bodouva said, referring to electric-light coves cut into the ceiling. Then, when passengers turn left toward Immigration control, the overhead opens into a vast skylight.
The Immigration area has 34 booths leading to four luggage carousels and space for a fifth. This area and the Customs staff at five channels are designed to handle 2,200 passengers an hour.
 
Expanded Customer Service
Coincidental with the opening of Terminal 1 came a new amenity for all three New York area airports: On June 15, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey hired a staff of 235 customer service agents, suited them up in red jackets or vests and sent them to the airports, turning a formerly seasonal program into a year-round project. Five of Kennedy's 82 permanent multilingual greeters are assigned to Terminal 1 seven days a week on two shifts.
Andrew E. Kreek Jr., Kennedy's manager of landside services, said these helpers had instructions to approach people in difficulty and to be sure they found what they needed. They can direct people to taxi lines and provide guidance on fares. Seventy percent of the customer service people speak a second language, commanding among them at least 30 languages, including French, German, Japanese and Korean.
 
Numbers Instead of Names
All terminals at Kennedy but Tower Air's are being redesignated by numbers. Terminal 1, built on 36 acres formerly used by Eastern Airlines, is the first major terminal an arriving driver meets coming off the Van Wyck Expressway; the last ones on the outbound swing, used by American, are now identified as Terminals 8 and 9.
Terminal 1 cost $445 million, according to Dieter Bergt, the chief operating officer. Ground was broken in September 1995, although the old Eastern terminal was not yet completely demolished. Terminal 4, formerly International Arrivals, has lost some of its tenants and is also being renovated.
Terminal 1 has 96 check-in positions and 32 ticketing positions on four islands on the departure level. Each island bears the logo of one of the four tenant-owner lines. But Mr. Bergt said the computer systems allowed any airline to use any counter in case passenger lines backed up. Air Afrique, Olympic Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Singapore Airlines and Turkish Airlines are moving into the new terminal, too, and others may follow.
Debra Shore, the project manager for the Terminal 1 Group Association, particularly admires the features that give the new terminal the ability to serve several functions in tight quarters. She pointed to the design of 6 of the 11 plane-entrance ramps, called lofting bridges. Departing travelers and arriving international passengers may not be mixed, and this usually requires using separate gates, or walled-off walkways in the interior. The adjustable end of the lofting bridges is on the terminal side: the plane can stay in the same place during its turnaround, and at the terminal end the gate is lowered to disembark passengers at the lower level or raised for embarkation at the upper level.
 
Cash Machines Scarce
On a humbler scale, the A.T.M. situation at Terminal 1 is not optimal. There are to be only two cash machines, according to Kevin Corrigan, a spokesman for Airport Aviation Professionals. This organization served as adviser on concessions to the Terminal 1 Group Association. Both machines are provided by American Express. The one that was working June 22 charges users $1.50 a pop to get at their bank accounts. It is inside the security barrier, near the American Express money exchange counters and, naturally, the stores. The other is on the ground floor, outside the security barrier, where arriving passengers are met.
The terminal has lots of phones, including a good number on pedestals in the meet-and-greet area, where they are so often needed. The wall installations on the departure level, oddly, are all at wheelchair height, which makes the keypads hard to read for those who dial standing up.
The 6,000-square-foot duty-free shop, where one may not enter without a boarding pass, is run by International Shoppes. Because Terminal 1 is used only by international passengers, this store is able to hand the merchandise, including cigarettes and liquor, to the buyers right in the store. The shop emphasizes California wines, and has a good selection of American whiskies.
Also beyond the barrier are two small bars and snack bars, Brooklyn Brewery Pub and Napa Valley Wine Bar, and some stores. One that has just opened is an H. Stern jeweler.
First- and business-class passengers can use spiffy private lounges run by the individual airlines. The walls facing out are almost entirely glass, with varying views, some distant, some of waiting planes. There are plenty of easy chairs, tables with phones and modem outlets, phone booths or communications carrels, meeting rooms, and a couple of windowless rooms with recliners for naps. The host airlines, which serve countries where smoking is apparently unabated, have encapsulated smoking rooms within their lounges. V.I.P. rooms, useful for those who crave privacy (rock stars perhaps), are available on request.
Three lounges have showers: Air France, Lufthansa and Korean Air. Attendants will fetch towels from well-stocked linen closets. Japan Airlines has no shower, but provides high-tech bidets with adjustable water temperature. In addition to the usual coffee, snacks and alcoholic drinks, Lufthansa and Air France will serve dinner at tables in the lounge to first-class passengers taking late-evening flights who want to go straight to sleep once on board.
Air France has transferred its children's playroom, with a wooden plane suitable for small children to climb aboard, a fabric tunnel for floor crawling and other games, from its former terminal to the corridor near its lounge. To reach the lounge or the playroom, passengers must go through security. The children's area may be used by Air France economy passengers, too.
There will also be a play area for children of all departing passengers out in the open on the departure level. It was still being put together on June 22.
The food court area on the balcony outside the security barrier is also still being finished, although a self-service counter was open, selling coffee and small sandwiches and cakes. It's hard to discern what it will be like when the Greenwich Village Bistro and the like are up and running, but in spacious unfinished condition, the balcony revived two vivid memories. One was the Golden Door at Newark Airport in the 1950's, a restaurant whose name reminded visitors that America was the place of opportunity, and whose splendid food endowed the portal itself with romance. Another feeling, from an even earlier era, overcame me as I stood at the balcony edge looking over the concourse: the sense one got in the old Pennsylvania Station -- of purposeful people under a high, high roof going someplace exciting.

HEADLINE: A BOMBERS TALE: Taking Aim at Castro;
Key Cuba Foe Claims Exiles' Backing

BYLINE: By ANN LOUISE BARDACH and LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
A Cuban exile who has waged a campaign of bombings and assassination attempts aimed at toppling Fidel Castro says that his efforts were supported financially for more than a decade by the Cuban-American leaders of one of America's most influential lobbying groups.
The exile, Luis Posada Carriles, said he organized a wave of bombings in Cuba last year at hotels, restaurants and discotheques, killing an Italian tourist and alarming the Cuban Government. Mr. Posada was schooled in demolition and guerrilla warfare by the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1960's. 
 In a series of tape-recorded interviews at a walled Caribbean compound, Mr. Posada said the hotel bombings and other operations had been supported by leaders of the Cuban-American National Foundation. Its founder and head, Jorge Mas Canosa, who died last year, was embraced at the White House by Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton.
A powerful force in both Florida and national elections, and a prodigious campaign donor, Mr. Mas played a decisive role in persuading Mr. Clinton to change his mind and follow a course of sanctions and isolation against Mr. Castro's Cuba.
Although the tax-exempt foundation has declared that it seeks to bring down Cuba's Communist Government solely through peaceful means, Mr. Posada said leaders of the foundation discreetly financed his operations. Mr. Mas personally supervised the flow of money and logistical support, he said.
"Jorge controlled everything," Mr. Posada said. "Whenever I needed money, he said to give me $5,000, give me $10,000, give me $15,000, and they sent it to me."
Over the years, Mr. Posada estimated, Mr. Mas sent him more than $200,000. "He never said, 'This is from the foundation,' " Mr. Posada recalled. Rather, he said with a chuckle, the money arrived with the message, "This is for the church."
Foundation leaders did not respond to repeated telephone calls and letters requesting an interview to discuss their relationship with Mr. Posada. But in a brief statement faxed to The New York Times, the group denied a role in his operations, saying "any allegation, implication, or suggestion that members of the Cuban American National Foundation have financed any alleged 'acts of violence' against the Castro regime are totally and patently false."
 
The Recluse
Talking on His Terms, After Years of Silence
Mr. Posada, 70, has long refused to talk to journalists; his autobiography, published in 1994, provided only a sketchy account of his dealings with the foundation's leaders.
But in two days of interviews, he talked openly for the first time about those relationships and how they figured in a fight to which he has devoted his life, a fight that has left him far from his declared goal of toppling the hemisphere's last Communist state.
His motives for agreeing to the interviews are not easy to pin down. Mr. Posada, who has survived several attempts on his life, told a friend recently that he was afraid he would not live long enough to tell his story.
For the first time, Mr. Posada also described his role in some of the great cold war events in which Cuban exiles were key players. He was trained for the Bay of Pigs at a camp in Guatemala, but did not participate in the landing on Cuban beaches after the Kennedy Administration withheld air support from the first wave of rebels, whose attack quickly foundered.
It was Cuban exiles like Mr. Posada who were recruited by the C.I.A. for the subsequent attempts on Mr. Castro's life.
Jailed for one of the most infamous anti-Cuban attacks, the 1976 bombing of a civilian Cubana airliner, he eventually escaped from a Venezuelan prison to join the centerpiece of the Reagan White House's anti-Communist crusade in the Western Hemisphere: Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North's clandestine effort to supply arms to Nicaraguan contras.
Mr. Posada denied any role in the Cubana bombing, which killed 73 people, many of them teen-age members of Cuba's national fencing team.
He agreed through an intermediary to meet with The New York Times, provided his current residence and alias, and the location of the interviews, were not divulged.
Some of what he said about his past can be verified through recently declassified Government documents, as well as interviews with former foundation members and American officials.
But he made several claims that rest solely on his word, including an assertion that he has agents inside the Cuban military and that American law enforcement authorities maintained an attitude of benign neglect toward him for most of his career, allowing him to remain free and active.
Mr. Posada said all payments from the exile leaders to him were made in cash, and he said he did not know whether the money came from personal, business or foundation accounts. He said that the money was used for his living expenses and for operations and that Mr. Mas told him he did not want to know the details of his activities.
In the interviews he was generally expansive on broad questions of philosophy but evasive on specifics. He spoke in Spanish and English, with difficulty, his speech distorted by the severe damage done to the nerves of his tongue in a 1990 attempt on his life.
Mr. Posada said he was angered by recent newspaper accounts of his activities and eager near the end of his life to put his version of events on record, perhaps reinvigorating a movement he sees as lacking energy and direction since Mr. Mas's death.
The exiles' foundation, created in 1981, has sought to portray itself as the responsible voice of the Cuban exile community, dedicated to weakening the Castro regime through politics rather than force. Thanks to that approach and millions in campaign donations, the foundation became one of Washington's most effective lobbying organizations and a principal architect of American policy toward Cuba.
Any evidence that the foundation or its leaders were dispensing money to Republicans and Democrats while underwriting bombings could weaken the group's claim to legitimacy. That kind of activity could also violate the Logan Act, which makes illegal any "conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage property in a foreign country."
Mr. Posada's remarks hinted that the foundation's public advocacy of purely nonviolent opposition to Mr. Castro was a carefully crafted fiction. Asked if he functioned as the military wing to the foundation's political wing, much as the Irish Republican Army does for Sinn Fein, he replied, "It looks like that," and laughed.
 
The Money
Assertions and Denials On Sources of Support
In the interviews and in his autobiography, "The Roads of the Warrior," Mr. Posada said he had received financial support from Mr. Mas and Feliciano Foyo, treasurer of the group, as well as Alberto Hernandez, who succeeded Mr. Mas as chairman.
Dr. Hernandez and Mr. Foyo did not respond to repeated requests for comment, and it was unclear whether they were aware of how Mr. Posada might have used any money they provided. In his autobiography, Mr. Posada said foundation leaders helped pay his medical and living expenses and paid for his transportation from Venezuela to Central America after his 1985 jailbreak.
At times, Mr. Posada said, cash was delivered from Miami by fellow exiles, including Gaspar Jimenez, who was jailed in Mexico in the 1976 killing of a Cuban diplomat there. Mr. Jimenez is now an employee of the medical clinic that Dr. Hernandez operates in Miami, according to employees at the office.
Mr. Jimenez did not respond to requests for comment.
When the bombs began exploding last year at Cuban hotels, the Government there asserted that the attacks had been organized and paid for by exiles operating out of Miami, a claim it bolstered with the videotape of an operative confessing to carrying out some of the bombings.
More recently, reports in The Miami Herald and the state-controlled Cuban press tied the operation to Mr. Posada. However, he told The New York Times that American authorities had made no effort to question him about the case. He attributed that lack of action in part to his longstanding relationship with American law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
"As you can see," he said, "the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. don't bother me, and I am neutral with them. Whenever I can help them, I do."
Mr. Posada gave conflicting accounts of his contacts with American authorities. Initially he spoke of enduring ties with United States intelligence agencies and of close friendship with at least two current F.B.I. officials, including, he said, an important official in the Washington office.
"I know a very high-up person there," he said.
Later he asked that those comments be omitted from any article and said it had been years since he had had these close dealings.
An American Government official said the C.I.A. has not had a relationship with Mr. Posada "in decades," and the F.B.I. also denied his assertions. "The F.B.I. does not now have nor have we ever had a longstanding relationship with Posada," said John F. Lewis, Jr. who as assistant director in charge of the national security division supervises all counterintelligence and counterterrorism work for the agency.
Declassified documents unearthed in Washington by the National Security Archives support Mr. Posada's suggestion that the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. had detailed knowledge of his operations against Cuba from the early 1960's to the mid-1970's.
G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel to the 1978 House Select Committee on Assassinations, said he had reviewed many of the F.B.I.'s classified files about anti-Castro Cubans from 1978 and had noted many instances in which the bureau turned a blind eye to possible violations of the law. As he put it, "When I read some of those things, and I'm an old Federal prosecutor, I thought, 'Why isn't someone being indicted for this?' "
On one point Mr. Posada was direct and unrepentant: he still intends to try to kill Mr. Castro, and he believes violence is the best method for ending Communism in Cuba.
"It is the only way to create an uprising there," Mr. Posada said. "Castro will never change, never. There are several ways to make a revolution, and I have been working on some."
Within militant Cuban exile circles, Mr. Posada is a legendary figure, celebrated for his tenacity and dedication to the anti-Castro cause. He has at various times also worked for Venezuelan, Salvadoran and Guatemalan intelligence or security agencies because, he explained, he wanted "to fight against the Communists, the people who helped Cuba."
But the Cuban Government regards him as a terrorist and a "monstrous criminal" responsible for numerous acts of violence against official installations and personnel, on the island and off, and has called on the United States to curb his activities.
Mr. Posada proudly admitted authorship of the hotel bomb attacks last year. He described them as acts of war intended to cripple a totalitarian regime by depriving it of foreign tourism and investment.
"We didn't want to hurt anybody," he said. "We just wanted to make a big scandal so that the tourists don't come anymore. We don't want any more foreign investment."
The bombs were also intended, Mr. Posada said, to sow doubts abroad about the stability of the regime, to make Cuba think he had operatives in the military and to encourage internal opposition. "People are not afraid anymore," he said. "They talk openly in the street. But they need something to start the fire, and that's my goal."
 
The Bombings
A Mastermind Reveals Some Key Secrets
 For several months the attacks did indeed discourage tourism. With a rueful chuckle, Mr. Posada described the Italian tourist's death as a freak accident, but he declared that he had a clear conscience, saying, "I sleep like a baby."
"It is sad that someone is dead, but we can't stop," he added. "That Italian was sitting in the wrong place at the wrong time."
In Havana last September, authorities arrested a 25-year-old Salvadoran, Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon, and accused him of carrying out a half-dozen of the hotel attacks. Mr. Posada said Mr. Cruz Leon, whom he described as a mercenary, had been working for him, but said "maybe a dozen" others reporting to him remained at large.
The hotel bombings were organized from El Salvador and Guatemala, Mr. Posada said. Explosives were obtained through his contacts there, and subordinates in turn recruited couriers like Mr. Cruz Leon to take the explosives into Cuba and detonate them in carefully selected targets.
"Everything is compartmentalized," Mr. Posada said. "I know everybody, but they don't know me."
"This was an inside operation in Cuba," he added, explaining that he was now trying to think of another way to disrupt the Cuban economy and demonstrate to the Cuban people that Mr. Castro's security apparatus is not all-powerful and all-knowing. "Very soon there will be exciting news," he predicted.
Mr. Posada said he had several ongoing operations, including one that resulted in Cuba's capture of three of his colleagues in early June. "Castro is keeping this a secret," he said. "I don't understand why."
In response to several questions about operational details that he clearly did not want to answer, he jokingly said, "I take the Fifth Amendment."
While agreeing to allow the interviews to be taped, he declined to be photographed, saying he did not want to provide Cuban agents with any information that would help them hunt him down. "The reason that I last so long is that nobody knows how I am," he explained. "Not having pictures of my pretty face has kept me alive a long time."
In Guatemala in 1990, he was attacked and gravely wounded in what he describes as an assassination attempt mounted by his enemies at Cuban intelligence. He was hit with a dozen bullets, one of which shattered his jaw and nearly severed his tongue, requiring several rounds of reconstructive surgery.
He said that during his long recuperation in El Salvador, some of his expenses were paid by Dr. Hernandez, the current chairman of the Cuban-American foundation, whom he described as "a great Cuban patriot and a dear friend." Just last year, he said, a Houston surgeon whom he also described as a friend flew to El Salvador and performed further surgery on him.
Mr. Posada detailed instances of support from foundation leaders throughout his career. Mr. Mas, he said, helped organize his escape from a Venezuelan prison in 1985, and then helped settle him in El Salvador, where he joined the White House-directed operation that led to the Iran-contra scandal.
"All the money that I received when I escaped from the jail," he said, "it was not that much, but it was through Jorge."
Mr. Posada said Mr. Mas was also very much aware that he was behind the hotel bombing campaign last year. But the two men had a longstanding agreement, he said, never to discuss the details of any operation that Mr. Posada was involved in.
"He never met operators, never," Mr. Posada said. "You ask for money from him, and he said, 'I don't want to know anything.' " Any discussion was "not specific, because he was intelligent enough to know who knows how to do the things and who doesn't know."
Mr. Mas, he added, "was afraid of the telephone."
"You don't talk like that on the telephone."
Asked when he had last visited the United States, he answered with a laugh and a question of his own: "Officially or unofficially?" A State Department official said Mr. Posada was reported to have visited Miami in the summer of 1996.
Mr. Posada acknowledged that he has at least four passports, all in different names. He regards himself as a Venezuelan citizen, but he has a Salvadoran passport bearing the name Ramon Medina Rodriguez, the nom de guerre he assumed during the Iran-contra affair, and a Guatemalan passport issued in the name of Juan Jose Rivas Lopez.
He also reluctantly admitted to having an American passport. But he would not discuss how he had obtained it or disclose the name in it, saying only that he occasionally uses it to visit the United States "unofficially," and had once used it to gain refuge in the American Embassy when he was caught in the middle of a revolution in the West African country of Sierra Leone.
"I have a lot of passports," he said with a laugh. "No problem."
He added, "If I want to go to Miami, I have different ways to go. But I don't go. You can't control Customs people. They can do anything."
"Then," he said, "Your friends can't help you."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 16, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on July 12 reported a series of interviews with Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile who told of having waged a campaign of violence aimed at toppling Fidel Castro. Mr. Posada was quoted as saying his operations had been financed for years by Jorge Mas Canosa and other leaders of an influential American lobbying group, the Cuban-American National Foundation.
Because of an editing oversight, one sentence reported that Mr. Posada said the Cuban-American leaders had "supported" a series of hotel bombings in Cuba. The wording was not intended to mean that Mr. Posada said the foundation leaders had paid specifically for the hotel bombings.
In the interviews, Mr. Posada acknowledged having organized the bombing campaign. He also noted that leaders of the foundation had publicly expressed support for the bombings, which they characterized as an act of internal rebellion. But, as was made clear elsewhere in the article, Mr. Posada said Mr. Mas and other leaders of the foundation did not earmark money for specific operations, and asked not to be told how he used their funds.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Rose 16% During May

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Domestic orders for machine tools jumped in May, with orders increasing in all regions except the Northeast, an industry survey showed today.
Orders from American companies for domestic and foreign-produced machine tools rose 16 percent to an estimated $795 million in May, compared with April, according to a joint report from the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association. 
 Estimated orders for machine tools for the first five months of 1998 totaled about $3.7 billion, up 3 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier. Some tool makers, though, expect to come under pressure because of weakening demand from Asia. Also, the effects of the strikes against the General Motors Corporation are likely to hurt demand further.

HEADLINE: THE ARTS IN: DES MOINES -- Ripples in the Cultural Mainstream;
Arts Play a Curious Role In a Business Minded City

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: DES MOINES

 BODY:
It was a bit of Americana, stirring and sincere. Sockless, in baggy shorts and a tennis shirt as though fresh from a holiday barbecue, the Governor himself, Terry Branstad, stood on the Capitol's steps and introduced the Des Moines Symphony to some 20,000 Iowans gathered on the lawn and in the parking lot. This was the night before Independence Day, the occasion of an annual concert here. Rain clouds sprinkled a few drops on the crowd, but didn't dare spoil the party, dispersing as the evening darkened.
In the fading light, the gold dome of the Capitol glinted, even under its scaffolding. And by the time the orchestra rendered a George M. Cohan medley; a tone poem by its guest artist, Mark O'Connor, a country fiddler, and reached the climax of the "1812 Overture," many in the audience were cheering the musicians and waving tiny flags. Des Moines takes ardent pride in both its cultural institutions and its mainstream values. 
 Of course, therein lies a conflict. Although audiences in Des Moines, a city of 400,000 people with a healthy corporate base, have supported their symphony, their well-regarded opera company, their world-class art museum and their community theater for more than a quarter-century (and dozens of others for not quite so long), no one is claiming the city as a hotbed of experimentation or even as terribly tolerant of art that leans to the subversive. It was only a decade or so ago that a patron stood up at a performance of "A Chorus Line" at the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines, demanded that the profanity be halted immediately and had to be escorted from the theater.
" 'Angels in America' would not play well here," said Jeff Chelesvig, the general manager of the Civic Center, which is the city's only site for professional theater. "I'd love to do it, but I couldn't."
Indeed, the role of the arts in Des Moines is a curious one, characterized by cultural officials as both a strength and a weakness of a community that is generally enthusiastic if narrowly focused.
"I do think there's a general perception here that the arts are supposed to be entertainment," said Kenneth W. Hopper, the executive director of the symphony, who, like other cultural officials in town, sees himself as an educator of a sort. The symphony featured seven world premieres last season, well received, Mr. Hopper said, though he added that it thrills him when people applaud between movements of a Beethoven symphony, because it means the audience is full of new members.
"Opera is not indigenous to Iowa, but I've felt proud of our audiences," said Jerilee Mace, director of the 26-year-old Des Moines Metro Opera in Indianola, a dozen miles to the south, which has 1,500 subscribers. "They're growing into an appreciation of an unusual repertoire."
That would apply to a current production, Lee Hoiby's adaptation of "Summer and Smoke." After each performance, delighted patrons swarm the lobby to meet the performers, still in costume, a company tradition.
Most people acknowledge that, unlike the two major university towns nearby -- Ames, home of Iowa State, to the north, and Iowa City to the east, where the University of Iowa (and the renowned Iowa Writers Workshop) is located -- Des Moines is more a center of capitalism than intellectual ferment, an indistinct place that struggles with the image of blandness.
"I come from Des Moines," Bill Bryson wrote at the beginning of his dyspeptic travel book, "The Lost Continent" (HarperCollins). "Somebody had to." And though Mr. Bryson may not be held in particularly grand repute in his hometown, he isn't disputed much.
"We're just like the rest of the country," said Louise R. Noun, an art collector who specializes in work by women. "Same crime, same culture, just in smaller quantities."
Ms. Noun, it must be said, however, is pretty distinctive herself, having turned 90 in March, just after serving as curator for a show of an early 20th-century Iowa painter, Agnes Weinrich, at the Des Moines Art Center. (It travels to the Provincetown Art Museum in Massachusetts next month.)
 
Preferring Poetry To Auto Racing
There are, of course, other local residents who defy the mainstream cultural stereotype. One is James Autry, a former president of the Meredith magazine group here (the Meredith Corporation publishes Better Homes and Gardens and other magazines), and the author of several management books and a book of poetry.
Nine years ago, irritated that a group of businessmen had sponsored a Grand Prix auto race in town, Mr. Autry helped found the Des Moines National Poetry Festival, which has brought poets like Galway Kinnell, Carolyn Forche and Czeslaw Milosz for weekends of readings and workshops. More than 800 people took part in the eighth annual event in May.
"And I'm pleased to say, as a postscript, that the Grand Prix is out of business," Mr. Autry said.
Another offbeat arts entrepreneur is John Gaps 3d, an Associated Press photographer and the author of "God Left Us Alone Here" (Lone Oak Press), a collection of his photos from war zones with accompanying poems.
"I don't know what Des Moines is," Mr. Gaps said. "It doesn't have enough of any one influence to be any one thing. There's not a preponderance of pain here, but there is a preponderance of introspection."
Mr. Gaps is plumbing that introspective vein; he has started both a small publishing house and a literary magazine, Stand Alone, devoted primarily to Iowa writers. "The most prestigious literary publication in Iowa is The Iowa Review," he said, "and there's no one from Iowa in it."
The main influence on the culture of Des Moines, however, is commerce. A center of insurance and agribusiness, the city has a downtown where 65,000 people go to work every day, more than in Kansas City, Detroit or Phoenix. Companies like Meredith, the Principal Financial Group (which commissioned a sculpture by Maya Lin for its corporate headquarters) and Pioneer Hi-Bred International are the primary benefactors of the city's cultural institutions.
 
Cultural Groups As a Selling Point
Pioneer, for example, the world's largest seed-corn producer, endows a string quartet, the only four salaried players in the Des Moines Symphony. Part of this is enlightened self-interest, perhaps. Recruiting executives and technically trained workers has become difficult in Des Moines, where unemployment is less than 2 percent, so many companies are reaching out nationally. A local study showing that Des Moines has more cultural organizations per capita than cities like Austin, Tex., and Portland, Ore., is regarded as a selling point.
The arts scene, said Eric Fogg, the program manager for community development at Pioneer, "comes up in most interviews, and if it doesn't come up, we'll bring it up, because we're pleased with the quality and quantity of the arts in Des Moines."
Still, as in many other cities that have expanded away from the center, downtown more or less clears out after dark. And though situated prettily at the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers, the city has acres of riverfront that have gone unexploited.
As it happens, the city has only just begun to address the lifelessness at its heart at night, with proposals pending before the local government to create a downtown arts district, establish incentives for converting abandoned warehouses to residential lofts and build an entertainment center that would include a 24-screen movie complex, restaurants, shops and nightclubs.
"The resources are here to invest in culture and entertainment," said David M. Feehan, president of the Downtown Partnership, an organization of businesses. "The likelihood is that we'll build $750 million worth of stuff downtown in the coming years."
This is encouraging talk, given the relative noninvolvement of the government; frustrated by the lack of support, the city's cultural institutions have recently formed an alliance to begin seeking funds from the suburbs. On the state level, Iowa ranks 42d among 56 states and territories in arts dollars spent per capita.
"Government support is terrible, pathetic," said David Kruidenier, 77, the former chairman of the Cowles Media Company, which owned The Des Moines Register before it was sold to Gannett in 1985. "Iowa is kind of an odd place. It's been so agriculturally oriented that I think the arts have been viewed as frivolous. But there has been a change among business leaders, a recognition that we haven't paid enough attention to esthetics."
Mr. Kruidenier was among those who selected I. M. Pei, in the 1960's, and Richard Meier, in the 80's, to create new wings for the Des Moines Art Center, whose main building was designed by Eliel Saarinen in 1948. The first museum built in the United States after World War II, it stands on a rolling, city-owned greensward west of downtown. Most residents consider it the city's cultural jewel, though it seems to be appreciated by a remarkably insular group; of its 110,000 visitors a year, 90 percent are Iowans, said Jessica Rowe, the acting director.
What others are missing is a collection that holds, among dozens of works by 20th-century masters, the Edward Hopper painting "Automat," which is featured on a 32-cent stamp; a white square by Robert Ryman much like the bone of contention in the Tony Award-winning play "Art," and "Amazing Juggler," by Kuniyoshi Yasuo, which Nikita Khrushchev once stood before in Moscow as he denounced modern art.
 
Vegetable Art With Dash of Humor
The Pei wing, a contemporary sculpture court, is particularly lively, with arresting pieces by Donald Judd and Claes Oldenburg (whose giant umbrella in front of the Civic Center downtown makes him well represented in Des Moines).
An installation by Red Grooms, depicting a booth at the Iowa State Fair, includes busts done in vegetables of native Iowans like John Wayne and Herbert Hoover, and indicates that, if anything, Iowans will tolerate a little humor about themselves.
A current exhibition of Iowa artists is an eclectic group of works, including paintings, kinetic sculptures and photographs. But at least one artist featured in the show, Sarah Grant-Hutchison, seemed a quintessential representative of Des Moines. An abstract painter who has had exhibitions in many regional museums, she was asked 12 years ago by a Meredith publication, Weekend Woodworker, to design a wooden nativity scene. She balked at first, but agreed when she was told her fee would be $500.
In addition to her painting, she now runs Sticks, a company that makes original furniture with wood-burned and painted designs, employing 55 people and represented by 125 galleries around the country. Sales last year were $2.5 million, and the company, having outgrown its studio, is putting up a new building.
"I've come to love the business end of things," Ms. Grant-Hutchison said, as mainstream an American artist as perhaps there is. "It's as creative and challenging for me as my painting."

HEADLINE: Applied Materials Offers Warning on Profit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 12

 BODY:
Applied Materials Inc., the world's largest maker of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, said late Friday that its fiscal third-quarter results would fall below analyst forecasts, hurt by delayed orders and cutbacks in capital spending by chip makers.
The company said it expected to report an operating profit of 15 cents to 18 cents a diluted share in the quarter ending July 26. Analysts had forecast earnings of 21 cents a diluted share, according to First Call. 
 Applied is the last major chip equipment company to warn that the Asian economic crisis and slowing orders from chip makers will hurt profits.
Applied, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it expected new orders of $600 million to $675 million, and revenue of $850 million to $885 million.
The company made the announcement after the stock market closed. Applied's shares had been up 50 cents, at $29.50, before Nasdaq trading was halted pending the report.

Is There a Right to Sex?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Does a poor man have as much right to sex as a rich man? Ask anybody that question, and the answer will be yes.
For that reason, the recent decision by Kaiser Permanente, the health plan of nine million people nationwide, not to cover the cost of the potency pill Viagra will meet with disapproval. 
 This despite Kaiser's upfront explanation: the $7 pill costs too much. If Kaiser were to pay for unrestricted use of the sought-after drug, pharmaceutical bills would jump 10 percent -- a cost that would sharply increase premiums paid by all.
Some other health plans, worried about their images at a time that every H.M.O. wears a "kick me" sign on its back, will pick up the cost of one potency pill a week. Even so, Kaiser's frankness draws the larger issue that politicians hate to confront: should medicine be rationed, and if so, by whom?
The answer used to be: leave it up to doctors. Supposedly, patients would then get the treatment they needed, unhampered by the niggling naysaying of insurance company accountants.
But that did not account for an epidemic of incurable greed. Insured patients were greedy ("never mind that $100 X-ray, doc, give me a $1,000 MRI"); doctors were intimidated ("if I don't give this hypochondriac all the expensive tests he wants, he'll sue me for malpractice") as well as greedy ("why shouldn't I make as much as a trial lawyer?").
This incentive to waste and overcharge drove up demand for medical services without increasing the supply. The result was the incredible inflation of costs. Insurance cost more and covered less because the one law you can't repeal is supply and demand.
Hillary Clinton came up with an answer: let government manage care, ration medicine on the basis of need and subsidize health care for everyone with increased taxes. This liberal approach wasn't crazy, but Americans overwhelmingly rejected her approach as overly intrusive.
That did not stop the idea of "managed care" as a rationer; some institution has to say no, to play the villain, to limit demand. And so we had the rise of H.M.O.'s as a hate object, with some of the mismanaged ones deserving the fury that patients would have aimed at bumbling government.
Not surprisingly, liberal politicians are offering to ride to the rescue by having government carefully manage the privately managed care. Because publicly financed campaigns and tobacco taxing fizzled as voter turnouters, "patient protection" has become the Democrats' chosen issue this fall.
That's why we see the President pitching a "patient's bill of rights" that would force the insured to pay for more benefits. (It's not the employer or the H.M.O. that pays; in the end, the insured pays.) Such pressure pushes Republicans to counter with tax-free medical savings accounts and closer regulation of the most stupidly bureaucratic of the H.M.O.'s.
But few will whisper a truism of American life: people who can afford it are able to buy better health care. The poor, elderly, disabled and otherwise dependent are entitled to an adequate level of treatment, but above that level is the best care that money should be able to buy.
If you work hard, save and invest, you and your family will eat better, shelter better, travel further and enjoy yourselves more than others. Although nobody in America need starve, live without a roof, or be denied basic medical care or equal opportunity, the reason most of us earn and save money is to do much better than subsist.
But isn't that unfair? John F. Kennedy had the answer: "Life is unfair." The world now knows that non-monopoly capitalism makes life better for more people than leveling-down socialism.
To the point: Should the Government direct that the price of something as life-enhancing as a potency pill be within easy reach of poor and rich alike? The non-populist answer few politicians dare utter: No. The free market does it better.
High initial price and heavy demand will soon draw other pill makers to produce a better pill at a lower price, which competing health plans will eagerly cover. The patient's insurance bill will cost less than a spinmeister's "bill of rights," and all of us geezers, rich and poor, will be happily rutting around like rabbits.

HEADLINE: Dead Diver From North Puts Seoul on Alert

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 12

 BODY:
South Korean military commanders put troops on the country's eastern coast on alert today and declared a curfew in the area after finding the body of a diver who they said was a North Korean commando.
The diver, whose body apparently washed up on the beach, was carrying a Czech-made submachine gun, a hand grenade, radio transmission gear and an underwater camera, the military said. Nearby, investigators found a cone-shaped aluminum submersible boat that could carry up to five commandos. 
 "Judging from the objects found, it has been proven that the dead diver was an armed infiltrator," said Kang Jung Kwon, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
If further investigation backs that up -- and if other armed North Korean infiltrators are caught -- a result could be serious new antagonisms between North and South Korea. More broadly, the incursion could be a major setback for efforts to engage the Stalinist state in the North and bring it out of its isolation.
South Korea's President, Kim Dae Jung, has pushed a "sunshine" policy intended to build ties with the North and ease sanctions against it. But that is proving difficult to promote because of evidence that North Korea is still sending armed commandos into the South.
Just last month, a furor erupted when a South Korean fisherman caught a North Korean submarine in his drift net. The North Korean commandos on board apparently killed the crew and then themselves, but South Korean officials said that some of the commandos had recently been on South Korean soil.
That incident aroused only limited outrage in the South, in part because the submarine was 12 miles offshore when it was caught in the net. North Korea said it had lost power and suggested that it had drifted south.
A much more serious episode occurred when a North Korean submarine ran aground on the South Korean coast in October 1996 and 19 crew members and commandos slipped ashore. Some 70,000 South Korean troops were deployed to hunt them down, and in the end all the North Koreans were killed or committed suicide except one who was captured and another who was never found.
That incident nearly destroyed efforts to promote peace on the Korean peninsula, and it also led to strains in relations between South Korea and the United States as officials argued about how to handle the crisis.
The body discovered this morning was found by a South Korean man walking along the beach near the city of Tonghae, 110 miles east of Seoul. The dead diver was wearing a wet suit, goggles and two oxygen tanks.
Defense Ministry doctors examined the body and said that the man had died of a heart attack and had been dead between 24 and 48 hours.
North Korea had no immediate comment on the discovery of the diver. In the past it has denied that it engages in armed infiltration.
Some overseas Koreans sympathetic to the North have said that infiltrators are the only means the North has of gathering military intelligence. The South can get intelligence from satellite pictures, they say, while the North has to send in commandos.
South Korea has military bases in the area, and there are sure to be intensive efforts to track down any other spies who might have been with the one who died.
The obvious question is why North Korea would risk another humiliation by sending commandos to the South, particularly so soon after its submarine was snared in the net.
Lee Jong Chan, head of South Korea's intelligence agency, warned last week that the North might step up spying and terrorism against the South in the next couple of months before the inauguration of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, as his country's President. Mr. Lee had said that North Korean agencies would redouble efforts against the South in a show of loyalty to Mr. Kim.
While North Korea has not formally announced that Mr. Kim will become President, the betting is that he will be chosen in August or September. Just today, North Korea announced that he had accepted a nomination for the Supreme People's Assembly, an apparent step toward assuming the presidency.
Another theory that some North Korea experts have offered is that the North Korean leadership, or at least elements within it, are embarrassed by the South's efforts to promote peace. Only if hard-liners prevail in the South, so the argument goes, will the North have a good scapegoat for its closed-door policy with the South and for its own economic mess.
So, according to that theory, some elements in the North Korean forces may be just as happy if an incursion causes rage in the South and harder-line policies toward the North.
A final explanation is simply that North Korea infiltrates spies all the time, and that lately it has simply had bad luck in getting caught.

HEADLINE: High-Level Talks Collapse In General Motors Strike

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., July 12

 BODY:
Frustrated by deadlocked talks to end a crippling strike at two auto parts factories here, the chief negotiator for General Motors announced late this afternoon that he would return to his office in Detroit, while the top union negotiator warned that it would be difficult to settle the strike before mid-August.
The company's top negotiator, Gerald Knechtel, vice president for North American personnel, said that G.M., the world's largest auto maker, would pursue a three-week-old legal grievance against the United Automobile Workers union. The company has accused the union of using the parts factories to stage an illegal national strike although G.M.'s national agreement with the U.A.W. has more than a year to run. The union denies the accusation, and the issue will go to arbitration. 
 Mr. Knechtel also said that the company would step up a review of its investment plans in the United States. The statement was the latest of several veiled threats by G.M. to close assembly plants and end production of some car models if the union does not accept the company's ideas for improving productivity.
Finally, Mr. Knechtel said G.M. was considering unspecified actions, of which employees would be notified before any public announcement. The company has said repeatedly in the last three weeks that it might cut off health insurance coverage for 100,000 laid-off U.A.W. workers and their families, on the grounds that their union membership made them indirect participants in a national strike. Mr. Knechtel declined to say whether G.M. planned to take such action.
Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for G.M. issues, said he planned to stay here and expected to be able to continue bargaining with Mr. Knechtel by telephone. Mr. Knechtel and Mr. Shoemaker said talks would continue among junior negotiators at the two factories here where workers are striking and at parts factories in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio, where workers have been threatening to strike.
Mr. Shoemaker said, "It'll be hard to resolve this sooner than mid-August."
Mr. Shoemaker has consistently been more gloomy than Mr. Knechtel about the likelihood of a settlement. He has two strong incentives to be more gloomy: Predictions of a long strike tend to hurt G.M.'s stock price, which puts pressure on the company to compromise, while union members are more likely to scrimp on household expenses and guard their savings if no settlement is in sight. But even Mr. Knechtel said this afternoon that he was disappointed by the lack of a settlement, although he made no forecasts about when a deal might be possible.
Both sides had tried to reach a deal by tonight, when G.M.'s two-week annual summer shutdown ends. The breakdown in high-level talks means that one of the costliest strikes in American history will keep almost all of G.M.'s North American assembly plants closed for days or weeks to come, at a cost to the auto maker of $400 million a week in lost after-tax profits. The auto maker has laid off 161,000 workers across North America, including 44,000 Mexican workers, 11,700 Canadian workers and several thousand workers in the United States represented by unions other than the U.A.W.
Halfway through a 17-day strike in 1996 at two brake factories in Dayton Mr. Knechtel and Mr. Shoemaker were unable to reach a deal. Stephen Yokich, the U.A.W.'s president, and John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chief executive, then took over, holding talks in Detroit. It was unclear tonight whether top leaders for the two sides would meet soon to seek a settlement.
About 3,200 workers went on strike on June 5 at a metal parts factory here that makes hoods and fenders for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles and makes engine supports for most G.M. cars and trucks. Nearly 6,000 workers walked out on June 11 at a nearby factory that makes speedometers, spark plugs, engine air filters and other components.
Mr. Knechtel said on Friday that G.M. was insisting on settlements in Dayton and Indianapolis as part of any deal here. But today, Mr. Knechtel said that the main impasse involved the U.A.W.'s insistence that G.M. invest more money in the metal parts factory.
Mr. Knechtel accused the union of waging the strike for "bad reasons," later explaining that "it's for reasons involving demands to put investment into a noncompetitive business, and the company is not going to do that."
The union has insisted that the factory would be competitive if G.M. spent more money to update its equipment. But G.M. contends that the factory's productivity has been hurt by outdated work rules, including a rule that allows 600 welders of engine mountings to stop work after four-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours, provided that they have completed enough auto parts.
Before high-level talks broke down today, a lower-level negotiator provided the first details to emerge from the dispute at the metal parts factory. The negotiator, who insisted on anonymity, said that many union safety grievances and other minor issues had been resolved. G.M. has also reached an informal understanding with the union that the 600 welders would be required to produce more parts before they can stop work, making it harder for workers to finish in less than eight hours, the negotiator said.
But four sticking points remain in the talks at the metal parts factory here, the negotiator said. First, G.M. wants to retain some discretion over whether it proceeds with a $180 million investment here that was announced last year but later placed on hold by G.M. Second, G.M. has not fixed a timetable for the return of parts-making equipment it removed from the factory over Memorial Day weekend in preparation for a strike.
Third, G.M. has resisted union demands to move several presses here that stamp hoods and fenders out of rolls of galvanized steel. Moving the presses would improve their speed and productivity but require a costly redesign of a production line, the negotiator said.
Finally, G.M. has been reluctant to proceed with plans to install two new presses here, each more than 100 feet long and packed with the latest technology. The presses are among six being made for G.M. in Japan because no steel smelters are left in the United States with the equipment to make the enormous gears needed for the presses. G.M. has become leery of installing the expensive machinery in a strike-prone factory with relatively low efficiency.
All these issues are similar to those at other factories where G.M. has been quick to compromise in previous strikes. But G.M. executives have become increasingly concerned that the auto maker is not keeping up with productivity gains at the Ford Motor Company or at the Chrysler Corporation, which has agreed to a merger with Daimler A.G.
While any settlement will not set a legal precedent for changes in contracts at other local units of the U.A.W., the company has been trying to show the union that it will no longer give in easily in labor disputes.
By not settling quickly now, G.M. might make some union members less enthusiastic about voting for union leaders who cost them a month or two of wages to protect work rules. The U.A.W. is paying strike benefits of $150 a month to the 9,200 striking workers here, while laid-off G.M. workers qualify in most states for unemployment benefits of $200 to $300 a week, although the company is trying to block these benefits.
But at a convention three weeks ago in Las Vegas, Nev., the union finished re-electing its national leaders to three-year terms. Mr. Shoemaker warned this evening that if G.M. tried to stand fast, "we can probably teach each other a lesson that neither one of us will forget."
Mr. Shoemaker said on Saturday that G.M. might try to reopen a few of its assembly plants temporarily, using old parts from its warehouses. G.M. has also asked outside suppliers if they can provide extra parts, and is said by people in the auto parts industry to be looking at air shipments of parts from G.M.'s Brazilian subsidiary. But any reopening of assembly plants would be difficult logistically, and it is unclear how many vehicles could be produced.
David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities, said that the collapse of talks was likely to hurt G.M.'s share price when trading resumes on Monday.

HEADLINE: Political Uncertainity Shakes Financial Markets in Asia

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, July 13

 BODY:
Asian markets and the Japanese currency tumbled this morning, as investors worried about economic disarray in Japan following the severe beating that the governing party took in parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Japan's leaders have been under pressure from abroad for months to clean up the banking system's morass of bad debts and to lift the economy out of recession. Though they finally have the beginnings of a blueprint to tackle the problems, the defeat of the governing Liberal Democrats suggests that pushing through economic legislation will be even more difficult than in the past. 
 "The uncertainties are enormous," said Russell Jones, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Japan. "Who leads Japan? Are we faced with lower house elections? What does it mean for the process of putting through the legislation for the bank bailout and tax cuts?"
In the first 20 minutes of stock trading, the benchmark Nikkei 225 average fell to 15,810.09, down 279.97 points, or 1.74 percent from its close on Friday. And the yen fell sharply against the dollar to a one-month low, falling to 144 yen, down from 141.39 in late trading in New York on Friday.
The stock markets in Asia were also down. At midday in Singapore, the index fell 3.46 percent. In Hong Kong, stocks were down 2.86 percent and in Thailand they fell 2.08 percent.
Investors had been relatively sanguine about the prospects for economic policy in the last couple of weeks, particularly with talk about permanent tax reform and a cleanup of the nation's bad debt.
But the resounding message of protest against the Liberal Democrats throws into question the ability of the nation's leaders to push through economic policy.
The Liberal Democrats will now have to work more closely with the opposition parties to pass legislation, and this is likely to stall the process.
As Japan's economy was sinking in a recession this spring, governments abroad were already criticizing the slow pace at which Japan's Parliament was pushing through a $116 billion spending plan to spur growth -- and that was when the Liberal Democrats had a firm hand in the governing coalition and when the opposition parties were extremely weak.
The election results now raise the possibility of calls for an election in Parliament's lower house, where the governing Liberal Democratic Party currently has a majority.
The stock market rebounded after its initial fall, and in late morning trading, the Nikkei benchmark stood at 16,023.58, down 66.48, or four-tenths of 1 percent, from Friday's close. The yen recovered to trade at 142.55 near midday. Nonetheless, the market's jitters themselves are likely to aggravate the problems for the banks and for the Government.
Japanese have been suffering a credit squeeze as the nation's banks have cut back on their lending around the country. The bankshave also pulled back from lending elsewhere in the region, leading to credit squeezes in Hong Kong, South Korea and Southeast Asia.
The problem is that part of their capital cushion is made up of stocks, so as the prices of those stocks fall, there is more pressure on banks to trim lending to insure they have enough capital in proportion to those loans.
United States Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, traveling in Africa, said Japan should stick to reform of its banking system, despite the election results.
"I do not think investors should overreact," he was quoted as saying by Reuters.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE PREMIER RESIGNS AS VOTERS REBUKE HIS PARTY

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, July 13

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned this afternoon after voters gave Japan's governing party a brutal drubbing in parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Several senior officials in the Liberal Democratic Party are jockeying to succeed Mr. Hashimoto, and a decision is expected soon, to reassure the unsettled financial markets throughout Asia. But whoever takes over, the transition is sure to create new uncertainties about Japan's political and economic course. 
 A grim Mr. Hashimoto told Japanese television earlier, as the dismal election results rolled in: "The results are attributable to my lack of ability. We could not live up to the people's expectations, and it is all my responsibility."
While the voters were apparently punishing the confusion and lack of decisiveness in the Government as it faces Japan's worst economic crisis in more than half a century, the election result may create more disarray than ever in the coming days.
No one knows who will lead the country -- whose economy is second only to that of the United States in size -- as it tries to extricate itself from recession, or what will happen to Japan's recently announced plans to deal with its mountain of bad loans held by banks.
It will now be harder than ever for the Liberal Democrats to govern Japan and push economic legislation through Parliament.
None of the main contenders within the party for the Prime Minister's job are the kind of new and dynamic leader that many Japanese say they want, and that the United States and other countries fervently desire. There is even some risk that the job will go from a man who exhibited little leadership to a rival who has shown none.
In an early verdict on the result, currency traders sent the yen plunging in trading against the dollar this morning. Japanese stocks also tumbled initially, though they rebounded by midday and the currency recovered somewhat. Stocks in other Asian markets fell. Page A8.
The markets would have tumbled more if it were not for the possibility that the election shock may force the Liberal Democrats -- who have changed policy in the past in reaction to electoral defeat -- to become more aggressive in tackling the nation's economic problems.
There may now be more possibility of tax cuts and of another economic stimulus package, although it is not clear that there will be any push for the kind of market-oriented reorganization that many economists urge.
Since the elections were for the upper house of Parliament, not the more important lower house, they did not directly affect Mr. Hashimoto's post as Prime Minister or his party's lock on power. But he billed the vote as a referendum on his leadership, and the party won only 44 of the 126 seats up for election.
The 44 seats won by the Liberal Democrats were still far more than the 27 seats won by the leading opposition group, the Democratic Party, but far less than the 61 seats that the Liberal Democrats held going into the election.
Other seats were won by the Communists, who did exceptionally well as winners of protest votes, and by independents and other groups in Japan's deeply fragmented opposition.
The upheaval comes at an odd time in the Japanese political world, when the country is neither exactly the one-party state it used to be nor a Western-style country where parties go in and out of power.
The Liberal Democrats ran the country for decades with only token opposition, but they were evicted from power in 1993 after a poor election performance and a series of defections by members of Parliament.
At that time, many thought that old-style Japanese politics were gone forever, but a year later the Liberal Democrats clawed their way back to power as part of a coalition.
Then Mr. Hashimoto took over as Prime Minister in January 1996 and led the Liberal Democrats in a long slog in which they managed to regain majority control of the lower house of Parliament, so that five years later the situation is much as it was before -- but with much less sense of expectation that the political system can be a vehicle for far-reaching change anytime soon.
While Sunday's vote was an unambiguous rebuke to the Liberal Democrats, it is less clear whether it was a vote in favor of anything. By most accounts the voters were simply annoyed by the Liberal Democrats' lack of strong leadership at a time of national economic crisis.
"The biggest reason is the lack of economic recovery," Taku Yamasaki, a Liberal Democratic leader, told NHK Television. Mr. Yamasaki said the top party officials, including Mr. Hashimoto and himself, should resign, but he added that he worried about the impact of the move on the economy.
"What if something happens like the collapse of a financial institution while our financial restructuring scheme is still unfinished?" Mr. Yamasaki mused. "I'm very worried about the power vacuum created by this election result."
Prime Minister Hashimoto planned to go to Washington for a state visit later this month, but that will almost certainly be called off or postponed until a new leader is in place.
The Liberal Democrats will be under strong pressure to act within a week to choose a replacement, and probably to summon Parliament into session so a new person can formally take the Prime Minister's post.
The main contenders are Keizo Obuchi, the Foreign Minister and leader of the largest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party; Seiroku Kajiyama, a veteran politician who was the chief Cabinet spokesman for a time under Mr. Hashimoto; Kiichi Miyazawa, a former Prime Minister, and Yohei Kono, who was the Liberal Democratic leader until he resigned to make way for Mr. Hashimoto.
Whoever takes over, fundamental changes are not expected.
"The L.D.P. has a firm lock on power in the lower house, and that's not going to change," said John F. Neuffer, an analyst of Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo. "Hashimoto was being pulled around by his nose by party elders, and whoever is in there is going to continue party-established policies."
Mr. Neuffer said that while financial markets would be jittery, the humiliation might encourage the Liberal Democrats to become more aggressive in tackling bad debt problems, cutting taxes and approving a new economic stimulus package.
"In the long term I think this is good for the nation and the world, but in the short term I think everybody's going to be nervous," Mr. Neuffer said.
One important winner was the Democratic Party, which consolidated its role as the leading opposition force.
While the party is a poorly organized and newly formed coalition of various factions, it shows hints that it may eventually emerge as a Western-style opposition force, distinguishing itself from the governing party on issues and seen by voters as a credible alternative force.
The Democratic Party is led by Naoto Kan, who opinion polls suggest is by far Japan's most popular politician. Mr. Kan, who made his name as a Cabinet minister crusading against the bureaucracy, will now push to build his party's organization so it can wrest power from the Liberal Democrats in the general elections that must be held by 2000.
"I take it very seriously that the newborn Democratic Party has been given a chance by the people," a jubilant Mr. Kan told reporters at his party headquarters. "People said no to what the Liberal Democratic Party has done. They realized that the Liberal Democratic Party cannot reform, is totally bound by special interests."
"People rejected the bureaucracy-led Government," Mr. Kan added, calling for early elections for the lower house.
Ichiro Ozawa, who once was the main opposition leader but now heads only a small opposition party, said, "I think lower-house elections are inevitable."
The Liberal Democrats may see things differently, since they would almost certainly lose ground in a general election.
With Sunday's election, Mr. Hashimoto becomes the latest in a series of politicians who entered the Prime Minister's residence strong and self-confident and then left ignominiously with his reputation in tatters.
When he took office, he was welcomed enthusiastically as a dynamic leader who was an expert on policy issues and was contrasted sharply with his predecessor, Tomiichi Murayama, a grandfatherly Socialist who was widely viewed as extremely nice and extremely lackadaisical.
Mr. Hashimoto initially did indeed exhibit leadership and decisiveness, but in retrospect he chose to exercise it in the wrong way: he pushed through an increase in the national sales tax from 3 percent to 5 percent. It was a bold and politically courageous attempt to put Japan's finances on a better footing, but it turned out to be economically catastrophic, tipping the nation into recession.
Moreover, Mr. Hashimoto proved much less firm in tackling the recession. He eventually pushed through a large stimulus package, but it took so long to put into place that the economy tumbled in the meantime and further endangered the country's weak banks.

HEADLINE: WORLD CUP '98;
City of Light Erupts in Victory Celebration

BYLINE: By CRAIG WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 12

 BODY:
A million Parisians stormed the Champs-Elysees tonight in an early celebration of their July 14 Bastille Day national holiday unleashed by France's first victory ever in the World Cup championship, 3-0 over Brazil in the Stade de France in St.-Denis.
Black and white, Muslim and Christian, Arab and Asian, the people of Paris trooped down the avenue as they had during victory parades after World Wars I and II. 
 It was, the French coach, Aime Jacquet said, a moment of "national communion."
And tonight the French came together to wave blue-white-and-red flags, honk horns, and toss cherry bombs and firecrackers onto the granite cobblestones under a shimmering moon, in the exuberance of suddenly being on top of the world after a long period of doubt over whether they had what it took to compete in a global economy dominated by Anglo-Saxons. But with the teams of the United States and England long since sent out of this championship in defeat, the Champs-Elysees became a celebration of the Gallic spirit.
"The whole world is here," boasted one of the celebrants, Rachid Kasimi, a French soccer booster from the racially troubled suburb of Asnieres who said his family emigrated here from Morocco. "This is the most beautiful avenue in the world, and we're going to stay here all night," he shouted over the din created by drivers of cars trapped in the celebratory madness, honking staccato victory rhythms, and people shouting, "We've won, we've won."
About 60 fans were later injured when a car crashed into the crowd. "Apparently it was a crazy car, which drove for several dozen meters, knocking over people on its way," said Comdr. Philippe Lavoil, a rescue official. The driver, a woman, was attacked by the crowd before police intervened.
Elsewhere in the country the celebration played out more idyllically, temporarily uniting in joy a people whose most commonly shared value until recently seemed to be pessimism about the future. In St.-Germain-en-Laye, just west of Paris, hundreds poured out of the bar Le Soubise and filled the square in front of the Chateau Vieux, once the home of Louis XIV. The crowd, singing "Marseillaise" and waving the tricolor, soon swelled into the thousands as people came out of their homes, some carrying their children to join the celebration. Horns blared and traffic in the square along Place de Charles de Gaulle soon came to a stop as people piled onto the cars, rocking them back and forth.
The spontaneous march down the Champs-Elysees will be mirrored by a parade up the avenue on Monday afternoon by the winning French team, a day before the usual Bastille Day military ceremonies along the same axis from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde. President Jacques Chirac, a conservative who buried the political hatchet and attended the match tonight with Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, both wearing scarves with the national colors, also invited the team as guests of honor at the Bastille Day celebrations at Elysee Palace on Tuesday.
The team is as racially diverse as the country, and its spontaneous demonstrations, though the extreme-right-wing National Front party routinely garners 15 percent of the vote on a platform promising to send all foreign immigrants back where they came from. Two of the goals were scored by the French team's top playmaker, Zinedine Zidane, whose North African origins made two Algerian women who gave their names as Nadia and Farida proud to be among the victory celebrants on the Champs-Elysees tonight.
Gabriel Muller, a young man who had watched the match in a bar in Montparnasse, said he came to the avenue because the bar had become too crowded. Soon so was the Champs-Elysees, a mile-long avenue of eight lanes that is still the place to see and be seen. It filled entirely with flag-waving pedestrians half an hour after the game ended at 11 p.m. Where the avenue begins, appropriately at the Arc de Triomphe planned by Napoleon to celebrate his victory at Austerlitz in 1805, the 164-foot-high arch was emblazoned tonight with blue lasers, some proclaiming, "Thank you, Blues."
"It was a big surprise, and at first I wondered whether it was a genuine victory," said Carla Dupont, a French journalism student who, with her friend Sophia, was handing out free plastic boaters tonight for one of the soccer tournament's corporate sponsors, Snickers.
There were only a few querulous French eyebrows raised at the fact that the other corporate soccer sponsors included multinational companies such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Fuji Film. With unemployment stuck above 12 percent for most of the past three years, and currently at 11.9 percent, France needs jobs wherever it can get them, and some French officials expressed hope that a soccer victory that had brought the host team from behind in a truly multinational tournament would also leave France with lasting self-confidence.
Chirac, making his way through the clogged streets of the capital after the victory, said at Elysee Palace: "We really had an amazing team, and an exceptional coach who prevailed against all the criticism against him. But what is most fantastic, when you see the stadium and you see the streets of Paris, is that you have the impression that it was each French person individually who won the Cup and was on the field kicking the ball. We're happy, and we're proud."

HEADLINE: Fresh Faces Are Few For Top Job In Japan

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, July 13

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may have angered his own citizens and the rest of the world with his reluctance to tackle Japan's economic problems, but if he seems lackluster, the alternatives could be worse.
Now that Mr. Hashimoto has resigned after his party's dismal performance in parliamentary elections on Sunday, the leading candidate to replace him is Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi. Mr. Obuchi has never been tainted by scandal and has generally avoided missteps, but analysts describe him as someone who could make Mr. Hashimoto seem dynamic by comparison. 
 While the United States and many Asian countries are desperately hoping that a fresh face will emerge -- someone who will take charge of the Government and begin tough steps to revive the economy, no one in Japan seems to see such a person in the wings. Mr. Obuchi certainly does not fit that description, for even in a country that has specialized in faceless leaders, Mr. Obuchi has had a career that has not been memorable.
"Obuchi has all the pizzazz of a cold pizza," said John F. Neuffer, a specialist in Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo. "He wouldn't be calling the shots," Mr. Neuffer added of Mr. Obuchi, if he were to become Prime Minister. "He'd simply be a puppet for the party elders."
This is also true to some extent of Mr. Hashimoto and other candidates who might replace him, but even by comparison to his peers, Mr. Obuchi seems unusually colorless and malleable. He is relatively little known in Japan and has never been associated with major policy initiatives -- and it is unclear what he stands for.
While Mr. Obuchi helped carry out some of Mr. Hashimoto's diplomatic initiatives, such as warmer ties with Russia, Mr. Obuchi has been largely a figurehead who made few decisions himself. Diplomats say that he generally allowed the career bureaucrats in the Foreign Ministry to make the crucial decisions.
The prospect of Mr. Obuchi serving as Prime Minister raises some intriguing questions about the Japanese political system. Polls indicate that people want leadership, but the governing party may replace a Prime Minister who has exhibited little leadership with a Cabinet minister who has demonstrated none.
The reason for this puzzle, say Japanese politicians and analysts, is that in a virtual one-party state like Japan, the key to rising in politics is seniority and congeniality. And Mr. Obuchi, 61, is extremely senior and congenial.
He succeeded his father in a Parliament seat in 1963 and has been there since, working his way up the leadership ladder. A gentle, low-key figure, he has often played the role of a mediator and now heads the largest faction in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
While Mr. Obuchi's lack of charisma and obvious leadership skills might add to the party's problem with voters, the fundamental problem that it faces is that while Mr. Hashimoto is unpopular, there is no one else around in the party who seems a clear improvement. Indeed, the lack of alternatives is what has kept Mr. Hashimoto in office in recent months.
"How do you take care of the situation after him?" asked Kiichi Miyazawa, a former Prime Minister, in an interview last week. "Without knowing that, they can't get rid of him." "Who can succeed Hashimoto under these circumstances? I don't know."
Still, someone will have to succeed Mr. Hashimoto, and talk is now turning to Mr. Miyazawa as a possible emergency replacement. It would be highly unusual to turn to a former Prime Minister, and he is not the kind of fresh face that the party would like. But he is recognized as an expert on finance and economics.
Mr. Miyazawa's term as Prime Minister was not memorable -- except to Americans, who remember President Bush throwing up in Mr. Miyazawa's lap during a state visit to Tokyo in 1993 -- but his expertise in finance would bring some credibility to efforts to grapple with Japan's economic troubles.
Another contender is Seiroku Kajiyama, a veteran Liberal Democratic Politician who has called for more aggressive efforts to tackle economic problems. Mr. Kajiyama suffers, however, from an image of an old-style political horse-trader -- just the image that the Liberal Democrats are trying to shed.
Mr. Kajiyama caused an uproar in 1990, when he was Justice Minister and told a news conference that prostitutes were taking over and harming a district in Tokyo. He said this was "just like in America, where blacks move in an area and whites are chased out."
Another candidate for the Prime Minister's job might be Yohei Kono, a former party leader who has a fresher image than some of his rivals but who like Mr. Obuchi appears to have more friendliness in his belly than fire.

LUCKY BASTARD
By Charles McCarry
385 pages. Random House. $24.95. 
 Truth may be stranger than fiction, but in his darkly entertaining new novel, "Lucky Bastard," Charles McCarry has taken the American political scene of the past half-century or so and made of it something considerably stranger than the truth.
The lucky individual of his title is John Fitzgerald Adams, a young man from working-class Ohio who may well be the love child of John F. Kennedy, if certain souvenirs of his mother's experiences in the Navy during World War II are credible evidence. Whether they are or not, Jack Adams has the irresistible smile, the remorseless sexual drive and the gift for politics of his namesake.
As Arthur, a Soviet agent who teaches political science at Columbia, explains to his handler, Dmitri Alexeyivich, the narrator of Mr. McCarry's novel: "The point is, Jack has a great natural gift. Since childhood, he has studied people, found out what they wanted, and made them believe he was giving it to them even when he wasn't. Without money, without influence, without connections, he has risen to the top every time. He has this uncanny gift for making others like him. Trust him. Want to help him. It's like a spell he can cast at will."
So Jack may be just the young man to be recommended to Dmitri's superior, Peter, a lieutenant general of the K.G.B. so capable that he "could make Andropov laugh and Brezhnev think," which, Dmitri adds, was "enough to make anyone fear him." As Dmitri explains, Peter believes that the future of the revolution lies in America, which, thanks to the Vietnam War along with "pathological fear and loathing for that nemesis of the faithful, Richard Nixon," history had turned upside down. "Golden opportunities were falling out of its pockets," Dmitri adds.
What Peter and Dmitri intend to do is befriend and compromise Jack, underwrite a political career for him, turn him into an agent of influence and then get him elected President. As Peter tells Dmitri, referring to Alger Hiss: "The same people who beatified Alger will discover and love Jack -- the Jack we are going to design for them. They will invest every kopeck of their moral and political capital in him as soon as they hear him speak in parables. To them, Jack's weaknesses will be strengths, his lies truths, his crimes miracles."
Exactly how this plan is carried out is far too byzantine to be summed up in this space. Nor is it fit for a family paper because it exploits Jack's outsized sexual drive through the use of "Swallows, as girls and boys who provide operational sex were called by our organization," Dmitri explains.
Suffice it to say that the plot thickens as intriguingly as in any of Mr. McCarry's recent novels ("Shelley's Heart," "Second Sight" and "The Bride of the Wilderness," among others), with Jack graduating from Harvard Law School, setting up a practice in Ohio, winning a highly publicized police-corruption case and beginning his clamber up the ladder of elected offices.
As usual, Mr. McCarry displays the inside scraps of knowledge he has picked up presumably from working in the C.I.A. and writing memoirs with the likes of the former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and the former Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan. How else could he come up with such fables and facts as a "Lubyanka breakfast" being a cigarette and a bullet? Or that at the battle of Kursk, between Germany and Russia, "so many tanks were destroyed on both sides that Americans saw the rust spot from the moon 25 years later." Or that when the Russians made Janos Kadar the Premier of Hungary after the uprising of 1955, to make sure that his attraction to the ladies didn't distract him from his duties, "the K.G.B. castrated him -- completely." Which, of course, they have to keep threatening to do to Jack.
And, as usual, Mr. McCarry exercises his disdain for the political left, heaping scorn on draft dodgers, Vietnam War protesters and "that community of right-thinkers that Peter called the Unconscious Underground," whose members "manned the junction boxes of influence and opinion of America." What makes his derision seem particularly vitriolic is that he identifies it with Peter's, whose "contempt for those Americans who loved us was breathtaking," Dmitri reports, "but that is the revolutionary's way."
Toward the end, the novel's landscape begins to seem eerily familiar, with Jack besieged by sex scandals as he strives for the Presidency, with his wife blaming a vast conspiracy for his troubles, with campaign contributions coming in from questionable sources, with an Asian financial crisis threatening to undo the American economy and with problems connected with a bank's collapse reaching out to ensnare Jack from the state where he once was Governor. Increasingly as it goes along, "Lucky Bastard" reads like a "Primary Colors" written with imagination.
The only moment that Mr. McCarry sounds less than completely cynical is when a United States Attorney General refuses to go after Jack. "I believe that democracy is God's work," he tells Jack's enemies. "Jack Adams may be exactly what you say he is. But he was elected ... by the people, and the people is always right. It's up to them to decide his fate."
This may well reflect Mr. McCarry's own outlook. On the other hand, he has earlier described this Attorney General as looking "like an especially stupid horse that had just awakened to find itself in bed with the severed head of a Hollywood producer."
In any case, at the conclusion of "Lucky Bastard" it is not the American people who decide if democracy can be saved from Jack, but instead a determined individual, one of many vivid characters in the story who push it beyond mere political satire into a corrosively penetrating view of the contemporary cultural ethos.

HEADLINE: A BOMBER'S TALE: Decades of Intrigue;
Life in the Shadows, Trying to Bring Down Castro

BYLINE: By ANN LOUISE BARDACH and LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
Two years after the Bay of Pigs invasion ended in ignominious failure on the beaches of Cuba, two young Cuban exiles stood next to each other in the spring sun at Fort Benning, Ga., training for the next march on Havana.
It was 1963, a time of feverish American plotting against Fidel Castro's rule. The two men were among the exiles who had survived the bungled operation to overthrow the Cuban leader and had enlisted in the United States Army, confident that President Kennedy would mount another attack that would banish Communism from the hemisphere. 
 The orders never came, and both men soon quit the Army to begin their own three-decade war against Mr. Castro.
Jorge Mas Canosa, the younger of the two, emerged as the public face of the movement, a successful businessman who as chairman of the powerful Cuban-American National Foundation courted Presidents and politicians, raised money and relentlessly lobbied the White House and Congress to get tough on Cuba. By the time Mr. Mas died of cancer last November, after two decades of denying any direct role in the military operations of exiles seeking to destabilize Cuba, he had become perhaps the most influential voice in tightening America's official policy of economic and political quarantine.
The older man, Luis Posada Carriles, a former sugar chemist, became a leader of the exiles' clandestine military wing, plotting to kill Mr. Castro and planting bombs at Cuban Government installations. As Mr. Mas was building a personal fortune that eventually exceeded $100 million, Mr. Posada remained in the shadows, consorting with intelligence officers, anti-Castro militants and even, declassified documents say, reputed mobsters.
Now, as he nears the end of his career as the most notorious commando in the anti-Castro underground, Mr. Posada has for the first time detailed his 37-year relationship with exile leaders in the United States and with the American authorities.
Supplemented by additional interviews and newly declassified American intelligence reports, Mr. Posada's account is the most detailed to date of the deadly underside of the campaign against Mr. Castro's rule.
In two days of taped interviews at his hideout in the Caribbean, Mr. Posada was by turns proud, bawdy, boastful and evasive about his work as a self-proclaimed freedom fighter, which included a series of hotel bombings last year that plunged Cuba into tumult. He described, sometimes selectively, the role of his sponsors in the ostensibly nonviolent Cuban-American population, and his complicated relationship with American officials who originally trained him but now take a dimmer view of his activities.
"The C.I.A. taught us everything -- everything," Mr. Posada said. "They taught us explosives, how to kill, bomb, trained us in acts of sabotage. When the Cubans were working for the C.I.A. they were called patriots. 'Acciones de sabotaje' was the term they used to classify this type of operation," he added, using the Spanish for acts of sabotage. "Now they call it terrorism. The times have changed. We were betrayed because Americans think like Americans."
It is not clear why Mr. Posada, who has avoided interviews for most of his career, has chosen to speak publicly. Last month, he agreed through an intermediary to talk to a reporter, provided that the location of the interview was described only as "somewhere in the Caribbean" and that his current residences were not disclosed. Mr. Posada, who has survived several assassination attempts, recently told a close friend that he feared that he would not live long enough to tell his version of events.
During the interviews Mr. Posada often joked about his outlaw activities. But there was also a wistful, almost melancholic tone to the conversations with a man who has devoted his entire adult life to a not-yet-realized goal that seems as elusive as ever. Communism in Europe has vanished, but the 71-year-old Mr. Castro is still a true believer and still in power, with no signs that he is losing his grip.
No anti-Communist opposition in the world has been more fervent or as well financed as that of Cuban exiles living here. And yet, as Mr. Posada made clear in the interviews, they have little to show for their efforts.
To outsiders, the struggle between the aging leader and the graying commandos who want to displace him seems geriatric, as out of place in the late 1990's as the vintage American cars that still cruise the streets of Havana. But as Mr. Posada emphasized, the hatred of the men on the losing side of Mr. Castro's revolution has not been dimmed by the passing of the years.
"Castro will never change, never," he said, adding later, "Our job is to provide inspiration and explosives to the Cuban people."
Barely a half-hour into the conversation, Mr. Posada yanked his shirt over his head, displaying a torso ribboned with scars, the legacy of an attempt on his life in Guatemala in 1990. Both his arms showed holes where slugs had entered and exited; across his upper left chest was a 10-inch gash where bullets had grazed his heart.
"Let me have your hand," he said, maneuvering a reporter's wrist to the right side of his jaw, shattered by the same bullet that damaged his tongue and nerves, leaving him with a crushed, gravelly voice. "One bullet entered here, and it exited on the left side. My chin used to be an inch longer, very nice. I was very handsome once."
Mr. Posada, who always carries a revolver and is described in C.I.A. files as an excellent marksman, blames Cuban operatives for his maiming. But as he told the story of his life on the run and his work for various anti-Communist governments in the region, it became clear that his decades of intrigue had left him with enemies aplenty throughout the region, from the leftist guerrilla movements of Venezuela, Nicaragua and El Salvador to the Guatemalan military, whose officers he was spying on at the behest of the country's President.
A long period of recuperation followed the attack. Then at 64, he resumed his life's mission, doggedly determined to topple Mr. Castro. "It's a war, a bad war," he said.
 
The Early Years
An Interest in Politics; A Split in the Family
Luis Posada Carriles was born on Feb. 15, 1928, in the then-elegant coastal city of Cienfuegos, one of four children in a family he described as upper-middle-class. His father owned a bookstore and printing press, and moved the family to the capital when Luis was 17 and about to enter the University of Havana.
Also at the university was an intense law student named Fidel Castro. "He was three years ahead of me," Mr. Posada recalled, describing him as tall and handsome but outfitted "like a crazy guy, dressed like a gangster."
He said his most vivid memory of Mr. Castro was his imposing the same gangster style on student politics, relying on a band of supporters in which "everyone had guns" to intimidate opponents.
After studing medicine for two years and then chemistry, Mr. Posada went to work for the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, first in Havana and then in Akron, Ohio, after the revolution. His entire family, including his parents, two brothers and a sister, remained behind, committed to Mr. Castro's revolution.
His 58-year-old sister, Maria Conchita Posada de Perez, joined the Cuban Army after the revolution and reached the rank of colonel. "She is married to a colonel in the intelligence department," Mr. Posada said, savoring the irony. "I help her with money now and then."
Like most educated Cubans his age, Mr. Posada opposed the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. "To be frank, I was never interested in politics when I was young," he said. "Not until the revolution."
By 1960 he had moved into open opposition to Mr. Castro, which landed him in a military prison. According to his Cuban criminal record, a copy of which was published a decade ago in Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, he then sought political asylum at the Embassy of Argentina, left Cuba in February 1961 and immediately volunteered for the force being trained by the C.I.A. for the Bay of Pigs invasion two months later.
It is not clear precisely what prompted Mr. Posada to take up arms against the revolution so heartily supported by his own family and, initially, by a great majority of his countrymen. Asked repeatedly to explain, he said simply: "All Communists are the same. All are bad, a form of evil."
Later in the interviews, Mr. Posada wrote out his credo on a sheet of yellow note paper. The oppression, suffering and poverty Mr. Castro has propagated, he argued, "gives the right to all free Cubans to rebel in arms against the tyrant, using violence and any method within our reach that contributes to the toppling of the nefarious system and leads to the freedom of our fatherland."
Mr. Posada was sent to Guatemala to take part in a second wave of landings in the Bay of Pigs invasion, but did not see action because the initial invading force foundered.
In March 1963, at the C.I.A.'s behest, Mr. Posada enrolled in officer candidate school at Fort Benning and received instruction in demolition, propaganda and intelligence. Fate brought him together with Mr. Mas Canosa. "Jorge stood next to me every day for seven months in the line," recalled Mr. Posada. "We were very close friends."
Both men left the Army after it became clear that the United States had no intention of invading Cuba again. They settled in Miami, the epicenter of anti-Castro activity.
Although revolution was his passion, Mr. Mas took jobs as a milkman, stevedore and shoe salesman before becoming involved with a telephone cable company that became the cornerstone of his multimillion-dollar fortune.
"I knew Jorge when he was poor," Mr. Posada recalled. "He was not perfect, but he was a very smart guy. He had a lot of trouble with different people, even with his own brother."
But, Mr. Posada added, "I trusted him."
 
The C.I.A. Years
A 'Principal Agent'; Links With 'Gangster'
While Mr. Mas was making his mark in business, Mr. Posada was building close ties to the C.I.A., which was using Miami as a base of operations against Mr. Castro.
It was a dizzying time of conspiracies and plots, some harebrained, some deadly serious. The agency's station in Miami was among its largest, and its officers industriously enticed anti-Castro Cubans to sign on with "the company." Miami's organized-crime figures, who had taken in bountiful profits under the Batista Government, were eager to bankroll the Cuban opposition, or use the Cubans for their own ends.
In the interviews, Mr. Posada spoke only obliquely about this period and provided even fewer details in his 1994 autobiography, "The Roads of the Warrior."
Now, newly declassified documents furnished for The New York Times by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research group in Washington, make clear why: For much of that time, the C.I.A. was directing Mr. Posada's activities, involving itself even in such minutiae as whether he should buy a boat. (His handlers thought that it was a bad idea and that his cover would be better without it.)
The documents are part of voluminous files amassed by the 1978 House Select Committee on Assassinations as part of its investigation into the killing of President John F. Kennedy. Investigators examining whether anti-Castro Cubans had any links to the 1963 assassination were permitted to read and summarize a trove of Government cablegrams and documents, all of which remain classified.
According to those summaries, Mr. Posada provided the agency and the F.B.I. with a steady stream of valuable information about Cuban exile activity in Miami. It was the C.I.A. that directed Mr. Posada to "establish a training camp for guerrilla ops against Castro." At one point, the documents say, the agency pressed Mr. Posada to recruit his brother Ricardo as a spy.
Interviewed in the late 1970's by investigators from the House assassinations panel, Mr. Posada said he had been trained as a C.I.A. operative in the Florida Keys and had quickly become a "principal agent." He said his anti-Castro group had "worked with the company direct" and had had arms, boats and a network of safe houses.
His handling of those responsibilities evidently earned Mr. Posada the respect of his C.I.A. superiors and high marks in the agency evaluations filed on him. One from the summer of 1965 deemed him "of good character, very reliable, security-conscious," while another a year later said his "performance in all assigned tasks has been excellent."
At the same time, Mr. Posada was deepening his relationship with Mr. Mas, who is described in one of the C.I.A. documents as a "close friend" of his. The two were active in the exile group RECE, or Cuban Representation in Exile, and later in a larger umbrella alliance called CORU, or Coordinator of United Revolutionary Organizations, both of which undertook violent actions aimed at toppling the Castro Government.
A series of July 1965 cablegrams asserts that the two men were plotting to attack Soviet and Cuban installations abroad. One document quotes Mr. Posada as saying that "Jorge Mas Canosa of RECE had paid assassin $5,000 to cover expenses of a demolition operation in Mexico" and that Mr. Posada was "planning to place limpet mines on a Cuban or Soviet vessel in the harbor of Veracruz, and had 100 lbs. of C-4 explosives and detonators."
Mr. Mas, other documents reported, "had in his possession 125 lbs. of Pentol to be placed as charges on the vessels" and had "proposed to demolitions expert he travel to Spain, Mexico at expense of RECE and place bombs in Communist installations in those countries."
By July 24, according to the cablegrams, Mr. Posada had "completed two 10-lb. bombs for RECE working directly with Mas Canosa." At that point, the cablegrams cryptically report, Mr. Posada was "instructed to disengage from activities." There is no indication that the operation went forward.
The intelligence files contain intriguing references to Mr. Posada's dealings with Frank (Lefty) Rosenthal, described in one report as a "well-known gangster" who became the model for the fictional crime figure at the center of the movie "Casino."
During the summer of 1965, Mr. Posada was "involved in passing silencers, C-4 explosives, detonators" and hand grenades to Mr. Rosenthal, according to a Defense Department intelligence report. A year later, the report continued, Mr. Posada supplied 150 small bombs and some fuses to Mr. Rosenthal "under threat of bodily harm."
The 1967 report drily states that "station only recently advised of this transaction." A "memo for the record" says the timing "suggests Posada may have been moonlighting for Rosenthal and only reported transactions to agency when it got hotter." About that time, Mr. Rosenthal left Miami for Las Vegas, Nev., after being questioned by the police in Miami about a series of unsolved bombings.
It appeared that Mr. Posada's ties with the agency had begun to fray. A report in February 1968 complains of his "tendency" to become involved in "clandestine sabotage activities." A few months later, in June 1968, Mr. Posada was questioned about "unreported association with gangster elements" and "thefts from C.I.A., plus other items."
 
The Latin Years
A Venezuela Job; Break With C.I.A.
Mr. Posada's life took a new turn in 1967, when he abruptly left Miami and joined Venezuelan intelligence. This marked the beginning of his years as an operative for a succession of Latin American governments. He has not lived again in the United States, depending instead on a web of powerful friends in the region who see to his welfare and shield him from prosecution.
He got his job as chief of operations for Venezuelan intelligence with the help of C.I.A. recommendations and was immediately sent to combat the leftist guerrilla movements that Mr. Castro was supporting in Venezuela.
To Mr. Posada, the work was an extension of his efforts to bring down Mr. Castro, and by all accounts, he carried out his job in Venezuela with gusto. "I persecuted them very, very hard," he said of the guerrillas, some of whom later abandoned armed struggle and now are important political figures in Venezuela. "Many, many people got killed."
Mr. Posada arranged for a friend from his C.I.A. days, Orlando Bosch, to "come to Venezuela to make sabotage" against the Castro Government. Mr. Bosch had earlier been convicted in the United States of a bomb attack on a Polish freighter bound for Cuba and advocated the violent overthrow of Mr. Castro.
But a falling out with Venezuela's newly elected President, Carlos Andres Perez, led to Mr. Posada's dismissal and prompted him to found his own private security agency, "the largest in Venezuela," he said.
Around that time, Mr. Posada's relationship with the American authorities was suddenly thrown into crisis by an intelligence report that "Posada may be involved in smuggling cocaine from Colombia through Venezuela to Miami, also in counterfeit U.S. money in Venezuela."
According to the report, a copy of which is summarized in the House investigators' files, the C.I.A. decided "not to directly confront Posada with allegation so as not to compromise ongoing investigation." But subsequent cablegrams call Mr. Posada a "serious potential liability." The agency would most likely "terminate association promptly if allegations prove true," one read.
Mr. Posada was questioned, and "found guilty only of having the wrong kind of friends," the synopsis of another report read. Interrogators were convinced by his denial of drug trafficking, the report concluded.
Even so, by February 1976, the agency's officers decided to break their ties with Mr. Posada in what the documents cryptically described as concerns about "outstanding tax matters."
Over the next few months, Mr. Posada volunteered information to the agency in hopes of obtaining American visas for himself and his family. He warned that Mr. Bosch and another Cuban exile were plotting against the nephew of Chile's deposed leftist President. In June, Mr. Posada was calling the C.I.A. again, "concerning possible exile plans to blow up Cubana airliner leaving Panama." He again asked for help with his visa.
Four months later, on Oct. 6, 1976, a Cubana jetliner with 73 people aboard was blown out of the sky shortly after it took off from the Caribbean island of Barbados. The dead included teen-agers from Cuba's national fencing team.
The following day, the C.I.A. made what its records call "unsuccessful attempts" to reach Mr. Posada.
 
The See-Saw Years
Jail and an Escape; A New Link With U.S.
The bombing dramatically changed Mr. Posada's fortunes. Investigators in Venezuela traced the bomb to the plane's luggage compartment and identified two Venezuelans who checked bags through to Havana but got off the plane in Barbados. The men had worked for Mr. Posada, who was arrested and charged with the bombing. Also arrested was Mr. Bosch, who had long collaborated with Mr. Posada.
To this day, Mr. Posada maintains that he did not order the bombing and blames a Cuban colleague in Venezuelan intelligence for the action, which he called "stupid." Mr. Bosch has defended the attack in a published interview as "a legitimate act of war."
A retired C.I.A. official familiar with the case said in a recent interview that "Bosch and Posada were the primary suspects," adding, "There were no other suspects."
Mr. Posada was jailed in Venezuela, and for most of the next nine years, he remained behind bars, where along with Mr. Bosch he learned to paint.
During the interviews, Mr. Posada emphasized that he was never convicted of the bombing, and blamed corruption and political influence-peddling in the Venezuelan justice system for his failure to be freed on bail.
Mr. Mas, in contrast, was flourishing, his business booming and his political influence growing. At the behest of the Reagan Administration, he founded the Cuban-American National Foundation in 1981.
Mr. Posada acknowledged that he might still be in jail in Venezuela had not his friends, led by Mr. Mas, come to his rescue. In a sworn deposition taken in a civil lawsuit, Ricardo Mas, the estranged brother of Jorge Mas, recounted how he had traveled to Panama to obtain the cash used to pay for the escape.
Ricardo Mas was the comptroller of his brother's company, Church & Tower, from 1972 to 1985. He said that at his brother Jorge's instruction he deposited a check in one of the company's Panamanian accounts and returned with cash.
"He said that he needed me to go down and bring back $50,000, that it would be used to get Luis Posada Carriles out of jail, that Carriles wanted out, that he might start talking," Ricardo Mas testified. "The guy, I guess, was breaking down. They had to get him out of jail."
Mr. Posada's version of how money was raised for escape is somewhat different. He said that a bribe for the warden had come from the sale of his house in Venezuela and that the money from Mr. Mas had paid for additional expenses.
During a changing of the guard at midnight on Aug. 18, 1985, Mr. Posada, dressed in a black jacket with a collar turned up like a priest's, crossed the courtyard of the prison. He carried a Bible, to strengthen the impression that he was a priest, and a satchel containing food and a lamp.
A farmer saw him and ran to his side seeking solace, he recalled with amusement recently. " 'Father, I have a son who is ill. Could you please pray for him?' I said "O.K. friend, walk with me and pray," and together the two men strolled out of the prison. "It was perfect," Mr. Posada said.
After 15 days in Caracas, Mr. Posada said, he was taken to Aruba aboard a shrimp boat. From there, a private plane flew him to Costa Rica and then on to El Salvador, where Felix Rodriguez, a Cuban-American comrade from his C.I.A. days, was waiting for him with a job helping the secret contra resupply operation directed by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the White House aide.
Mr. Posada was working for the American Government again, this time for a covert operation that had ties to the C.I.A. and the local military attache, but which was run by the White House.
In his autobiography, Mr. Posada acknowledged his debt to Mr. Mas. He wrote that "a group from Miami, all very prominent, among them Jorge Mas, Feliciano Foyo, Pepe Hernandez and others" created a "pool" to handle his finances. Mr. Foyo, who first met Mr. Posada during their training for the Bay of Pigs, is the longtime treasurer of the Cuban-American Foundation, while Mr. Hernandez is the group's president.
"I usually got $2,000 to $3,000 a month from Jorge," Mr. Posada elaborated recently. "Every month someone came from Miami, and they gave me money. But as soon as I started working with the contras, I said stop sending me money, because I am working."
Mr. Posada was given a Salvadoran passport in the name of Ramon Medina Rodriguez. He coordinated the flights of a fleet of rickety planes that ferried supplies for the contras from the Salvadoran air base at Ilopango to the battlefront.
The flights ended in October 1986, when Sandinista forces shot down one of the planes and captured an American named Eugene Hasenfus, who parachuted safely to the ground. Mr. Posada said he had relentlessly teased Mr. Hasenfus about his habit of wearing the parachute and had himself been scheduled to fly aboard the downed aircraft but had narrowly missed the flight.
Captured by the Nicaraguan Government, Mr. Hasenfus began talking and immediately admitted that the contra operation was being directed by a Cuban exile known as Max Gomez whose real name was Felix Rodriguez. It was not long before the world learned that Ramon Medina was actually Luis Posada Carriles, the international fugitive.
These days, however, Mr. Posada describes his relationship with Mr. Rodriguez as frosty. According to F.B.I. documents obtained by the National Security Archive, Mr. Posada was interviewed for more than six hours at the American Embassy in Honduras regarding his role in the Iran-contra affair and complained to F.B.I. agents that Mr. Rodriguez "talked too much."
"They wanted me to come to Washington to testify against Oliver North," he said in the recent interview. "I refused to go," he continued proudly, adding disparagingly that "Felix went and testified." Of Mr. Rodriguez he said: "You see, he's like a boy, like a child. Felix was an enemy of Oliver North."
 
The Guatemala Years
Wounded by Gunmen; A Long Recovery
At loose ends after the Iran-contra affair, Mr. Posada soon signed on as a security consultant to Vinicio Cerezo, Guatemala's first democratically elected civilian President in a generation. Mr. Cerezo's biggest challenge was to curb the power of the Guatemalan military, and Mr. Posada's reputation for loyalty and tenacity seemed to make him the ideal choice to keep an eye on restive officers or guerrillas who might be planning a coup or an assassination.
But at the same time, Mr. Posada continued to pursue his campaign against the Cuban Government, keeping in close touch with his friends in Miami.
Mr. Posada said that in the 1980's, Gaspar Jimenez delivered money and messages to him. Mr. Jimenez, who was jailed in the 1976 murder of a Cuban diplomat in Mexico, now works at the medical clinic run by Dr. Alberto Hernandez, the foundation's current chairman, according to employees there.
A prominent Cuban exile, who has known Mr. Jimenez for 40 years, said the money had been provided by Cuban-Americans in Miami. Mr. Jimenez, he said, gave Mr. Posada $15,000 "for every act of sabotage." Mr. Jimenez did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Posada's activities were brought to a halt on Feb. 28, 1990, though, when three gunmen he describes as Cuban intelligence operatives approached his car as it was stopped in traffic in Guatemala City and opened fire at him. He was hit by a dozen bullets, and he survived, he said, only because he was able to drive himself to a gasoline station and scratch out a note that mentioned his relationship with Mr. Cerezo and asked for an ambulance to be called.
"It took two years and three surgeries to recover," Mr. Posada said. "My last surgery was a year ago. A doctor friend from Houston came down and operated on me at an army base in El Salvador."
In his book, Mr. Posada said his medical bills, some $22,000, were paid by friends in Miami. Once again, leaders of the Cuban-American National Foundation, among them Dr. Hernandez, who succeeded Mr. Mas Canosa as chairman of the group last November, and Mr. Foyo, its treasurer, led the effort.
Mr. Posada acknowledged that many people besides his enemies in Cuba had had motive to want him eliminated. Guerrilla groups in Venezuela, the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador had all been victims of his anti-Communist zeal, and the Guatemalan Army had long been resentful of an outsider being brought in to advise and protect Mr. Cerezo.
But Mr. Posada said he was certain that his attackers were Cuban operatives, citing information provided to him by an unidentified friend in Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. "They were supposed to kidnap me and take me back to Cuba, interrogate me and have me confess on television," he maintained.
 
The Final Years
Dreading That Castro May Outlive Him
At an age when most of his contemporaries have retired and are doting on their grandchildren, Luis Posada Carriles has returned with renewed vigor and determination in recent years to the struggle that has consumed him all of his adult life. Time is running out, he made it clear, both for him and his lifelong adversaries.
With Mr. Mas dead, Mr. Posada said, he is particularly concerned that the anti-Castro movement is now rudderless and drifting. One of the reasons he agreed to come forward now to discuss his activities, he explained, was in hopes of reinvigorating the cause.
"Right now is a bad time," he said. "Too many years. Everybody is very old."
Mr. Posada said he last spoke with Mr. Mas about a month before he died of cancer that began in the prostate and spread to the lungs and bones. "He was very sick then," he said. "It was very sad. He was in terrible pain. He knew he was dying. He was a very powerful man." Mr. Posada paused. "Now is nothing."
Equally disturbing is the attitude of American Government agencies, Mr. Posada said. Cuba is not as important an issue to the Clinton White House as it was to earlier administrations, and many of the veteran operatives for whom he performed favors -- and from whom he collected them -- have long since passed from the scene, leaving him to deal with a younger, less sympathetic generation. "It's been a long time since I've done anything for them," he lamented.
"It's a new relationship," he continued, with concern evident in his voice. "The problem is that they think the money which helped me in the operation came from the States," which would be a violation of American law. When it was suggested to him that was indeed the case, he replied "Yes, it's obvious."
As Mr. Posada sees it, because he does not stage his anti-Castro activities from within the United States, his activities should be of no concern to the American authorities. "What I do is from Latin America, and my targets are inside Cuba," he said. "I am not a citizen, so they do not have power over me."
Mr. Posada suspects that he may be questioned by the American authorities about the hotel bombings, and he is bitter about the way he and the Cuban exile cause have been treated over the years. After a long courtship, he feels, he and his compatriots were seduced and then abandoned.
But most distressing of all is the nagging thought that his nemesis, Fidel Castro, might outlive him, as he has already outlived Mr. Mas. "Maybe I pass away before Castro," he said with a shrug. "Nobody knows."
Informed that Mr. Castro's mother lived well into her 90's and that another relative recently celebrated her 105th birthday, Mr. Posada groaned. "Oh my God," he said. But then, shaking his head and wagging his finger, he quoted a popular proverb, as if to reassure himself. It is derived from the Cuban tradition of slaughtering a hog for a holiday meal: "A cada lechon se le llega su Nochebuena," or "Every pig gets its Christmas Eve."

Desperado Democracies

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Three weeks ago I visited Tirana, Albania, and on my way out of the airport to board my plane, I was stopped by an Albanian customs "official." She looked me up and down and asked: "How much money are you carrying?" There was a certain Jesse James tone in her voice. I told her I had $3,500. "$3,500," she repeated, her eyes lighting up. "He has $3,500," she said to her fellow customs agent. "Where are you from?" he asked, apparently trying to determine if I was a diplomat and therefore immune from this bureaucratic stickup. "I'm from The New York Times," I answered. "Let him go," the man said, apparently concluding it wouldn't be good publicity to separate me from my money.
These two Albanian customs agents had a lot more in common with Bonnie & Clyde than Coopers & Lybrand. They were a reminder, though, of a basic truth -- that in many formerly Communist countries, the successor to Communism is more often kleptocracy than democracy. That fact is too often forgotten in today's debates about China, Russia and other once-Communist states. 
 For instance, the Kosovo Liberation Army is now talking about uniting all the Albanian communities in the Balkans into a "Greater Albania." That is a frightening thought -- not because Albanians aren't entitled to unification, but because they haven't proved they can properly run one Albania, let alone five put together. The whole debate in Washington about China is when it will become a democracy. The much more important question -- for them and us -- is how it will become a democracy. How will it make the leap from where it is now -- with antiquated institutions and a police-state apparatus increasingly unsuited to its rapidly modernizing economy -- to a more open, rule-based system, without chaos in the transition?
It is one thing for Albania to collapse; it would be quite another for China to start spewing refugees, weapons and financial scams. "China had 70,000 traffic deaths last year -- roughly 630 deaths per 100,000 cars. America had 21 deaths per 100,000 cars," notes the Stanford University China scholar Mike Oksenberg. "It's because China has all these new highways with inadequate passing signs, or warnings about oncoming hills, or even traffic lights in some places, and no free press to report on it all. Their growth is simply outrunning their existing systems of governance and education."
That's why the ultimate test of U.S. China policy is not whether President Clinton shook his fist hard enough at President Jiang Zemin. The ultimate test is how well the U.S. uses its influence to promote a more rule-of-law system in China -- one that first constrains the Chinese state, and then gradually lays an institutional foundation that can carry Chinese society forward after the inevitable collapse of the Communist Party or its evolution into an electoral body.
If Congress wants to do something useful on China, it should spare us the chest-thumping and instead appropriate the funds sought by Mr. Clinton to train lawyers, judges and law professors in China. When Communist states collapse, before the new institutions have evolved you are much more likely to get Russia -- where they have a free press and the Mafia guns down inquisitive journalists -- than you are the best case, Poland, which had a Catholic Church and trade unions to fall back on.
But preventing Albania in China takes a lot of engagement, on a lot of levels. Those who argue that America should simply isolate China and hasten the collapse of its system now are just begging for a big Albania.
Fatos Lubonja, editor of the Albanian literary journal Endeavor, talked to me in Tirana about post-Communist Albania: "After Communism we had total equality in Albania. We were all at zero. There was no real infrastructure, no one really had property or contacts. Politics became just another business, because being a politician meant you could or could not give stamps of approval. The free market here was considered freedom to do anything. One of the West's great errors was that during the collapse of Communism, sometimes we changed the people in charge , but we did not really change the system. Instead of building a free economy, based on initiative and risk, we created a criminal economy. No one understood that without the software of real governing institutions , Albania is just a jungle."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq Sets a Record on Gains From Technology Issues

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
A brighter earnings outlook for several leading technology companies propelled the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index to its fourth consecutive new high yesterday.
Aside from the gains among technology issues, stocks were mixed, as investors pondered how the unexpected resignation of Japan's Prime Minister would affect American companies. 
 The Nasdaq composite rose 22.49 points, to 1,965.53, led by gains among some of its bellwether issues like Microsoft, Intel and Dell Computer.
The surge in the index reflected renewed enthusiasm by investors for computer-related issues, which have largely been the torchbearers of this year's bull market. Many investors are now betting that earnings and sales of these companies -- which have taken a hit this year, in part because of slowing demand -- will rebound in the second half of 1998, as a worldwide glut of personal computers abates. Once that happens, makers of personal computers like Dell and Compaq will increase production and purchases of computer chips, improving the lot of chip makers like Intel.
Shares of Intel rose 2 5/8, to 82 3/8, on expectations that sales for the world's largest semiconductor maker will soon improve. While Intel is expected to report weak second-quarter earnings later this week, investors are optimistic the company will signal a sales improvement in the second half of the year.
Microsoft gained 4 3/8, to 117 9/16, on optimism that it would report better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.53 points, to 9,096.21. General Motors, Exxon, Sears, Roebuck and Procter & Gamble were among the blue chip decliners.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.86 points, to 1,165.19, just 1.18 points shy of the record close set last Wednesday.
In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei index rose 1.68 percent, but most equity markets were lower. The Prime Minister of Japan, Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned, accepting responsibility for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's dismal showing in weekend elections.
Reacting to the news, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen yesterday and Treasury bond prices dropped, suffering their largest declines in more than a month. The retreat indicated a possible end to the recent strong gains by the dollar and bonds, much of which was attributed to safe-haven buying by foreign investors.
Analysts offered mixed views of how domestic stock markets will fare as a result of the latest Japanese development.
"I'm just breathing a sigh of relief that they got off the ground," said Peter J. Canelo, a United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "I wasn't expecting a resignation, but that's even better. It's an even stronger signal that they're going to do something right."
But other analysts remain skeptical that the resignation signals that the Japanese Government is ready to take quick action and carry out major economic changes to pull the economy out of recession.
"Investors around the world are looking for concrete steps," said Douglas Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities in New York. "There've been a lot of false starts."
"There's change," Mr. Cliggott added. "I think people are hoping there will be change in the right direction, but I don't know if there's anything to support" that conclusion.
While technology shares led the market higher yesterday, declines among issues like Applied Materials indicated that aside from global economic news, quarterly corporate earnings reports are still a focus.
Applied Materials closed at 28 9/16, down 15/16. Shares declined after the computer chip equipment manufacturer warned that fiscal third-quarter earnings would fall below analysts' forecasts, weakened by order delays and spending cutbacks.
But "the stock really didn't cascade" the way other shares have done after forecasting earnings disappointments, said Anthony Conroy, a managing director for Bankers Trust Global Investment Management. He attributed the stock's limited slide to investors' belief that "we're close to a bottom" and the sector is ready to rebound.

HEADLINE: Japan's Voter Revolt

 BODY:
Japanese governments do not normally resign after election losses for Parliament's less important upper house. But so emphatic was the defeat voters inflicted on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Sunday that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto decided to quit. The L.D.P. had expected to take about 60 of the 126 seats being contested. It won only 44.
The rebuke was richly deserved, and Mr. Hashimoto was right to resign. For most of its two and a half years in power, his Government made no serious effort to revive the world's second-largest economy, and indeed made matters worse by introducing a national sales tax. When the Prime Minister finally did cut taxes earlier this year, it was too little and too late. Japan, once the main engine of Asian prosperity, now threatens to drag its neighbors and itself into prolonged recession. 
 Despite Washington's repeated urgings to reform, reflate and clean up billions in bad bank debt, Mr. Hashimoto spent most of his term dithering instead of leading. Like most of his predecessors, he deferred to powerful Finance Ministry officials, who preferred inaction to reforms that might erode their bureaucratic grip.
Only this month, eight years after Japan's banks began weakening, did Mr. Hashimoto announce a credible plan for weeding out failing institutions and reinforcing the rest. Now that belated but important initiative could be lost in the extended transition rituals of Japanese politics.
The L.D.P., still the majority party in the lower house, will pick the next prime minister, spending the next week choosing among four uninspiring candidates. The front-runner, Keizo Obuchi, is even more colorless than Mr. Hashimoto. Two others, Kiichi Miyazawa and Yohei Kono, have already failed in leadership roles. The remaining contender, Seiroku Kajiyama, is a veteran insider who at least has called for more vigorous economic action. But there is little realistic hope of reform policies emerging from an L.D.P. system designed to keep things as they are.
The brightest aspect of this election may be the emergence of the Democratic Party, led by Naoto Kan, Japan's most popular politician, as a potential competitor to the L.D.P. Mr. Kan earned his popularity two years ago when, as Health Minister, he stood up to bureaucratic resistance to resolve a scandal over H.I.V. contamination of the blood supply.
The L.D.P. has recovered from past election setbacks and has always come back. But with Japan now facing its worst economic crisis of the postwar era, muddling through an additional two years to the next election is no longer an acceptable option. World financial markets will not accept it, and Asia's other economies cannot afford it. Now, it appears, Japan's voters have lost patience with it as well.

Treasury Prices Fall on Hints Of Japan and Russia Recovery

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities suffered their worst one-day losses in more than a month yesterday on suggestions that Japan and Russia would overcome their economic crises, which diminished the allure of United States bonds as a safe-haven investment.
The benchmark 30-year bond's price fell 31/32, or nearly $10 for each $1,000 in the face amount, to 106 7/32. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, increased to 5.69 percent from 5.62 percent on Friday. 
 The main force behind the bond selloff was the resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan, after weekend elections that reduced his party's power and showed widespread dissatisfaction with his Cabinet's handling of the country's deepening economic problems. The drop in United States bond prices came on speculation that the new Japanese prime minister, as yet to be designated, might speed up tax cuts and other measures to stimulate the economy.
The financial turmoil in Asia has been a major reason United States bonds have rallied in recent months, sending the yield on the long bond as low as 5.56 percent last week, the lowest level since the Treasury began regular sales of these securities in 1977. Buyers have been acting on the belief that Asia's problems will hurt the American economy, keeping inflation and interest rates down.
Bonds also weakened yesterday on news of an agreement on new international aid to Russia to help it avoid default. Russia's worsening economic problems had also been an important force driving up United States Treasury prices.
Today, bond traders should get more data on the possibility of American inflation when the Consumer Price Index for June is released along with the report on June retail sales. Most economists are expecting a gain of two-tenths of a percentage point, both in the overall inflation index and in so-called core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices.
Despite yesterday's bond market weakness, the weekly Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills met with strong demand. Three-month bills were priced to yield an average rate of 4.98 percent, up from 4.96 percent a week ago, while the six-month bill was priced to yield an average rate of 5.025 percent, up from 5.010 percent last week.

HEADLINE: The Murky Life of an International Gun Dealer

SERIES: A WORLD OF ARMS: Weapons in the Sky

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
An athletic-looking Dane, with blond hair, blue eyes and an arrest warrant for armed robbery, hires a British arms dealer with a Walter Mitty complex. In Latvia, they buy a Russian cargo plane and have it flown to Bulgaria where it is loaded with 77 cases of weapons, including 300 assault rifles, ammunition, pistols, hand grenades and rocket launchers.
The lumbering plane then heads east to India. When it gets over the village of Purulia, near Calcutta, the weapons are shoved out, drifting down under parachute rigging purchased in South Africa. The deal is financed out of Hong Kong. The intended recipient is a violent religious sect. 
 However fictional it might sound, this was a real-life arms shipment, one that reveals the circuitous measures terrorists and rebel groups employ to get weapons, and how relatively easy it is for them to do so. It also illustrates the almost complete lack of international controls on the small-arms trade. In Oslo on Monday, the United States and 20 other governments opened a meeting to discuss measures to deal with the spread of assault rifles, pistols, grenades and other so-called small arms.
Generally it is not a crime for a weapons dealer to get around the arms-control laws of his country by having the weapons shipped from another country.
"It's a huge loophole," said Geraldine O'Callaghan, an analyst at the British American Security Information Council, an independent group that lobbies on small-arms issues. "It needs to be addressed urgently."
In the United States, the Clinton Administration closed this loophole two years ago by giving the State Department greater authority to monitor and regulate arms brokers. As a result, American arms dealers are now subject to the same laws whether they are shipping weapons directly from the United States or brokering deals abroad.
The Administration is pushing other countries to adopt similar controls.
Britain plans to address this, but only in part, by preventing arms dealers from selling weapons to countries on which the United Nations has arms embargoes.
While weapons falling from the sky is downright bizarre, the other elements of this tale typify a black-market small-arms transaction.
"You have deals like this being brokered on all continents of the world every day," said Donald Manross, an American who is the director of the firearms and explosives division at Interpol, the international police group that is still investigating the Purulia deal, which occurred in late 1995.
It is easier for the black-market trade to flourish because even legal transactions are highly secret. To protect the commercial interests of businesses, most governments, including the United States, do not disclose information about licenses issued to arms exporters.
Also, the document that governments rely on to control the destination of weapons, the so-called end-user certificate, can be easily forged, and a dealer has no legal responsibility to check on the validity of this certificate before shipping the weapons.
Rebel groups and terrorists use phony end-user certificates in order to disguise where the weapons will wind up.
Britain has tough export controls, but in this sale to the Indian religious sect, none of the arms touched British soil and no British documents were involved. Thus, while the British arms broker, Peter von Kalkstein-Bleach, languishes in a Calcutta jail on charges of waging war against India -- his plane was grounded by Indian authorities in Bombay when the deal went sour -- he does not appear to have violated any laws in Britain where he was based.
Nor is the other British arms-trading company, Border Technology and Innovations Ltd., which arranged for the weapons to be bought and shipped from Bulgaria, accused of any crime.
Mr. Bleach has pleaded not guilty in India to 12 counts, all of which carry the death sentence.
The deal began in the summer of 1995 when Mr. Bleach heard from a German commodities trader that a Danish businessman wanted to buy weapons.
Like many arms traders, Mr. Bleach, now 47, has a military background and colorful resume. After serving in the British Army, he was a prison guard in what was then white-ruled Rhodesia. He returned to Britain as a private investigator and later took up commodities trading, including arms deals. His company, Aeroserve, has a license from the British Defense Ministry.
"He's a Walter Mitty character, and a bit of a lady's man," said Christopher Hudson, who met Mr. Bleach 15 years ago in the course of their political activities in the Tory Party.
Mr. Hudson, who is engaged in a campaign to save Mr. Bleach from hanging, likes to call Mr. Bleach "the Milk Tray man." It is a reference to an advertisement popular in Britain in the 1970's, where a dashing man in a black polo shirt jumps out of planes and helicopters and braves shark-infested waters or other dangers to deliver a lady her Cadbury's chocolates.
For the Purulia deal, Mr. Bleach showed up in Amsterdam to meet a short man with a big Adam's apple, contact lenses and sunken cheeks, who introduced himself as Kim Davy. Mr. Bleach also met with Mr. Davy, and his lawyer, at the business center of the Intercontinental Hotel in central London.
Mr. Davy's real name is Niels Christian Nielsen. He was born in Denmark in December 1961, according to a confidential Interpol report. He took the name Kim Davy from a New Zealand infant who died at the age of 5 weeks. He has also engaged in gold and drug smuggling, money laundering and counterfeiting $100 bills, according to the report Interpol refers to as a "red notice."
A teetotaler and vegetarian, Mr. Nielsen is a member of the Ananda Marga, a Hindu fundamentalist group founded in 1955 in India, according to Interpol. The police agency says that the sect has been responsible for "many acts and threats of violence against Indian Government buildings and personnel," and was the intended recipient of the weapons. Mr. Davy eluded the Indian police when Mr. Bleach was seized and is still at large. Several European countries also want him for crimes ranging from armed robbery to counterfeiting.
A series of faxes from Mr. Bleach to Mr. Davy and his partners provides rare glimpses inside the world of small-arms trading.
"I stressed from the very beginning that in order to be successful, it is most important that this resembles a perfectly normal transaction in every possible way," Mr. Bleach wrote in one five-page fax.
"No single contractor should be aware of the entire route," Mr. Bleach scolded. Only the pilot should be aware of the ultimate destination of the weapons, he said.
For reasons that are not completely clear, at the time he was meeting with Mr. Davy, Mr. Bleach decided to go to the British authorities.
In a letter to the British Defense Ministry, one that is again highly revealing, Mr. Bleach said that if he backed out of the deal, Mr. Davy "will simply go elsewhere, and somebody else will provide the goods."
In the end, he took $30,000 from Mr. Davy and bought the Russian aircraft, Mr. Hudson said. After the operation, Mr. Bleach planned to sell the plane and keep the money as part of his profit, Mr. Hudson said.
To get the arms, Mr. Bleach turned to Border Technology, an arms-trading company in Hexham, in northeast England, because it had experience in getting weapons, said Peter Scott, one of the company's two directors; both men are former British military officers.
Border Technology would not discuss the details of the transaction but Mr. Bleach told Mr. Hudson that the company was paid $165,000 for the first shipment of weapons, the one that was parachuted, netting the company a "minimum profit" of $100,000.
Besides the 300 Kalashnikov assault rifles there were 20,000 rounds of ammunition; 15 9-millimeter pistols and 4,000 rounds of ammunition; two sniper rifles, with night vision sights; 10 rocket launchers and 200 rocket grenades, and 100 hand grenades.
If they had been shipped from Britain, Border Technology would have needed an export license, which the British Government might have been reluctant to issue.
So Border Technology turned to a leading Bulgarian arms maker, the Arsenal Company, for the high-quality Kalashnikov rifles and pistols. On the shipping documents Arsenal declared the weapons "technical equipment" and omitted the code of letters and numbers that would have identified the cargo as weapons, a senior Bulgarian defense official said.
Arsenal did not respond to telephone and fax requests for comment.
In a letter from prison to Mr. Hudson last August, Mr. Bleach said that when he became suspicious about the deal, he told one of Border Technology's directors "the facts, and suggested that it would be a damned good idea to call the authorities."
"He did not want to know," Mr. Bleach wrote. Mr. Bleach had already made his initial contact with the authorities, and continued to talk with them after his warning to Border Technology, Mr. Hudson said.
Mr. Scott, the Border Technology director, said his company had acted on the basis of what it considered to be a "genuine" certificate that identified the final customer as the Bangladesh Defense Ministry, and in any event had done nothing improper.
The certificate was fraudulent, Mr. Hudson said.
If significant curbs are going to be made on the shadowy arms trade, said Mr. Manross of Interpol, end-user certificates need to be standardized so that it is more difficult for them to be forged and easier for a company to check their validity.
Mr. Manross noted that in the last year there has been considerable discussion among independent groups that study the small-arms trade, and a few governments, about the need to crack down on the illicit trade in small weapons. "Now, we have to move to concrete action," he said.
 
Later articles will report on other aspects of the spread of arms around the world.

GRAPHIC: Map/Chart: "Explosive Loophole"
In most countries, it is not a crime for a broker sitting in an office in one country to arrange for a load of arms made in a second country to be shipped to a customer in a third. Here is one such case.
 
1. A British arms dealer, Peter von Kalkstein-Bleach, agrees to purchase weapons for a Danish client, Kim Davy.
 
2. Mr. Bleach arranges for the purchase of a Russian cargo plane, an Antonov 26, in Latvia.
 
3. The plane is flown to Bulgaria where it is loaded with 77 cases of Bulgarian-made weapons including assault rifles, ammunition, pistols, hand grenades and rocket launchers.
Mr. Bleach and Mr. Davy board the plane.
 
4. The plane continues on to India. The weapons are dropped by parachute into Purulia, near Calcutta, for delivery to a militant religious sect.
 
5. In Bombay the plane is grounded by Indian authorities and Mr. Bleach is arrested. Mr. Davy, the mastermind of the plan, escapes and is still at large.

HEADLINE: Second Time Around, and Around;
Remanufacturing Is Gaining Ground in Corporate America

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Dig inside the Xerox Corporation's newest stand-alone digital copier and the nuts and bolts of a big shift in manufacturing swing into view.
Parts that were welded are now fastened, and easy to take apart. Components that were scattered throughout the machine are arranged on subassemblies that can easily be lifted out. The fuser roll, which fixes the toner to the paper, is no longer made of an aluminum core that is tossed out when its rubberized coating wears off; the core is now a combination of aluminum and steel that can be recoated again and again. 
 Why all the changes -- particularly since some of the new parts are more expensive to make? Because they add a re-use option to the "recycle or dump it" choice for disposing of used or obsolete products.
"In the long run, it is cheaper to re-use a part than to recycle it," said Jack C. Azar, Xerox's director of environment, health and safety.
Once the purview of myriad small companies that eked out a living refurbishing carburetors, printer cartridges and other used parts, remanufacturing -- a method of re-using old parts in new machines -- has hit corporate America in a big way.
From Xerox to Saturn, from Lucent to DuPont, from Kodak to Steelcase, companies of all types and technologies are looking to remanufacturing as a premier way to hold costs down and keep products out of landfills. No longer happy to let their small-company forebears breathe new life into their discarded machines, many are stepping up their collection methods and re-use technologies to bring older products home.
But they are not content just to salvage parts from old products. Now, they are beginning to design products with eventual remanufacturing in mind.
"We're finally convincing designers that it doesn't matter if a part is twice as expensive, if you can use it again and again," said Cavan Kelsey, manager of design for health, safety and environment at the Eastman Kodak Company, which recently replaced some plastic parts in its high-speed copiers with more expensive, but reusable, stainless steel.
Designers are not the only converts. The Federal Trade Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and even Congress have recently embraced remanufacturing, with money, technological support and new rules. And numerous universities are studying it and teaching it.
In fact, interest is running so high that some manufacturers are using design changes and sometimes lawsuits to keep the independent remanufacturers at bay. Some are fearful that the remanufactured versions of their products will eat too deeply into sales of new ones. Others just want to do the remanufacturing themselves.
Although they have similar environmental goals, recycling and remanufacturing are not at all alike. Recycling generally involves destroying something so that its materials can be re-used. remanufacturers remove parts, test them, refurbish them and re-use them.
Recycling methods -- melting down steel or dissolving paper -- can be energy intensive and polluting, and often yield lower-grade materials. And they do not recapture the value that was added through processing or assembling.
By contrast, "remanufacturing is an affordable way to get the highest value out of parts," said Nabil Nasr, director of the Rochester Institute of Technology's National Center for remanufacturing and Resource Recovery. That realization, said Stuart L. Hart, professor of strategic management at the Kenan-Flagler Business School of the University of North Carolina, is yielding "tremendous corporate interest in, and sophistication about, remanufacturing."
Universities are fanning the embers. Kenan-Flagler just hired a professor of reverse logistics -- getting products back and remanufacturing them. The Rochester Institute sponsored a conference on remanufacturing in June. Gary A. Davis, director of the Center for Clean Products and Clean Technology at the University of Tennessee, said his group was about to study remanufacturing for the automobile industry "because it is infinitely superior to any type of recycling."
And numerous schools now preach remanufacturing in industrial design courses. "We are teaching students that it is silly to think one-time use when they design products," said Steven Derby, associate professor of mechanical engineering at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
remanufacturing is no panacea. The logistics of getting products back can be daunting. So can putting in tracking systems to insure that a part with a 10-use life is not on its 11th go-round. And some customers eschew remanufactured products, no matter how rigorously tested and warrantied.
"Some people will always believe that if something isn't brand new, it isn't high quality," said Michael J. Best, a product manager for Steelcase Inc., which makes new and remanufactured furniture.
Still, a growing number of manufacturers think the pluses outweigh the drawbacks. Computer companies, including the International Business Machines Corporation, are retrieving chips from old machines. Telecommunications equipment companies, including Lucent Technologies, are remanufacturing switching equipment. Lexmark International, which remanufactures its own printer cartridges, is looking "on a test basis" at whether it should use remanufactured parts in printers, a spokesman said.
The General Motors Corporation's Saturn division is working with the University of Tennessee to develop a software program that tracks the energy and environmental impact of every part of a car, from manufacture to disposal. One major use for the program: letting designers run "what if" scenarios to see whether tinkering with certain parts will make them easier to recycle or remanufacture. "We want designers to look at the environmental component of all their decisions," said William R. Miller 3d, Saturn's manager of environmental affairs.
Even chemical companies, which deal with vats of materials rather than discrete parts, are learning to remanufacture. Instead of melting down old polyester film -- which degrades the fiber -- or burning it for fuel, DuPont now "unzips" the polyester molecule down to its atoms, and remanufactures the polyester. DuPont is "scouting around for a similar chemistry for nylon," said John B. Carberry, director of environmental technology. "Billions of pounds of nylon carpeting is going into landfill that we should be able to re-use."
Collins & Aikman Floor Coverings Inc. has noticed that, too. It has a new technology, which falls between recycling and remanufacturing, for grinding up old carpets and, without any chemical processing, using them as backing for new ones. "You can do this forever, without the fiber degrading in any way," said Lee H. Schilling, senior vice president.
Remanufacturing as a separate industry has been around for more than 50 years. Remanufactured parts dominate the aftermarket for cars and trucks. Remanufactured office furniture and printer cartridges have also been available for years.
The United States military, the largest remanufacturer in the world, routinely uses remanufactured parts in vehicles and weapons. And "disposable" cameras are a misnomer: since the early 1990's, Fuji and Kodak have retrieved them from photofinishers and re-used the flash and other parts in new cameras.
"It didn't take long to realize how much value was left in those so-called throwaways," said Stephen C. Rumsey, Kodak's manufacturing manager for single-use cameras.
Indeed, remanufacturing is a good-sized industry in its own right. Robert T. Lund, a professor of manufacturing engineering at Boston University, said that in 1996, the last year for which he gathered figures, companies that rebuild parts comprised a $53 billion business employing 480,000 people.
But until recently, manufacturers and regulators barely acknowledged them. "This industry has grown and grown, yet it's been completely overlooked," Professor Lund said.
Now, remanufacturing is being promoted by its proponents -- including several state legislators in New York, which is home to many cartridge remanufacturers -- as the answer to everything from global warming (it requires less energy, and thus reduces greenhouse gases) to welfare reform (it provides jobs for low-skilled workers). Congress just granted the Rochester Institute's remanufacturing center $10 million over five years to develop new technologies.
The F.T.C., whose Green Guide to products with recycled content is widely followed by corporate and government procurement departments, amended its guidelines in May to embrace remanufactured products. The E.P.A. is financing some studies on remanufacturing. "It's an environmentally friendly solution for businesses looking to hold down costs," said Jane Bare, a chemical engineer in the E.P.A.'s office of research and development.
Remanufacturing companies are trying to capitalize on their new fame. Last year they formed the Remanufacturing Industries Council International, which is lobbying Congress to make remanufacturing equipment eligible for a 25 percent capital investment tax credit.
"As George Burns used to say, 'Hang around long enough, and you'll get discovered,' " said William Gager, chairman of both the Automotive Parts Rebuilders Association and the new council.
But what may be old hat for Mr. Gager is brand new for primary manufacturers. Many are under pressure from shareholders to meet environmental goals, and from customers who, facing their own environmental pressures and leery of rising landfill charges, want them to take back used items.
The pace of technology and the robust economy together encourage companies to upgrade old equipment, creating a steady flow of products to be remanufactured. And the pressure to keep costs down, combined with the growing number of start-up businesses that cannot afford all-new products, has created a growing market for remanufactured goods like office furniture or cartridges, which, unlike remanufactured copiers or cameras, are generally sold at a discount.
The battle lines between primary manufacturers and the independent remanufacturers are being drawn. Several printer companies have redesigned their cartridges to make them harder to refill. And they have aggressively sued remanufacturers -- and sometimes each other -- for trademark infringements when the packaging on the remanufactured cartridges looks too much like that on their new ones.
Furniture manufacturers may be playing hardball, too. Bill Davies, owner of Davies Office Refurbishing in Albany, says it used to be simple to remove fabric from the frames of office panels; now, he says, Steelcase and other manufacturers are laminating the fabrics "solely to make them hard to remanufacture."
Mr. Best of Steelcase says that is nonsense -- particularly since his company has a thriving remanufacturing business of its own. "The new design makes it easier to route cable through the panels," he said.
Maybe so. But it also brings more of the panels home to Steelcase itself for remanufacturing.

Chart: "Re-Use It or Lose It"
A new Xerox copier is a prime example of a movement among companies to design and build new products in a way that allows key parts to be re-used over and over again. The idea is to hold down costs and avoid unnecessary waste.
 
ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING
At its Utica, N.Y., factory, Xerox builds and remanufactures the fuser cartridge - the heart of the image reproduction system - for its new digital copy machine.
 
RE-USE
Instead of throwing out the cartridge, as it did in previous models, the company rebuilds the part after 275,000 copies.
 
INSPECTION
The fuser cartridge is disassembled, cleaned and examined.
 
SEPARATION
Individual parts that can be refurbished are sent to the factory where the machine is built.
 
REMANUFACTURING
At a separate site, the roll inside the fuser cartridge is stripped of its coating and a new skin is put on. The cartridge is remanufactured to meet specifications.
 
RECYCLING
Anything that cannot be re-used is recycled.
 
DELIVERY
The rebuilt part is installed in a copier.

HEADLINE: George Dunne, 92, Priest and Ecumenist, Dies

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
The Rev. George H. Dunne, a Jesuit priest who was an impassioned critic of racial segregation and prominent in ecumenical efforts to combat poverty and foster peace, died on June 30 in a hospital in Los Gatos, Calif., outside San Jose, near the Jesuit retirement community where he had been living. He was 92.
Father Dunne was also a student of Chinese theology and language, a playwright and an author. But he was best known for his criticism in the 1940's of racial segregation, particularly in Roman Catholic institutions. 
 "He was basically a prophetic voice for social justice long before his time," said the Rev. Paul Locatelli, president of Santa Clara University, a Jesuit institution in Santa Clara, Calif. "He talked about racism back in the 1940's. He predicted in 1933 that if we did not develop democratic leaders in China, it would fall to the Communists within 30 years."
Father Dunne made that prediction after spending a year as a missionary in China.
Later, after receiving a doctorate in international relations in 1944 from the University of Chicago, he went to work at the Institute of Social Order, a new program at St. Louis University, another Jesuit institution, that was meant to respond to social problems and increase Jesuits' awareness of them.
But as things turned out, he was transferred to California after strongly expressing his opposition to racial discrimination at the university. In 1946, in an article published in the influential Catholic lay magazine Commonweal, he branded segregation a sin. (He was later called one of the first prominent Roman Catholics to have done so.) In that article, he contended, among other things, that segregation constituted a breach of justice.
A year earlier he had written a play, "Trial by Fire," that described the bombing of a black family that had moved into a Los Angeles neighborhood restricted to whites. The play was performed in 1947 and 1948 in Los Angeles and Chicago and at the Blackfriars Theater in New York.
Father Dunne spent much time and energy combating prejudice: writing articles, making speeches and taking part in numerous civil rights demonstrations, including several led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
In 1968, Pope Paul VI and the Rev. Eugene Carson Blake, the general secretary of the World Council of Churches, named him the first director of the Committee on Society, Development and Peace, an ecumenical group based in Geneva.
Father Dunne wrote later in "The King's Pawn: The Memoirs of George Dunne, S.J." (Loyola Press, 1990) that the committee's "stated purpose was to focus attention upon the problems of poverty, especially in the third world, and upon the imperatives of peace."
"Through the churches," he added, "it proposed to quicken the consciences first of Christians, and then of all men and women, to their moral responsibility to concern themselves with the issues."
He and other members of the committee traveled widely and held conferences in Lebanon, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere. At a conference in 1968 in the mountains above Beirut, participants blamed a lack of political will, among rich and poor nations alike, for inadequate economic growth in most emerging nations.
Pope Paul VI sent a special blessing to that gathering, and messages from him and leaders of the World Council of Churches emphasized the importance of joint Christian action in the sphere of international cooperation.
After four years as director of the committee, Father Dunne retired from the post. The panel expired not long afterward.
Father Dunne's chief literary work was "Generation of Giants" (1962), about Matteo Ricci and other Jesuit missionaries who worked in China during the Ming and Manchu dynasties. His view was that those missionaries' lives had provided a lesson for the present day by adapting Christianity and humanism to the culture of China and not imposing Western ways on the Chinese.
A relative of the American humorist and journalist Finley Peter Dunne and the author Dominick Dunne, Father Dunne was born in St. Louis, grew up in Los Angeles and studied at various institutions, receiving a bachelor's degree from Loyola College in Los Angeles and a master's from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash.
In later years, his activities included teaching at Loyola and at Santa Clara and serving as the president's assistant for international programs at Geogetown University.
Father Dunne is survived by six nieces and two nephews.

HEADLINE: TURNOVER IN JAPAN: WASHINGTON;
White House Hopes Japan Can Restore Confidence

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
The White House today urged Japan's next Government to move quickly to "restore confidence in Japan's financial system," even while Administration officials said they feared that political paralysis in Tokyo greatly complicated efforts to ignite a recovery in Asia and ease pressure on other countries, including Russia.
White House officials today spent little time mourning the departure of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose slowness to act on economic reforms had been a continuing source of frustration here. 
 But several Administration officials wondered aloud whether any of Mr. Hashimoto's likely successors would be able to piece together a coalition strong enough to bail out the Japanese banking system and provide a sharp stimulus to the economy -- and to do so before the deterioration in the Japanese currency does greater damage to the world economy.
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said in an interview, "One can hope that this vote will be seen by the new administration in Japan as a definitive wake-up call."
But colleagues of hers in the Administration said it was too early to determine whether Mr. Hashimoto's party would interpret its electoral loss on Sunday as a signal to accelerate reforms or a sign that it should be cautious about causing economic pain.
Some experts on Japan say the election could stimulate action. "Up to now the main pressure to get the house in order was from the U.S. and from the markets," said Michael Mochizuki, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "That was big pressure. But still, what you read from Japan was that no one wanted to make any hard choices.
"Now there is domestic political pressure. The question is whether that translates into action."
How the markets interpret the politics will reverberate beyond Japan. Just a few weeks ago, for example, a Treasury Department study found a "surprisingly strong correlation" between the fall of the yen and the flight of investors from Russia.
Like the other financial contagions that have swept through Asia and beyond in the last year, no one can entirely explain this phenomenon, beyond citing the psychology of increasingly wary investors who are nervous about emerging markets of all kinds, including Russia's.
But the link was one more factor in the race to put together the loan package for Russia that was announced today by the International Monetary Fund.
It was this same concern about Russia, and the growing pressure on China to devalue its own currency, that led President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to order an intervention in the currency markets a month ago to strengthen the yen.
But Sunday's election could unwind that effort. If the political turmoil in Japan is prolonged, one result could be another panicky sell-off of the yen.
"This is going to soak up time that Japan doesn't have, and that the rest of Asia doesn't have," one Administration official said today.
The size of the Liberal Democrats' drubbing clearly took the Administration by surprise. At White House meetings last week, the consensus was that the party would garner at least 54 or 55 seats in the upper house of Parliament. It won only 44.
But in public today, Administration and Japanese officials aimed their public comments at forestalling a sharp reaction in the financial markets.
"Whoever the new Prime Minister is, he will try to implement the economic plans formulated by the Hashimoto Government," Japan's Ambassador to the United States, Kunihiko Saito, said as he sipped green tea in his office along Embassy Row.
Mr. Saito is a veteran of managing relations with Washington during times of upheaval: he was the country's top career diplomat, running the day-to-day operations of the Foreign Ministry, when the Liberal Democrats were thrown out of power in 1993. Then, it was because of corruption, not ineptitude in handling the economy.
But while Sunday's defeat was less dramatic, in some ways it is more complicated.
There was little international cost to the political chaos that followed the 1993 upset; the issues of political reform were entirely domestic. This time they ripple daily through the international markets.
So now, though the party retains the prime ministership, it must convince Washington, the markets and Asia that a weaker governing party will push through painful reforms that a stronger Government, under Mr. Hashimoto, shied away from.

HEADLINE: Hillary Clinton Inaugurates Preservation Campaign

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, July 13

 BODY:
The heroic bronze figures on the Francis Scott Key Monument are corroded, and an oar that was once in the statue's supple-looking stone waters is long gone. But standing in front of this beleaguered 1911 monument to the national anthem in a quiet, green square this afternoon, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke of renewal.
Her visit kicked off "Save America's Treasures," Mrs. Clinton's four-day history tour and preservation pledge drive that ends on Thursday in Seneca Falls, N.Y., at a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the first American women's rights convention. 
 In many ways, the tour reflects the current diversity of the historic preservation movement, once associated with battlefields, Presidents' birthplaces and blue-haired lady restorers in sneakers. Although Mrs. Clinton is in fact visiting one site where George Washington really slept -- his headquarters in Newburgh, N.Y. -- her stops also include a dilapidated theater, an Indian archaeological site, Thomas Alva Edison's laboratory and landmarks devoted to women's rights and African-American history.
The tour, a traditional First Lady-like endeavor, is designed to raise public awareness that if history is America's future, the bridge to the 21st century is in precarious shape.
Earlier today, the President appeared with his wife at the National Museum of American History in Washington. They were dwarfed by the original "Star-Spangled Banner." The 15-stripe, 15-star flag, which looms nearly three stories high, survived the attack on Fort McHenry in 1813-14 and inspired Francis Scott Key but is now a fragile, muted textile in dire need of restoration.
The President and First Lady shared the stage with Ralph Lauren, the designer who launched thousands of Polo sweaters with the American flag on them. Mrs. Clinton's campaign began with the announcement that Mr. Lauren had agreed to contribute $10 million toward the flag's conservation, including a state-of-the art laboratory that will be visible to museum-goers.
"We've been assured that this is a philanthropic gift and not a marketing gift," said I. Michael Heyman, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
The sites on Mrs. Clinton's tour include Federal, state and privately financed landmarks, all with expensive wish lists. One of the not-so-subtle purposes of the tour is to encourage public-private partnerships like Mr. Lauren's donation, the single largest corporate contribution in the Smithsonian's history.
The Park Service alone has a $1 billion backlog in historic structure repair, said Randall J. Biallas, the chief historical architect. The President's budget request of $50 million for the preservation program has yet to be approved by Congress.
"We are not talking about just generous gifts, but also encouraging kindergartners to collect pennies to clean up the monument in the town square," Mrs. Clinton said in an interview at the White House.
Speaking later at the National Museum of American History, she encouraged Americans to be "good ancestors," preserving landmark buildings as well as artifacts like "historic photographs yellowing in a county clerk's cabinet."
An example is the contents of the Thomas Alva Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, N.J. It was there, in his Invention Laboratory, that the master inventor developed, among other things, the motion picture camera, the nickel-iron-alkaline battery and the disk photograph.
Now a little-known outpost of the National Park Service, the site consists not only of historic structures, including the first building designed for motion-picture filming, but also 400,000 artifacts and 5 million pieces of paper, including original letters and lab notes, many of which are decomposing.
Mrs. Clinton is the latest of several First Ladies to adopt American history and the environment as their cause: Lady Bird Johnson campaigned for the beautification of the nation's highways, and Jacqueline Kennedy took on the renovation and preservation of the White House.
In her new endeavor, Mrs. Clinton has surrounded herself with preservation gurus, most notably Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which is sponsoring the "Save America's Treasures" program with the White House Millennium Council. "She's really into it," Mr. Moe said. "We've never had a First Lady this deeply involved."
Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that historic preservation is an easier cause than, say, health care. "The politics are less controversial," she said. "No one is going to stand up against 'The Star-Spangled Banner' and its need for preservation."
In embracing preservation, Mrs. Clinton is attaching her star to a populist design movement that has sprung from the ground up from its inception, often against the wishes of politicians. In 1859, for example, Anne Pamela Cunningham established the Mount Vernon Ladies Association as a last resort after failing to persuade either Congress or the State of Virginia to save the mansion from developers.
"Historic preservation is the most important singular popular mass movement to affect architecture and planning in the modern era," said Vincent Scully, the Sterling Professor Emeritus of art history at Yale University, who recently gave an architectural lecture at the White House that reportedly had the Clintons spellbound.
Mr. Scully continued: "Architects hate it. It's the people taking back the way they want to live and what they want their cities to be, instead of being at the mercy of architects, planners and politicians."
Among the people Mrs. Clinton will encounter is Stephen Miller in Pittsfield, Mass., whose art supply and wallpaper store is housed in the 1903 Colonial Theater, imbuing the neo-Baroque haunt of Douglas Fairbanks, Ethel and John Barrymore and Sarah Bernhardt with the scent of linseed oil and vinyl. This week the marquee reads, Miller Supply Co. Inc. Welcomes Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Mr. Miller's father, George, bought the place in 1952, dreaming that one day he would restore it as a theater, drawing on both the local community and the Berkshire-bound culture tourists. The Colonial Theater has been waiting in the wings, mothballed and hidden, ever since, its now abandoned rotund balconies resplendent with dusty, peeling putty.
Like the theater, Pittsfield has had its economic hardships. Robert Boland, the head of the Friends of the Colonial Theater, a private group, said that about $10 million was needed to restore the building. The state has committed $2.5 million, he said.
There is no Ralph Lauren in Pittsfield, and the unglamorous nitty-gritty work of preserving landmarks falls to people like Mr. Miller.
"We'd love to see it renovated; that has always been the intent," Mr. Miller said recently, leading a visitor up a hidden staircase to the theater, its silk and linen damask curtains still sweeping the balcony but no longer Nile green. "There's plenty of sweat maintaining a building like this. My hope is that Hillary Clinton's presence will serve as a catalyst to get this off the ground."

HEADLINE: SOCCER;
Reprise: France Salutes Its Champions Again in Daylight

BYLINE: By CRAIG WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 13

 BODY:
For the second time in 24 hours, hundreds of thousands of ecstatic and patriotic French soccer fans thronged the most famous avenue in Paris today, this time to thank their national team for bringing France its first World Cup soccer championship.
"On est champions, on est champions, on est, on est, on est champions," supporters with the tricolor painted on their faces chanted victoriously on the Champs-Elysees this afternoon as members of the national team, bearing the gold cup to thunderous cheering, slowly worked their way up the avenue toward the Arc de Triomphe on an open-air double-decker bus. 
 French flags waved in the fresh breeze under a day that made people happy to be alive. Some flew the tricolor alongside the flag of Algeria, a salute to Zinedine Zidane, the team's playmaker. Zidane, the son of Algerian parents, scored two of France's three goals in Sunday night's 3-0 victory over Brazil. Marseilles, where Zidane grew up, celebrated far into the night after the game.
"Merci Zizou!," his nickname, became a chant in itself on the Champs-Elysees this afternoon. People were hanging from sycamore trees, street lights, traffic signals, and jumping up and down on top of steel-and-plastic bus shelters.
And there in the middle of the packed milelong avenue stood Martel Chatelain, wearing a New York Yankees windbreaker. "I watched the game at home last night on television," he said. "The guys played so well I just had to come down this afternoon to tell them how grateful we were."
So grateful, in fact, that the country's politicians let this be the team's day, since Tuesday is the Bastille Day national holiday, when the Champs-Elysees will fill again with tanks and marching soldiers to mark the 209th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille.
Defense Minister Alain Richard paid tribute today to the 8,500 soldiers and gendarmes who had worked throughout the monthlong tournament to assure public safety, recalling that one of them, a policeman in Lens, still lay in a coma after being attacked by German hooligans there on June 21.
On Tuesday, President Jacques Chirac, the French team's honorary No. 23, plans to talk in a nationally televised interview about "the France that wins," his aides said. The President, a Gaullist conservative, has been trying to get his compatriots to cheer up and be happy for the past three unemployment-ridden years, and the national team's victory on Sunday finally did it just as the French prepared to set off on their annual five-week summer vacations.
The President also invited team members as guests of honor to the sprawling gardens of Elysee Palace, the French equivalent of the White House, for the Bastille Day garden party Tuesday afternoon.
A million and a half Parisians surged through the city Sunday night after the game ended shortly after 11 P.M., most of them on the Champs-Elysees.
There, after a moonlight night turned to clouds and rain shortly after 3 A.M., a black Volkswagen driven by a woman whom the police said was under psychiatric treatment plowed into the crowd and hurt 80 people, 11 of them seriously, according to hospital officials. None of the injured was in critical condition, they said today.
The driver, a 44-year-old teacher, fled the scene of the accident but surrendered to the police in Yvelines, the western Parisian suburb where she lives, this morning. The police said she was still in their custody this evening.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Says It Will Borrow From Members

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
With its financial strength depleted by the Asian crisis, the International Monetary Fund said today that it would have to borrow from its richest members to pay for the bailout of Russia.
The $11.2 billion in new loans being provided by the fund to Russia this year, plus the possibility of an additional $2.6 billion next year, would just about wipe out the money available from the fund's main financing pool, I.M.F. officials said. 
 As a result, said the managing director of the fund, Michel Camdessus, the loan package to Russia will largely tap a backup credit line from 11 of the largest industrial countries, including the United States. The American share is expected to be $2.1 billion.
The fund has not had to use the credit line -- described by a senior American official today as a "spare fuel tank" -- since 1978. With Japan in political and economic flux and other economies throughout Asia moving downward, analysts and American officials said the I.M.F. and the other multilateral lending institutions faced a real possibility of being caught short should another major crisis erupt.
"This puts them pretty close to the bottom of the barrel," said Morris Goldstein, a former I.M.F. official who is now with the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "If a big case comes in, or maybe a couple of medium-size cases, then you're stuck. Your alternative then is to go around hat in hand and try to put it together bilaterally."
Clinton Administration officials said the situation added urgency to their request that Congress provide new money for the I.M.F. The Senate has approved a White House request for $18 billion for the fund.
But the House has balked at providing the money without conditions that the White House has considered unacceptable, including limits on family planning.
Any Congressional approval would not have direct effects on the Russia bailout. But it could help the fund if it needed additional money to deal with a further spreading of the Asian crisis.
"With each of these developments, it becomes ever more important that Congress act quickly to approve I.M.F. funding," a senior American official said today.
A House Appropriations subcommittee is scheduled to take up the issue on Wednesday. But Republican aides said today that the party leadership has not decided whether to seek the full $18 billion or to limit the bill to one part of the financing, $3.5 billion that would go to an expanded version of the backup credit line.
That would leave open the question of the other $14.5 billion. That money would be the American contribution to an increase in the monetary fund's main financing pool, which is financed by quotas -- or membership dues -- levied on each of the 182 member countries.
Democrats in Congress said they would push the Republicans to act quickly to approve the new appropriation.
"We no longer have the luxury of simply waiting for something to happen," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said after meeting President Clinton at the White House today. "It's happened. We've got to act soon."
Fund officials said they plan to raise $8.4 billion for the Russia bailout from the credit line, known as the General Arrangements to Borrow. The United States, which provides 25 percent of the money under the credit line, expects the fund's request to be approved quickly by the big industrial countries, the senior American official said. American participation would not require Congressional approval.
Under the credit line, the United States and its major allies can provide the fund with up to $23 billion, which has to be repaid at market interest rates.
The quotas paid into the fund by its members total $195 billion. But of that the fund has $30 billion available. Half of that has to kept in reserve in case any member countries decide to withdraw part of their quotas, which they are free to do, much like a depositor at a bank.
The bottom line is that without tapping the backup credit line, the fund has no more than $15 billion available. By the end of the year, fund officials said, its available funds will have declined to worrisomely low levels, even including the backup credit line.
Some Republicans in Congress said the fund was exaggerating the crisis it faces. They said the fund has $30 billion in gold reserves, plus the ability to borrow on the financial markets.
But Administration officials said the fund badly needed the flexibility that would accompany the pending quota increase and the increased backup credit line. The increases were proposed by the fund after the financial crisis in Mexico in 1995. That crisis showed international lending institutions how quickly global financial markets could overwhelm entire economies.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Power to Lift India-Pakistan Sanctions

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration asked Congress today for more flexibility in its dealings with India and Pakistan, saying that current sanctions against the two countries for their nuclear weapons programs are too rigid and limit Washington's ability to halt a South Asian nuclear arms race.
The Administration is not calling for an immediate lifting of the sanctions, but only the power to lift them. That power, many officials believe, would enable them to induce India and Pakistan to stop testing or deploying nuclear weapons. 
 After the two countries tested nuclear weapons in May, the Administration was forced under a 1994 law to impose harsh sanctions against them. The law contains no provision that would allow the President to lift sanctions, either in whole or in part. Any changes in sanctions require a new law, passed by both the House and the Senate.
"Our purpose is not to punish for punishment's sake, but to influence the behavior of both Governments," Karl F. Inderfurth, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian affairs, said at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian affairs. "We do not wish for unnecessary harm to fall on the civilian populations of either country," he said, "or on U.S. businesses."
Last Thursday the Senate voted, 98-0, to exempt wheat and other agricultural exports from the sanctions because farm state legislators said the sales ban hurt only American farmers and would not prevent foreign farmers from profiting instead.
A provision attached to that law would have given President Clinton the authority, through March 1999, to waive the other sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan. But it was dropped after protests from Senator John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, who wrote the original 1994 bill.
Other sanctions include a cutoff of trade credits, private bank loans and American support for loans not based on relief needs from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Recently the United States voted for a World Bank loan to India meant for child education and health care.
Arms sales and military aid to Pakistan were cut off under separate legislation in 1990, when it was determined that Pakistan had nuclear weapons. "Right now there's no system to give the executive branch any flexibility," said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. "We'd like it to come in the form of Congressionally mandated authority for the executive branch to respond to, or to induce, changes of behavior on the part of India and Pakistan."
What is new, Mr. Rubin said, is the Administration's request for such authority now in order to induce policy changes in India and Pakistan, rather than simply gaining it in time to respond to changes.
Together with other countries, the United States is asking India and Pakistan to stop testing, sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty without conditions, stop producing any more fissile material, quit deploying nuclear weapons, and stop testing or deploying missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
"The intent is not to waive sanctions now," a White House official said. "But we'd like to have the authority to do so later once India and Pakistan have taken enough steps to warrant a waiver."
Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee and just returned from a trip to the region, said the sanctions were imposing significant economic harm on both countries in the midst of the Asian economic crisis.
"The economic situation there was not very good before we imposed sanctions, particularly in Pakistan," he said, "and now it is even worse."
Senator Brownback has sponsored another bill that may come up later this week. It would waive all the current sanctions for nine months, and follow that with a graduated waiver based on a Presidential certification that India and Pakistan were making progress in reducing nuclear tensions.

HEADLINE: Rowland Opens Re-election Effort With a Pledge to Cities

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: NORWICH, Conn., July 13

 BODY:
Formally starting a re-election campaign that has been under way for a year, Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut declared today that his top priority in a second term would be helping to rebuild the decaying cores of the state's largest cities.
That choice as a campaign centerpiece is part of a continuing effort by Mr. Rowland, a Republican, to chart a course that he calls "fiscally conservative and socially inclusive." It also reflects the evolution of the ever-more-moderate Mr. Rowland, 41, who went to Congress in 1985 as a brash right-winger and won the gubernatorial race in 1994, a year of big Republican gains. 
 On Nov. 3, Mr. Rowland will face a former colleague on Capitol Hill, Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, 62, a Democrat who has championed women's and children's issues during her 16 years in Washington. Mr. Rowland has built a wide lead in polls and has set a state record for a governor's race by raising $4.3 million, or more than twice as much as Mrs. Kennelly.
Basking in the state's rebounding economy and showing a deep tan after nine days at the beach, Mr. Rowland cut a confident and casual figure as he led a caravan across the state for four rallies featuring Boy Scouts, Dixieland bands and all the other patriotic trimmings.
"We've looked the bad times in the eye and we've turned things around," Mr. Rowland said, sporting a gold elephant in his lapel. "More jobs, higher wages, health care for children, better schools, safer streets." Pausing for applause, he said, "I promise you that we are just getting started."
Mr. Rowland began running television ads nine months ago, so today's rallies were hardly a surprise. But his campaign tried to pump up supporters by sending star-spangled postcards urging: "Don't miss out. It's the tour that makes it official."
He began the day under a white tent on a wharf in this mill town in eastern Connecticut, drove 100 miles west to the office towers in the New York suburb of Stamford, then doubled back to West Hartford and finished the night at an amusement park near his hometown of Waterbury, where he once worked in his family's insurance business.
In his speeches, Mr. Rowland said that he would continue to try to cut taxes, and he hailed the state's efforts to move welfare recipients into jobs as "tough love."
But he said he was making the cities his top priority because the state as a whole is in such good economic shape. "All of our cities are on the way back to an economic renaissance that we've never seen before, because of our hard work," he said. "But we can do so much more."
After his address in Stamford, Mr. Rowland said he wanted to follow through on economic development plans that had been announced for the downtown areas of Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport and Waterbury.
Mr. Rowland said that he wanted to promote similar projects in other cities and urban towns, but would like them to rely on local and private money rather than on state financing.
"It's going to be a combination of universities, colleges, private investment, Federal dollars in some cases, city dollars in some cases, waterfront development," he said. "So I want to kind of stick around for a few more years to see that come to fruition."
Responding later to Mr. Rowland's plans, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, Edward L. Marcus, pointed to Mr. Rowland's long-abandoned promise of the last campaign, to repeal the state income tax, and asserted that today's pledges were no different.
"He takes positions as they become convenient," Mr. Marcus said. "He ignored the cities and education and the environment for three years. Now in an election year, he's for all of the above."
Mr. Rowland brushed off questions about whether he would commit to serve out a second term before seeking a higher office, or whether he might seek a third term. (Connecticut has no term limits for governors.)
In his speeches, Mr. Rowland made only the vaguest reference to Mrs. Kennelly or the Democratic Party. But he said he would stand by his challenge to debate Mrs. Kennelly six to eight times before Election Day.
A spokeswoman for Mrs. Kennelly said that the Congresswoman wanted to participate in debates, but said it was too soon to discuss how many.
This afternoon, Mrs. Kennelly held a news conference outside a recycling plant in New Haven to accuse Mr. Rowland of "putting polluters before people," a charge that she planned to make repeatedly through the fall.
Mrs. Kennelly had expressed frustration and even defeatism at several recent appearances, but aides said today that she was upbeat.
"The state of Connecticut will be better for this race, and I intend to win this race," Mrs. Kennelly said. "I'm going to work so hard, you won't believe it."

HEADLINE: The Face-Off at G.M.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., July 13

 BODY:
It began 39 days ago as a simple strike at a single General Motors factory over how modern-day workers should build fenders and hoods. But like two neighborhood toughs daring each other with escalating taunts, G.M. and the United Automobile Workers union have fallen into a dispute so big, complicated and destructive that a solution now seems more elusive than ever.
The strike has forced G.M. to lay off 165,000 workers across North America and close 26 of 29 assembly plants. Any hope of resolving it soon was dealt a big setback this weekend when both sides threw up their hands in frustration. 
 It has also laid bare some emotional issues for the auto workers about job security and a steely resolve by the world's largest auto maker to fracture, once and for all, the union's insistence on a relationship that G.M. says threatens its competitiveness. Both sides have invested too much in the strike to accept defeat.
"Looking at it in actual dollar terms, it's hard to justify, but our long-term viability is on the line," Donald Hackworth, G.M.'s group vice president for North American car operations, said tonight in a recorded strike-update telephone message in which he also suggested a settlement would not come soon.
Mr. Hackworth said that G.M. had to improve productivity to maintain its market share. "We continue to lag behind our competitors -- as they continue to get better, our volumes continue to shrink," he warned.
Each side has repeatedly tried to force the other to back down by escalating the struggle, introducing new issues in the process that were not even part of the original dispute. G.M. and the union have been willing to escalate because of a combustible combination of huge cash reserves, which have given them the confidence that they can stand a fairly long strike, and a desire by G.M. executives to stand fast.
The U.A.W. has a strike fund of $725 million and is only spending about $3 million a week for strike benefits and health insurance for the 9,200 striking workers and a few laid-off workers who appear ineligible for unemployment compensation.
G.M. had $13.6 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, and Wall Street analysts estimate the company has probably not spent more than half of it so far.
G.M. has been fighting for years to reduce its costs. But its struggle has grown more intense because of steady cost reductions at Ford Motor and Chrysler .
Record profits at cross-town Detroit rivals, combined with Chrysler's pending merger with Daimler-Benz of Germany, have put pressure on G.M. to eliminate a succession of factory-level agreements concluded over the years that have allowed some employees to collect a full day's pay for a few hours work and have left G.M. with the highest labor costs in the industry.
G.M.'s biggest productivity problem rests with its parts plants, which have the least-flexible work rules. The plants were starved of investment in the 1980's, when G.M. was pouring billions of dollars into assembly-plant robots, and have antiquated machinery as a result.
Harbour & Associates, a manufacturing consulting firm in Troy, Mich., has calculated that G.M.'s average labor cost for the auto parts in each vehicle is $2,765, compared with $2,322 for Ford and $2,167 for Chrysler. Ford and Chrysler buy a slightly higher proportion of their parts from outside suppliers that pay lower wages and also require fewer workers because they have invested in more modern equipment.
Because a strike at a crucial parts factory can shut down the company, G.M. has until now been leery of taking on the U.A.W. But under steady pressure from Wall Street, G.M. has become more willing to challenge the union.
Mr. Hackworth said G.M. was still pursuing a legal complaint accusing the U.A.W. of using the strikes at the two factories here to wage, in effect, a national strike in violation of a national labor contract that runs through next year. The union has denied this, but if G.M. wins an arbitration ruling, it could not only seek damages from the union but could also stop it from pursuing similar strikes. Legal experts give G.M. little chance of success.
The diminished hope for an end to the strike was reflected today in G.M.'s share price, which fell $2.3125, or 3.2 percent, to $68.875, after remaining fairly steady last week when optimism about a settlement had been growing.
Each side's sheer losses are now making it harder to compromise. The strike has cost U.A.W. workers about $300 million in lost pay, though many workers are eligible for unemployment benefits equal to about a quarter of their usual compensation.
G.M.'s losses have been heavier: 227,000 cars and light trucks not produced, with further production losses now rising at a rate of 21,000 a day, and an after-tax loss of $1.18 billion in after-tax losses, also rising now at a rate of $75 million a day.
G.M. and the workers will recover half or more of their losses through extra production and overtime pay after the strike. But G.M. dealers are complaining that they are running out of popular models and may permanently lose customers who try other auto makers' cars and light trucks and never come back.
Soon after the strike started, both sides began alternating serious negotiations with moves to escalate the dispute.
G.M. and the U.A.W. made a strenuous effort to find a solution after just six days of the strike at an auto body parts factory in Flint that makes hoods, fenders and engine mounts. G.M. even made the important concession on June 11 of promising to return parts-making equipment removed from the factory before the strike. But when those talks broke down, the U.A.W. ordered a walkout at a nearby spark plug and speedometer factory that is losing jobs to Mexico and East Asia, where wages are lower.
The second walkout raised the difficult question of G.M.'s steady push to build factories overseas while slowing investment in its low-profit American operations.
Unlike the auto body parts factory, the spark plug and speedometer factory is part of G.M.'s inefficient Delphi Automotive Systems subsidiary, which makes mostly small, low-technology auto parts. G.M. wants to sell part or all of Delphi, and the U.A.W. does not want it sold; so the second walkout dragged in this long-festering issue.
A few days after the second walkout, G.M. began threatening to close assembly plants and terminate the production of some slow-selling car models if the U.A.W. did not compromise. The threats angered the U.A.W., and raised the contentious question of how many workers G.M. would employ in the long term.
In response, the U.A.W. threatened further walkouts later this year at other parts factories here and in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio. G.M. responded last week by insisting that long-simmering disputes at those factories be resolved before any agreement is reached here.
The entire morass has left bargainers saying that while G.M. and the U.A.W. have labored through more than a dozen local strikes the last five years, none of those disputes have approached the complexity of the current mess. "It's complex enough that we've been out here a lot longer than we should have," Richard Shoemaker, the U.A.W.'s vice president for G.M. issues, said at a news conference this afternoon.
Yet both sides say the broader questions are unlikely to be settled by any deal here. Gerald Knechtel, G.M.'s vice president for North American personnel, said on Sunday that the main issue remained the union's insistence that G.M. invest more in the auto body parts factory here despite its low productivity.

HEADLINE: Lobbyist Is Indicted Over Campaign Donations

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
A Federal grand jury today indicted a Thai businesswoman who worked as a Washington lobbyist on charges that she and her family funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign money to the Democratic Party to gain access for her clients to President Clinton and members of the Administration.
In a 24-count indictment, a grand jury here said the businesswoman, Pauline Kanchanalak, and her family made unlawful donations of at least $679,000 to the Democratic National Committee and other state and local political committees from 1992 to 1996. The contributions were typically reimbursed from money sent through companies incorporated in the Cayman Islands and in Hong Kong. The contributions enabled Ms. Kanchanalak to attend a White House coffee and a birthday celebration for President Clinton, a fund-raiser with Vice President Al Gore, and events with other Democratic lawmakers. 
 The indictment was the third criminal case filed by the Justice Department's Campaign Financing Task Force in two weeks. Earlier this month, Howard Glicken, a Miami business executive, was charged with soliciting a political contribution from a foreign national and causing it to be made in someone else's name. On July 7, a grand jury indicted Maria Hsia, a California Democratic fund-raiser, on four tax counts. Ms. Hsia has also been charged with disguising illegal campaign contributions to President Clinton's re-election campaign.
With today's indictment, prosecutors in the special task force have now charged most of the main contributors who gave money to the Democratic National Committee through John Huang, the former senior Democratic finance official who has long been a central focus of the inquiry.
Erik L. Kitchen, one of Ms. Kanchanalak's Washington lawyers, issued a brief statement today saying that she "will ultimately be vindicated in this matter."
"Ms. Kanchanalak has been caught up in a political controversy relating to D.N.C. fund-raising practices," the statement said. "The filing of a 24-count indictment against her continues a pattern of the Government inflating alleged Federal Election Commission violations into massive felony charges."
The indictment said little about Ms. Kanchanalak's clients. One, Dhanin Chearvanont, is one of the richest men in Asia, controlling a business conglomerate, the Charoen Pokaphand Group, that involves more than 250 companies that sell products as diverse as chickens, shrimp, petrochemicals, motorcycles and telecommunications. The company is also the largest foreign investor in China.
Ms. Kanchanalak helped arrange for Mr. Dhanin to meet with President Clinton, Mr. Huang and Donald Fowler, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, at a White House coffee on June 18, 1996. According to the indictment, Mr. Dhanin discussed "primarily economic and political issues relating to the relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China."
Around the same time, Ms. Kanchanalak gave the Democratic National Committee $135,000, and her sister-in-law, Duagnet G. Kronenberg, who listed the same home address in Virginia as Ms. Kanchanalak, contributed $50,000.
In addition to the charges against Ms. Kanchanalak, 47, today's indictment also accused Ms. Kronenberg, 41, of conspiracy and other violations. Ms. Kanchanalak's husband, Chupong, and her mother-in-law, Praitun Kanchanalak, were not indicted but were identified as co-conspirators.
As she fell under investigation in late 1996, Ms. Kanchanalak fled to Thailand, where Justice Department officials believe she remains. A Federal magistrate-judge today issued a bench warrant for her arrest.
The indictment describes numerous efforts by Ms. Kanchanalak to cover her tracks. Shortly after articles began to appear in late 1996 about her, she took steps to destroy and hide possible evidence, according to the indictment. She hired a computer expert to erase the hard drives of her office and home computers. She also removed boxes of records from her office, some of which she shipped to Thailand.

HEADLINE: TURNOVER IN JAPAN: THE OVERVIEW;
JOCKEYING BEGINS FOR POST IN JAPAN

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 13

 BODY:
Politicians began jockeying today for the chance to play chief surgeon to the world's second-largest economy after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned, saying he was responsible for his party's disastrous finish in parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Mr. Hashimoto's resignation left a political vacuum at the economic heart of Asia, sending stocks and currencies reeling across the continent today and touching off fears that another chapter could be beginning in the Asian financial crisis. At midday on Tuesday, the yen was up slightly against the dollar and stock prices were mixed. 
 The sudden and unexpected nature of the political upheaval here was underscored when Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko of Russia arrived in Tokyo this morning for a visit with Mr. Hashimoto. It was the first such visit ever by a Russian Prime Minister, and it seemed sensible enough when Mr. Kiriyenko left Moscow, but by the time he stepped off the plane in Tokyo, Mr. Hashimoto was history.
Mr. Hashimoto formally resigned shortly afterward and also had to cancel plans for a state visit to the United States later this month.
A new Prime Minister is expected to be chosen in the next week and installed on about July 30, after intensive horse-trading in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
But the election has left some wondering whether Japan is on a transition toward a two-party system that will change the character not just of the party but also of the nation. That is subject to debate, but there seems little doubt that the election has already left the party with a reduced ability to govern and with a handful of prime ministerial candidates who represent precisely the old school of politics that the voters decisively rejected on Sunday.
"Hashimoto is one of the best that the L.D.P. can produce," said Takashi Inoguchi, a political scientist at Tokyo University. "Unless someone terribly fresh and surprising comes along, it's hard to see how the next Prime Minister can handle the issues head on and fast.
"To handle the problems efficiently, you need a fresh, strong and decisive leader, but they are very hard to find. So we'll have to muddle through with less than competent political leadership."
The selection of a new prime minister for Japan is of intense interest around Asia, for Japan is seen as the key to overcoming the region's crisis. Its economy is eight times as big as China's and twice as big as all the rest of Asia's put together, and it has contributed far more to bail-out packages than the United States or any other country.
Handicapping the race is a bit difficult, however, for the last thing candidates do is express interest in the job. Instead, if one is asked if one is interested, it is deemed polite to assume a pained expression and rush away without answering -- which is precisely what the front-runner, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, did today when reporters raised the issue outside his home.
While in the United States the metaphor for becoming a candidate is to toss one's hat into the ring, in Japanese it is to be an omikoshi, a portable shrine. Just as throngs of revelers together carry an omikoshi on their shoulders in exuberant street festivals, so the candidate is supposed to be carried by supporters into the fray.
In reality, of course, the candidates are a bit different from other omikoshi: they desperately scramble for shoulders to carry them, and in some cases they even pay party officials huge sums for support.
Mr. Obuchi, 61, is the leading candidate largely because he heads the largest faction in the party and is respected for his affability. But critics say that while he may not have enemies, he also has no policies or initiatives, and it would be difficult to find someone less charismatic.
Another contender is Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, a much more outspoken and controversial party elder. He has some support, because he has consistently urged a more aggressive posture in tackling Japan's economic problems, but he has also made missteps over the years.
A possible compromise is Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, a former Prime Minister who is respected for his command of financial affairs.
Mr. Hashimoto, in announcing his resignation, declined to endorse a successor. His face grim and his eyes moist, he urged his successors to continue his policies of rectifying Japan's finances and restructuring government.
"I have proposed a number of reforms that are painful to people," Mr. Hashimoto said, apparently referring to such measures as his increase of the national sales tax. "I realize that there are various objections to this. But I did my best on these matters."
Asked what the biggest reason was for his defeat, Mr. Hashimoto scarcely paused.
"It was totally my fault," he said. "I lacked ability."
Mr. Hashimoto will remain a caretaker Prime Minister until his successor is chosen.
One of the new leader's central tasks will be to shore up not only the country but also his party. The elections Sunday for the upper house of Parliament were a major blow to the party, as it won only 44 seats out of the 126 contested.
Perhaps most worrying for the Liberal Democrats were the hints that Japan might be moving toward a Western-style system in which two political parties alternately hold power. For decades Japan has been a multiparty democracy in form, but the reality has been something closer to a one-party state.
"It is surely changing," Takao Toshikawa, publisher of a political newsletter in Tokyo. "We're moving toward a two-party party system."
Commentators have been saying that for a number of years, and it never came true in the past, even in similar circumstances. In the 1989 elections for the upper house, for instance, the Liberal Democrats suffered an even worse defeat, which was widely seen as a sign of fundamental change. Then tides quickly shifted again.
Yet the latest result also indicated that a two-party system may be emerging. The main opposition group, the Democratic Party, consolidated its status by winning big in the election, gaining respectability and legitimacy.
Moreover, in the proportional representation part of the ballot, the Democrats won 22 percent of the vote, just behind the Liberal Democrats, who got 25 percent. The balance was divided among a profusion of small opposition parties, and if some of them join forces with the Democrats -- as the Democrats hope -- then the opposition would be theoretically able to outvote the Liberal Democrats.
The Democratic Party is poorly organized. Its greatest asset is Naoto Kan, a dynamic former Cabinet minister who is by far the most popular politician in the country. The Liberal Democrats are fretting that they have no one with close to the appeal of Mr. Kan.
Another key factor is that disaffected citizens once simply did not bother to vote. But this time, exit polls indicate, the disaffected turned up at the polls -- and voted against the Liberal Democrats. Voter turnout surged from 44 percent in the last election for the upper house to 59 percent this time.
"This time is extremely different from past elections, both upper house and lower house elections," Mr. Toshikawa said. "This time, people were motivated to vote because of the economic circumstances."
More broadly, the election suggests that the Liberal Democrats are relying on a dwindling power base. They won their seats primarily in the rural areas that are losing population and influence, and they were demolished in the urban areas, failing to win a single district in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe or Nagoya. In urban areas, even the Communists did better than the Liberal Democrats.
Kazuyuki Hamada, a political commentator in Tokyo, said that the challenge will be for the Democratic Party to unite the fragmented opposition, but that if this happens, the impact on Japan will be historic.
"They have to put aside their differences and work together," Mr. Hamada said of the opposition parties. "It's a life-or-death moment for Japan. If they fail, in the 21st century Japan will drift along and we will have no hope."
Japanese and Western analysts, even those in the Liberal Democratic Party, often emphasize the importance of a nurturing a two-party system as the best way to create a responsive political structure to lead the nation. For now, Japan in some respects resembles a one-party state, with a familiar pattern of political corruption and stagnation.
Moreover, many say that it would be difficult to restructure the Liberal Democratic Party and make it more forward-looking unless it is evicted and kept from power for some time. Just as the best thing that happened to the British Labor Party was the introspection and change during its years in the political wilderness, the thinking goes, the only way to refocus the Liberal Democratic Party may be to exile it from power.

HEADLINE: Russia and Lenders Seal Accord On $17 Billion in New Support

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 13

 BODY:
The Russian Government and international lenders concluded an agreement today aimed at easing Russia's financial crisis and restoring confidence in its economy.
The agreement would provide $17.1 billion in additional loans over the next two years. About $12.6 billion would be delivered this year and another $4.5 billion would be available in 1999. Combined with existing international assistance, the new pact would bring total lending to Russia to $22.6 billion over this year and next. 
 Most of the new money is to be lent by the International Monetary Fund, which came under pressure from the Clinton Administration to increase the amount of money it was willing to lend to Russia and to quickly wrap up negotiations that had dragged on for weeks.
To finance the Russian bailout, the United States agreed to lend the fund $2.1 billion. Other countries making loans include Japan, Germany, France and Saudi Arabia.
Anatoly B. Chubais, the lead Russian negotiator, described the round-the-clock talks as the most difficult ever held between the Yeltsin Government and the I.M.F. "The decisions taken today signify a restoration of faith in Russia's ability to overcome its difficulties," Mr. Chubais said.
In fact, the process -- and the endless drama here -- is far from over. Russia still has to take a number of important steps before any of the money will be distributed. On Wednesday and Thursday the Russian Government will attempt a crucial hurdle when the lower house of Parliament is expected to vote in extraordinary session on the Kremlin's plan for ending the financial crisis.
The plan calls for lower tax rates and laws to stimulate investment as well as a new law on budgeting procedures, all considered vital by the I.M.F.
John Odling-Smee, the chief negotiator for the fund, said the fund would decide on July 20 whether to start distributing its new loan to Russia and the actions of the Parliament would heavily influence the I.M.F.'s decision.
The Parliament has already balked at measures to reform the personal income tax and to change procedures for determining value added taxes. If the legislature also rejects additional proposals, Mr. Yeltsin can impose some of his measures by decree. But that could plunge the nation into a legal and political quagmire.
Still, today's announcement provided badly needed fuel for Russia's financial markets, which have been waiting for the I.M.F. to throw its support behind the Russians. Russia's stock market rose 10 percent today.
Mr. Odling-Smee described the agreement as "a major strengthening of Russia's economic program" that will enable the Yeltsin Government to avoid devaluing the ruble.
To a large extent, Russia suffered from Western investors' general unease over emerging markets following the economic turmoil in Asia. But Russia has also been vulnerable to a global currency crisis because it depends on foreign investors to finance so much of its deficit.
Initially, the I.M.F. said new loans were not needed. It wanted to husband its limited resources and insisted that the Kremlin could weather the financial storm by taking its own corrective measures.
But as interest rates on Russian Treasury bills soared, recently reaching 120 percent, and Russia's bond markets weakened, investors began to worry about the ruble and whether the Government would be able to avoid a devaluation of the currency as a means to lower interest rates.
With Central Bank reserves of dollars and other foreign currencies at about $15 billion, and foreign investors owning about $20 billion in treasury bills, there was a widespread concern among investors that a investor panic might drain Russia's slender cash reserves. Of the $15 billion, $5 billion of that is in gold, which cannot readily be spent.
The worry was that a foreign panic might set off a stampede in the treasury bill market in which investors would convert their ruble proceeds into dollars. Without adequate reserves the Central Bank would be unable support the value of the ruble by purchasing it in the currency markets, and a devaluation might soon follow.
The concern was that a devaluation of the ruble would not only lead to a round of inflation but might also shake the nation's political establishment. Mr. Yeltsin has even gone so far as suggest that "extremists" might attempt to launch a coup.
As Russia's financial markets shuddered in May and June, the I.M.F. began to consider additional financing. I.M.F. officials initially proposed only $5.6 billion in new loans. But after President Clinton returned from his trip to China, the United States began to focus on Russia's economy with new intensity.
The Clinton Administration considers Sergei Kiriyenko, the new Russian Prime Minister, and his team of aides to be the most reform-minded Government Russia has had in years.
American officials argued that assistance had to be large enough to impress the world's financial markets and give Mr. Kiriyenko the breathing space he needed to try to turn the country's economy around.
The American pressure bore fruit last weekend when the I.M.F. doubled its financial package and sought to wrap up the negotiations.
To come up with the additional funds, the fund was forced to use the General Arrangements to Borrow, a little-used loan fund established in 1962 to stabilize the world monetary system.
Still, even with the lure of additional funds, the monetary fund and Russia had to work hard to overcome their differences.
A major issue in the talks, for example, was been the pace at which Russia should cut its budget deficit. The two sides now agree that the deficit should be reduced to 2.8 percent of Russia's domestic production in 1999 from more than 5 percent currently, a huge step that will require raising billions of dollars in new revenue.
To reassure investors, Mr. Chubais emphasized that Russia will receive $22.6 billion in loans during the last half of 1998 and in 1999. That figure, however, combined old loans that were worked out before the financial crisis and the new rescue package.
The actual amount of new financing is somewhat less, though still substantial.
Russia will receive $12.6 in additional financing during the rest of 1998. Those loans include $11.2 billion from the I.M.F., $800 million from the World Bank and $600 million lent from Japan.
Some $2.2 billion in previously agreed I.M.F. and World Bank loans is also to be disbursed, bringing the total for this year to $14.8 billion.
Next year, Russia will receive $7.8 billion in new aid, including $4.5 billion in new loans and $3.3 billion in previously agreed financing.
There may be even more loans in the future, as the fund indicated that it is willing to negotiate a further three year loan if the Government stays on the reform track. That would provide an additional $2.6 billion a year in new financing.
Besides the loan package, Russia said it would stop issuing short-term treasury bills, which have been sold at high interest rates in auctions that have occurred every week or 10 days. Instead, it will now offer investors an opportunity to convert their ruble denominated treasury bills into longer-term dollar denominated bonds.
Russia has been negotiating to receive $10 billion from western commercial banks. But today, Mr. Chubais suggested that the commercial loans would not be needed. "We are not seeking to increase debts, but on the contrary to diminish debts."
Not everyone applauded the new financial package.
Gazprom, the huge natural gas monopoly, complained about provisions that would require it to make its transport pipeline system available to other gas producers. The World Bank insisted that the pipeline be opened to limit Gazprom's dominance and introduce more competition.
Though the Russian Government was breathing a sigh of relief, the toughest part lies ahead. The Yeltsin Government has to win parliamentary approval of its package to end the crisis. Then it has to try to stay the course.
One Yeltsin aide said he had no time to celebrate today's agreement. "It is going to be a difficult week," he said.

Chrysler Profits Double, Topping Analysts' Forecast
Chrysler reported second-quarter earnings of $1.51 a share, surpassing Wall Street's projections by about 10 cents a share.
The auto maker, whose profits were more than double those of the strike-ridden second quarter of last year, attributed the sound performance to strong sales, cost- cutting and the growing popularity of high-margin products like the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle. Page D2. 

Turmoil in Japan Causes New Fears
The resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan left a political vacuum at the economic heart of Asia, sending stocks and currencies reeling across the continent and touching off fears that another chapter could be beginning in the Asian financial crisis. A1.
 
Russian Loans Package Approved
The Russian Government and international lenders concluded an agreement to ease Russia's financial crisis. The deal provides $17.1 billion in additional loans in the next two years, with most of the money provided by the International Monetary Fund. A1.
 
The I.M.F. said it would have to borrow from its richest members to pay for the bailout of Russia. The American share is expected to be $2.1 billion. A9.
 
Intel Responds to Antitrust Suit
Intel said it acted lawfully in withholding some technology from three computer companies and in seeking to retrieve other technology from them. It was Intel's first formal response to a Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit against the top computer-chip maker. D19.
 
Nasdaq Sets a Record; Dow Falls
A brighter earnings outlook for several leading technology companies propelled the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index to its fourth consecutive high. Other stock gauges were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.53 points, to 9,096.21. D8.
 
Higher Earnings at Two Big Banks
Nationsbank's quarterly earnings rose 53 percent on stronger loan growth and improved investment banking and brokerage revenue. First Chicago NBD earnings rose 8 percent on higher income from bank fees that offset declines in loan income. The results at both banks exceeded expectations. D2.
 
Tenneco Was Near Deal for ITT Unit
Tenneco halted talks to buy the European brakes division of ITT Industries, but two other bidders, the German tire maker Continental A.G. and Ford Motor's Visteon Automotive Systems, are said to be interested in the concern. D6.

Earnings Rise 39% at Paine Webber
Paine Webber Group said second-quarter earnings jumped 39 percent, to $129.5 million, or 82 cents a diluted share, from $93 million, or 58 cents, beating Wall Street forecasts of 78 cents. Sales rose to $1.2 billion from $976 million. The record earnings and revenues were attributed to strong asset management and investment banking fees. D6.
 
Milan Jury Convicts Media Tycoon
Silvio Berlusconi, the flamboyant media tycoon and former Prime Minister of Italy, was convicted by a Milan jury of making illegal political donations and was given a sentence of two years and four months as well as a $5.6 million fine. Mr. Berlusconi, 61, was convicted last week of bribing tax inspectors and sentenced to a term of two years and nine months. He was also convicted of accounting fraud in a trial in December. A4.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Wondering How the World Will End? Some Mordant Thoughts from Physics

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
IN contrast with the malevolent scientists of horror movies, most physicists are well-adjusted, friendly, attractive people whose conspicuous brain power is generally mixed with the milk of human kindness.
It might therefore seem a little uncharacteristic that some physicists are eagerly hoping to see some tiny blue flashes streak through a cathedral-size water tank buried under a mountain: a signal that an inexorable process of annihilation is gnawing away at the universe. The universal rot, if it is real, will take untold eons to complete, but it will be thorough, leaving no stars, no people, no monuments, no cinders, no sonnets, no atoms, no memories. 
 Except for a faint and ever fading glow, the corpse of our universe would cease to exist.
And yet, a harbinger of this dismal future would be welcomed by many theorists.
For much of the 20th century, physicists have tried to construct a theory that would mathematically bring three of the four known forces of nature -- the electromagnetic force and the weak and strong nuclear forces -- into consonance. (A theoretical assimilation of the fourth force, gravity, poses many more formidable problems for theorists.)
There are various candidates for the title Grand Unified Theory, but none has been validated by experiment or observation, and all of them seem to embody a disquieting requirement: the eventual death of every proton in the universe.
So far, in nearly two decades of searching, no experiment has produced convincing evidence of the decay of even one proton, much less an appreciable fraction of the 10 to the 79th power protons the universe is estimated to contain. (That number is mathematical notation for the numeral one followed by 79 zeros.)
This hasn't stopped scientists from continuing the search; in fact, there are hopes that the mighty Super-Kamiokande detector under a mountain near Kamioka, Japan, which contains 50,000 tons of water, will soon see the telltale flash signaling the death of a proton. This minuscule event, the theorists predict, would yield some decay products. In one possible decay route, the products would be an antielectron and a pi meson, which would almost instantly decay into two gamma-ray photons. In another proton decay mode, the debris would include a K meson with a specific energy associated with proton decay, and a virtually undetectable neutrino.
The demise of a proton (or better, of several protons) would make it easier for theorists to build a Grand Unified Theory that would actually work. Frustrated scientists therefore feel a certain urgency in the quest for deceased protons. During a physics conference in Japan last month, Dr. Frank Wilczek of the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J., told an audience that "if we don't see proton decay pretty soon, we'll be in serious trouble."
Of course, if scientists do detect a proton decay, the whole universe, not just theorists, will be in serious trouble. The death of just one proton would herald the eventual end of everything; if one proton can decay, all protons will decay, and without protons there can be no atoms, molecules, DNA, mountains, roses or concertos.
Fortunately, even if a protonic funeral should occur in the coming months, the demise of the universe would not be imminent. In exquisitely sensitive experiments in Japan and elsewhere, physicists have determined that if protons decay at all, it must take them more than 2.5 times 10 to the 32d power years to die, on average. That's about 10 quintillion times the present age of the universe, which is believed to be about 14 billion years. (Although the average lifespan of a proton must be phenomenally long, a handful of them could be expected to have short lifetimes, some ending now rather than in the remote future. This is why the current search for proton decay is practical.)
Of course, inhabitants of the surface of our terrestrial ball of iron and stone have many more immediate worries than proton decay, astrophysicists tell us. The devastating impact of a large comet or asteroid, for example, has furnished profitable grist for movie makers, and there are lots of other celestial catastrophes the entertainment industry has yet to mine.
The nearby explosion of a supernova is one. There is no telling when or where a supernova will explode, but a few known candidates are uncomfortably close. The red supergiant star Betelgeuse, a mere 430 light years from the Earth, might be about ready to pop. Betelgeuse, a bright star at the shoulder of the constellation Orion, is close enough to us that its explosion could conceivably shower the Earth with potentially harmful radiation and disrupt the protective ozone layer.
Another nasty possibility came to light during the past year -- roasting by a nearby gamma-ray burster.
Since the advent of orbiting gamma ray telescopes in recent years, astrophysicists have been puzzled by gamma ray bursters -- spots in the sky that emit intense gamma-ray radiation for a few seconds or hours and then fade away without a trace, never to recur.
But observations by a new gamma-ray satellite named BeppoSAX, built by Italy and the Netherlands, are so fast and so accurate that they can be used by optical, infrared and X-ray observatories to hunt for faint objects created by or left over from the fleeting gamma-ray bursts.
Such objects have been found, and their distances from the Earth measured. This led to a sensational surprise last year: some gamma ray bursters appear to be vastly farther away than had been believed. To produce gamma rays of the intensity recorded from the vicinity of the Earth, these mysterious objects must be almost inconceivably powerful. One of them seems to have produced more energy in a few seconds than an entire galaxy generates during a year.
Theorists surmise that such "hypernovas" may result from the violent merger of pairs of black holes or black holes with neutron stars. But no one knows how these great bombs are distributed throughout the universe; if one happened to go off relatively near the Earth, there could be dire consequences.
Among the outlandish doomsday scenarios dreamed up by some scientists is the possibility that the energy density of "empty" space in our part of the universe represents a "false vacuum"-- an emptiness pervaded by a certain amount of hidden energy. The menace is that there might be another vacuum with a lower energy level into which our part of the universe might tumble, losing all its protons and thereby obliterating our neck of the universal woods, ourselves included.
It has been suggested by some non-physicists, led by Paul Dixon, a psychologist at the University of Hawaii, that the powerful Tevatron particle accelerator at Fermilab in Illinois (which collides particles together at a combined energy of two trillion electronvolts) might pack so much punch it could start a tear in our friendly space-time along with its false vacuum. Such a catastrophe, it is surmised, would propagate at the speed of light, plunging Batavia, Ill., the site of Fermilab, and the rest of the universe into non-existence.
Physicists scoff at this notion, saying that the Earth is continuously peppered by cosmic rays that have energies up to 10 to the 19th power electronvolts -- about 10 million times more energy than the most potent accelerator collisions -- and yet our universe survives.
Nevertheless, Fermilab is pestered often enough by doom-saying demonstrators that the editors of the laboratory's news letter devoted two pages last month to debunking the torn space-time threat.
This seems to be the season for contemplating decay and doom, not only in movies but in such serious publications as Sky & Telescope magazine. The August issue features an article entitled "Future of the Universe," which paints a somber process of universal aging and decay, with the last stars winking out about 100 trillion years from now, and even the most massive black holes evaporating in around 10 to the hundredth power years.
But although the long-term prognosis for our "region" of the universe is grim, physics offers some possibilities that could save us from the awful all-becoming nothing, to borrow a phrase from Asian philosophy.
Dr. Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose revolutionary conjectures have strongly influenced cosmological thinking during the last two decades, envisions an eternal process, in which our stable region of the universe must run down to cold, dark death, but other unstable regions of the universe might undergo the same instantaneous process of "inflation" that our own region supposedly once underwent long ago. Inflation, in the cosmological sense, means not only instantaneous expansion of space-time, but the spontaneous creation of energy to fill the new space-time, providing the raw stuff of a new universe.
A new generation of observatories and experiments now on the drawing board may provide some answers to human's most deep-seated questions about the texture and fate of universal existence. In any case, the quest will continue.
The authors of the Sky & Telescope article, Dr. Fred Adams of the University of Michigan and Dr. Gregory Laughlin of the University of California at Berkeley, put it this way:
"Whether life can exist indefinitely, or whether the universe is structured to guarantee the final annihilation of all consciousness, purpose and meaning -- including any record that such things ever existed -- holds an inordinate fascination."

HEADLINE: Taking His Own Path, He Follows His Father

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, July 8

 BODY:
When Birch Evans Bayh Jr., the notable Democratic United States Senator of the 1960's and 70's, first learned that his son wanted to run for public office, the elder Bayh was wary.
"I guess my first thought was, was that something he really wanted to do or is that something he wanted to do just because his father wanted to do it?," Mr. Bayh recalled recently. 
 And during the son's first campaign -- for Indiana Secretary of State in 1986 -- the father said he wanted his son to make his own way. "If he said, 'Dad can you call so-and-so?' I would say, 'Yes, I can call so-and-so, but are you sure that's what you want to have happen?' "
The son, Birch Evans Bayh 3d, who prefers to be called Evan Bayh, won that race and went on to be Governor of Indiana. And now, Mr. Bayh, 42, is running for the Senate seat that his father lost in 1980.
He is favored to win back his father's seat for the Democrats. But Evan Bayh is not a carbon copy.
While his father, now 70, spent 18 years in office as a prominent Great Society liberal, Evan Bayh is a fiscal conservative who takes credit for balancing his state's budget, implementing welfare reform and cutting taxes. While his father wrote constitutional amendments, including the one lowering the voting age to 18, and helped block two of President Richard M. Nixon's Supreme Court nominees, Evan Bayh has practiced what he describes as a politics of "pragmatic," incremental change, an approach that supporters praise as savvy and critics consider overly cautious.
"Sometimes making progress a step at a time is better than no progress at all," Mr. Bayh said in an interview at the Democratic Party's campaign headquarters across from the state Capitol. "If by demanding revolutionary change, I run the risk of accomplishing nothing on behalf of the public, then I'm not sure that's a responsible course of action."
Mr. Bayh is enormously popular in Indiana, with his famous name, his earnest manner, his good looks and his risk-averse governing style in a state dominated by Republicans.
He has also been mentioned as a prospect for higher office. Held up as the embodiment of President Clinton's "New Democrat" policies, Mr. Bayh gave the keynote speech at the 1996 Democratic National Convention. While he was edged out of prime-time airplay by other speakers, and pundits said his performance lacked excitement, Mr. Bayh came across as a good sport, appearing on stage with his wife, Susan, a lawyer, and their twins, Nicholas and Beau, then 9 months old.
"He's the kind of boy the people in Indiana would like their daughters to bring home," said Brian S. Vargus, a political science professor at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis. "Mr. Clean, crisp, Boy Wonder, young, attractive, articulate, nice."
Mr. Bayh gets chided by more liberal Democrats, who, Professor Vargus said, privately "refer to him as a Republicrat."
While Republican leaders consider the race for this seat, vacated by Senator Dan Coats, to be their toughest senatorial election this year, they are running a well-credentialed candidate, Paul Helmke, 49, the three-term Mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana's second-largest city.
"Evan still comes across a little the empty suit," said Mr. Helmke, a moderate Republican who won a three-way primary and has achieved some national prominence of his own, as a former president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. "He looks good. He sounds good. But there's a sense that he's trying to be all things to all people."
Born on Dec. 26, 1955, in Terre Haute, Ind., Evan Bayh was swaddled in politics. His mother, Marvella Bayh, was the daughter of an Indiana Governor, Matthew E. Welsh. His father ran twice for the Democratic nomination for President, dropping out in 1972 because his wife was stricken with cancer, which took her life in 1979.
When Evan Bayh was 6, he accompanied his parents to the home of former President Harry S. Truman, where his father was seeking advice about his first Senate race. He remembers that Truman gave him a silver dollar and that sometime in the political discussion he blurted out, "I have to go to the bathroom." Truman rescued him from his mother's mortified looks by saying, "You know, son, I have to go the bathroom, too," and taking him there.
At a White House dinner with his mother and father, Evan saw President Lyndon B. Johnson put his feet up on the table and was escorted by Lady Bird Johnson into the Lincoln Bedroom to watch television.
"Evan grew up in a very public home," said his father, now practicing law in Washington. Mr. Bayh said Evan was aware that his father was controversial because of the judicial appointments and other liberal stances, and once heard a phone caller threaten to kill the Senator.
Evan Bayh helped run his father's unsuccessful last Senate campaign, against Dan Quayle in 1980, and the loss "probably hurt him more than it hurt me," the elder Mr. Bayh said.
Eight years later, at age 32, the son was elected the nation's youngest governor and served the maximum two terms. Mr. Bayh, who contended with Republican-dominated Legislatures during his tenure but benefited from a robust economy, said his accomplishments included creation of 350,000 jobs and doubling the state surplus, to $1.6 billion, the largest in state history. He trimmed a deficit in state pension plans and sliced Medicaid spending to restore the state's fiscal health.
There were no tax increases. He did try to raise taxes on hospitals and cigarettes, but was blocked by Republican legislators.
Political experts say Mr. Bayh, who has been practicing corporate law since 1996, made few major advances on issues like education.
"Most of his governorship time was devoted to dollars-and-cents kinds of issues," said Jay McCann, associate professor of political science at Purdue University.
Although a polished spinner of phrases, Mr. Bayh said he resisted "generalizations" and "buzzwords," believing that most issues were complex.
He gets ideas from reading history and biographies that he orders from a history book club. He just started Theodore H. White's "Thunder Out of China," because he is "trying to learn more about foreign policy and defense policy."
Mr. Bayh said that as Senator he would work to raise educational standards and support "a flatter, fairer tax." While government should help the disadvantaged, he said, "personal responsibility has to go hand in hand."
"I'm trying to find the sensible center," he said.

HEADLINE: EATING WELL;
Saving Rare Breeds, the Tasty Sort

BYLINE: By Marian Burros 

 BODY:
KA-BOSS, ka-BOSS, ka-BOSS."
On a sunny morning last week, Annie Farrell was using her all-purpose animal call to round up her Large Black pigs. The three sows and a boar came readily, thinking there might be food; the six piglets were having too much fun foraging. 
 When they finally trotted over from a nearby field, Ms. Farrell couldn't help gushing over the Large Blacks, one of the highly endangered domesticated breeds she is trying to save on a farm less than an hour from New York. "They are wonderful pigs, good natured, great mothers, very protective," she said, then stopped herself before adding, "I don't want to get mushy about them because they are the best eating."
Good eating. That's Ms. Farrell's mantra.
If there is one thing she has learned in her efforts to save historic breeds of farm animals from extinction, it is the need to get people excited about eating the food these animals produce. It's all well and good to talk about preserving parts of the gene pool, but the only thing that will make the idea economically viable is meat tasty enough that people will want to buy it.
Just think of a Noah's Ark for epicures.
The pig-calling might have been a scene out of "Babe," but Ms. Farrell and her patrons, Nancy and Jerome Kohlberg, are deadly serious about their purpose at Cabbage Hill Farm, 200 bucolic acres in the backwoods of Westchester County.
The broods at the farm include 29 Large Black pigs, a rare Gloucestershire Old Spots sow, 32 Scottish Highland cattle, 72 Shetland sheep, 16 Shetland geese, 40 Shetland ducks and very rare Bronze turkeys.
These are the breeds that factory farming forgot, once popular but now disappearing in favor of fast-growing animals that yield the highest profits.
The Scottish cattle are accustomed to being outside in cold weather, and they have adapted to it by growing a heavy hairy coat rather than an extra layer of fat.
"We've had the meat tested at two different labs -- the first report was so surprising we couldn't believe it," Ms. Farrell said. "The meat has the same cholesterol count as white-meat chicken."
The Scottish Highland cattle are not actually listed as endangered by Britain's Rare Breeds Survival Trust, the pioneer conservation organization, now a quarter-century old. But they are classified as a "minor" breed, meaning they are definitely outside mainstream agribusiness. "We are watching them to make sure they don't head toward our priority lists," said Richard Lutwyche, the publicity officer of the group.
Now, Ms. Farrell is looking for butchers who are willing to hang the Scottish Highland beef she and the Kohlbergs are raising (hint: the farm's number is 914-241-2658). Fed exclusively on grass, the beef is filled with the flavor anyone over 40 may remember. Without grain, the beef is much leaner -- but it is also less tender until it is hung.
"People don't know how good rare breed meat is because they are used to fatty meat," she said. The Large Black pigs are far rarer: "There are only 300 Large Black breeding sows on the planet," Ms. Farrell explained as she continued rounding them up to meet a visiting veterinarian. The three sows and the boar were imported from Southwest England. Today they are doing well enough at the farm that some of the offspring will be sold for meat.
Ms. Farrell looked perturbed for a moment: There was still one pig missing, a sow that answers to the name of Abigail (when it deigns to answer at all). She is a Gloucestershire Old Spots, also "extremely flavorful," Ms. Farrell added. Like the Large Blacks, which forage and are happy to root around for themselves, these pigs are more flavorful than pigs from factory farms that are fattened on corn.
Abigail may be a good breeding sow, but her hearing is none too sharp: she either had not heard the calls or chose to ignore them. Then Ms. Farrell noticed a barely visible snout wiggling inside the enclosure where the pigs go to farrow.
"Come on, sweetie -- come on Abby sweetie," she said, coaxing her out. Abigail, who preferred snoozing, came out quite grumpily and was even grumpier when she and the other pigs were vaccinated.
Mr. Lutwyche, in England, points to the Gloucestershire Old Spots with cautious optimism. "It was the most popular breed in England in the 1920's," he said. "There were four or five thousand, but in the 1960's it had got down to 200 or so, almost all in one herd. Now we're back up to five or six hundred." But it is still on the trust's "endangered" list, its second most critical rating.
What's so special about the Gloucestershire Old Spots? The fact that they happily live outdoors makes them ideal "free-range" pigs. And their foraging skills are another thing in their favor, saving on feed costs. Their high fat content gives them added succulence and flavor.
"All biological systems need to have genetic diversity to make way for environmental change," said Dr. Donald E. Bixby, the executive director of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy in Pittsboro, N.C. In other words, you can't respond to shifting tastes and conditions if the gene pool is gone.
Playing Noah is only one of Ms. Farrell's goals at Cabbage Hill Farm. She also produces salad greens, herbs and broccoli sprouts, and farm-raised fish.
Amid the snorts of indignation from just-vaccinated pigs, the tour moved on to Ms. Farrell's aquaponics department, housed in a greenhouse. It is a closed recirculating system: the water from the fish tanks circulates through gravel beds, from which the plants pick up nutrition. The water feeds the greens and is then cleaned and returned to the fish tank. There are plenty of delicate, sweet talapia for sale. (More good eating.)
While the system at the farm is still too small to make a profit, it is used as a model to teach people how aquaponics works. The entire farm, in fact, is a teaching laboratory. Visitors have come from as far away as Israel and Kenya.
Ms. Farrell, who sold baskets of mesclun at the Union Square Greenmarket before most people knew what mesclun was, has been involved in sustainable agriculture for all of her adult life, though she has no formal training. She was known around New York as the Veg Lady in the early 80's, when she grew speciality crops, like white strawberries, for some of the city's best chefs.
Building a showcase for rare breeds and sustainable agriculture costs money, and Ms. Farrell is fortunate to have patrons like the Kohlbergs, who share her passions and have the means to further them through their Cabbage Hill Farm Foundation. (Mr. Kohlberg was a founding partner of the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.)
She and the Kohlbergs met about five years ago through friends and discovered their common interest.
"Mr. Kohlberg said to me, 'What would you do if you could do anything you wanted?' " Ms. Farrell recalled. Four months later she was at Cabbage Hill Farm.
Everyone at the farm does chores, even the cattle. They gladly do the initial "mowing" of the fields and are moved from one to another as their task is completed. They are followed by the Shetland sheep, who graze more intensively.
Two imperious looking llamas, Felix and Eleanor, zealously guard the sheep from coyotes, seen in the neighborhood. Coyotes tangle with llamas at their own risk. "The llamas either crush them to death or they kick them," Ms. Farrell explained. So much for the llamas' gentle looks.
Just then there was a cry of "Help, help!" Or something like it. "That's either a peacock or a woman being attacked," Ms. Farrell said. "Peacocks are great watchdogs." In some places, peacocks are also considered good eating.

Pioneers of the North Fork, Farewell

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

DATELINE: CUTCHOGUE, N.Y., July 11

 BODY:
"Twenty-five years is a long time for a career in any sport," Alex Hargrave said. "And winemaking is an Olympic sport."
This was Mr. Hargrave's deceptively casual way of explaining why he and his wife, Louisa, are ending their remarkable career as Long Island's pioneer winemakers. In 1973, the couple -- he was 28, she 25 -- set out their first vines in a former potato field on the North Fork. They were bravely -- and in the opinion of just about everyone else, foolishly -- determined to produce wines to rival the best that California and Europe could offer. 
 "It's good that we were so young," Mrs. Hargrave said, curled up on a sofa in the family home here. "When you're young, you don't want to take advice."
Youthful enthusiasm paid off, as it often does. Starting from scratch, the Hargraves created an industry that was ecologically and culturally in tune with the times.
And by demonstrating that vineyards and winemaking were economically viable, they showed that it was possible for Eastern Long Island to remain at least partly rural and agricultural.
The Hargraves, who were wine drinkers when most Americans did not know much about the stuff, particularly loved the grape varieties found in the great wines of Bordeaux and Burgundy: cabernet sauvignon, merlot, chardonnay, pinot noir.
"We resolved to go ahead only if we could make those kinds of wine," Mrs. Hargrave said.
They did, in the face of the conventional wisdom, much of it from state agricultural officials, who warned: don't even think about growing European grapes on Long Island.
But the Hargraves had visited other potential sites for their business that were as close as the Finger Lakes and as distant as British Columbia. Nothing they saw offered the climate and the soil of the North Fork.
They bought their first plot of land and in 1973 planted their first grapes and installed their press and fermenters in an old potato cellar. They produced their first wine, a cabernet sauvignon, in 1974.
Within just a few years, those who had doubted them were giving them respect instead, and many would-be winemakers followed in their footsteps.
Today, there are 21 wineries on Long Island, most of them within 10 miles of Hargrave Vineyards on Route 48. The wineries draw on some 1,500 acres of wine grapes, none of which existed 25 years ago.
A half-dozen more wineries are planned, and each week more and more people, both farmers and wine hobbyists, inquire about getting into the business, which now produces about 200,000 cases a year in the region.
That figure should double in the next few years, Mr. Hargrave said. "Every bottle we make these days is spoken for," he said. "Every good bottle has a home." Hargrave Vineyard produces 6,000 to 7,000 cases a year, he said.
Equally important, he continued, "the North Fork has become a wine destination." He added, "All year long, people flock to the wineries to taste, to learn and to buy."
The Hargraves have had dozens of inquiries about their 84-acre property, which includes the winery, the aging cellar, some 20 acres of vines, their home, a pool, tennis court and farm buildings. They are asking about $3 million and said they may close a deal sometime in the fall.
So why are they selling? The end to their wine story has its roots in its beginning. After graduating from Princeton University in 1968, Mr. Hargrave, whose grandfather was chairman of the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, did graduate work at Harvard University in Asian studies. By 1969 he had married Louisa, a graduate of Smith College, whose grandfather was Norman Thomas, the Socialist leader.
While Mr. Hargrave was recuperating from back surgery, the couple decided to leave academia and take on something they could do together. They chose wine.
In searching for a site, they visited John Wickham, a North Fork farmer who had grown vinifera table grapes successfully for more than a decade. Seeing his red Malagas convinced the Hargraves that they could grow vinifera wine grapes.
"Long Island has always had the potential to be an important wine region," Mr. Hargrave said, pointing out that wine grapes were grown in what is now Queens in the 1830's. But most of the farmers who were drawn to the region were teetotalers, he said. So potatoes, not grapes, became the agricultural stars. Until the Hargraves showed up, that is.
But starting about seven years ago, Mr. Hargrave was drawn back to Asian studies; particularly Chinese culture and specifically the origins of Chinese languages.
"It's called paleolinguistics," he said. Working at night and during winter breaks from the vineyards, he has been reconstructing what he calls a hypothetical language from which Chinese and other languages must have come.
"I find time to do the research, but not the writing," he said.
"We thought that eventually we'd have time to do other things," he added. "But a winery is like a sailboat -- someone's always got to be at the helm."
The Hargraves do not anticipate a complete break with the North Fork and wine; they may serve as consultants. But they do foresee a change in their life style, which may include his return to academia.
"An apartment in Boston and a cottage here on Peconic Bay sound pretty good to me," Mr. Hargrave said.
More immediately, the Hargraves, who have a son, 21, and a daughter, 23, must get the 1998 harvest in, bottle the 1997 vintage and prepare themselves for a new way of living.
"I guess it has something to do with choices, with making sense of a life," Mr. Hargrave said. "Do I want people saying, 'He's a vintner and his field is historical linguistics'?"
They hired a manager, to try and get more free time. "But we were still involved because it was the hands-on part that we loved -- the esthetics of making wine," he said. "It's so beautiful. That will be the hard part to give up."
 
Tastings
Orvieto's Pride
Salviano Orvieto Classico 1996, Umbria, Italy. About $12.
 
ITALY leads the world in the production of top quality wines at moderate prices, as this exceptional Orvieto readily attests. Orvieto, an hour's drive north of Rome, is a delightful small city, which gives its name to one of Italy's best-known white wines.
The prescribed formula for Orvieto permits a wide choice of grapes in the blend, but the base wine is invariably the dull trebbiano. The Tenuta di Salviano estate rescues this wine, of which about 40 percent is trebbiano, by adding verdello, grechetto, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, malvasia and drupeggio -- a new one to me. The result is a golden, fragrant, surprisingly complex wine to go with Italian cheese and seafood.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Visiting South Africa, Rubin Sides With the Free-Marketers

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, July 14

 BODY:
Stepping into a sharp South African debate without acknowledging it, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin repeatedly endorsed South African economic policies today even as these policies faced attack by the Government's closest allies.
Mr. Rubin, who is on a five-nation Africa trip, said in Soweto that the country's economic policies were "strong and stable" and that the Government's controversial Growth, Employment and Redistribution Policy "sets forth a medium-term plan to keep them that way." 
 Besides South Africa, the American Treasury Secretary is visiting the Ivory Coast, Namibia, Mozambique and Kenya to encourage policies that Washington and international lending agencies endorse: austere budgets, open markets, vigorous business competition and the sale of state-owned companies.
He also called here for expanding loans to small businesses, more education for the poor and greater flexibility from labor unions.
He deflected questions about the value of the South African currency, the rand, which has fallen sharply, other than to repeat that good economic and fiscal policies made for resilient currencies. The rand rose 2.6 percent today to a rate of 5.985 to the dollar. But it remains 19 percent below its value at the end of 1997, when it took 4.86 rand to buy a dollar.
Although Mr. Rubin did not mention the political criticism faced by the ruling African National Congress, he made it clear that the United States supported the Government's economic policies.
In an evening session with reporters, Mr. Rubin said he had "no ulterior motive" in praising these policies and was not conveying an American position on next year's South African national elections.
The A.N.C.'s two closest political allies, the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, an umbrella organization of mostly black labor unions, strongly oppose Government economic policies, which favor cutting public payrolls, keeping Government debt low, accepting high interest rates to control inflation and selling the airlines, railroads, ports, phone and electric utilities, diamond mines and dozens of other companies owned by the state.
The Government's opponents also oppose its request for "labor flexibility," considered a euphemism for union agreement to end wildcat strikes and accept changes such as around-the-clock mining operations.
Such policies represent a sharp reversal for the A.N.C. -- which, until it came to power in 1994, took a socialist approach that favored nationalization of the gold mines and full employment through state projects. The unions and the Communists, who hold many seats in Parliament in return for years of loyal support of the A.N.C., have criticized these current policies because the economy grew less than 2 percent last year, with a net loss by some estimates of 130,000 jobs.
But last month, President Nelson Mandela and his heir apparent, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, warned the unions and the Communists that these policies would be A.N.C. positions for the 1999 election campaign.
Today, Mr. Rubin pressed here for stimulating the economy through "micro-enterprise lending" -- loans of as little as $50 given to the poor to start businesses. To push the point, he visited a Soweto day care center run by Francina Mbense, who has stocked it with books, toys and furniture bought with a 15,000 rand loan -- about $2,500 -- which she received under a program financed by the United States Agency for International Development. Although she pays 23.25 percent interest, Mrs. Mbense said she was grateful because South African banks would not make loans of less than 50,000 rand and Soweto loan sharks charged as much as 50 percent a month.
At an hourlong discussion afterward with South African bankers and small-business executives, Mr. Rubin heard bankers explain why they did not make loans in impoverished areas. The cost of administering the loans was too great, they said; they cannot offer the business advice small borrowers need, and they are criticized when they build cut-rate branch offices because they build fancy ones in white suburbs.
Mr. Rubin suggested that they look at American business models such as pooling their money to be lent, and he noted that American bankers had been pushed through legislation into making small loans to customers in rundown areas.

For the summer, Northwest is offering weekly nonstop flight between Anchorage and Tokyo.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
ALMOST a decade after Alaska lost its nonstop passenger service to Japan, Northwest Airlines is currently making weekly nonstop flights between Anchorage and Tokyo.
In 1996, Gov. Tony Knowles of Alaska proposed $1 million in incentives to any airline that provided direct service to Tokyo. However, Northwest does not qualify for the incentive because it plans to suspend service Sept. 24, at least until next summer. But its 15 summer round-trip flights are expected to bring in more than 4,200 Japanese business and leisure travelers, and Governor Knowles said the flights would add more than $12 million to the Alaskan economy. 
 "Prior to 1989, most international traffic stopped here to refuel," said Morton V. Plumb, Jr., director of Anchorage International Airport. But Anchorage was no longer needed after the fall of Communism opened the shorter polar routes to international air traffic, and more fuel-efficient jet planes made refueling unnecessary.
While Anchorage does a big business in cargo flights, ranking 12th in the nation, its international traffic dwindled to 396,000 passengers in 1994, the fewest number in years, from 1.5 million in 1989. This year, including the expected 4,200 Northwest passengers and those who connect from Hawaii and cities in the continental United States, the foreign passenger tally in Anchorage will rise to about 720,000, Mr. Plumb said, while domestic passengers will total 4.3 million.
Meanwhile, gross sales at Anchorage's duty-free shops have struggled back to about $16 million, double that of four years ago but still only a fraction of the $118 million in gross sales in 1989. The main reason for the drop in revenue is obviously the result of the big drop in international passengers. But Mr. Plumb observed that many of the current Chinese and South Korean visitors are less free spending than were the Japanese passengers of a decade ago, and today's Japanese visitors are themselves less free spending, no doubt because of their nation's economic woes.
 
Millennium Cruises
The jointly owned Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises have announced millennium plans for their 17 ships. Royal Caribbean's Legend of the Seas, for example, will be among the first and last cruise ships to celebrate the event by positioning itself west of the international date line on Dec. 31, 1999, and east of the dateline Jan. 1, 2000. Its Vision of the Seas will be the first to enter the Panama Canal from the Caribbean in 2000, followed by Celebrity's Zenith.
 
A Gift in Time
By commissioning a line of gifts from some of Japan's leading artists and craftsmen, the Park Hyatt Tokyo Hotel has made it easy for its guests in that gift-giving country to pick up a little something for customers, business associates, family or friends -- remembrances ranging from paper coasters with artistic designs to tea sets and sake bottles.
Items, most of them hand crafted, can be ordered from hotel rooms and are wrapped by the hotel staff in traditional Japanese paper and cord.
 
Matter of Commissions
Rumors abound in the travel agent community that at least three airlines plan to lower commission caps further or eliminate commissions altogether. While the carriers have neither confirmed nor denied the rumors, John Hawks, president of the Association of Retail Travel Agents, appears guardedly optimistic that they are just that -- rumors. "It seems unlikely that the major carriers would take action now," he said, "given the very unfriendly atmosphere in Congress on issues like airline alliances."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Surges 1.6% to Join Other Stock Gauges at Record Levels

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market rallied sharply yesterday as several companies reported good or better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, easing concerns about the drag from Asia's economic turmoil.
The surge was enough to push the Dow Jones industrial average up 1.6 percent to a new high -- making it the last of the big three indexes to climb back into record territory. 
 Whether the rally will hold will depend a lot on how the the rest of the second-quarter earnings season plays out. Only a small proportion of the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's index have reported so far and analysts are still predicting a lackluster quarter.
After the market closed yesterday, the Intel Corporation reported that its second-quarter earnings dropped 29 percent, to 66 cents a diluted share, 2 cents below recent estimates. In after-hours trading, Intel's stock dropped to $80.125 after falling $1.6875, to $80.6875, in regular trading.
But it appeared yesterday that the rush of money into the stock market from Americans and foreigners is so strong that it may be enough to overcome less than fabulous earnings growth.
"Foreigners are buying U.S. securities aggressively, stock buybacks are big and mutual fund flows are strong," said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The market is being driven by liquidity."
Mr. Wien marveled at the economy's ability to grow without a resurgence in inflation and the refusal of investors to worry about how far this market can go. "It is sort of like having drink after drink and not getting drunk and waking up the next morning without a hangover and thinking that you can party all the time," he said.
Also buoying investors is the fact that usually -- despite the Intel disappointment -- there are a lot of positive earnings surprises during the reporting season because companies work so hard to manage expectations. Companies jawbone down earnings forecasts until the beginning of the reporting season, making it much easier for the actual reports to surpass those already-lowered expectations.
This is what happened with the positive earnings reports yesterday from Weyerhaeuser, the manufacturer of wood and paper products. The company announced earnings of 34 cents a diluted share, beating the recent consensus estimate of analysts tallied by First Call Corporation of 22 cents a share. But on June 16 the company said that its earnings would be significantly below the then estimate of 38 cents a share.
Johnson & Johnson, the health care company, and Norwest and J. P. Morgan, two major banks, also reported earnings at or above expectations yesterday. General Motors reported a sharp strike-induced drop in earnings that was smaller than expected. And Allied Signal, the aerospace company, reported positive results after the market's close on Monday.
The Dow surged 149.33 points, to 9,245.54, beating its previous high of 9,211.84 on May 13. The Dow's rally back to new highs took just under two months, three times as fast as the return to new highs this February after 1997's August peak and the sharp one-day decline on Oct. 27 of 7.2 percent.
The Nasdaq index, which surpassed its April 22 high on July 8, rose 2.88 points to a record of 1,968.41. The S.& P. 500-stock index, which had surpassed its April 22 high on June 24, climbed 12.39 points, or 1.1 percent, to a record of 1,177.58.
Big Board volume was 700.3 million shares, higher than average. Advancing issues led decliners by 1,773 to 1,190.
The return to record highs, some analysts say, is not surprising because they believe that the underlying fundamentals of the American economy continue to be positive enough to support the stock market, even if earnings growth has slowed well below the double-digit pace that sent stocks higher during the last several years.
These positive fundamentals were reinforced yesterday with the report that the Consumer Price Index for June rose just one-tenth of 1 percent, leaving inflation up just 1.4 percent on an annual rate this year. June retail sales rose one-tenth of 1 percent after a revised 1.2 percent gain in May.
While bond prices fell and interest rates rose yesterday, low inflation and a slowing in economic growth -- signs of which are beginning to pop up -- mean that interest rates could remain low, which also helps the stock market by making equities look more attractive.
"Lower interest rates are more important than the difference between 3 percent and 6 percent earnings growth," said Richard Pucci, the director of research at I.B.E.S. International, a firm that follows earnings estimates. "With inflation and long-term interest rates low and economic activity healthy, I believe that investors are and will remain unfazed by the slowdown in earnings growth."
And with this positive background there just seems to be an urgency among investors to get their money into the stock market.
"The pressure is so great to get the money in," said Marshall Acuff, the equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. Earnings still count, he argued, but "current earnings sometimes may not make as much difference as people speculate that they will get better in the future."
Also aiding the market yesterday was the improvement in the outlook for Russia's economy following an agreement on Monday for $17 billion in new international support. But the county's legislature still must approve the domestic economic program that goes along with the bailout.
"Every problem out there that seems to scare us seems to get solved," Mr. Wien said.

HEADLINE: Corporations Still Give, but Also Get

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
While corporations continue to lend major support to colleges and universities, their giving is rarely so purely philanthropic as in the past, the leading organization of education fund-raisers was told at its annual meeting over the weekend.
"Rather than simply hand over a check and say goodbye, today's corporate sponsors want to see their money used in ways in line with their business objectives," said Suzanne Cornforth of Paschall & Associates, public relations consultants in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. 
 Ms. Cornforth, who spoke in Chicago on Sunday at the annual gathering of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, an organization of academic fund-raisers, alumni association administrators and others, said corporate giving to all beneficiaries leaped to $4.25 billion in 1994 from $850 million in 1985. But increasingly, she said, strings are attached.
"This is a young generation of corporate sponsors," Ms. Cornforth said, "and they have discovered the advantages of building long-term relationships with educational institutions."
Those long-term relationships -- or "partnerships," as they are known -- manifest themselves in a variety of ways. A corporation may donate a laboratory and then train students and faculty in the use of its own technological equipment, a step virtually sure to have long-term sales benefits. Or companies may use scholarships and grants to focus research in ways useful chiefly to themselves.
Or they may award fellowships to promising graduate students, or endow faculty chairs or deanships that carry the corporate name: when Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chief economic adviser to President Clinton, was chosen two months ago to head the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley, the title she assumed was BankAmerica Dean, following a $2 million BankAmerica donation to the business school.
Corporate consulting fees to faculty are another common partnership feature, and critics worry that big businesses can threaten academic independence and steer the human and physical resources of a university in directions beneficial mainly to themselves. Even a believer in corporate partnerships, Manny Cunard, executive director of the National Association of College Auxiliary Services, acknowledges, "When you have colleges taking money from corporations, there's always the potential risk that the colleges will become obligated to a particular company."
Partnerships are a relatively recent trend that experts trace to 1992, when the Pepsi-Cola Company and the Pennsylvania State University system struck a deal in which Pepsi agreed to pay the system about $14 million over 10 years for exclusive rights to sell its products on 21 university campuses. Today nearly 100 institutions have similar deals, according to a survey by Lee White, a Denver investment banker who specializes in higher education finance.
Among the corporate heavyweights that have entered or are exploring partnerships are Fujitsu Ltd., GTE Services, Nike Inc., Barnes & Noble Inc., the Rite Aid Corporation, the Sun Company, Pfizer Inc., Merck & Company, the Pepsi-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola Company.
In January, California State University at Fresno announced that Pepsi-Cola and Save Mart Supermarkets had jointly offered to contribute $40 million over 20 years or so toward the $105 million needed to build a multipurpose campus event center. If the trustees approve, the new building will be named the Save Mart Center, and the food chain will be granted the exclusive right to serve as the off-campus ticket outlet for all Fresno State events. As for Pepsi-Cola, a unit of Pepsico Inc., it would be given the exclusive right to sell nonalcoholic beverages and certain snack foods on campus.
Still other corporate sponsors provide scholarships and support academic work increasingly tied to their research and development needs. This spring the trustees of the University of Connecticut approved a deal in which Pfizer will build a $19 million research laboratory on the university's campus in Storrs. The university will occupy 20 percent of the space, and Pfizer 80 percent. Officials said they expected that the venture would help Pfizer develop animal vaccines and enhance the university's ability to attract highly qualified faculty and students.
Of course, Pfizer is not alone among pharmaceutical companies in reaching out to colleges and universities. Last year, for example, Merck announced an agreement under which it will pay the Massachusetts Institute of Technology $15 million over five years to collaborate in the development of innovative technology. Merck will be given patents and licensing rights to developments resulting from the deal.
Not all such arrangements work out smoothly. One of them, which only recently collapsed after months of negotiation, concerned a partnership called the California Educational Technology Initiative, in which two or more companies, including Fujitsu and GTE Services, were to build a $300 million high-technology network linking the 23 campuses in the California State University system. In exchange, the corporations were to have the use of the linkage to market their products to university students, faculty and alumni.
While critics voice concerns about corporate influence and its potential to threaten academic independence, corporations and university development officers defend their ties, arguing that universities have become more sophisticated in fund-raising.
"A generation ago, some people thought it was unseemly for universities to go out and ask people to give money," said Charles R. Agnew, vice chancellor for development at the Penn State system of higher education. "Now it's routine. And some of those we routinely ask -- sometimes in exchange for a franchise -- are corporations."

HEADLINE: Clinton Sees Computer Bug As Major Test In Year 2000

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Addressing the potential year 2000 computer crisis for the first time, President Clinton said today that he would propose legislation to limit the liability of companies that share data about year 2000 solutions if the information proves faulty.
He also said the United States would contribute $12 million to a World Bank program to help developing nations deal with the potential computer problem. 
 Mr. Clinton, addressing the National Academy of Sciences, warned of "gaping holes" in efforts by the Government and private industry to prepare their computer systems for the end of the millennium.
Bringing the nation's computers into compliance is one of the greatest technological challenges in history, the President said. Failure to deal with the "millennium bug," which prevents computers from recognizing the beginning of a new century, will result in "a series of shutdowns, inaccurate data, faulty calculations" that could affect Government functions from the payment of Medicare claims to control of the nation's air traffic system, he said.
Most older computers are programmed with two digits for the year in the date field, and will not recognize "00" as 2000. They may think it is 1900, with potentially catastrophic consequences.
The current official estimate of the cost of bringing the Federal Government's computers into compliance is $6 billion, but most experts consider that figure far too low.
The "Good Samaritan" legislation that Mr. Clinton said he would submit to Congress is intended to deal with the fear by many companies that they will face expensive lawsuits if they provide information about their computers' year 2000 compliance that proves wrong.
The bill, which is still circulating in the Government in draft form, would not relieve companies of liability for failures of hardware or software intended to address problems involving the year 2000.
A burgeoning legal specialty of year 2000 liability litigation is discouraging companies from freely sharing data, said Michael A. Aisenberg, a Washington lawyer working with the Administration on the proposed legislation.
"The prospect of litigation is already putting a chill on technology initiators, who are worried they'll be sued if their year 2000 disclosures turn out to be wrong or don't work," Mr. Aisenberg said. Granting liability relief for well-intentioned data sharing has bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, he added, but it may face strong opposition from the product liability bar.
Mr. Clinton and other Administration officials expressed optimism that the United States would bring its "mission critical" computer systems into compliance before the ball drops in Times Square at the end of next year. "I have made it clear to every member of my Cabinet that the American people have a right to expect uninterrupted service from the Government, and I expect them to deliver," the President said.
But the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has a markedly more pessimistic view of the Government's efforts.
As of last month, only about 40 percent of the 7,336 most-critical Federal computer systems were prepared for Dec. 31, 1999, according to the G.A.O. "Unless progress improves dramatically," the agency said in a report issued on June 10, "a substantial number of mission-critical systems will not be year-2000 compliant in time."
Representative Steve Horn, Republican of California, has studied the problem for the past several years and gives the Government a failing grade for its progress so far.
In an interview, Mr. Horn said he had been pressing Mr. Clinton to personally address the millennium bug as a means of concentrating the minds of Federal bureaucrats.
"I think this is a major step here," the Congressman said. "The denial is over. They hadn't done anything up to now to share with the American people what this problem is all about. Now they have to keep at it and not assume the nation heard it because he gave one speech."
Some Federal agencies are better prepared for next year's turn of the calendar than others, Administration and Congressional officials said. Among those relatively well along in their efforts are the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
But other agencies are "substantially challenged," according to John A. Koskinen, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget and chairman of the Year 2000 Conversion Council, which is overseeing the Government's work on the problem. Among them are the Internal Revenue Service and the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Energy and Education.
Mr. Koskinen said that the United States was further along than 90 percent of the other nations, and that many countries had failed to take even preliminary steps toward compliance. "We have great risks internationally," Mr. Koskinen said. If the Singapore stock exchange fails to open on Monday, Jan. 3, 2000, for example, the repercussions will be felt throughout the global financial system.
"No one knows," he added, "what the end of next year will look like."

HEADLINE: House Passes Bill to Lift Nuclear Sanctions on Food for India and Pakistan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
The House of Representatives voted today to exempt agriculture credits from economic sanctions placed on Pakistan and India after they exploded nuclear devices.
The vote was a response to farmers who feared heavy losses as a result of the sanctions. 
 The Senate, which approved similar legislation last week by a 98-0 vote, quickly accepted the House version, sending it to President Clinton for his signature.
The immediate effect of the voice vote in the House was to open the way for an agreement with Pakistan for the purchase of 385,000 tons of white wheat, most of which is grown in the Pacific Northwest. Pakistan had set a deadline of Wednesday for legislative action allowing for the wheat negotiations to go forward.
Mr. Clinton endorsed the legislative effort last week.
"The timing could not be worse," said Representative Doug Bereuter, a Nebraska Republican, referring to the sanctions. French, Australian and Canadian farmers "will exploit this lucrative wheat export market at a time when American wheat prices for our farmers are at the lowest point in decades and we desperately need to hold on to those export markets."
The House bill exempts agricultural commodities from the embargo for one year. The original Senate version provided a permanent exemption.
"I'd prefer a permanent solution to this, but we can't afford to wait any longer -- our farmers are already too close to devastating losses," said Representative Bob Smith, an Oregon Republican, who is chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.
"This bill will fix the immediate problem and permit our farmers to take advantage of the Pakistani wheat tender while allowing Congress time to work toward a more permanent resolution."
Pakistan had planned to use credits to purchase up to $250 million in American wheat during this fiscal year. The sanctions imposed in May after Pakistan responded to India's nuclear testing by exploding its own nuclear device froze $88 million in remaining credits for the year.
It was estimated that next year Pakistan would buy up to $350 million worth of American wheat. Last year, 37 percent of the wheat grown in the Pacific Northwest went to Pakistan.
India is a much smaller customer, having imported about $142 million in total agricultural goods last year.
The sanctions that went into effect automatically when India and Pakistan violated international nuclear testing regimes exempt relief aid, but the Clinton Administration concluded last month that wheat credits were private transactions and not protected.
The clamor over the hardships the sanctions would impose on farmers had some lawmakers also saying it was time to rethink the value of sanctions in general, with some contending that the damage to American exporters often outweighs the political objectives.
"Clearly it is in the interests of U.S. workers and U.S. companies to eliminate sanctions that penalize our working men and women and that is why we need to go further," said Representative Calvin Dooley, a California Democrat.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Barely Rose Last Month

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose less than expected in June and retail sales for the month added to a strong gain in May, the Government said today in reports that suggested the economy was still expanding without causing higher inflation.
The Consumer Price Index -- the broadest gauge of costs for goods and services -- rose one-tenth of a percent in June as energy prices fell for the eighth time in nine months, Labor Department figures showed. That is down from a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in May and less than the increase of two-tenths of a percent that analysts had forecast. 
 June retail sales rose one-tenth of a percent, to $225.691 billion, after surging a revised 1.2 percent in May, the largest monthly gain since July 1997. Sales at restaurants, bars and drugstores showed the largest percentage increases in June, while fur niture and apparel sales fell.
Increases in retail sales averaged seven-tenths of a percent a month in the second quarter, the same as in the first quarter, when the economy grew at an extraordinarily strong 5.4 percent annual rate.
The June sales increase fell short of the forecast of five-tenths of a percent. Analysts say it is unclear whether the numbers signal the start of a weaker trend.
The core rate of the Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy costs, matched the overall increase of one-tenth of a percent in June. The core increase is down from rises of two-tenths of a percent in May and three-tenths in April.

HEADLINE: Bucking Trend, Debt in Albany Keeps Growing

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 10

 BODY:
There is an audacity to the way New York State borrows money that can make even critics sound almost admiring.
"You know, it really is amazing," said Robert A. Kurtter, senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. "No one else is even close." 
 While many states are taking advantage of the economic boom to control or reduce their public debts, New York State is vigorously bucking the trend, engaging in a borrowing spree that easily gives it the largest debt of any state in the nation.
When Gov. Mario M. Cuomo began his last term, in 1991, New York owed $20 billion in outstanding bonds that were being repaid with state taxes. When Gov. George E. Pataki took office four years later, the debt was $27 billion. Today, it is almost $35 billion, and the administration projects that it will reach $41 billion in five years.
California, with a population 75 percent larger than New York's, is a distant second, with $21 billion in tax-supported debt.
New York's public authorities, agencies like the Thruway Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which are controlled by the Governor, owed $60 billion at the start of 1991 and $71 billion when Mr. Pataki took office; they owe $85 billion today. That figure, too, is expected to keep rising fast. Some of that debt is supported by state taxes, but most of it is repaid through the authorities' own revenues, like tolls and subway fares.
This voracious borrowing has come even as the state has racked up record surpluses in the last two years, and it has helped make possible what Mr. Pataki, a Republican, holds up as his signal achievement: cutting taxes deeply, even as state spending has increased.
Going billions of dollars deeper into debt has allowed the state to expand its capital building programs, despite tax cuts, by pushing the costs as much as 30 years into the future and leaving a future generation of lawmakers to deal with the consequences.
"Once they cut taxes, they had to either borrow a lot more money, or let the capital program go to pieces," said Frank Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a group financed primarily by foundations and labor unions that studies state finances.
People who watch the state's finances from outside the Capitol, including some who rate the state's bonds, warn of a debt crisis in the making, one that in the next recession -- or even in a Wall Street downturn -- could force severe program cuts and layoffs, or increases in the taxes and fees that are used to pay off bonds, because the state has saddled itself with high debt payments for the next 20 to 30 years.
The state's debt has grown as the nation's economy has been humming along -- though somewhat less tunefully in New York -- and generating healthy tax revenues. Most states have used this period to get their fiscal houses in order and their debts under control. Louisiana, until recently the only state with a worse credit rating than New York's (they are now tied for worst), has cut its debt in half in five years.
New York began the last recession as the biggest debtor state. When some states borrowed to make ends meet during that downturn, New York borrowed more. When sour times turned sweet, New York kept borrowing and continues to borrow far more money, year in and year out, than any other state.
A new report by Moody's shows that New York State's tax-supported debt is the fourth highest, per capita, of any state, and fifth highest when measured against the income of state residents.
New Jersey, under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, has also bucked the national trend, going much deeper into debt despite good times. Before Mrs. Whitman took office, New Jersey had a below-average debt burden, but it has jumped to seventh worst in the Moody's rankings, though still significantly less than New York's.
Connecticut, long one of the most heavily indebted states, has marginally increased its borrowing under Gov. John G. Rowland.
In New York, Mr. Pataki, who is running for re-election this year, acknowledges that the state owes too much, and he has proposed some modest steps to deal with the problem. But it is a measure of how deeply ingrained borrowing is in the state's political culture that while many other states have held their debts steady or reduced them, the Governor's budget director, Robert L. King, boasts of having slowed the rate at which New York's debt grows.
The Republican Governor and his aides have said the primary blame for the growing debt lies with the Legislature, particularly the Democrats who control the Assembly. The Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, has repeatedly advocated more borrowing, despite the state's huge cash surpluses of $2.1 billion this year and $1.4 billion last year. The administration also points to the burden of keeping up the state's expansive infrastructure of roads, bridges, colleges and mass transit, arguing that they were ill maintained in Mr. Cuomo's last years.
"I'm not here to tell you that the problem does not need to be addressed," Mr. King, the budget director, said in an interview. "We are committed, the Governor and the Budget Division, to trying to reduce the size of the state debt."
But the growing debt has tarnished, somewhat, the Governor's carefully built and jealously guarded image as a fiscal conservative, one that is central not just to his current campaign, but to his potential aspirations for national office in 2000.
"The Governor's record on debt is irresponsible, because New York was already so deeply in debt when he took office," said Tom Carroll, president of Change-NY, a group of fiscal conservatives that has generally lauded Mr. Pataki's record. "This is the one fiscal problem he has made worse, rather than better. And it's particularly inexcusable to keep borrowing more when the state is running such big surpluses."
Some Democrats complain that while Mr. Pataki derided Mr. Cuomo as a tax-and-spend Democrat, the Governor has turned out to be a borrow-and-spend Republican.
Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker and a leading Democratic candidate for governor, has tried to campaign to Mr. Pataki's right on fiscal matters, making himself out to be the true conservative, and reminding audiences of his role in creating New York City budgets that are, by most experts' judgments, more sound than the state's.
Independent analysts say the problem has actually worsened under Mr. Pataki, because the state borrows for more of its capital needs than ever before.
For most of Mr. Cuomo's 12 years in office, the state paid well over half of its capital budget with cash on hand, borrowing the rest. In some years, the "pay-as-you-go" portion was over 70 percent, and even in Mr. Cuomo's last two years in office, when the state's economy was still stagnant, it was 51 percent and then 40 percent. Under Mr. Pataki, it has fallen below 30 percent, despite the state's record surpluses, and the administration's long-range plan calls for it to drop to 10 percent in a few years.
"With these huge surpluses, we've not only blown a spectacular opportunity to increase pay-as-you-go, cap borrowing and even pay off some of the old debts, we've actually done the opposite, and made it a lot worse," said Andrew Rein, senior researcher with the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors the New York city and state budgets.
Most states spend less than 4 cents of every general fund dollar repaying bonds. At the start of 1991, New York spent less than 6 cents. When Mr. Pataki took office in 1995, it spent 8 cents. This fiscal year, it will spend $3.5 billion paying off loans, or 9 1/2 cents of every dollar in the general fund.
That figure is projected to keep rising fast, not only because the state plans to keep borrowing, but because lawmakers have approved a host of tax cuts that have not yet taken effect, and that will cut into the available money in the general fund. The increase is all the more striking because interest rates have been very low in recent years, allowing the Pataki administration to refinance bonds at lower rates, saving money on repayment.
Mr. King, the budget director, spoke of the administration's frustration at not being able to take more steps to control borrowing. "Patterns of behavior take a while to change," he said. "We're changing them as aggressively as our friends upstairs will let us," he added, referring to the Legislature.
Under Mr. Pataki, the state has not engaged in some of the most derided practices of the Cuomo years, like selling, in essence, the Attica prison to itself to generate cash, or borrowing money to meet routine operating needs.
Last year, Mr. Pataki proposed early repayment of the $200 million in Attica bonds, but the Legislature refused. This year, he proposed paying cash for $425 million in already approved projects, like a sports complex in Brooklyn and improvements to the Buffalo Bills' stadium, rather than borrowing the money, but the Legislature said no. He proposed the creation of a debt-reduction fund that would use up to $800 million in surplus funds this year to pay off debts; the Legislature created the fund, but would only put $50 million in it.
And in April, the Governor, under some criticism for proposing an 8 percent increase in state spending, vetoed more than $800 million in borrowing approved by the Legislature, saying the projects were unnecessary, or could be paid for with cash on hand.
All of this lets Mr. Pataki claim, with some justification, that his is the voice of restraint in Albany. But restraint is a relative term.
It was Mr. Pataki who this year started a six-year, $3 billion borrowing campaign for improvements at State and City University campuses. He agreed to the $425 million in borrowing for sports and other facilities in last year's budget. He championed the $1.75 billion environmental bond act approved by voters in 1996.
And this year, under Mr. Pataki's direction, the Long Island Power Authority is issuing $7 billion in bonds, the largest state or local bond issue in American history, to buy the assets of the Long Island Lighting Company. The M.T.A., which the Governor controls, is selling $3.5 billion in fare-backed bonds over three years, largely because Mr. Pataki ended the state's long-standing practice of helping pay for new trains and buses.
"Debt in New York is viewed as a free good," said Mr. Kurtter, of Moody's. "It's not viewed as a scarce resource. The concern is first and foremost creating additional resources to afford current spending, and deferring any costs that can be deferred as far as possible into the future."

Just Say $1 Billion

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
If all the merchandising might of Hollywood couldn't make America's teen-agers buy "Godzilla," why does anyone think that a five-year, $1 billion government ad campaign is going to make kids swear off drugs?
Especially ads like these. No sooner was this new exercise in bipartisan idiocy announced by Bill Clinton and seconded by Newt Gingrich last week than the premiere commercial of the campaign hit the networks. In this elegantly shot display of high-concept Madison Avenue creativity, a young woman armed with a skillet angrily smashes an egg and then an entire kitchen to dramatize the destructiveness of heroin. The ad is an oh-so-hip variation on a Golden Oldie of Reagan-era anti-drug advertising -- remember that fried egg once labeled "your brain on drugs"? -- and it sends bizarrely mixed messages. The woman looks like Winona Ryder; she's wearing a tight tank top; there are no visible track marks on her junkie-thin arms; and the kitchen representing her drug-induced hell is echt Pottery Barn, if not Williams-Sonoma. 
 Far from discouraging teen-agers from drug use, our anti-heroin heroine -- so sexy when she gets mad -- may inspire some of them to seek out a vixen like her for a date.
The mixed messages hardly end there. Not only will these ads coexist on TV with those pushing beer and pharmaceutical panaceas but with a commercial culture that in general subliminally sells intoxication. "A lot of advertising equates products with drug experiences," says Thomas Frank, the author of "The Conquest of Cool," a scintillating history of the modern ad biz. Whether it's a soft drink like Fruitopia trading on psychedelic packaging or a stylish new car promising its owner escape and speed or a Nike shoe bestowing enhanced physical powers, the ubiquitous message of the advertising medium is Get High.
Though the new anti-drug campaign is the largest government merchandising effort in history, it's hard to imagine how it will be heard above the din surrounding it. Even at almost $400 million a year (half public funds, half pro bono freebies from media participants), it's still a far smaller campaign than McDonald's current and as yet inconclusive effort to win back its youthful defectors. Meanwhile, the industry publication Brandweek has challenged the methods of academic studies that the Partnership for a Drug-Free America trots out to defend the efficacy of anti-drug advertising. It calls the research "flimsy," adding that its findings "would hardly justify launching a new stain remover, let alone a program meant to help keep children sober and alive."
While partisans on all sides of the drug wars have condemned the new ad campaign as wasteful, arguing that the money might be better spent on either more law enforcement or on more after-school programs and drug treatment, the public has been mum. This only encourages Washington to think of advertising as the new instant remedy to fool voters into believing that it is addressing intractable problems; Speaker Gingrich, proposing a new tobacco bill to replace John McCain's, has already suggested that anti-smoking ads be its centerpiece. What's next? An ad campaign to brainwash Americans into believing that they can trust their H.M.O.'s? It's enough to make you pine for the usual government gimmick of appointing blue-ribbon commissions to finesse hard policy questions, whether about AIDS or women in the military or Social Security. These commissions don't do anything either, but at least they don't cost us a billion bucks.
Where is all that money going? To advertising agencies and their media outlets, from newspapers to MTV. Advertising Age reports that most of the first $90 million installment will go -- where else? -- to Disney. The mouse will throw in some bonus public service announcements on ABC, a Web site and, who knows, maybe an Epcot ride simulating the OD experience, in exchange for a $50 million "multimedia, cross-property package." The idea of Disney being on the Government dole is amusing enough, but it may also introduce a new economic model to the long and tortured history of the drug war. Where once we had companies that laundered drug money, now we have corporations synergizing anti-drug money. Should its "Armageddon" not cross the line into profit, Disney's share of this Washington bonanza may be just the fix it needs to help it feel no pain.

Profits at a Juvenile Prison Come With a Chilling Cost

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: TALLULAH, La.

 BODY:
Here in the middle of the impoverished Mississippi Delta is a juvenile prison so rife with brutality, cronyism and neglect that many legal experts say it is the worst in the nation.
The prison, the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth, opened just four years ago where a sawmill and cotton fields once stood. Behind rows of razor wire, it houses 620 boys and young men, age 11 to 20, in stifling corrugated-iron barracks jammed with bunks. 
 From the run-down homes and bars on the road that runs by it, Tallulah appears unexceptional, one new cookie-cutter prison among scores built in the United States this decade. But inside, inmates of the privately run prison regularly appear at the infirmary with black eyes, broken noses or jaws or perforated eardrums from beatings by the poorly paid, poorly trained guards or from fights with other boys.
Meals are so meager that many boys lose weight. Clothing is so scarce that boys fight over shirts and shoes. Almost all the teachers are uncertified, instruction amounts to as little as an hour a day, and until recently there were no books.
Up to a fourth of the inmates are mentally ill or retarded, but a psychiatrist visits only one day a week. There is no therapy. Emotionally disturbed boys who cannot follow guards' orders are locked in isolation cells for weeks at a time or have their sentences arbitrarily extended.
These conditions, which are described in public documents and were recounted by inmates and prison officials during a reporter's visit to Tallulah, are extreme, a testament to Louisiana's well-documented violent history and notoriously brutal prison system.
But what has happened at Tallulah is more than just the story of one bad prison. Corrections officials say the forces that converged to create Tallulah -- the incarceration of more and more mentally ill adolescents, a rush by politicians to build new prisons while neglecting education and psychiatric services, and states' handing responsibility for juvenile offenders to private companies -- have caused the deterioration of juvenile prisons across the country.
Earl Dunlap, president of the National Juvenile Detention Association, which represents the heads of the nation's juvenile jails, said, "The issues of violence against offenders, lack of adequate education and mental health, of crowding and of poorly paid and poorly trained staff are the norm rather than the exception."
Recognizing the problem, the United States Justice Department has begun a series of investigations into state juvenile systems, including not only Louisiana's but also those of Kentucky, Puerto Rico and Georgia. At the same time, private juvenile prisons in Colorado, Texas and South Carolina have been successfully sued by individuals and groups or forced to give up their licenses.
On Thursday, the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, an offshoot of the Southern Poverty Law Center, filed a Federal lawsuit against Tallulah to stop the brutality and neglect.
In the investigations by the Justice Department, some of the harshest criticism has been leveled at Georgia. The department threatened to take over the state's juvenile system, charging a "pattern of egregious conditions violating the Federal rights of youth," including the use of pepper spray to restrain mentally ill youths, a lack of textbooks, and guards who routinely stripped young inmates and locked them in their cells for days.
A surge in the inmate population forced Georgia's juvenile prison budget up to $220 million from $80 million in just four years, but the money went to building new prisons, with little left for education and psychiatric care. "As we went through a period of rapid increase in juvenile crime and record numbers of juvenile offenders," said Sherman Day, chairman of the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, it was "much easier to get new facilities from the Legislature than to get more programs."
After reacting defensively at first, Gov. Zell Miller moved quickly to avert a takeover by agreeing to spend $10 million more this year to hire teachers and medical workers and to increase guard salaries.
Louisiana, whose juvenile system is made up of Tallulah and three prisons operated by the state, is the Justice Department's latest target. In hundreds of pages of reports to a Federal judge who oversees the state's entire prison system under a 1971 consent decree, Justice Department experts have depicted guards who routinely resort to beatings or pepper spray as their only way to discipline inmates, and who pit inmates against one another for sport.
In June, two years after the Justice Department began its investigation and a year after it warned in its first public findings that Tallulah was "an institution out of control," consultants for the department filed new reports with the Federal judge, Frank J. Polozola of Federal District Court in Baton Rouge, warning that despite some improvements, conditions had deteriorated to "a particularly dangerous level."
Even a former warden at Louisiana's maximum-security prison, acting as a consultant to Judge Polozola, found conditions at Tallulah so serious that he urged the judge to reject its request to add inmates.
"I do not make these recommendations because of any sympathy for these offenders," wrote the former warden, John Whitley. "It shocks me to think" that "these offenders and their problems are simply getting worse, and these problems will be unleashed on the public when they are discharged from the system."
 
The Private Prison
When the Profits Are the Priority
Some of the worst conditions in juvenile prisons can be found among the growing number of privately operated prisons, whether those built specifically for one state, like Tallulah, or ones that take juveniles from across the country, like boot camps that have come under criticism in Colorado and Arizona.
Only 5 percent of the nation's juvenile prisons are operated by private, for-profit companies, Mr. Dunlap of the National Juvenile Detention Association estimates. But as their numbers grow along with privately operated prisons for adults, their regulation is becoming one of the most significant issues in corrections. State corrections departments find themselves having to police contractors who perform functions once the province of government, from psychiatric care to discipline.
In April, Colorado officials shut down a juvenile prison operated by the Rebound Corporation after a mentally ill 13-year-old's suicide led to an investigation that uncovered repeated instances of physical and sexual abuse. The for-profit prison housed offenders from six states.
Both Arizona and California authorities are investigating a privately operated boot camp in Arizona that California paid to take hundreds of offenders. A 16-year-old boy died there, and authorities suspect the cause was abuse by guards and poor medical care. California announced last Wednesday that it was removing its juveniles from the camp.
And recently Arkansas canceled the contract of Associated Marine Institutes, a company based in Florida, to run one juvenile institution, following questions of financial control and accusations of abuse.
A series of United States Supreme Court decisions and state laws have long mandated a higher standard for juvenile prisons than for adult prisons. There is supposed to be more schooling, medical care and security because the young inmates have been adjudged delinquent, rather than convicted of crimes as adults are, and so are held for rehabilitation instead of punishment.
But what has made problems worse here is that Tallulah, to earn a profit, has scrimped on money for education and mental health treatment in a state that already spends very little in those areas.
"It's incredibly perverse," said David Utter, director of the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana. "They have this place that creates all these injuries and they have all these kids with mental disorders, and then they save money by not treating them."
Bill Roberts, the lawyer for Tallulah's owner, Trans-American Development Associates, said that some of the Justice Department's demands, like hiring more psychiatrists, are "unrealistic." The state is to blame for the problems, he said, because "our place was not designed to take that kind of inmate."
Still, Mr. Roberts said, "There has been a drastic improvement" in reducing brutality by guards. As for fights between the inmates, he said, "Juveniles are a little bit different from adults. You are never going to stop all fights between boys."
In papers filed with Judge Polozola on July 7 responding to the Justice experts and Mr. Whitley, the State Attorney General's office disputed accusations of brutality and of high numbers of retarded and mentally ill inmates at Tallulah.
In a recent interview, Cheney Joseph, executive counsel to Gov. Mike Foster, warned there were limits to what Louisiana was willing to do. "There are certain situations the Department of Justice would like us to take care of," he said, "that may not be financially feasible and may not be required by Federal law."
 
The Entrepreneurs
An Idea Born Of Patronage
The idea for a prison here was put forward in 1992 by James R. Brown, a Tallulah businessman whose father was an influential state senator.
One of the poorest areas in a poor state, Tallulah wanted jobs, and like other struggling cities across the country it saw the nation's prison-building spree as its best hope.
Louisiana needed a new juvenile prison because the number of youths being incarcerated was rising steeply; within a few years it more than doubled. Adding to that, mental health experts say, were hundreds of juveniles who had no place else to go because of cuts in psychiatric services outside of jail. Mental health authorities estimate that 20 percent of juveniles incarcerated nationally have serious mental illnesses.
To help win a no-bid contract to operate a prison, the company Mr. Brown formed included two close friends of Gov. Edwin W. Edwards -- George Fischer and Verdi Adam -- said a businessman involved in the venture's early stages, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
None of the men had any particular qualification to run a prison. Mr. Verdi was a former chief engineer of the state highway department. Mr. Fischer had been the Governor's campaign manager, Cabinet officer and occasional business partner.
Tallulah opened in 1994, and the town of 10,000 got what it hoped for. The prison became its largest employer and taxpayer.
From the beginning, the company formed by Mr. Brown, Trans-American, pursued a strategy of maximizing its profit from the fixed amount it received from the state for each inmate (in 1997, $24,448). The plan was to keep wages and services at a minimum while taking in as many inmates as possible, said the businessman involved in the early stages.
For-profit prisons often try to economize. But the best-run companies have come to recognize that operating with too small or poorly trained a staff can spell trouble, and experts say state officials must pay close attention to the level of services being provided.
"Ultimately, the responsibility belongs to the state," said Charles Thomas, director of the Private Corrections Project at the University of Florida.
Louisiana officials say they monitored conditions at Tallulah and first reported many of the problems there. But in fiscal year 1996-97, according to the State Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Tallulah still listed no money for recreation, treatment or planning inmates' return to society. Twenty-nine percent of the budget went to construction loans.
By comparison, 45 percent of the $32,200 a year that California spends on each juvenile goes to programs and caseworkers, and none to construction. Nationally, construction costs average 7 percent of juvenile prison budgets, Mr. Dunlap said.
"That means either that Tallulah's construction costs are terribly inflated, or the services they are providing are extraordinarily low," he said.
 
The Inside
Hot, Crowded, Spartan, Neglectful
Part of Tallulah is a boot camp, with boys crammed so tightly in barracks that there is room only for double bunks, a television set and a few steel tables. Showers and urinals are open to the room, allowing boys who have been incarcerated for sexual assault to attack other inmates, according to a report in June by a Justice Department consultant, Dr. Bernard Hudson.
The only space for the few books that have recently been imported to try to improve education is a makeshift shelf on top of the urinals. Among the aging volumes that a reporter saw were "Inside the Third Reich," "The Short Stories of Henry James" and "Heidi."
From their wakeup call at 5:30 A.M., the inmates, in white T-shirts and loose green pants, spend almost all their time confined to the barracks. They leave the barracks only for marching drills, one to three hours a day of class and an occasional game of basketball. There is little ventilation, and temperatures in Louisiana's long summers hover permanently in the 90's.
The result, several boys told a visitor, is that some of them deliberately start trouble in order to be disciplined and sent to the other section of Tallulah, maximum-security cells that are air-conditioned.
Guards put inmates in solitary confinement so commonly that in one week in May more than a quarter of all the boys spent at least a day in "lockdown," said Nancy Ray, another Justice Department expert. The average stay in solitary is five to six weeks; some boys are kept indefinitely. While in the tiny cells, the boys are stripped of all possessions and lie on worn, thin mattresses resting on concrete blocks.
The crowding, heat and isolation are hardest on the 25 percent of the boys who are mentally ill or retarded, said Dr. Hudson, a psychiatrist, tending to increase their depression or psychosis.
Although Tallulah has made some improvements in its treatment of the emotionally disturbed over the last year, Dr. Hudson said, it remains "grossly inadequate."
The prison still does not properly screen new arrivals for mental illness or retardation, he reported. The part-time doctor and psychiatrist are there so infrequently that they have never met, Dr. Hudson said. Powerful anti-psychotic medications are not monitored. Medical charts often cannot be found.
And the infirmary is often closed because of a shortage of guards, whose pay is so low -- $5.77 an hour -- that there has been 100 percent turnover in the staff in the last year, the Justice Department experts said.
Other juvenile prisons that have come under investigation have also been criticized for poor psychiatric treatment. But at Tallulah this neglect has been compounded by everyday violence.
All these troubles are illustrated in the case of one former inmate, Travis M., a slight 16-year-old who is mentally retarded and has been treated with drugs for hallucinations.
Sometimes, Travis said in an interview after his release, guards hit him because his medication made him sleepy and he did not stand to attention when ordered. Sometimes they "snuck" him at night as he slept in his bunk, knocking him to the cement floor. Sometimes they kicked him while he was naked in the shower, telling him simply, "You owe me some licks."
Travis was originally sentenced by a judge to 90 days for shoplifting and stealing a bicycle. But every time he failed to stand for a guard or even called his grandmother to complain, officials at Tallulah put him in solitary and added to his sentence.
After 15 months, a judge finally ordered him released so he could get medical treatment. His eardrum had been perforated in a beating by a guard, he had large scars on his arms, legs and face, and his nose had been so badly broken that he speaks in a wheeze. A lawyer is scheduled to file suit against Tallulah on behalf of Travis this week.
One reason these abuses have continued, Mr. Utter said, is that juveniles in Louisiana, as in a number of states, often get poor legal representation. One mentally ill boy from Eunice was sentenced without a lawyer, or even a trial. Poorly paid public defenders seldom visit their clients after sentencing, Mr. Utter said, and so are unaware of conditions at places like Tallulah.
Another reason is that almost all Tallulah's inmates are from poor families and 82 percent are black, Mr. Utter noted, an imbalance that afflicts prisons nationwide to one degree or another. "They are disenfranchised and no one cares about them," he said.
 
The New Guard
A Retreat From Brutality
In September, Tallulah hired as its new warden David Bonnette, a 25-year veteran of Angola State Penitentiary who started there as a guard and rose to assistant superintendent. A muscular, tobacco-chewing man with his initials tattooed on a forearm, Mr. Bonnette brought several Angola colleagues with him to impose better discipline.
"When I got here, there were a lot of perforated eardrums," he said. "Actually, it seemed like everybody had a perforated eardrum, or a broken nose." When boys wrote complaints, he said, guards put the forms in a box and pulled out ones to investigate at random. Some were labeled, "Never to be investigated."
But allegations of abuse by guards dropped to 52 a month this spring, from more than 100 a month last summer, Mr. Bonnette said, as he has tried to carry out a new state policy of zero tolerance for brutality. Fights between boys have declined to 33 a month, from 129, he said.
In June, however, Ms. Ray, the Justice Department consultant, reported that there had been a recent increase in "youth defiance and disobedience," with the boys angry about Tallulah's "exceptionally high" use of isolation cells.
Many guards have also become restive, the Justice Department experts found, a result of poor pay and new restrictions on the use of force.
One guard who said he had quit for those reasons said in an interview: "The inmates are running the asylum now. You're not supposed to touch the kids, but how are we supposed to control them without force?" He has relatives working at Tallulah and so insisted on not being identified.
The frustration boiled over on July 1, during a tour by Senator Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who is drafting legislation that would require psychiatric care for all incarcerated juveniles who need it. Despite intense security, a group of inmates climbed on a roof and shouted their complaints at Senator Wellstone, who was accompanied by Richard Stalder, the secretary of Louisiana's Department of Public Safety and Corrections.
Mr. Stalder said he planned to create a special unit for mentally ill juvenile offenders. One likely candidate to run it, he said, is Trans-American, the company that operates Tallulah.

HEADLINE: Justice Delayed and Derailed

 BODY:
Attorney General Janet Reno is going to report to the Senate Judiciary Committee today, but nothing she says is likely to change one big fact or clear up one lasting mystery. The fact is that even with the Independent Counsel Act, if an Attorney General is determined to protect a sitting President from investigation there is little that Congress or Federal law enforcement agencies can do. The mystery is why any Attorney General would want his or her chief legacy to be the preservation of a cover-up.
Senator Fred Thompson said that was how history is likely to regard the Justice Department's campaign finance inquiry if it stays on its current track. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Thompson was not able to prove Chinese Government meddling in the 1996 Presidential election, but the information remains as disturbing as it was back when the Federal Bureau of Investigation first warned members of Congress about the alleged Chinese plan. Johnny Chung, the accused bag man who had such good entree to the Oval Office, may have been the connection between the Chinese military and Democratic fund-raisers, but Justice Department spin is that we may never know. 
 Such possibilities make most prosecutors curious. They make the nation's top prosecutor militantly lethargic. Janet Reno has rejected the obviously correct advice of Louis Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, that she appoint an independent counsel, since her boss, the President, was at the center of the most reckless fund-raising effort since Watergate. The fact that even her tightly controlled inquiry has already produced the indictment of 11 Democratic figures argues for appointment of an independent prosecutor willing to follow the trail into a White House where, according to a recent indictment, a wealthy Asian businessman like Dhanin Chearvanont was able to discuss economic issues with Mr. Clinton and Don Fowler, then the Democratic Party chairman.
Instead of lashing her department to produce the truth, Ms. Reno has steadily reinforced its balkiest instincts. For months in 1996, the inquiry languished under inexperienced leadership. Charles Labella, who arrived in October 1997 to fix things, is about to decamp to California, abandoning his unfinished duty to David Vicinanzo, a deputy United States Attorney from New Hampshire. Maybe Ms. Reno learned something during all those years she lived by the sea in Miami. If you want to prevent a ship from reaching its destination, just keep changing the navigators.
We are pleased that Mr. Freeh has delayed a transfer for James Desarno, the senior F.B.I. investigator on the case. Mr. Freeh continues to tell members of Congress that he thinks an independent counsel is necessary. We would like to see him make more forceful and persistent public statements. The worst that could happen would be that Ms. Reno or the President would fire him. In this Administration, it would be refreshing to see someone dismissed for zealous curiosity about how Mr. Clinton raised the money that got him re-elected.

HEADLINE: Fund-Raising For Pataki Has Surpassed '94 Campaign

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has collected $15.5 million for his re-election effort, surpassing his total for the entire 1994 campaign and apparently far outpacing his Democratic rivals.
Mr. Pataki took in $4.3 million in the first half of the year alone, according to figures released by his campaign last night. If he continues harvesting money at this rate, he is likely to rank as one of the most successful fund-raisers in the history of state politics. Four years ago, when he was an Republican state senator, Mr. Pataki collected more than $14.5 million in his defeat of Mario M. Cuomo, who raised more than $11 million. 
 Mr. Pataki has $12.2 million on hand, after spending $3.3 million in the first half of the year, mostly for television and radio advertising and fund-raising events, according to a summary of his disclosure report.
Details on contributors to the Governor's campaign will not be available until today, when the full report is to be filed with state election authorities.
The campaigns of the four Democratic contenders did not release figures yesterday but are expected to today. In their last disclosure in January, the Democrats reported having far less money than Mr. Pataki, who has hewed to a strategy of raising money aggressively throughout his term in order to avoid having to do so in the final weeks of his re-election campaign.
The two Democrats with the biggest bank accounts as of January were Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, both of whom had raised more than $2 million. The vast majority of Ms. McCaughey Ross's money came in a single contribution from her husband, the financier Wilbur L. Ross Jr.
Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, did not respond to phone messages last night. But she has said in the past that he has excelled at fund-raising because people are pleased with his policies on issues like crime, welfare and the economy.
Democrats have contended that the Governor's fund-raising is unseemly, pointing out that much of the money is from donors with interests before the state government.
Besides his own campaign money, the Governor can also rely on the financial support of the New York Republican State Committee, which has been collecting record sums since Mr. Pataki took office in 1995.

Appellate Court Says Lilco Was Overtaxed

DATELINE: MINEOLA

 BODY:
A state appellate court has upheld a lower-court ruling awarding the former Long Island Lighting Company $1.2 billion in tax refunds for overassessment of its Shoreham nuclear power plant.
In a ruling released in Brooklyn yesterday, the Second Judicial Department of the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court concluded that the evidence presented by Lilco was sufficient to prove that local taxing authorities had overvalued Shoreham, especially from 1988 to 1992, when the plant, after facing intense local opposition, failed to achieve commercial operation and became economically obsolete. 
 The appeal was filed by the Town of Brookhaven, the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District and Suffolk County, all of which overtaxed Lilco, according to a ruling on Nov. 7, 1996 by Justice Thomas M. Stark of State Supreme Court. Because the plant and other assets of Lilco were taken over by the Long Island Power Authority last fall, LIPA will receive the benefit of the appellate ruling.
A formula to ease the impact of the overassessment from 1984 through 1992 was included in a plan that Gov. George E. Pataki announced on March 19, 1997, enabling the partial state takeover of Lilco. The $1.2 billion overassessment was reduced to $625 million, to be covered by a state bond issue financed by a surcharge billed to Suffolk electric customers.

HEADLINE: GAME THEORY;
In Fantasy Game, Real Cash for Virtual Cards

BYLINE: By J. C. Herz; E-mail address: Herz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN the history of paper, playing cards predate the widespread use of printed currency. So it is with the Internet, where a fantasy card game called Sanctum is incubating a myth-inflected form of electronic commerce.
Developed by Digital Addiction, a software company based in Maryland, Sanctum is a two-player strategy game. The object is to capture the other guy's fortress by marching your minions across a board and casting tactical spells. Each turn, the opponents cast fresh spells and draw new virtual cards from their respective decks. Based on the cards in hand, a player might decide to summon an army of zombies or cast a cannibalism spell (one of the enemy's minions starts eating the others) or a complacency spell (enemy minions stop following orders) or weaken the opponents' defenses ("Armor to Meat? Body Rot? Decisions, decisions. . . .") or heal the player's own fallen soldiers. It's a combination of hearts, gin rummy and chess, dressed up in chain mail with supernatural powers. 
 In this respect, Sanctum is not unlike Magic: The Gathering, a paper-based collectible-card game that has become a global phenomenon. Wizards of the Coast, which publishes the game, started selling Magic cards in 1993. The first 10 million cards, sold in $9 starter packs of 60 and $3 booster packs of 15, flew off the shelves in six weeks. Since then, more than two billion Magic cards have been sold, in nine languages, to an audience of millions. New cards are continually released. Old ones are periodically phased out, giving them instant status as collectibles to be bought, sold and traded in hobby stores and on the Internet.
Basically, Sanctum is an on-line version of Magic. Instead of sitting across a table, you log onto a Web site (www.digitaladdiction.com), download the game free, register as a player, find an opponent in the chat room and go at it. The game comes with a starter pack of 60 cards, which is adequate for beginners. If you want more -- there are 250 digital spells in all -- you have to buy them. A pack of 15 costs $1 to $3, depending on how many you buy. The transaction takes place via credit card on a secure area of the site, and the cards are registered to your account.
As with any system of trading cards, there are common cards (garden-variety bread-and-butter spells), uncommon cards (more idiosyncratic sorts of magic) and rare cards (highly specialized, highly sought, one per pack). The more cards you buy, the more tactics you have at your disposal and the greater your chances of adding something really exotic to your necromantic arsenal.
Essentially, Digital Addiction is giving away Sanctum and then selling ways to extend and enhance it -- tools that give the player a competitive advantage and a more complex experience. These digital objects are useful and scarce and therefore valuable. (Stored on site, they can't be copied off line.) You can play with them. You can ante them. And you can trade them.
That is where it gets really interesting. Because in this game space, which is also a marketplace, people are trading virtual objects that are worth real money. Inevitably, new cards will be introduced, and old ones will be phased out. Anyone who has seen Beanie Babies blossom into an on-line commodity knows that collectibles need no inherent value to fetch ever-increasing prices. Early Magic cards -- five-year-old pieces of paper -- are worth hundreds of dollars each. And thanks to the Internet, they are fairly easy to unload.
Except with Sanctum, the commodities are virtual to begin with. They don't need to be appraised. There are no transportation hassles. There are no transaction costs. On the Sanctum site, cards are the only medium of exchange. "But if people want to promise each other money off the server and trade cards inside," said James Harvey, chief executive of Digital Addiction, "that's none of our business." Already, third parties have struck deals with the company to set up digital storefronts to buy and resell cards from players for cash, although it is far from clear that strategy game fans used to trading directly on the Internet will bother dealing with middlemen.
Collectible trading-card games are an ideal test bed for this sort of virtual economy for two reasons. The first is that the people who play games like Magic are highly wired, and they are fanatic about their games. They're "M.I.T. students," Mr. Harvey said. "Computer geeks. Wall Street geeks. People in their 20's spend most of the money. They earn $45,000, single, no kids, no mortgage, and they spend the lion's share of their techie salaries on entertainment." If there was ever an audience that could support an on-line market for virtual toys, this group is it.
The second reason is that cards, unlike other sorts of collectibles, are low-touch items. Their value is not based on their material characteristics -- their tactile appeal or patina or even their visual quality. They are not generally fondled or displayed. They are kept in binders and boxes. The value of a given card is based on how many were produced, when it was discontinued and what that card refers to -- the career of a sports star, for example. But none of these factors have anything to do with the physical object. The card is just a placeholder. The most important things about it are the fact that you own it and the information printed on it. In a sense, trading cards are already virtual.
And collectible-card games are even more so because each card refers to an act, rather than to an object. The image on the card doesn't represent a star baseman. It represents the right to take some kind of action -- to cast a spell -- at a given time in a given context. It's not a noun. It's a verb. It's like a dollar bill, which represents the right to buy a cup of coffee at the convenience store.
Currency is, after all, just another kind of playing card.

It's Time to Shrink The Big Software Box

BYLINE: By Phil Patton 

 BODY:
AMERICANS are used to big boxes packed with cereal or cookies, but mostly with air. But it's a surprise to see the same packaging strategy from the computer industry, which constantly boasts of miracles of compression -- of laptops seven-tenths of an inch thin, multiple megabytes squeezed onto tiny disks and digital assistants the size of a Saltine.
So why does a program like Windows 98 (about $90), recorded on a single CD-ROM, arrive wrapped in a box that measures 8 inches by 10 inches by 2 inches and include a manual, a clutch of coupons and a cardboard stiffener folded with origami cleverness? 
 The standard big software box is designed to let vendors build a bright wall of product to attract customers. Peter Janssen, former vice president of merchandising of Egghead Software, advises software companies "to use the package as your ad." The big box also discourages shoplifting and, packagers say, protects the disk from damage during shipping.
But John Ruston, an economic analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund, who led efforts against McDonald's clamshell hamburger package, says, "Generally, most software is egregiously overpackaged." Software packages, Mr. Ruston notes, use virgin paper instead of recycled. The fat manuals are often redundant, since the information is already on the disk. So why do the packages continue to be so big?
Mr. Ruston attributes the persistence of wasteful software packaging to industry inertia. "This is the old outdated mentality of giving the customer value by providing a lot of stuff," Mr. Ruston says.
It's the "lot of stuff" that's the problem. One day not long ago, I heard a rumble behind my desk and realized that the Shaq-high stack of software boxes had toppled over. So much cardboard, so much air. What for? Haven't we been here before?
And not just with the McDonald's clamshell. Eight years ago, an organization called Ban the Box challenged the notion of the so-called long box, the 6-by-12-inch package that was devised to hold music CD's, which were then replacing albums. Peter Gabriel, Bonnie Raitt and U2 refused to have their music distributed in long boxes. As with computer disks, the complaint was that there was too much material surrounding the small kernel of product. Eventually, the long box was phased out. Today, the jewel box shelters CD's, electronically tagged against shoplifting.
Thinking of the victory over the CD long box, New York Assemblywoman Susan John sent a letter two years ago to Bill Gates, requesting that Microsoft provide leadership in reducing software overpackaging. She pointed out that reduction would be both environmentally sound and would save Microsoft money. She never received a response.
Package designers at Microsoft claim, however, that their packages are getting smaller as their manuals get smaller. (The one valid excuse for bigger packages -- the multiple disks that used to be required for some programs -- is no longer valid; today, it is rare for a program to require several disks.)
Heidi Rothauser, a Microsoft spokeswoman, says that existing packaging is still needed for security and protection of the disks. But she said, "We are working to reduce the size of packaging where possible." And there is some progress: the company has abandoned the interior jewel case that holds the disk itself for programs like Windows 98.
Still, that's not enough. The New York Times asked Tibor Kalman of M & Company, a design firm, to create a dummy package for Microsoft Word, to show how it could be done. His alternative: a cardboard slipcase with a much smaller manual and standard CD-ROM inside. The big software packages, he says, are like the humongous portions of pasta some restaurants serve. "It shows a disrespect for the intelligence of the audience," he said.
Getting rid of the software big box may require the same strategy that defeated the CD long box: software hotshots, like the rock stars, could refuse to have their Mega-Destructacon game released in anything but a smaller, less-wasteful box.

Curtain Call
They're at it again: John Kander and Fred Ebb, who gave the theater musicals like "Cabaret" and "Chicago." Now comes word that their new musical, "Over and Over," with book by Joseph Stein ("Fiddler on the Roof," et al.), is to have its world premiere on Jan. 6, 1999, at the Signature Theater in Arlington, Va. The show, to run through Feb. 14, is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Thornton Wilder play, "The Skin of Our Teeth," about the Antrobus family and their maid as they survive floods, war, the ice age and the double feature. Eric D. Schaeffer, artistic director of the Signature, will direct.
 
 Money Machine
 Just as Broadway pumps millions of dollars into New York City's economy, so does London's West End theater nourish Britain's. According to the Wyndham Report, just published and said to be the first study of the scale of the theater industry, the total impact of West End productions in 1997 amounted to about $1.76 billion. The report said 41,000 jobs depend on West End theater; theatergoers spent $410 million on tickets for 11.5 million seats and $710 million on restaurants, hotels, transportation and merchandise. The theater, a major tourist attraction, contributed some $369 million to Britain's balance of trade. P.S.: The report calls London Theater Capital of the World, with more shows and bigger audiences than anywhere else, including Broadway.
 
Family Jewels
 Tiffany & Company, celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Louis Comfort Tiffany, has opened an exhibition of the jewelry he designed for the 160-year-old firm founded by his father, Charles Lewis Tiffany. Situated on the second floor of the store at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street through Aug. 29 and titled "The Jewelry of Louis Comfort Tiffany: Explorations of Color, Nature and the Exotic," the display of 34 objects, including a pink sapphire brooch, a green tourmaline-and-pearl necklace and an Australian black-opal brooch, explores the artisan's love of color, his fascination with exotic culture and his inspiration from nature.
 
Journey's End
 In ceremonies yesterday at the Turkish Embassy in London, Britain returned to Turkey seven ancient sculptures from a Scottish steamer bound for Amsterdam that sank in 200 feet of water after a collision in the English Channel in 1894. The Castor Marbles, named for the ship, are second-century works that include a figure of Venus, a bust and five funeral monuments. The marbles have been valued at $40,000 but are considered of priceless significance to archeologists. They were taken illegally from Smyrna, now Izmir, by the Dutch Vice Consul Alfred van Lennep, who acquired many treasures for European museums. The marbles were retrieved from the Castor in 1994 by a team of divers.

HEADLINE: Records And CD's? How Quaint;
Digital Distribution Of Music Is Spreading

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
The sound that could transform the music business is the quiet click of a computer mouse.
Right now, anyone with a mid-level computer and an Internet connection can hear music in a multitude of forms, from radiolike Webcasts to snippets of songs. Many of those forms are ephemeral and in low fidelity, intended primarily for promotion. But it is also possible to download, free or for a price, high-fidelity songs and full-length albums that can join a permanent collection. There's no need to visit a store or wait for mail order; in fact, there's no need ever to handle a compact disk. David Bowie, Tori Amos, Duran Duran and other well-known groups have released songs through the Internet. 
 For those who have been sending and receiving music via the Internet, digital distribution is a harbinger of a future when recorded music has been freed entirely from physical form. Sold or disseminated as strings of 1's and 0's rather than disks, music joins the worldwide flow of digital information.
For enthusiasts, digital distribution presents utopian possibilities. Freed of the costs of manufacturing and distributing CD's, digitally distributed music could be cheaper for consumers and more profitable for musicians. Music could be geared to more specialized audiences that may be small but widely scattered; a fan in Helsinki could download tunes from a band in Jakarta.
More radical changes have also been predicted by some industry figures. The possibilities include drastically lower prices for recorded music by all but a commercial elite; other performers might simply give away songs to promote albums or sell concert tickets. Musicians could release music in small or large doses as they see fit, dealing one more blow to the album as pop's standard artistic unit. Stores could see their role reduced as digital distribution allows consumers to skip middlemen. Eventually, home music collections could become obsolete, as recorded music becomes available from central archives on demand.
To travel the Internet, music must be turned into a digital sound file that can be played through a computer. Electronic, or digital, distribution of music is still the province of a small but significant group of computer users. At least five million software "players" in one music format, MP3, have been downloaded, and MP3 is part of the Netshow multimedia package on Windows 98; 3.5 million players in another format, Liquid Audio, have also been installed.
Because high-fidelity music involves large amounts of digital information -- a music CD holds 650 megabytes -- transferring music over the Internet is slow for most computer users; one song can take a half-hour to download on a typical modem. Noting the technical obstacles, Jupiter Media, an on-line market research firm, has predicted that in five years the market for digitally downloaded music will be about $30 million, a minuscule percentage of the $12 billion recorded-music market.
"But we still think it's something that labels should aggressively pursue," said Mark Mooradian, group director of consumer content for Jupiter Media. He said digital distribution could be important for its marketing value, to combat piracy and to reposition labels as retail outlets.
Already, students and others with access to high-speed transmission lines have been sending around enough music to alarm the recording business.
Electronic distribution is a major topic on the agenda at Plug In '98, a conference on music in the digital era, organized by Jupiter Media; Andrew Rasiej, founder of Irving Plaza, and Michael Dorf, owner of the Knitting Factory, that is taking place alongside the Intel New York Music Festival through Saturday.
"You can't keep your head in the sand forever," said Thomas Dolby Robertson, who made new-wave hits in the 1980's and now runs Headspace, a company that adds soundtracks to Web sites.
In 1996, Mr. Bowie offered a single, "Telling Lies," as a file that could be downloaded free; even though it took up to 45 minutes to transfer the five-minute song, 300,000 people downloaded it. But that was a give away from an internationally known star. Getting paid for downloaded music has been more difficult, in part because of the inconvenience of the process and in part because few well-known performers have made it available.
But the advent of faster home Internet connections, including cable modems now being tested that can transfer computer data at rates comparable to the video and sound signals of cable television, music could be downloaded in seconds rather than minutes. And on college campuses, and some in high schools, with fast T-1 lines (special digital telephone connections to the Internet) students are already trading and copying music.
"If you take a look at any dorm at Stanford," said David Weekly, an incoming junior majoring in computer science at Stanford University, "people are listening more to MP3's than to radio."
Independent labels and individual musicians see digital distribution as a way to deliver music directly to listeners. "Record companies have a lock right now on how an artist can get music out to a global audience," said Larry Rosen, the chairman of N2K, which owns the on-line retail site Music Boulevard as well as its own N2K label, which makes some of its songs available for digital downloading. "With electronic distribution of music, there's a break in that kind of power structure."
Digital distribution allows musicians to make their newest work available instantly worldwide. The Jesus and Mary Chain, the English band scheduled to perform last night at Irving Plaza as part of the Intel New York Music Festival, planned to record their set and place a live song on the festival's Internet site (www.intelfest.com) 15 minutes after leaving the stage. The song was also to be available today at Tower Records in Manhattan, transferred to a recordable CD and given as a bonus with the Jesus and Mary Chain's current album.
Mr. Rasiej and Mr. Dorf organized the music festival and have set out to create the Digital Club Network, which would place cameras and recorders in clubs around the world. Performances could be cybercast live or maintained as archives, with royalties going to clubs and performers. "The amount of money is insignificant today, but we're building a new content source," Mr. Rasiej said. "You could create a chat room, collect your old friends from college and watch and participate in a concert. You might not be able to slam dance against one another, though."
Twin-Tone Records, the independent label that introduced the Replacements and Husker Du to rock fans in the 1980's, has announced that it will sell all its new releases through the Internet, preferably through downloading, and will stop manufacturing new CD's in bulk; downloading a song will cost $1.50, with albums at $10.
 
A Music Market That's Evolving
 "The retail market isn't what it used to be," said Paul Stark, the president and co-founder of Twin-Tone Records. "The number of releases has gone from 3,000 to 25,000 or 30,000, all competing for the same shelf space."
"If I wholesale a CD for $10, I'll only see about $3 of that after mailing, returns and advertising," Mr. Stark explained. "It costs me about $1 to manufacture the CD and the group gets $2 in royalties, which leaves me about 10 or 15 cents. On the Internet, with no manufacturing or distributing costs, I can cut my sales to a quarter of what they were and still come out ahead. The economic model of the recording industry is changing very quickly, and the Internet is the only future we have."
Marc Geiger, the founder of Artist Direct, a company that offers some downloadable music through the Ultimate Band List Web site, said: "You might be able to lease music for a certain amount of listenings, like a jukebox. You might pay a different amount to own it for an unlimited number of listenings. Or you might have an arrangement like cable television, where you pay $29.95 to an aggregater and listen to most of the music you want for a month."
Stores won't be directly threatened by digital distribution for some time. Still, the prospect of consumers getting music delivered instantly at home, without visiting a store, is not a happy prospect for them.
"Part of me is scared because we don't own any content," said Mike Farrace, vice president for publishing at Tower Records. "We are not intellectual property holders; we are brokers and agents and aggregaters. But I don't see digital distribution taking over. I can see it becoming a component, absolutely no doubt about it. The art for us is, How do we incorporate this into the business?"
When Capitol Records announced that it would sell a Duran Duran single, "Electric Barbarella," over the Internet, retailers protested, worrying that they were being bypassed. The song was made available simultaneously at stores and as a digital download, with one remix available only from the Internet. "We expect to have digital distribution be a piece of the pie, not to cause retail to disappear," said Liz Heller, executive vice president for Capitol Records.
Major labels, which own manufacturing plants, warehouses and trucks and invest heavily to shape the careers of musicians, are wary of digital distribution. As with all new technologies for transferring and copying music, they see the possibility of widespread piracy.
"The upside of digital distribution is the huge market that you have access to, which you can market and promote to in different ways," said Frank Creighton, senior vice president and director of investigations for the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade association that represents the larger recording companies.
When it comes to electronic distribution, he said, the labels are "moving with some trepidation in light of the fact that currently the majority of uses of distributed sound files are unauthorized. Right now, there is no set standard as to how these sound files are going to be distributed, protected and controlled."
There are three main technologies for digital distribution of music: Liquid Audio, AT&T's a2b and MP3. Liquid Audio and a2b are favored by companies that are worried about unauthorized copying. In both the music is encrypted so that it can be played back only by an authorized user and it is watermarked so that its source can be traced; every download is registered, and royalties can be deducted. Liquid Audio allows a buyer to copy the music once onto a recordable CD; a2b does not.
Scott Burnett, the vice president of marketing for Liquid Audio, said that there are about 10,000 songs available on the Internet in the Liquid Audio format, and that the company will soon establish the Liquid Music Network, a widely linked Web site that will hold 100,000 songs from independent labels including Rykodisc, Rounder and Platinum Entertainment, for $1.50 to $2 a song.
N2K, which sells CD's and tapes through mail order on-line as Music Boulevard, offers songs from its N2K label in a format it calls e-mod, using Liquid Audio; Twin-Tone also uses Liquid Audio. In the year that N2K's system has been in operation, fewer than 10,000 people have downloaded the songs for 99 cents each, said Mr. Rosen on N2K. But the available songs have been by little-known musicians. N2K has just signed David Stewart, formerly of the Eurythmics; he plans to release his next album in downloadable form on the Internet before it appears in stores.

Extensive Traffic On the Internet
Meanwhile, MP3, which is short for MPEG Audio Layer 3, can create endless generations of digital copies once a piece of music has been encoded as an MP3 file. Portable MP3 players, separate from home computers, are being manufactured. And MP3 files can be created from any piece of recorded music through encoders, called rippers, that are downloadable from many Web sites. The combination has led to an extensive Internet traffic in MP3 songs.
The recording-industry association considers any unlicensed copying to be piracy. It recently tracked down someone selling the entire recorded works of the Beatles, compressed into MP3 files on a single CD-ROM disk, and it has been working to shut down Internet sites offering large numbers of songs as MP3 files.
A new company, Goodnoise, plans to sell songs as MP3 files for 99 cents each. "Fans don't have access to legitimate content on MP3," said Gene Hoffman, the president and chief executive of Goodnoise. "MP3 is never going to go away, the technology is there and available, and you might as well make it easier to buy it than to steal."
But in most MP3 uses, no money changes hands. In 1996, Mr. Weekly used Stanford's computer to offer about 200 songs as MP3 files. "I put it up, told a few people about it and it just exploded," he said. "We were not pirates, we were certainly not making money from this; we just thought it was a great technology."
The site was on-line for a week and a half before record-company representatives called Stanford and had it shut down. "On the last day," Mr. Weekly said, "Stanford network services told me that 80 percent of outgoing bandwidth was my music. It shows that Internet music wants to happen, in whatever form, and there are people out there who are ready for it."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Telephone privatization tests economic will of Puerto Rico.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
TO most Americans, the idea of a government-owned telephone system is no doubt as alien, say, as driving on the left side of the road. But to Puerto Ricans the proposed privatization of the state-run telephone company is a fighting issue, with a majority apparently preferring Big Brother to big business. "We're children of the New Deal," explained Marcos Rodriguez-Ema, the president of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico.
More is at stake here than political symbolism, or even the efficiency of the telephone system. Puerto Rico is under enormous pressure to hew more closely to the capitalist road, in part because it is losing special tax breaks and welfare subsidies from Washington, and, in part because no island can remain an island in the increasingly integrated global economy. 
 "It's not a matter of whether the Puerto Rican economy will change, but how and when," said Jose Berrocal, a director of BT Wolfensohn.
The Puerto Rico Telephone Company uses modern digital switching equipment and, it is widely agreed, provides good service.
 But it isn't particularly efficient. The company operated 204 lines per employee in 1996, compared with more than 300 at Bell Atlantic. The return on capital is far below that of mainland providers. And ominously, it has rapidly lost share in cellular phones, the fastest-growing part of the business.
So when Congress opened local and intra-island telephone service to competition in 1996, Puerto Rico's Government decided to auction it off. "Our primary concern is that the managers of the Government enterprise didn't have the vision for a deregulated market," Mr. Rodriguez-Ema said.
The agreement to sell the system to the GTE Corporation for $1.85 billion (challenged at the 11th hour by another bidder, Spain's Telefonica Internacional) led to a strike by the telephone workers' unions. Last week, the strike made headlines nationwide when 50 other Puerto Rican unions staged a two-day sympathy walkout that shut the airport in San Juan, along with major shopping centers. And polls show that the strikers enjoy considerable support in their opposition to the sale of the "national patrimony."
(According to news reports, one of the two telephone unions will vote today on ending the strike, though both still oppose privatization.)
"This is a protest against a style of government," argued Heidie Calero, an economic consultant in San Juan who favors privatization but objects to the Government's "high handed" manner in decreeing the sale without bothering to explain the necessity.
The Government of Puerto Rico is apparently holding fast to the decision to sell the phone company -- though the unspecified bid from Telefonica does put in doubt who will end up with the prize. And whoever does buy it will likely go partway to relieve the union's anxiety about job security. "The buyers will need labor peace, and they know it," Mr. Rodriguez-Ema acknowledged.
The more formidable challenge, illustrated by the resistance to telephone privatization, is to shake the economy out of its dependence on government. While the island's gross domestic product per capita is one-third that of the mainland, transfers through Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and a variety of other social programs keep living standards within hailing distance. Indeed, a combination of the social safety net, the application of the national minimum wage and Federal tax breaks for manufacturing keep competitive wages quite high.
Therein lies a rub. High wages make it difficult for Puerto Rico to compete with the rest of the Caribbean in both tourism and labor-intensive products. Unemployment, now at 14 percent, topped 20 percent for much of the 1980's. Yet the tax breaks, which led to the development of a huge pharmaceutical and electronics manufacturing sector -- not to mention the creation of tens of thousands of white-collar jobs -- will be phased out over the next six years.
Mr. Rodriguez-Ema plays down the impact of losing these so-called Section 936 benefits, which the current, statehood-minded administration of Puerto Rico viewed as a crutch. "The pharmaceutical makers are hiring, not firing," he pointed out.
Indeed, it is hard to look at economic trends and come up an unalloyed pessimist. Total employment, below 700,000 as recently as 1985, now hovers around a million. Per capita income is close to $8,000 and has been growing more rapidly than on the mainland for several generations.
But in Mr. Berrocal's view, Puerto Rico is at a crossroads. The welfare state, he acknowledges, has provided good jobs for a minority and an adequate living standard for the majority. But it has also robbed the island of the opportunity to break out economically. And it has created vested interests with a great deal to lose from change.
The world is not standing still, though, and the repeal of Section 936 suggests that Congress isn't either. "We've just got to declare it isn't going to be business as usual," Mr. Berrocal concluded.

It's Official: '60 Minutes' Gets Double

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., July 15

 BODY:
CBS made it official today: "60 Minutes," the oldest and most successful news program in the history of television, will expand to a second edition early next year.
The new program, to be called "60 Minutes II," will include many elements of the original, including some appearances by its roster of veteran correspondents and the familiar opening of a ticking stopwatch, while introducing a new lineup of reporters. 
 The decision comes after a long, behind-the-scenes debate over whether a new "60 Minutes" would dilute the appeal of the original by spreading its brand too widely. Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, said the new program was intended to be "not a clone, but a respectful offspring" of the original.
The chief connection between the new edition and the original will be updated segments of what CBS is calling "classic" reports from the original show, presented by the cast of the Sunday night "60 Minutes." They may also appear in follow-up segments on the second edition if something reported on Sunday needs updating.
No new correspondents were named yesterday, but the executive producer will be Jeff Fager, currently the executive producer of the "Evening News With Dan Rather," who previously spent six years as a producer on "60 Minutes." Mr. Fager was called the crucial piece in building the new program by several CBS News executives, including Mr. Rather, who said, "I don't think there could be a '60 Minutes II' without Jeff and the credentials he brings to the table."
He will be replaced at the evening news by Al Ortiz, the chief of CBS's Washington bureau.
Mr. Fager said yesterday that he hoped to have the show on the air by mid-January. "One of the great advantages I have is that I don't need to go around looking for new music or building a new set."
The look of the new show will be very much the same as the original, Mr. Fager said, as will the style of reporting. There will be no anchor, he said, just a lineup of correspondents, as on the original "60 Minutes."
The other crucial player in the development of the new program is Don Hewitt, the creator and executive producer of "60 Minutes" for the last 30 years. Mr. Hewitt will serve as a consultant on the new edition, CBS announced.
The role of Mr. Hewitt and the correspondents long associated with the show like Mike Wallace, Morley Safer and Ed Bradley, had been one of the sticking points in what became a long negotiation over the second edition. Mr. Hewitt had said that he had been asked numerous times over the years to expand what has been the CBS network's most valuable franchise, but he always resisted, seeking to protect the almost hallowed status of the original.
In addition, the correspondents had expressed their own reservations about the potential risk to the reputation of the original. But CBS's management pushed the expansion to take advantage of the "60 Minutes" name. News magazines are some of the most dependable profit centers for networks, which are under increasing economic pressure because of a dearth of new hits and escalating costs for entertainment programs produced by Hollywood studios.
Mr. Hewitt, who declined to comment, said in a statement released by CBS: "I think that under Jeff Fager, '60 Minutes II' is a natural to be the second-best broadcast of its kind on television. Inasmuch as I can help, without shortchanging the first- best broadcast of its kind on television, I'm hoping to do that."
Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS and the man responsible for the network's prime-time schedule, had long made clear his enthusiasm for a second edition of the most reliable ratings getter on CBS. "This is very important for us," he said. "If you just look at the summer, '60 Minutes' has been the top-rated show in television three of the last four weeks."
He added that the new edition would likely be scheduled on a weeknight at either 9 or 10 P.M. and might be pitted against an existing news magazine on another network "just because it's so hard to avoid them."
Mr. Heyward declined to speculate on which correspondents might be under consideration for "60 Minutes II" but said of two part-time contributors to the original program, Christiane Amanpour and Bob Simon, "We're looking for experienced broadcasters with superb talent and those are certainly people with those qualifications."

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Reports Small Rise in Profits

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., July 15

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said today that earnings increased only 2.5 percent in the second quarter, less than expected, as weaker Asian sales and higher costs offset strong demand in the United States. The company's shares fell 7 percent.
Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of construction equipment, said net income rose to $446 million, or $1.20 a diluted share, from $435 million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier. 
 Analysts had expected earnings of $1.24 a share, and Caterpillar's stock declined $4.25, to $52, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Revenue climbed 15 percent, to $5.60 billion from $4.87 billion.
The economic turmoil in Asia has slowed economic growth in the United States. That slowdown, in turn, has kept down American interest rates, bolstering construction spending.
Still, Caterpillar's operating profit as a percentage of sales slipped to 12.4 percent from 13 percent because of what it said were higher fixed costs, lower productivity and the unfavorable effect of a strong dollar.
Caterpillar reiterated its forecast that 1998 profit will be near 1997's record level.
Higher spending in the latest quarter held down the full benefits from higher sales and revenue, though per-share earnings were helped by the company's stock buyback program.

HEADLINE: Businesses Register an Inventory Decline

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Inventories of unsold merchandise at businesses shrank in May for the first time in almost two years as free-spending consumers swept goods off retailers' shelves.
Total business inventories fell one-tenth of a percent in May, after rising one-tenth of a percent in April, the Commerce Department said today. Retail inventories alone, which account for about a third of all stocks on hand, fell 1 percent in May as retail sales surged. 
 While goods were added to inventories at a slower pace in the second quarter -- suppressing economic growth for those months -- it set the stage for a rebound later this year if retailers increase orders to factories for merchandise, analysts said.
"Consumers are going to continue to demand and purchase goods as prices continue to decline," said Richard Yamarone, a senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. "The shelves need to be restocked because inventories are being depleted and consumers continue to buy."
Prices are also staying at consumer-friendly levels. A separate report by the Labor Department showed prices for imported goods fell five-tenths of a percent in June, the eighth consecutive monthly decline.
Inventory building bolstered the economy in the first quarter, as businesses added to their stocks at a record annual pace of $105.7 billion. The result was a 5.4 percent annual growth rate in gross domestic product during the quarter.
As those inventories were drawn down in the second quarter, the G.D.P. growth rate probably fell.

HEADLINE: A Number of Banks Report Strong Profits in 2d Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 15

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation and several other large banks met or beat second-quarter earnings expectations as they generated higher fees from consumers and corporations.
Earnings at BankAmerica, the fifth-largest bank, rose 11.4 percent, and Fleet Financial Group Inc., the 10th-largest bank, said its net income increased 13 percent. 
 "They're strong," said Anthony Gray, chairman and chief investment officer of STI Capital Management in Orlando, Fla., which oversees $14 billion. "And they should be for the next couple of quarters" because of a robust United States economy, he said.
Gains from mortgages and credit cards, and profits from investment banking and asset-management units outpaced flat or declining net interest revenue.
The San Francisco-based BankAmerica, said profit in the second quarter rose on higher fee income from investment banking and other businesses. BankAmerica, which is being acquired by the Nationsbank Corporation for $65 billion, said net income was $890 million, or $1.24 a share, including several one-time gains and losses.
Fleet's second-quarter earnings rose as new brokerage and investment businesses thrived. The Boston-based bank said net income rose to $393 million, or $1.29 a diluted share, from $347 million, or $1.17, a year earlier. The results beat estimates of $1.26 a share.
Fleet's purchases of the brokerage firm Quick & Reilly and the Advanta Corporation's credit card unit pushed noninterest income up 35 percent, even as net interest income gained 5 percent.
U.S. Bancorp, the country's 17th-largest bank, with assets of $73.8 billion, said second-quarter earnings rose as the bank generated more fees from investment and trust services. The Minneapolis-based bank said net income, including one-time items in both periods, rose 5.5 percent, to $320.6 million, or 43 cents a diluted share.
The Wachovia Corporation, which has $63.9 billion in total assets, said its operating earnings rose 17 percent, led by gains in fees from capital markets and mortgage services.
The bank, which is based in Winston-Salem, N.C., said net income rose 6.7 percent, to $209.9 million, or $1 a diluted share, from $196.8 million, or 98 cents.
Republic, with $56.4 billion in assets, said second-quarter earnings rose 7.5 percent on foreign exchange and equity gains. The New York bank said net income rose to $118.8 million, or $1.05 a diluted share, from $110.5 million, or 98 cents a share.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Stepping out a bit from Coke's shadow, a big bottler is basking in its own spotlight these days.

BYLINE: By Constance L. Hays 

 BODY:
COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES INC., the bottling company that is ever the bridesmaid to the giant Coca-Cola Company, is getting a turn in the spotlight after all.
While the Asian economic crisis deepens, stock in the bottler provides a brand name that investors trust without the added exposure to Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and other countries whose bubbles have burst. 
 Foreign sales account for 80 percent of Coca-Cola's total business, and the company's profits have been crimped slightly as falling currencies reduce the value of those sales.
Meanwhile, sales in the United States are skipping along, with growth of about 10 percent annually, impressive for a mature market in which Coke products are already consumed at the rate of slightly more than one eight-ounce serving a day for each man, woman and child.
And Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler in the Coke system, accounts for 65 percent of Coke's domestic sales volume. The bottler also handles Dr Pepper, the No. 6 soft drink in the United States, and gets about 32 percent of its business from Western Europe and Canada. The last 18 months, it has been on an acquisition binge, snapping up Coca-Cola Bottling of New York, Coca-Cola Bottling of Canada and Coca-Cola Southwest, as well as a $2 billion British bottler. Last month, it announced plans to acquire Great Plains Bottlers and Canners Inc., a Midwest bottler that handles Dr Pepper and Coke products.
Margaret F. Carton, director of investor relations for Coca-Cola Enterprises, says that even without the acquisitions, the company will meet its goal of 10 percent growth in 1998.
All this leads to new-found respect in an industry in which the bottlers, clinking angrily under their breath, have long had to take a back seat to the soft-drink companies.
A year ago, shares in Coke Enterprises were trading at $21, up from a split-adjusted offering price of $5.50 in 1986. In April, the share price popped through the $40 barrier for the first time and leaped higher a few days later after an announcement that Henry A. Schimberg, the company's president, had pledged to stay on two more years as chief executive, and three subsequent years as a consultant. Summerfield K. Johnston Jr., the chief executive and chairman, agreed to remain as chairman for an indefinite period.
In May, two stock analysts speaking at a beverage-industry conference recommended the stock, even over Coca-Cola. And last month, at the Coca-Cola Company's biennial presentation before investment bankers and portfolio managers, officials of the bottling company were included on stage for the first time. Stock in the bottler gained 25 cents yesterday, to close at $40.75, ahead of a scheduled earnings report today from Coca-Cola.
The heightened interest in Coke Enterprises can be attributed to several factors besides concern about of the Asian crisis and management savvy. First of all, a bottler bonded in any way to the Coca-Cola Company ends up looking good, simply because Coke is, as the saying goes, running on all cylinders. Volume is up, both worldwide and in the United States. Marketing has never been better organized; witness this summer's relentless promotion of "Coke Cards," 55 million of which were distributed to teen-agers and college students. The cards combine entertainment discounts and other offers with the purchase of a Coke or Diet Coke.
Second, Coke Enterprises has been through a series of consolidations and aligned its marketing and business strategy with Coke. One of 11 anchor bottlers around the world (Coca-Cola Beverages, which has operations in Central and Eastern Europe, went public in London just this week), Coke Enterprises is a pillar of strength when it comes to local marketing and execution, the twin forces that increase sales.
The Coca-Cola Company, which has a 42 percent stake in the bottler, benefits directly from the bottler's success, and the two have reached a mutual understanding, mostly under the leadership of M. Douglas Ivester, the chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, who is a former chairman of Coke Enterprises.
Historically, companies like Coke and Pepsi had a fractious relationship with their bottlers. "You might call it constructive tension," says John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, a widely read industry newsletter. He added, however, "In the last couple of years, Coke has really listened well to its big bottlers."
The model looks pretty good, but, much like the Coke that dazzles investors today, it took years to assemble. The bottler staggered for its first five years. A 1991 merger with the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Company turned things around. Centralized management was replaced by one based in the field. And the merger brought in Mr. Schimberg and Mr. Johnston, who get rave reviews from money managers and bottlers alike.
"Henry is one of the most gifted executives in this industry," Mr. Sicher said. "He really has few peers. He has such a deep, intuitive understanding of the marketing and distribution of soft drinks."
Despite their linked agendas, Coke Enterprises must be regarded as a totally separate species from Coke, said Emanuel Goldman, a beverage stock analyst with Paine Webber in San Francisco. And if an investor worries about debt, Coke Enterprises may provide cold comfort.
"Coke is a concentrate company with a balance sheet that has effectively no debt," Mr. Goldman said. "Coke Enterprises is extraordinarily top-heavy."
Coke's long-term debt is just $801 million, on shareholder equity of $18 billion, according to its 1997 annual report. The bottler has about $8 billion in debt on shareholder equity of $1.8 billion.
Still, the bottler's stock is trading at more than 100 times earnings, twice the multiple of Coke's stock, Mr. Goldman noted. Dividends aren't much to write home about either, only about 16 cents a share annually.
More important, though, may be the role played by its principal shareholder. "Coke in a sense stands behind the company," Mr. Goldman said. "It's not official. But when you have 60 percent of the volume, you can be pretty sure Coke cares."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Another High for Nasdaq, But Profit News Hurts Dow

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday with the technology-heavy Nasdaq index jumping to another new high, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks finished lower after rising earlier in a day of volatile trading.
Microsoft, Dell Computer and Intel pushed the Nasdaq higher, with Intel rebounding after its second-quarter earnings, which were reported after the market closed on Tuesday, came in a little under expectations. 
 Eastman Kodak, which jumped 8 3/4, to 82 1/2, added about 37 points to the Dow after it reported that its second-quarter earnings beat forecasts by a striking 25 cents a share. But that was not enough to offset some disappointing earnings news.
Caterpillar said that earnings rose 2.5 percent, to $1.20 a diluted share, 4 cents a share below the forecast by analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation. The company said that earnings were hurt by weak Asian sales. Caterpillar's stock fell 4 1/4, to 52.
And even strong earnings from Ford Motor did not help it. The company reported profits that beat estimates by 10 cents a share, but the stock dropped 1, to 59 1/2. Even so, the stock is still up 84.5 percent for the year.
The Nasdaq index rose 26.13 points, or 1.33 percent, to 1,994.54, leaving it just a few points shy of the 2,000 level. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.77, to 1,174.81, while the Dow dropped 11.07, to 9,234.47. During the day, the Dow topped 9,300 for the first time, but was pulled lower by Caterpillar and by declines in some of Tuesday's better performers, including J. P. Morgan and Procter & Gamble.
In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond rose 7/32 , to 106 2/32 , snapping a three-day slide. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.70 percent, from 5.71 percent on Tuesday. The long-term yield is still more than 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, higher than it was a week and a half ago.
This is because the outlook for a turnaround in Japan and Russia has improved recently in some investors' eyes. Russia has been helped by a $17 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, the United States and Japan. And Japan is searching for a new Prime Minister.
One of the concerns some analysts have about the stock market is that while it is rising, the rally is limited to the bigger-company stocks. This means that the so-called breadth of the rally is not wide. One indicator of the lack of breadth is the number of advancing stocks compared with decliners. On the Big Board yesterday, decliners lead advancers 1,543 to 1,433.
Another indicator is the fact that the main index of smaller-company stocks is still well below its high while the major indexes have all bounced back. The Russell index of 2,000 stocks rose 2.55, to 461.98 yesterday, but it is still 6.4 percent from its high of 491.41 on April 21. And while the Nasdaq is up 27 percent this year and the S.& P. 500 has risen 21 percent, the Russell 2000 index is up just 5.7 percent.
"It's a big-cap rally," said Marshall Acuff, the equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "The lack of breadth makes you scratch your head. You have to build the breadth. You've got to have the earnings to build the breadth and companies like Caterpillar don't have the earnings."
And, he added, "if people really felt good about earnings they would be driving the mid-caps and small-caps higher."
One of the reasons for this disparity in performance is that price/earnings ratios are so high that investors only want to pay up for bigger company stocks that have long-term records of coming close to earnings expectations.
But other analysts argue that the rush of new money from Americans and foreigners into the stock market is going to be enough to offset concerns about the high cost of stocks and the comparatively lackluster earnings performance this year -- low single digits compared with double digits last year.

HEADLINE: Emergency Declared in Dallas As More People Die From Heat

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 15

 BODY:
With 16 deaths here already tied to the heat this summer and with temperatures of 100 degrees or more for 10 days in a row, Dallas County health officials have declared a state of emergency.
The emergency measures were imposed on Tuesday after eight heat-related deaths were reported in two days, said Betty Culbreath, the director of Dallas County Health and Human Services. Most victims have been elderly people who had other health problems, Ms. Culbreath said, although children 5 and under are also at risk. 
 "People are taking better care of their children than their elderly," she said.
The region's heat wave has been blamed for more than 50 deaths in all, including 23 in Texas and 20 in Louisiana. Oklahoma's state epidemiologist, Mike Crutcher, said he had received reports of six heat-related deaths in the past month, compared with four for last summer.
The county health agency here has set up a special telephone line so the elderly, the disabled and the poor can call to get their air conditioners repaired, to receive a free fan or to get help in paying utility bills, Ms. Culbreath said. City recreation centers and other public buildings were open during business hours to people who needed a place to cool off, and six of the centers were prepared for overnight use if needed, she added.
The 16 deaths here are the most heat-related fatalities in recent memory, Ms. Culbreath said. For all of last year there were 17 heat-related deaths in the entire state, said Doug McBride, apublic information officer with the Texas Department of Health.
The National Weather Service reported that the Dallas area, through today, had had 23 days when the temperature reached or topped 100 degrees. But that is far from the record set in 1980, when there were 69 such days.
Michael Foster, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, said the recent heat wave had been caused by an upper-level high pressure system covering the area, preventing cloud formation and rainfall and blocking other weather patterns from moving in.
The heat, combined with a lack of rain, has already cost Texas agriculture $1.5 billion -- which translates into a $4.6 billion loss to the state's overall economy -- as cotton plants shrivel and ranchers are forced to sell hungry livestock, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service reported.
Despite the heat, most Dallas residents, accustomed to summer temperatures in the mid-90's, have been going about their business as usual.
Ramon Rodriguez, a 91-year-old who received national attention last year when a drive-through bank was built around his modest house, said he sat under a shade tree in his backyard on Sunday, watching the bank's time-and-temperature sign as the temperature rose to 110 degrees. The Weather Service said that temperature broke a record for the date, set in 1954.
At Sammy's Bar-B-Q, a smattering of diners sat in the covered area outside today. "We're accustomed to it," said Jane Mills Pearle, 37, who moved to Dallas from Boston in that sizzling summer of 1980. "I remember my first summer in Texas, eating Popsicles and laying on a bed and thinking, 'I'm going to die.'
"Last weekend, I was playing tennis, and it was 105."
Even though a 23-year-old man died here after bicycling in the heat, John Lauck, 42, of suburban Plano took his customary lunchtime run today.
"The trick is to stay well hydrated and stay in the shade to run," Mr. Lauck said. "I haven't missed a day yet because of the heat."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Kodak Halts Profit Decline, Rising 35%

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company reported nearly a 35 percent gain in second-quarter earnings yesterday, reversing a six-quarter-long decline.
The photography giant, based in Rochester, earned $495 million, or $1.51 a diluted share, compared with $368 million, or $1.11, a year earlier. Even excluding a one-time gain of 13 cents a share from the sale of Kodak's stake in Gretag Imaging, the earnings were well above the $1.13 a share that Wall Street analysts had predicted. 
 Although losses from digital photography remained high, and total revenue declined 4.9 percent, to $3.7 billion, investors reacted as though the quarter had been perfect. Kodak's shares soared $8.75, or nearly 12 percent, to $82.50, as analysts pushed up their earnings estimates for all of 1998 and 1999.
"I figured they could beat us, but never by this much," said Jonathan Rosenzweig of Salomon Smith Barney, who had expected the quarter's earnings to reach $1.15. "I am a very happy camper."
Indeed, analysts took the figures as proof that Kodak was making good on its pledge last fall to cut research costs, stanch its hemorrhaging digital portfolio and eliminate almost 20,000 jobs -- a fifth of its work force. The company's stated goal was to reduce $500 million from costs both this year and next. Costs are already down $350 million for the first half of 1998, putting Kodak ahead of schedule. Indeed, even its line of writable compact disks, which lost $100 million last year, is nearing the break-even point.
"Even over $100, this wouldn't be an overvalued stock now," said Peter J. Enderlin, an analyst with the First Albany Corporation.
The quarter did have disappointments. Kodak's domestic film volume in units was up 10 percent, but continued pressure on prices kept revenue growth to just 3 percent. Sales in emerging markets, which had been one of Kodak's fastest-growing areas, plunged 14 percent, in good part because of Asia's economic problems.
Revenue from digital cameras was down about 5 percent, and the company's digital-photography portfolio lost $64 million for the quarter -- much reduced from the $102 million it lost in the second quarter of 1997, but up from a $55 million loss in 1998's first three months.
"Those two growth levers just didn't deliver for us," said Harry Kavetas, Kodak's chief financial officer.
Mr. Kavetas maintains that these are short-term setbacks. Kodak continues to pump money into emerging markets, particularly China, and expects growth to resume there soon.
It is working with the Intel Corporation to create photo-writable CD's, and with America Online to allow the Internet access provider's customers to receive digital versions of photographs by E-mail.
More important to analysts, Kodak is quitting ancillary products and businesses. It sold a chain of photofinishing stores that it had bought less than two years ago, aborting a retail strategy that was pushing it into competition with its photofinishing customers. It trimmed slow-moving products from its digital-photography line, and folded its graphic arts business into Kodak Polychrome Graphics, a joint venture with Dainippon Ink and Chemicals of Japan.
And it bailed out of sundry small businesses -- Cineon, which makes special-effects equipment for movies, is one example -- that served as little more than a distraction.
"They got rid of businesses we never even knew they were in, and they got rid of them fast," said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman & Reider.
Many Kodak-watchers also see happier news in the domestic film picture. Although Kodak continues to reduce prices on packs of slower-speed film, it is maintaining its price on the higher-priced APS and high-speed Max lines. Indeed, Max films accounted for 31 percent of film sales, up from 27 percent in the second quarter last year.
"The Max lines cost a few extra grains of silver to make, but they get more than double the price," Mr. Yannas said.
Still, the general euphoria remains tempered by basic worries about the outlook for the photography business. "It's one thing to stem digital losses or to steal film share from competitors," said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. "To really make money, they've got to find a way to get people to take more pictures."
Mr. Kavetas acknowledged that Kodak's revenue needed help. "We can't save our way to long-term growth," he said. "But this quarter has finally confirmed that we're getting our act together."

Companies Pitch In Where Public Education Leaves Off

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: PACAJUS, Brazil

 BODY:
When Antonio Gomes da Silva found school a bore at age 11, there was no grown-up within hollering distance urging him to stay. Not the grandfather rearing him, who raised cattle and saw little use for grammar. Not the father who abandoned him and went to live in Sao Paulo, 2,000 miles away. Not the mother left behind years earlier when his parents separated.
"If just one adult had said to me, 'No, don't drop out, you need an education,' it would have changed my life," Mr. Gomes da Silva said. 
 But in the 15 years since, the landscape in northeastern Brazil -- traditionally the poorest, most precarious swatch of this diverse country, which is bigger than the continental United States -- has begun to change, with subsistence farms giving way to factories. And in the lightning switch from ox carts to the post-industrial age, survival for workers like Mr. Gomes da Silva, a supervisor at a box factory, depends on hitting the books to make up for lost time.
Along with 30 other employees of Rigesa, the Brazilian subsidiary of the Westvaco Corporation, the paper company based in New York, Mr. Gomes da Silva now spends five nights a week in voluntary classes learning the basics of reading, geography and mathematics. A blue jeans factory owned by Vicunha Ltda., a large Brazilian textile manufacturer, that sits across the street from Rigesa also sponsors elementary school classes, as do the other concerns in the Pacajus industrial park, some 25 miles from the Ceara state capital, Fortaleza. It is all part of a tax-incentive package the state government offered to industry to create jobs outside large urban areas in places like this, a city of some 37,000 people.
Though the contrast between old and new is starkest here in Brazil's dusty northeast, the same shift is being played out across the country, from Sao Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul, where the opening of the world's eighth-biggest economy is expected to lure $17 billion in direct foreign investment this year -- the highest of any emerging market. Foreigners are buying up state-owned industries, and putting their money in everything from car factories to pharmaceutical subsidiaries.
But companies investing in Brazil are finding that severe shortcomings in the educational system, and the poverty that forced many workers to quit school early, hamper productivity and efforts at quality control. And as factories come to rely more on advanced, computer-controlled machines, they need fewer workers, but more capable ones: workers who can read the screens and make sense of what they see.
A wide-ranging 1997 study of industry in Brazil found overall productivity running at 27 percent of the United States level, with even the more advanced sectors, like the automobile industry, only 30 percent as productive as in the United States and 21 percent as productive as in Japan, the best in the industry. The report, by the McKinsey Global Institute in Washington in conjunction with its Sao Paulo office, largely blamed Brazil's protectionist legacy and business's lack of reinvestment. But it noted that workers in Brazil had an average of six years of schooling, compared with 11 to 13 years in Korea and Japan, and encouraged companies to invest in basic education.
"Compared to Asia, it's a disaster," said Riordan Roett, chairman of the Latin American studies program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. "In terms of globalization and competitiveness, education and job training are absolutely critical, and Brazil falls way behind.
"It's the lack of investment in basic education," Mr. Roett continued, "that is holding, and will hold, Brazil back."
The American Chamber of Commerce in Brazil, which began focusing on education early in the decade, found that the average worker in the Sao Paulo area had only a fourth-grade education. And the quality of even that level of schooling was open to question.
Through diagnostic tests, the chamber found that 90 percent of newly qualified primary school teachers had mastered barely 10 percent of the required curriculum, "which meant the perpetuation of the problem," said Silvio Tichauer, who runs the organization's Institute for Quality of Teaching.
The chamber is now putting together a 50-volume, 15,000-page "School Kit," a blueprint for putting together a properly functioning school. It has also introduced standardized tests for students and continuous remedial classes for teachers at five primary and secondary schools in Sao Paulo.
"We've had instances where we've wanted to start up computer-controlled machines, and we've found workers have a tremendous lack in logic and mathematical skills that we had to supplement with our own specific training," said Mr. Tichauer, executive manager in Brazil for the FMC Corporation, the food packager based in Chicago. Mr. Tichauer, who is based in Sao Paulo, added, "If it's bad here, it's probably worse everywhere else."
Other businesses are doing the same. Banco Bradesco S.A., a major Brazilian bank, finances nearly 50 primary and secondary school classes for workers and children scattered around the country. Fiat S.p.A., the Italian car maker, which built a factory in Minas Gerais state a few years ago, has had to open classes as well.
Jose Guilherme Reis, president of the National Council of Industries, based in Rio de Janeiro, said the longstanding government failure to supply decent public education and health care had increased the burden on industry, raising the price of doing business in Brazil beyond the legendary "Brazil cost," which covers excessively high financing costs, fees for the use of ports and taxes.
"In Brazil, beyond the taxes you pay, you have to pay more, a kind of hidden charge, for education in areas where public services fall short," Mr. Reis said.
While John Mein, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Brazil, said that companies were not yet avoiding the country because of the low level of education, Mr. Reis said that a "large share" of the industries his council surveyed "expect to have problems in a few years."
Mark R. McMahon, the president of Rigesa, is among those who see difficulties on the horizon. "As we modernize our mill and box plants, the equipment is much more sophisticated," he said. "The whole logic will be based on computers."
Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is running for re-election in October, spent the early part of his four-year term focusing largely on privatizing government-owned industries and opening Brazil to foreign investment. Efforts to shore up education began only in the latter part of his term. The Government has taken steps to force municipalities and states, which are responsible for primary and secondary school education, to spend a minimum of about $260 a year for each student in the classroom, up from $208 in 1996.
Historically, however, the problem has not been primarily a lack of money. Though Brazil has spent nearly 20 percent of the federal budget on education, among the highest levels in the world, money has not bought quality. Only one in three students finishes the eighth grade in Brazil, compared with two out of three in Bolivia, which spends two-thirds less than Brazil on education.
Moreover, the investment in education is one whose benefits may take a decade or more to appear. And critics say the showcase of the Government drive to improve education -- installing televisions and computers in each school -- overlooks the core of the problem, which is poor teacher training. In regions like the northeast, public school teachers typically earn $50 a month, less than half the legally established minimum salary.
David Fleischer, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia, who writes a newsletter called Brazil Focus, said televisions and computers "are nice, but in a lot of these schools, the teacher has a second-grade education, at best."
Mr. Tichauer was blunter still. "More than half of those TV sets or computers are just gathering dust," he said. "If you don't have someone in the schools who's going to be helping the school use these tools, it ain't going to work."
In addition, 30 percent of the entire education budget is earmarked for public universities, according to Government statistics. That, said Mr. Roett of Johns Hopkins, comes at the expense of primary education and reinforces the country's already heavily skewed distribution of income. Unless students come from families that can pay for private primary and high schools, they are unlikely to gain admission to the best universities, which are public.
When it started operations in Pacajus nearly three years ago, Rigesa demanded an eighth-grade education for the 160 or so jobs it was offering, most paying the minimum wage of $110 a month. But it quickly had to lower its requirement to the fifth-grade level. The company has spent about $50,000 here on its educational program, which relies on videotapes developed by a Brazilian television network to teach the courses and a "facilitator" to answer questions.
Mr. Gomes da Silva, the school dropout, said he was not among the first to seize the chance to study again. For many months, he said, he stood "on the outside looking in," observing other workers who were attending classes.
"They created a good environment," he said.
Watching them, he stopped drinking and stepping out for parties, and brought peace to his once-turbulent home life, Mr. Gomes da Silva said. He was preparing himself to learn. "If you enter with problems, it's not good, either for you or the people next to you," he said. "I wanted to put out only good energy."
Now, Mr. Gomes da Silva said, he is studying primary equations once again. This time, he understands why he is learning. At the end of the 18-month course, he and the other workers will have completed the eighth grade. The company is planning a sequel to enable the workers to complete high school-level studies.
"I didn't know how important studying was," Mr. Gomes da Silva said. "Now, if somebody explains something to me, I see a reason for it, and it's easier to grasp."

Hear Ye! 'Come Back to Your Future.'

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: DUBUQUE, Iowa

 BODY:
From the porch views of the Victorian-era houses high on the limestone bluffs above the Mississippi River, it looked like a sad parade on the streets of Dubuque in the 80's, an exodus of downhearted Iowans fleeing the farm-crisis economy.
In those days, with unemployment rates over 14 percent, young Iowans with roots five or six generations deep came to see their prospects here as hopeless. 
 "There was a saying, 'Would the last person out of Dubuque please turn out the lights,' " said Michelle Rios, a recruiter at the Greater Dubuque Development Corporation.
These days, Dubuque has a new and enviable problem: too many good jobs and not enough workers. With an unemployment rate below 4 percent, and a flurry of new and growing Dubuque companies in computer programming, publishing and marketing, employers lament a shortage of workers.
So Dubuque civic and business officials have begun an aggressive program to bring back the city's sons, daughters and grandchildren. The campaign, "Come back to your future -- come home to Dubuque," has included a site on the Internet and mailings to high school and college graduates. There have also been newspaper and radio advertisements directed at the parents and grandparents of former Dubuquers, urging them to persuade their offspring to return.
"It's wonderful to be home," said John Link, whose wife, Teri, and daughter, Tabitha, 2, are among the more than 30 families who have returned since the campaign began around last Christmas. "When I left, I never thought it would be possible."
The flourishing economy of Dubuque underscores the transformation of the economy in the rural Midwestern states like Iowa, which once depended almost solely on agriculture. Dubuque is now home to three textbook companies, a far cry from when the local economy was dominated by the John Deere tractor factory and a meatpacking plant.
Mr. Link, 30, left Dubuque after graduating from high school in 1986, eventually settling in the Northern Virginia suburbs, with a job in a marketing department in Washington. Ms. Link, 31 and also from Iowa, worked as a paralegal.
For young families that have grown weary of life in congested, expensive suburban settings, small cities and towns in the countryside have lately become appealing, particularly for safe streets and good schools. And employers in Dubuque, as in many other smaller Midwestern cities, need more technologically literate workers.
"We're not talking $6-an-hour jobs here, but jobs that pay $15 and $20 an hour," said Mike Walker, the general manager of Dubuque Data Services, a computer-programming company that has recently grown to 56 people, from 38 in November, including 6 new hires from Dubuque's Web site recruitment campaign.
The Links cherished living in a metropolitan area, especially the sense of excitement and diversity. But they also found it expensive, and more than a bit stressful, especially after the birth of their daughter. With Ms. Link expecting another child in the fall, the couple took a close look at Dubuque after hearing about the job surplus and recruitment efforts. Mr. Link easily found a good job in sales for an advertising company, and they moved back in the spring.
"Life is so much easier now," said Ms. Link, who added that she could afford to be a stay-at-home mother. "Around Washington, it took forever to get anywhere. Now I'm five minutes from the countryside, five minutes from the mall. You just feel like you can relax and breathe here."
The Links acknowledged that there were trade-offs for the slower-paced life: fewer restaurants, stores, less cultural diversity. Some acquaintances around Washington were dumbfounded by their decision to move to Iowa.
"Some would say, 'Oh, I'm so sorry,' " Ms. Link said, referring to people who assumed that her husband was being forced to transfer to a job in Iowa. "A lot of people don't even know where it is. They get it confused with Idaho or Ohio. They think its some desolate region with nothing but cornfields."
With architecture that goes back more than 150 years, Dubuque can be postcard pretty, its steep hills and rugged bluffs overlooking the nation's most storied river. Stylish boutiques and coffee shops line Bluff Street. And it takes less than a half-hour to get to the Illinois tourist town of Galena, 15 miles southeast, with its antique stores and historical sites.
"You wake up in the morning and see a sky that's cobalt blue," Mr. Link said. "You forget about what smog was."
It is also a much more affordable place for a young family. In the Virginia suburbs, a cracker-box town house cost about $150,000, Mr. Link said. Here the couple have a three-bedroom house with three bathrooms, a fireplace, a two-car garage and a nice yard -- for $108,000.
What's more, little Tabitha never goes more than a day or two without seeing a grandparent.
"They spoil her rotten," Ms. Link said. "Now we've got baby sitters whenever we want."

HEADLINE: G.O.P., IN SWITCH, BACKS MORE FUNDS TO SHORE UP I.M.F.

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
House Republicans took the first step today toward approving all of the added money requested for the International Monetary Fund, out of concern that the economic crises overseas might spread to the United States.
A House panel voted $3.5 billion for the agency, and even though that was far below the $17.9 billion requested by the Clinton Administration, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader and a harsh foe of the I.M.F, virtually conceded the fight. 
 "In the end, I suppose they will probably get about as much money as they're looking for," Mr. Armey said in a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce.
House conservatives have been suspicious of the agency's lending practices and critical of recent loans to prop up Russia and bail out Asia. But with the Asian financial crisis deepening and threatening United States agricultural exports, Wall Street's anxiety is rising and building pressure on House Republicans to drop their objections to the fund.
Speaker Newt Gingrich acknowledged the growing concerns last month when he noted, "A lot of members who were wavering last fall now realize that it's very important for us to pass this."
Other top Republicans concurred privately with Mr. Armey today, while predicting a loud fight when the issue goes to the full Appropriations Committee and then to the House floor later this summer.
And some conservatives are still threatening to attach provisions that would restrict funds for family planning efforts overseas -- a measure that President Clinton opposes.
Even if the conservatives hold sway against the monetary fund on the House floor, some Republican lawmakers indicated the money would probably be made available in a final bill negotiated with the Senate, which approved the full amount last March. That outcome would allow critics to preserve their ideological opposition.
The Clinton Administration denounced what it considers the sluggishness of the House's response to looming economic problems.
"It is time for this Congress to get serious and stop fooling around," Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said Tuesday. "This is just back to close-down-the-Government time, you know, and they play these games, and there is serious work to do."
Concerns about the I.M.F.'s programs were heightened this week when the agency was forced to dig deep into a little-used fund of last resort to provide up to $13.8 billion in new loans to Russia over the next two years to help stabilize the ruble. The agency has not dipped into this fund in two decades and doing so now severely limits its overall lending ability.
Even though the Foreign Operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee approved only one-fifth of the Administration's request for I.M.F. money tonight, members of the panel signaled that they recognized the urgency of the agency's need for more financing.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the top Democrat on the subcommittee, agreed that the monetary fund operated too secretively and made questionable judgments. She said that the agency could eventually be scrapped -- "Dismantle it, erase it, start from scratch." But first, she said, the full amount of money should be approved to stop the Asian crisis from spreading to the United States.
"If your house is burning down, you can't be concerned that the roof is leaking," she said. "We have an emergency at our doorstep."
Republicans, who dominate the panel, said the fund's inadequacies could be discussed later. Representative Ron Packard, Republican of California, said that adding the full $17.9 billion now would be a flippant move.
The subcommittee defeated Ms. Pelosi's proposal by voice vote and then approved the underlying bill, which, because of the small percentage of financing for the monetary agency, provides only about half of the $31.97 billion the President requested for all foreign operations.
The bill still includes tough restrictions on the fund's lending practices that the Administration is resisting. These include ending subsidized interest rates for regular borrowers and releasing edited transcripts of the minutes of the fund's board meetings.
"If they want the money, that's life," said Representative Robert L. Livingston, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
The bill faces other hazards. Anti-abortion forces have vowed to attach a proposal restricting money for overseas family planning services. Thus, the final version could offer the money for the I.M.F. that the President wants, but he could still veto it if it restricts the availability of family planning funds.
Abortion-rights forces won a slim victory in the committee meeting tonight on another family-planning issue.
Abortion opponents had written the bill so that it would have allowed groups financed by the United States Agency for International Development that advocate "natural" family planning -- the rhythm method -- to withhold information about other forms of contraception.
But on a vote of 8 to 7, proponents of abortion rights prevailed. They included language that requires "natural" family planning advocates to refer people elsewhere when they seek information on alternative methods of avoiding pregnancy.

HEADLINE: Subway Station to Be Renovated, Keeping Pace With Times Square

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The Times Square subway station -- a bewildering snarl of grime-encrusted tunnels that is the neglected basement of what has become the city's most animated neighborhood -- is finally about to receive the renovation that has been promised for decades.
Transit officials requested bids this week for the first phase of an eight-year, $180 million project to redesign and refurbish the city's busiest subway station, widening corridors and adding staircases and elevators for the thick crowds of workers, theatergoers and tourists that have begun flooding into the neighborhood. 
 The project will replace the station's filthy tiles and gum-plated floors, seen by 500,000 riders a day, with bright walls and nonslip granite, highlighted with stainless steel accents and restored mosaics. Several major artworks will be installed, including a 53-foot-long porcelain mural of a futuristic subway that Roy Lichtenstein created for the station before he died last year.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is scheduled to award the contract for the first phase of the project in October, and construction -- which will disrupt subway service on and off for years -- should begin by next spring.
The project is a scaled-down version of a much more grandiose plan that was unveiled in the early 1990's, before the recession caused real estate developers to pull out of a plan to contribute $90 million for a large rotunda and underground shopping plaza. Now, despite the boom that has transformed the neighborhood into a family-friendly arcade of theaters and shops, the M.T.A. is paying for the entire project itself.
Several good-government groups have criticized the M.T.A. for not requiring developers who are profiting from the boom to build escalators into the station or to contribute to its upkeep. But by using public money for the project, transit officials say, they are at least able to assure riders that this renovation will actually take place, unlike the many false starts that have left the station a decaying monument to the haphazard subway competition of the early 20th century.
"This is really it," said E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the M.T.A. "It's really going to happen. No more diddling around."
The authority has already begun closing off darkened corners of the station to prepare for the construction, and telling underground merchants to prepare for relocation. After 37 years of operation, the Record Mart, a renowned Latino music store near the north end of the N and R line platforms, will have to move to make way for an elevator. It is likely to relocate to a new strip of shops to be built in the station corridor that runs under 42d Street.
"I'm still not sure I believe it's real," said Jesse Moskowitz, who has owned the store since its opening in 1961. "But this time they sound very serious. We're getting ready to move."
The plan will proceed in two phases of about four years each. In the first, the authority will renovate the platforms for the Seventh Avenue Line (the 1, 2, 3 and 9 trains) and part of the Broadway Line (the N and R trains), along with most of the mezzanine above the platforms. The second phase will concentrate on the shuttle to Grand Central and the Flushing Line (the 7 train).
For most riders, the most striking change, in addition to the new walls, ceilings and floors, will be the changes to the mezzanine above the platforms, an area filled throughout the day by impassable streams of riders transferring between the shuttle and the north-south lines.
To ease pedestrian circulation, the project will widen the main corridor under 42d Street, at the north end of the Seventh Avenue platform, by about 15 feet, improving sight lines and removing sharp corners. A cluster of retail shops will open on the north side of that corridor, which will be lined with theater advertising posters.
On the mezzanine above the Broadway line, near the record store's current location, the authority will cut a large oval in the floor, surrounded by a stainless steel railing, that will give the area a more open feeling by permitting a direct view of the trains moving below. That corridor, and another beneath 41st Street, will also be widened and straightened to improve pedestrian flow. Ventilation will be slightly improved, although no fans will be installed.
Elevators will make the station accessible to the handicapped for the first time, and the narrow "finger stairways" that descend from the Seventh Avenue platforms to the Flushing Line will be repositioned and widened. Signs will be clearer, aiding the thousands of tourists whose first venture into subway riding often begins at Times Square and ends abruptly when they become hopelessly disoriented.
"We're finally going to make things the way we always would have liked them," said William J. Madden, the program manager for the project. He noted that the 94-year-old station was an agglomeration of four lines originally run by two competing subway companies, which accounts for its glued-together nature. In the original construction, corridors and staircases were squeezed in to make room for water pipes and huge utility lines running through the station, all of which will have to be painstakingly relocated during the construction.
The materials used in the new station, designed by the Manhattan architectural firm of William Nicholas Bodouva & Associates, will continue the airy, clean-scrubbed theme begun in the new entrance to the station that opened last year at 42d and Seventh Avenue, which has white tile walls and gray granite floors.
To reflect some of the energy of the neon-lighted neighborhood above ground, the station will feature several major artworks, including the Lichtenstein mural, a porcelain enamel work of a space-age subway completed before he died last September and donated to the subway system, which will be placed in the 42d Street corridor. The authority also commissioned major works from three other artists: Jacob Lawrence, who has completed a 36-foot mosaic of subway riders, Jack Beal and Toby Buonagurio.
The design of the project has already won high praise from riders' groups and the Municipal Art Society. "It's very handsome, very intelligent," said Brendan Sexton, the art society's president, who recently saw the completed plans. "They've really taken into account pedestrian travel underground, improving the lines of sight and way-finding. Right now, the station looks like a historical accident, unpleasant and quite confusing."
But Mr. Sexton said he was disappointed that the M.T.A. was letting property owners off the hook by not requiring them to build escalators and large entrances to the station, even though most received tax breaks for building in the area. The plan calls for the eventual closure of the narrow entrance on 43d Street, north of the shuttle, and Mr. Sexton noted that this would leave only one entrance north of 42d Street, the one on the northwest corner of Seventh Avenue. By recently allowing the Rudin Organization to make a $1.3 million payment in lieu of building a grand, canopied entrance there, he said, the M.T.A. was risking crowding at the staircases.
Mr. Conway said he did not think that the extra staircases were important enough to warrant seeking contributions from developers.
"I think the developers have done their job," he said. "We can argue all night whether they should have put this amount or not, but if developers are forced to do things that aren't necessary, they won't want to develop in New York City. What's important is that this project is finally going to begin."
Once it begins, construction will close off parts of platforms and entrances at various times through the course of eight years. Mr. Madden said that most of the work would be done at night and on weekends, and that while there would be some rerouting of trains at times, it would not be on the scale of the current Lenox Avenue project, which has pushed some West Side trains to the East Side during rush hours. The project will also cause lane closings on the streets above the station, mostly for the relocation of utilities.

House Eases Opposition To Full I.M.F. Financing
House Republicans signaled an emerging willingness to finance the International Monetary Fund fully, indicating a concern that the economic crises overseas might spread to the United States. A House panel voted only $3.5 billion for the agency, less than the $17.9 billion requested by the Clinton Administration, but Representative Dick Armey, the majority leader and a harsh foe of the I.M.F., predicted that the Administration would get "about as much money as they're looking for."

HEADLINE: Train New Teachers, Don't Import Them

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your July 11 front-page article "Low on Teachers, New York Scours Austria" says that the board will try to secure these teachers a special classification of visa for "research scholars." A shortage of H-1B visas, the usual classification for high school teachers, may be the reason for this. 
 The effect of the shortage of H-1B visas is not limited to secondary education. High-tech and financial companies, publishers, advertising agencies, colleges and universities all use these visas to employ foreign professionals.
In 1990 Congress created a 65,000 annual cap on H-1B visas. In an economy as robust as ours, this proved inadequate; the cap was reached in early May.

HEADLINE: World Bank Suspends 3 Employees for Suspected Kickbacks

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The World Bank, which lends billions of dollars a year for development projects in poor countries, is investigating possible kickbacks and other wrongdoing by at least three bank employees, bank officials said tonight.
The three employees have been notified that they are under suspicion and have been suspended, said Klas Bergman, the World Bank's chief of media relations. Mr. Bergman said the three are midlevel employees at the bank's headquarters in Washington. 
 Mark Malloch Brown, the bank's vice president for external affairs, said tonight that more bank aides could come under investigation, but he could not speculate how many.
"We need to confirm the allegations or disprove them," Mr. Malloch Brown said, adding that the bank's "moral authority" was at stake.
One aspect of the investigation involves a water utility project in Algiers. The bank is suing a former bank employee in Federal Court to recover thousands of dollars that it believes he took in kickbacks from a contractor who was a former neighbor and who did not complete the work properly, the bank officials said.
Another aspect of the investigation involves possible misuse of a trust fund set up by the Japanese Government to subsidize bank administrative expenses, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on the investigation in Thursday's editions. Mr. Bergman said he could not comment on that part of the case.
Since the bank funnels as much as $25 billion a year into development projects abroad -- and tries to guard against corruption in the needy countries that get its loans -- the World Bank's integrity is all-important, Mr. Malloch Brown said.
He said the amount of money involved in the investigation might be in the tens of thousands of dollars, or what he called "pretty small beer" compared to the bank's moral stature.
Mr. Bergman said the bank set up a special unit, the Oversight Committee on Fraud and Corruption, this spring after top officials began to get word of possible wrongdoing. The bank has also hired the global accounting firm Price Waterhouse Coopers and two outside fraud specialists.
The World Bank president, James D. Wolfensohn, distributed a message to bank staff members today in which he underlined the seriousness of the accusations, regardless of the amount of money involved.
"The bank has a passionate commitment to fight corruption," Mr. Wolfensohn said, calling it a "cancer."
"While I have no reason to believe there is a widespread problem in the bank, even one case is one too many," he said.
The bank has about 8,600 employees and has its headquarters a short distance from the White House, which Mr. Bergman said is being kept abreast of the investigation through the Treasury Department.
Mr. Bergman said he could not state whether the current accusations, if proven, would constitute the worst wrongdoing in the bank's history.
He recalled that, despite the bank's generally good record, an employee was convicted a few years ago of embezzling about $500,000.

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
Higher Surplus Estimate Stirs G.O.P. Tax Cutters

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office today more than doubled its estimate of the Federal budget surplus over the next decade, emboldening Republicans who want to use some of the money for tax cuts despite President Clinton's insistence that it all be set aside until Social Security's financial problems are solved.
The budget office said it expected the cumulative surplus from 1999 through 2008 to be $1.55 trillion, more than double the $671 billion it projected in March. The new estimate brings the Congressional Budget Office's outlook roughly in line with the Clinton Administration's most recent projection of a $1.8 trillion surplus over the same period. 
 With Washington having hardly had time to adapt to an era of good fiscal news after decades of huge deficits, both parties claimed credit for the good news in the budget office's report.
But it was seized on especially by Republicans, who have been pressing the budget office for months to adopt a more optimistic view of the nation's fiscal condition to further their tax-cutting plans. The Congressional Budget Office said today that it had detected a largely unexplained rise in tax revenues and a slightly stronger economic growth forecast.
Mr. Clinton tried early this year to place the surplus off limits to Republican tax cutters by saying that every penny should be preserved until the two parties could agree on how to shore up Social Security for the retirement of the baby boom generation. White House officials said tonight that they would stick by that policy no matter how big the surplus.
Mr. Clinton's strategy has worked. But as the surplus has grown, Republicans have begun asserting that it will be big enough to accommodate tax cuts and a Social Security fix. With today's estimates, Republican leaders became more explicit in rejecting Mr. Clinton's "Social Security first" demand.
"With a whopping $1.5 trillion surplus over 10 years, we can preserve, protect and strengthen Social Security while also passing significant tax relief for hard-working Americans," Speaker Newt Gingrich said.
House Republicans are seeking $100 billion in tax cuts in the next five years, including reductions in the so-called marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples. Mr. Gingrich has also called for cuts in the capital gains tax and in estate taxes.
Democrats and moderate Republicans in the House and the Senate have said a tax cut of that magnitude is politically unrealistic because it would require painful spending cuts that even Republicans would not want to defend in a Congressional election year.
But dipping into the surplus would at least partly solve that problem and allow Republicans to further their efforts to reduce the size of the Government.
"If the politicians in Washington aren't careful, the surplus will be used to create more Government spending," said Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "To stop the politicians from spending the money, I want to use the surplus to pay down the debt, save Social Security and we should use a portion of it to cut taxes this year."
But Democrats warned that dipping into the surplus now would jeopardize any chance of reaching a bipartisan consensus on Social Security and would leave Republicans vulnerable to accusations of putting immediate tax cuts for the wealthy ahead of retirement security for the baby boomers and their children.

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
G.O.P. Senators Defeat Democrats' Farm Plans

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The Senate voted today along party lines to reject Democratic proposals to give more Federal assistance to struggling farmers.
The main Democratic measure, billed as essential to keep thousands of farms from going under in one of the worst years in more than a decade, would have increased the amount of Federal money farmers could borrow with their crops as collateral and would have extended the time for repayment. 
 The Democratic proposal, an amendment to a $57 billion bill to pay for Government agriculture programs in the next fiscal year, was rejected, 56 to 43. Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, joined all 55 Republicans in opposition. All those who voted in favor were Democrats.
Democrats hope the vote will work against Republicans running for election in farm states this fall.
The Northern Plains states are a striking exception to the generally booming national economy. Plunging wheat prices caused primarily by reduced exports to Asia and a worldwide glut on the market have crippled many small farms from Minnesota through the Dakotas and west along the Canadian border to Washington.
This is the first big test of the 1996 farm law, which phases out Government crop subsidies, placed a limit on how much farmers can borrow from the Government and ended Government controls over what farmers can plant and when they can plant it.
Republicans believe that farmers, like almost all other Americans, fare best when the Government takes a hands-off approach. Democrats hold that farmers need a strong Government safety net to protect them in bad times.
In the case of the loans, the Democratic proposal would have increased the amount that could be borrowed against a wheat crop, this year alone, to $3.16 a bushel from $2.58, and would have lengthened the maximum repayment period to 15 months from 9 months. Farmers with other crops would have been entitled to similar loans.
In theory, this would help farmers by enabling them to withhold crops from the market until the price rose. DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

HEADLINE: U.S. Imposes Curbs on 9 Russian Concerns

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that it would impose trade sanctions on nine Russian companies and institutions that have been helping Iran with its missile program.
The Administration's action comes as the Russian Government, for the first time, publicly announced an investigation into the nine enterprises for violating new export control laws worked out in cooperation with the United States. 
 These were the first trade restrictions by the Administration on Russian companies helping Iran, though American assistance to seven of the companies had already been suspended. That assistance was largely in the form of research grants and scientific partnership programs originally intended to keep former Soviet scientists working after the collapse of the Soviet Union and not emigrating to help states like Iran with their weapons programs.
The Administration's announcement was timed to head off a Congressional effort to override President Clinton's veto of a bill that would impose sanctions on any company believed -- but not proven -- to be aiding Iran's missile, nuclear or chemical weapons program.
The House put off its vote on overriding the veto, which was scheduled for today. While the House is expected to vote to override, Administration officials say they are working to sustain the veto in the Senate.
The bill, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, was passed overwhelmingly by both houses and would hit Russian and Chinese companies the hardest. It was strongly supported by the pro-Israel lobby, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
Mr. Clinton vetoed the bill for many reasons, officials say. First, they feared it would create a nationalist backlash in Russia and make it harder to win Moscow's cooperation on halting these exports. Second, the bill calls for sanctions on the basis of "credible evidence," a low threshold of proof, and allows the President to waive the sanctions only for reasons of national security, a high threshold for waiver.
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said: "The standard of evidence is far too low. We constantly see evidence that is credible but just turns out to be wrong. That's not a serious way to do business in the international community."
Another senior official said the main issue was the need for Russian and Chinese cooperation to stop dangerous exports. "We can impose a few sanctions and show our outrage and feel better, but in reality, that's often symbolic. The real way you get to the heart of the problem is through the creation and effective enforcement of Russian controls, and you put that at risk with a confrontational sanctions route."
Vice President Gore, who is about to travel to Moscow, today praised the Russian decision to investigate the companies and announce the investigations.
Mr. Gore, who has been promoting United States-Russian scientific and space cooperation, called the Russian move today "an encouraging step forward." Mr. Gore has been politically frustrated by the Russian help to Iran, because he has also been responsive to Israeli concerns about the danger posed by the Iranian nuclear, chemical and missile programs.
"We will continue to work closely with the Russian Government at every level to close off exports of dangerous, destabilizing weapons technology," he said today. "This includes imposing trade restrictions and suspending U.S. Government programs or assistance to entities under investigation."
The trade restrictions will include bans on exports and imports and financial transactions, the officials said, which are more sweeping penalties than those called for under the bill Mr. Clinton vetoed. The bill would ban the export to Russian companies helping Iran's missile program of specific commodities that have potential military uses.
The restrictions announced today cover all the imports or exports of the companies. "This is designed to send a strong message to other Russian companies that want to deal with Iran that the U.S. is prepared to inflict economic pain," an official said.
But officials said they did not believe the new curbs, announced in an apparent hurry, would affect United States-Russian cooperation on the International Space Station or plans to launch American satellites on Russian rockets. One company sanctioned today is Glavkosmos, which is the Russian equivalent of NASA.
American scientific assistance to all Russian enterprises runs about $50 million a year, officials said. They could not provide a figure on the amount of trade these enterprises have with the United States.
"All this is designed to avoid an override," a Congressional staff member said. "Senior officials have been up here a million times trying to explain that the Russians are trying to get this under control. But this is the first time heads have rolled and enterprises have been exposed by the Russians."
Targets of the investigation were identified by the White House as the INOR scientific center, the Grafit and Ployus research institutes, the Tikhomirov institute, Glavkosmos, the Komintern plant in Novosibirsk, the MOSO company, Baltic State Technical University and Europalace 2000. MOSO and Europalace were the brokers for 22 tons of specialized steel, believed by Washington to have been produced for Iranian missiles. The steel was intercepted in Azerbaijan last March on the way to Iran.
INOR and Grafit supplied specialty steels for missile production, Poyus supplied guidance units and the Baltic State Technical University, in St. Petersburg, was helping with rocket-motor technology and training, officials said.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 17, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about American sanctions against nine Russian enterprises included an outdated description of one company, Glavkosmos. It is private and acts as a broker of space and missile technology; it is no longer a Government space agency.

HEADLINE: Worries About Loans Revive Ghost of 1980's Bank Debacle

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Last year, Chase Manhattan, the country's largest bank, lent about $890 million to an Australian utility, Loy Yang B. Typically, to avoid putting too many eggs in one basket, banks try to get other banks to assume part of the risk by taking portions of big loans.
But Chase gave Loy Yang such generous terms -- a maturity of at least 15 years and a rock-bottom interest rate -- that it found few takers. And now, with the Australian economy squeezed by Asia's financial crisis, most of the Loy Yang loan is gathering dust on Chase's books. 
 Neither Chase nor Loy Yang said the loan was troubled. Chase said it was saddled with few loans that it had been unable to divvy up with other banks and that it had ample resources to protect it from loan losses.
But bountiful lending like this -- whether to overseas customers, builders in booming hotel markets like Las Vegas or nuts-and-bolts operators like heavy manufacturers -- still gives some bankers and Federal regulators the jitters. They have criticized freewheeling practices in certain markets, including the trillion-dollar business of splitting up big loans -- a business, known as syndicated lending, that is dominated by Chase, Citicorp, J. P. Morgan, BankAmerica, Nationsbank and other big banks.
The main concern is that banks are lending too freely, either to rack up one-time fees or to generate other business. Banks can do all sorts of things to keep the lending mill churning. They can lend at artificially low interest rates, perhaps too low to reward them for their risks, and they can stretch out repayment schedules, leaving themselves exposed to unforeseen economic tumult. In addition, covenants -- standards borrowers must meet to avoid having the bank demand repayment -- can be loosened or ignored entirely.
Some liken the zealousness to the heady days of the 1980's, when banks chased real estate loans with all the determination and earnestness of lemmings.
"Instead of getting better, it just gets crazier and crazier," said Richard Kovacevich, chief executive of the Norwest Corporation, a big Minneapolis bank. "The basics of banking are just being filtered away in order to grow." John Medlin, former chairman of the Wachovia Corporation, a bank in Winston-Salem, N.C., said in a December speech that lending practices were the worst he had seen in nearly four decades.
A letter the Federal Reserve sent to banks on June 23 offered a rare glimpse into how some banks now do business. The Fed, while noting that there is still little evidence that problem loans are on the rise, said it was concerned that lending standards were slipping -- presenting dangers should the economy stall and borrowers have trouble paying what they owe.
The Fed said that only 20 to 30 percent of several hundred loans it reviewed earlier this year had been thoroughly screened by banks to see how well they would hold up during a slump.
"That's absolutely a startling number," said Charles Peabody, a bank analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. "The Fed said the pricing was getting narrower and maturities were being lengthened. If you are cutting the prices of loans and extending the terms, you better be darn sure what the future holds."
Why such hand-wringing when the economy is the most robust it has been in decades, and banks, whose lending is buttressed by newfangled computer safeguards, are enjoying record profits?
Regulators and others are still haunted by the ghost of the 1980's banking debacle, when scores of major banks were brought to their knees by reckless lending. When the Bank of New England collapsed in 1991, most regulators were caught by surprise. By the time the smoke cleared in the early 1990's, 11 of the nation's 50 largest banks had to be closed or sold because of bad loans. As a result, it became harder than at any time since the Depression for businesses and consumers to get loans.
With many analysts now warning that the United States economy cannot surge indefinitely, especially if Asia's woes have more impact here, regulators are concerned that imprudent lending could once again wreak havoc if the economy hits a wall.
Amid the rush to lend, the creditworthiness of borrowers is moving rapidly down scale.
In 1995, only about 12 percent of syndicated loans went to companies already carrying heavy debt and subpar credit ratings, according to the Comptroller of the Currency. By 1997, fully 17 percent of syndicated loans were to such indebted borrowers. And at the end of this year's first quarter, that figure had soared to 31 percent.
Julie L. Williams, the Acting Comptroller, said in an interview that she was "very uneasy" about lending standards at banks, citing lax standards in syndicated lending, lending to midsized companies and commercial real estate lending. She said that the comptroller's office had addressed its concerns in discussions with banks, and that some senior executives had been surprised to learn about questionable lending decisions made by their underlings.
But big banks said they were vigilant about their lending practices and constantly reviewed loans to make sure they were sound. They said the Fed's lending survey was skewed by loans from smaller, regional banks that they said might be less cautious in their lending.
"We think we've appropriately priced and structured the deals," said Robert Strong, Chase's chief credit officer. "We're comfortable with what we do."
Analysts consider Mr. Strong a sober-minded and effective manager. But some current and former Chase employees, and some analysts, worry that James B. Lee Jr., who oversees Chase's syndicated lending business, can override the bank's credit managers when he wants to complete a deal. Chase orchestrated some $474 billion in syndicated loans last year, a small but undisclosed portion of which remained on the bank's books.
Mr. Lee declined to be interviewed. But Mr. Strong said Mr. Lee does not have the authority to approve loans and cannot circumvent the loan review process at Chase.
"There are not a lot of quick, informal handshake kind of deals," Mr. Strong said, adding that Chase regularly takes months to scrutinize and "stress test" large loans. Mr. Strong pointed out that since the 1980's, Chase has diversified its lending and sharply reduced the number of loans it holds.
Other big banks say they are similarly disciplined. Citicorp, which flirted with collapse in the early 1990's because of errant lending and has since instituted tougher lending policies, has expanded its commercial and industrial loan portfolio to $59.3 billion last year from about $36 billion in 1992. But analysts and the bank said they were comfortable with the quality of those loans.
Real estate lending, the perennial bogyman of the banking business, appears to be relatively sound throughout the industry, but analysts said there were early signs that lending guidelines were drooping. A recent study by the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche observed that construction loans that once had conservative maturities of one, three, or five years now involve "almost permanent lending of 7 to 10 years," thus exposing banks for longer periods to the notoriously boom-and-bust nature of the business.
Banks had about $400 billion in commercial mortgages last year, up from $300 billion in 1993, Deloitte said. Banks' exposure to related forms of lending, including loans to real estate investment trusts and the packaging and selling of mortgage-backed securities, is harder to quantify because no comprehensive, entirely accurate statistics are available.
"There's been a large increase in real estate lending, and when you put it all together -- adding in whole loans, REIT debt, and mortgage-backed securities -- it has grown significantly," said Dennis Yeskey, Deloitte's managing director for real estate services. "Whatever one does today is locked in for the next few years at a minimum, and that's not something that is easy to get off your books."
Las Vegas, the nation's fastest-growing city, has enjoyed a building boom fueled by such huge projects as Mirage Resorts Inc.'s $1.6 billion Bellagio casino. The Bellagio will open this fall, but gambling industry analysts question whether there will be enough demand to support such huge hotels.
The BankAmerica Corporation, the largest lender to Las Vegas operators and a backer of the Bellagio, said it was confident in the Bellagio's prospects and in the quality of outstanding loans to other gambling companies.
"That's not to say we haven't relaxed a covenant here or there," said William Newby, a managing director in charge of BankAmerica's gambling portfolio. "But we're not giving away cheap money with no covenants at all."
Mortgage-backed securities are an example of real estate investing that gives banks greater flexibility in managing risk. After all, the securities, which represent an ownership stake in mortgages made by banks and others, can be sold to investors and swept off a bank's books -- as long as investors want to buy them. Should the economy or interest rates swing against them, banks could be left holding the bag.
The First Union Corporation and Nationsbank, two of the most active participants in this market, have seen their holdings rise sharply.
First Union now holds about $24 billion in mortgage-backed securities, up from about $11 billion in early 1997. First Union said the credit quality of all of those securities was excellent and that the investments were used to manage risk, not to speculate.
Nationsbank declined to discuss the quality of its loans or investments, citing a pending merger with BankAmerica and a coming earnings announcement. It owns $29.5 billion of mortgage-backed securities, up from $9.9 billion early last year, and attributes part of the growth to acquisitions.
For his part, Norwest's Mr. Kovacevich said that historically problems in bank lending first emerged in consumer loans -- like the recent downturn in the credit card market -- and then appeared in large-scale commercial lending. If current lending standards continue to deteriorate, Mr. Kovacevich said he was unsure that big commercial lending snafus could be avoided.
And if serious lending problems do emerge down the road, only a handful of people will be the first to know.
"The industry has learned many lessons from past excesses, and the average bank is exercising more diligence than was the case in the late 1980's," said James M. McCormick, president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group, which specializes in financial institutions. "But ultimately only the regulators will know whether some banks are pushing the lending envelope too far."

 CORRECTION:
A series of charts accompanying the continuation of a front-page article on July 16 about concerns over bank lending practices included one set of data erroneously. A declining ratio of bank reserves to bank assets among United States banks does not indicate that banks are ill prepared for an increase in nonperforming loans.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
A Revolution Made Of Gritty Intimacy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Nearly 20 years ago, a catchy hit song called "Video Killed the Radio Star" by a group called the Buggles eerily presaged the rise of MTV and the revolution in pop-music marketing that the promotional video clip was just beginning to incite. Today, when the mindless star-studded "event movie" has risen to become the economic cornerstone of the film industry, the time is more than ripe for an upstart video artist to concoct a similar fantasy that might be dubbed, "Video Killed the Movie Star."
In the world of the $20-million-a-picture movie-star salary, that's not going to happen any time soon. But as suggested by the work shown in the New York Video Festival, which opens today at the Walter Reade Theater, video art, that unruly stepchild of television and experimental cinema, has flowered into a vast, immensely creative alternative culture. At its most inventive, as in "Flat Is Beautiful," Sadie Benning's 50-minute video evocation of preadolescent angst in a nontraditional Midwest household, experimental form and conventional narrative fuse into something extraordinarily original and touching. 
 Surveying the bewildering array of styles, technologies and attitudes in the festival, which runs through Thursday and is a part of Lincoln Center Festival '98, you almost have a sense of the universe expanding at the speed of light after a spontaneous explosion. Within the territory being mapped, there's nary a movie star to be found.
While it's risky to generalize about the flowering of video art, a few broad trends seem obvious. The home video camera leads people into much more intimate and quirkier spaces than the movie camera. Where movies monumentalize their subjects, video banalizes them, reducing everything to a collection of dancing pixels. Where movies are great at conjuring beautiful dreams, videos tune us in to the gritty day-to-day texture of "the real world," as defined by television. But paradoxically, in the hands of a subversive artist, it is equally adept at challenging the narrow Darwinian vision of life that saturates commercial television.
Video art lends itself to work ofraw, punkish nonsense, as in the program of eight bizarre shorts, "Faultlines in the Psyche," but it can also yield work of rigorously elegant abstraction. In a program called "Persistence of Vision," the seductive images run from the whimsical abstractions of Michael Intriere's "Fish" (schools of fish photographed swimming against a woozy, waterlogged pop instrumental soundtrack) to visually transfixing, even romantic meditations on technology.
As gorgeous as any fireworks display, Van McElwee's "Transfinite Loops" invents dazzling astral patterns and finds a mood of deepening sadness in the swirling, overlapping images of amusement park rides photographed at night and accompanied by the sound of howling wind.
Mark Bain's "Space Probing," which was photographed in a dense tangle of ducts, pipes and machinery beneath the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, creates a shifting, kinetic, kaleidoscopic landscape that suggests a continually re-configuring Cubist painting that at moments seems almost three-dimensional. On a more austere, experimental level, Les LeVeque's "Flight" takes the shimmering low-resolution black-and-white television image of a lunar astronaut and, to the sounds of accompanying static, stretches it into two figures.
 
Unusual Documentaries
 If "The Persistence of Vision" represents one pole of the work shown in the Video Festival, three programs -- "The Good, the Bad and the Converted," "Frontier Meditations" and "Gimme Shelter" -- bring fresh concepts to the documentary form.
Jeanne Finley and John H. Muse's "O Night Without Objects," the centerpiece of "The Good, the Bad and the Converted," tells the true story of a rabidly anti-Semitic grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Lincoln, Neb., who underwent a spiritual and political transformation, converted to Judaism, and was taken in and cared for until his death by a local cantor and his family. The story, which probes deeply into this family's complicated dynamics, is framed by abstract essays on family psychology (the opening segment of this triptych shows a psychological test being given to a child who is asked to describe what's happening in certain ambiguous pictures), society and religious community.
"Frontier Meditations" consists entirely of the Russian director Aleksandr Sokurov's five-and-a-half-hour documentary "Spiritual Voices: The Diaries of War," a rigorous, glacially paced meditation on the personal ravages of war on individual soldiers. The movie opens with a nearly one-hour shot of a desolate snow-covered landscape.
The centerpiece of "Gimme Shelter" is "The Final Insult," a disturbing, quasi-documentary on homelessness and the apathy of the impoverished by the American filmmaker Charles Burnett. Narrated by a fictional character, a low-level bank employee named Box Brown whose financial woes have left him homeless and forced to live in his car, "The Final Insult" blends fiction and truth so craftily that it's impossible to tell the actors from the nonactors. But its portrait of people living on the streets (and under the freeway) of Los Angeles is depressingly realistic. It shows how homelessness could happen to almost anyone.
 
Artistic Ambitions
 Some of the festival's longer works are more notable for what they attempt than for what they achieve. "Tomorrow and Tomorrow," by Dominique Cabrera, is a personal video diary, filmed with a hand-held camera, of a year in which Ms. Cabrera suffered from paralyzing bouts of depression. The work captures the texture of her daily life (with luminous close-up images of household objects) and the roller-coaster mood swings of someone desperately trying to pull her life together. For all its candor, the work still seems fragmentary and noncohesive.
Equally ambitious, although wildly different in intent, the Belgian video artist Johan Grimonprez's "Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y," in the program "Secret Histories," is an intellectually pretentious documentary history of airplane hijackings (accompanied by heavy-handed readings from the works of Don DeLillo). Illustrating how televised disasters have forced us to redefine what constitutes a genuine personal drama and to re-think our notions of personal autonomy, the work has a haranguing tone; after a while, the old newsreel and television clips of hijack survivors recounting their ordeals fades into a blur.
Much more satisfying and far scarier is Maria Venuto's half-hour video film, "The Tourist," which is based on a true incident in 1993. Arriving at Kennedy International Airport, a young German tourist who has fled her domineering family is fleeced of her money by a taxi driver and returns to the terminal, where she spends the next three weeks composing unsent postcards home describing her glorious new life in New York. Having subsisted on Pizza Hut leftovers and sleeping in the terminal, she is eventually thrown out into the cold by a security guard. This portrait of helplessness is so merciless it becomes nightmarishly funny.
 
Video's Intimate Quality
 But perhaps the high point of this uneven festival is Ms. Benning's "Flat Is Beautiful," which explores the world of a tomboyish 11-year-old girl named Sammy Steel, who lives with her divorced mother and the mother's gay male roommate. The most inspired conceit of this technically crude video film is to have all the characters wear cartoonish masks. Along with the characters' face gear, the videography, which focuses on billboards, store signs and flat surfaces, creates the feeling of living in a children's cartoon world where reality is simultaneously hidden and revealed in a twisted, more intensely felt stylization.
If the same devices were used in a glossier film, they wouldn't have nearly the same emotional impact. But because "Flat Is Beautiful" has the look, feel and sound of an intimate home video, it draws you into a private world that feels at once strange and profoundly recognizable.

HEADLINE: Reports of Embezzling at World Bank Jeopardize U.S. Financing

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
A key member of Congress said today that financing for some of the World Bank's poverty-fighting efforts had been put in jeopardy by reports that bank employees were suspected of embezzlement and of accepting kickbacks.
Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee's foreign operations subcommittee, said in a letter to James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank's president, that he found news reports of possible wrongdoing uncovered by the bank's internal investigation "shocking." He said that it was time for an independent review of the institution's management and operations. 
 Mr. McConnell's subcommittee was scheduled to vote next week on providing $800 million for next year to the arm of the World Bank that makes low-interest loans to the world's poorest countries. His aides said he probably would write the bill to require a full explanation of the reports of wrongdoing and the bank's failure to apprise Congress of the problem before he released the money. Mr. McConnell's letter came after newspapers reported that the bank had found evidence of kickbacks being funneled to employees in at least two cases, and was investigating other accusations as part of a broad inquiry into wrongdoing within the bank. The bank's investigations were first disclosed by the Washington Post and the Asahi Shimbun in Tokyo.
When compared to the billions of dollars that the institution routinely lends to rickety, poor and sometimes corrupt governments around the world, the two cases at the center of the bank's investigations are miniscule in financial terms.
In one case, World Bank officials are investigating whether two Japanese employees took $11,000 in kickbacks for steering a consulting contract to a subsidiary of a Japanese securities firm.
In the only other case to have progressed beyond the initial stages of investigation, the bank filed a civil lawsuit seeking to recover tens of thousands of dollars it suspects were funneled to an employee by a technology company he hired to work on a project in Algeria. No criminal charges have been filed in either case.
Analysts who follow the World Bank generally see internal corruption as a far smaller problem than the bank's attempt to wrest full control over the more than $20 billion it channels each year into construction projects, education, health and nutrition projects and other programs in scores of countries across the world.
But since the institution has embarked on a high-profile effort to insure that the money it lends goes to fighting poverty and not to enriching corrupt government officials and business executives, officials at the bank were concerned that the institution be able to live up to its own standards.
And with the bank's poverty-fighting effectiveness under attack in Congress and internationally among economists and development specialists, the investigations brought more criticism that the bank is not sufficiently accountable to taxpayers in the United States and other wealthy nations that help finance its operations.
The Treasury Department said it had encouraged the bank to "investigate fully and then take all appropriate actions."

HEADLINE: New York City's Bond Rating Is Raised by Wall St. Agency

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
A major credit-rating agency raised New York City's bond rating yesterday, and leaders of the City Council said it was the strongest sign yet that the budget they adopted last month was fiscally prudent.
But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has assailed the Council's budget plan, said the upgraded bond rating was instead a sign that his conservative financial policies over five years were finally paying off. 
 The agency, Standard & Poor's, increased New York's rating to A-, up one notch from BBB+, citing the city's $2 billion budget surplus, its flourishing economy and its success in reducing projected deficits for the coming years. But analysts at the agency also said they were worried about the city's rising long-term debt and the Council's plan to cut taxes by $200 million this year and $500 million in future years.
By adding tax cuts to the budget plan that Mr. Giuliani proposed in January while also increasing spending, the Council increased the projected deficits for coming years, the analysts said. "The change from the original January plan was slightly in the wrong direction," said Todd Whitestone, a managing director at Standard & Poor's. "We don't feel they're all the way there."
The upgraded rating affects billions of dollars in general-obligation bonds the city has issued over the years to finance construction and renovations of bridges, roads, buildings and other projects. The better rating is important because banks and other financial institutions that do not invest in municipal bonds with a rating lower than the A category, a standard cutoff, would now be able to buy new bonds issued by the city.
In theory, the improved bond rating would save the city millions of dollars by making its bonds attractive to more investors and allowing the city to offer them with less interest. But experts predicted that the upgraded rating would yield hardly any savings this year, because the city's bonds are already trading at prices reflecting the higher rating.
The announcement from Standard & Poor's came one month after Mr. Giuliani vetoed $200 million from the Council's budget plan, saying it included reckless spending that would create deficits. When the Council overrode the vetoes, Mr. Giuliani threatened to use his considerable powers to hold down spending, and he started by asking city agencies to look for ways that they could cut their budgets by 10 percent.
Mr. Whitestone and other analysts at Standard & Poor's praised the Mayor's plan to cut spending yesterday, saying it was one of the reasons they raised the city's bond rating.
But Mr. Giuliani, speaking at a news conference, said he was not yet sure whether cuts would be necessary. He focused more on the warnings that accompanied the improved rating than on the rating itself, saying they proved that the Council's budget was unsound.
"This is an upgrade in spite of the damaging action of the Council's budget in increasing out-year gaps," Mr. Giuliani said, referring to the projected deficits. "Maybe we could have gotten more of an upgrade if they hadn't done that."
But the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat running for governor, pointed out that the Council's budget included money to pay off debt, a plan that Mr. Whitestone said was wise. "The Council passed the most fiscally responsible budget in city history," Mr. Vallone said. "We are better prepared now than any other year for an economic downturn."
The city's general-obligation bonds had been rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor's since it downgraded them from a rating of A- in 1995. The upgrade came five months after another major Wall Street credit-rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, increased the city's rating for the first time since 1991. City bonds have been trading at the higher level since last summer, when that upgrade was first predicted, said Denis Galle, a managing director at Lebenthal & Company, which deals heavily in the city's bonds.
But Mr. Whitestone said New York could still profit from the new rating since it would open up the city's bond market to more banks and other institutional investors who can buy only bonds with ratings in the A range. "Far more institutions can now purchase the bonds," he said.

Treasuries Slide Despite Signals Of Diminished Inflation Pressure

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities fell yesterday despite Government reports pointing toward lower economic growth and diminished inflationary pressure.
Traders attributed the bond market's retreat to a further decline in the dollar's value and a belief that the effects of the General Motors strike had made the latest economic data look deceptively weak. 
 The dollar fell to the lowest level against the yen in more than three weeks on speculation that Japan's next elected prime minister will support radical bank reform.
The dollar also fell for the fifth day against the mark after Russia's Parliament passed austerity measures to secure new loans.
Bonds have tended to track the dollar's value lately. A higher dollar attracts foreign investors to assets denominated in the currency.
The benchmark 30-year bond slipped 12/32, to a price of 105 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.72 percent, from 5.70 percent on Wednesday.
The price weakness came despite Government reports showing a decline of six-tenths of a percent in June industrial production and a decline of eight-tenths of a percent in factory use. The reports suggested the economy was cooling, which would tend to help bonds.
But economists said the data reflected the mass shutdown of G.M. factories caused by a strike at two plants in Flint, Mich., that began more than a month ago. The reports would have been stronger without the effects of the labor dispute.
"The G.M. strike has started to wreak havoc with the economic data base and market observers are beginning to weave through the statistical minefield," said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.

HEADLINE: Mahbub ul Haq, 64, Analyst And Critic of Global Poverty

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Mahbub ul Haq, a former Finance Minister of Pakistan and an early proponent of economic liberalization who in later years argued that poor countries failed to prosper because they neglected the basic development of their people, died yesterday in New York. He was 64.
The cause of death was pneumonia, said his son, Farhan, a reporter for the Inter Press Service, a news agency. The elder Mr. Haq, who was visiting New York from Pakistan, collapsed early this week and did not respond to treatment, former colleagues said. 
 Mr. Haq, who had also been a governor of the International Monetary Fund and director of policy planning at the World Bank, was the author of several books, including "The Poverty Curtain" (Columbia University Press) and "Strategy of Economic Planning" (Oxford University Press).
But he is best known for his creation in 1990 of an annual Human Development Index, a measure used by the United Nations Development Program to measure the wealth of nations by the level of living standards their citizens have attained.
His views did not make him popular in many developing countries, nor in some Western capitals, where he also criticized foreign aid policies and domestic social programs.
A scrappy and articulate debater, he relished the controversies he provoked. He traveled extensively to speak and gather information and impressions for the United Nations' annual Human Development Report, which was built around his index.
James Gustave Speth, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, said, "I don't think anybody did more or even as much as Mahbub did to bring balance back to development thinking when everyone else was worshiping at the altar of G.N.P. growth."
After leaving the United Nations Development Program in 1995, Mr. Haq returned to Pakistan to establish the Human Development Center for South Asia with the help of his wife, Khadija Khanum, an economist. Measures of human progress in the region, especially in India and Pakistan, had begun to slip badly.
"After producing seven global Human Development Reports, I had to face the sad reality that the real challenge to human development lay back home, in Pakistan and South Asia," he said. "South Asia has been sinking fast into a quagmire of human deprivation and despair, emerging as the most deprived region of the world."
Mr. Haq, who is survived by his daughter, Toneema, as well as his wife and son, studied at Punjab University in Pakistan, King's College in Cambridge, Yale and Harvard.
He was born on Feb. 22, 1934, and while still in his 20's he became the chief economist of Pakistan's national planning commission. In the 1980's, under the late President Mohammad Zia-ul Haq, he served as Minister of Commerce, Planning and Finance. He moved to Washington and the World Bank in 1988.
The founder of the Third World Forum, a panel for discussing development issues, Mr. Haq was also an adviser to the Brandt Commission, which looked into economic relations between the rich and poor nations.
In his spare time, he was a great reader of literature and poetry. In 1985 he wrote a volume of poems titled "An Elusive Dawn."
"I have struggled for a long time with the concept and practice of development," Mr. Haq wrote in the preface to the first Report on Human Development in South Asia, in 1997. "Emerging from the Western citadels of learning -- Cambridge, Yale, Harvard -- in the 1950's, I was armed with the firm neoclassical conviction that the real purpose of development was to increase national income." Over half a century, he increasingly doubted that analysis.
"There is widespread consensus today," he wrote, "that the purpose of development is not just to enlarge incomes but to enlarge people's choices, and that these choices extend to a decent education, good health, political freedom, cultural identity, personal security , community participation, environmental security and many other areas of human well-being.
"A link between growth and human lives must be created through conscious national planning."

HEADLINE: Production Declined in June For First Time in 4 Months

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Industrial production declined during June for the first time in four months, the Government said today, partly reflecting the strike at the General Motors Corporation.
The Federal Reserve said output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities decreased six-tenths of 1 percent last month. Production had risen in each of the three previous months; the Fed today revised May's gain to three-tenths of 1 percent from the half a percent reported earlier. 
 June's decline, which matched a drop in May 1993, was the steepest since output fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in March 1991, the final month of the 1990-91 recession.
Most of last month's decline was attributed to an 11 percent drop in auto production stemming from the strike. Output at factories other than auto and truck plants rose one-tenth of 1 percent in June following a decline of the same amount in May.
Utility output last month increased four-tenths of 1 percent, and production at mines and oil wells fell 2 percent.
The production decline pushed down the operating rate at industrial companies to 81.6 percent of capacity in June, the lowest rate in five years, from 82.4 percent in May. At factories alone, the operating rate declined to 80.3 percent, also the lowest in five years, from 81.1 percent.
Economists attribute some of the drop in output to businesses' desire to reduce the huge inventory of unsold goods that developed during the first three months of the year as export sales fell.
Despite the overall weakness of June's report, there were areas of strength. Production of industrial equipment rose 2.2 percent, with strong increases for construction machinery and computers and other office equipment. Semiconductor and clothing output also rose.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
In TriBeCa, a Condo Building on a Parking Lot Site

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
With many of the remaining old warehouses in TriBeCa being swallowed up by conversions to expensive lofts, plans are moving ahead for one of the first newly constructed condominium buildings in the area in a decade.
Plans call for a nine-story reddish brick structure, designed to blend with its older neighbors, that will contain 26 two- to four-bedroom lofts, including two penthouses. The apartments, some with terraces, are expected to range in size from 1,500 to 3,600 square feet and in price from $600,000 to $3 million. There will also be 4,500 square feet of ground-level retail space in the building, which will rise on a corner site at Hudson Street and Ericsson Place in a spot now occupied by a surface parking lot and a vacant automotive shop. 
 The new building is being developed by 124-130 Hudson Street L.L.C., a firm based in Jersey City, whose principals include members of a family that once operated the parking lot on the site.
The conversion underscores developers' continued interest in capitalizing on Manhattan's strong residential market and what they say is an increasing demand for new housing in neighborhoods like TriBeCa.
Meeting that demand in TriBeCa in the last few years has meant converting existing warehouses. But with the supply of big former manufacturing and warehouse buildings dwindling and the cost of buying and renovating buildings nearing the cost of constructing new ones, developers see now as a good time to build, said Peter Hauspurg, chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a Manhattan-based real estate investment company.
David H. Imrie, a condominium sales broker at the TriBeCa office of Douglas Elliman, a Manhattan brokerage concern, said that sales prices for the area's condominium lofts have risen to a point that supports new construction. In the last two years, the average sales price for such units has gone from $300 a square foot to $500, with penthouses selling in the $700-a-square-foot range, Mr. Imrie said, adding that the increase was reflective of a "new breed of lofts, with all the bells and whistles, like a doorman."
In addition to the Hudson Street project, there are three other new condominium buildings in various stages of the approval process that together could produce about 100 loft apartments, according to estimates from Community Board 1. All are planned on sites now or once used as surface or garage parking. The largest is a 12-story, 68-unit building proposed at 3-9 Hubert Street.
Another project was planned at 32 White Street. But the property was recently sold to Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus, N.J., which plans to build a hotel, said Emanuel Stern, the company's president.
"I guess the best thing," said Judy Duffy, assistant district manager of Community Board 1, "is that the new projects have a relatively low density and will not translate into too many units, even though they will replace parking lots, which are still open space."
Anita Murray, a member of the TriBeCa Community Association, added, "Considering what the alternatives could be, the residential reuse of sites is the least offensive."
Finding building sites is getting more difficult, but the developers of the Hudson Street project were in a better position than most. The company's principals are members of the Harwood family, who ran the parking operation on the site, along with 54 others in New York City, until 1997, when it sold its parking company, Square Industries.
Before the sale, the family contracted to buy the Hudson Street property, contingent on all approvals, from the owner and began the development process. The family has been involved with other investors in development of 12 residential buildings, totaling just under 1,000 units, on sites that included parking lots it owned throughout the city.
In terms of timing and location, the site represented "an opportunity," Craig Harwood said, citing the supply-demand imbalance in the TriBeCa housing market as factors for pressing ahead. "The challenge was creating a building the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission felt comfortable with and we felt made economic sense," Mr. Harwood said. The project is expected to cost $26 million to build, including the cost of the site.
Both new buildings and conversions that take place in designated historic districts like parts of TriBeCa must receive approval from the commission. It approved the design of the Hudson Street project, situated in the TriBeCa West historic district, in January after nine months of review and many revisions. The revisions largely had to do with the number of setbacks on the building. The developers wanted more setbacks in order to offer more terraces as amenities. Two setbacks were ultimately approved.
The building, designed by Peter DeWitt Architects of Manhattan, will have features reflective of TriBeCa warehouses, including big recessed windows, molded brick cornices shaped like crowns and three corrugated steel marquees around its one-story base. Decorative cast-stone and brick details are more modern, Erica Tishman, a partner at the architectural firm said. While "no one will be fooled that the building hasn't been here for hundreds of years," she observed, "it harmonizes with its historic surroundings."
Mr. Harwood said construction was to start on the Hudson Street building in October.

Lockheed Calls Off Merger With Northrop Grumman
Faced with continued resistance from the Government, Lockheed Martin has abandoned its planned $8.3 billion acquisition of the Northrop Grumman Corporation.

Seven weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund was playing down the crisis in Russia. This week, in an about-face, the fund and the Russian Government announced a bailout package that will inject $17.1 billion in new loans to the nation. The Clinton Administration was the driving force behind the reversal. Treasury officials were worried that while negotiations with the Russians dragged on, the political peril to President Boris N.

HEADLINE: Theater Complex Planned for Brooklyn

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a sign that developers are increasingly forced to scout out unlikely locales for new projects, a Manhattan company said yesterday that it would build a huge entertainment complex along the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn that would include the city's largest multiplex movie theater.
The project, to be known as Brooklyn Commons, would be part of a stark modern steel and glass complex contrasting sharply with the surrounding ragtag assemblage of what was once one of the city's busiest manufacturing zones. Besides a 22-screen Loews theater, the complex would include a bowling alley, athletic center, shops, restaurants, a 1,500-car parking garage and an esplanade along the Gowanus Canal. 
 The canal was dug in the 1860's to provide a manufacturing lifeline to the New York Harbor but in recent years become a little used, malodorous liability to Brooklyn.
"This project is an indication that there is great market demand to develop parts of town where, years ago, people would have considered such things idle fantasy," said Joseph Rose, the city's Planning Commissioner, who has been a persistent advocate of luring builders to little-used industrial areas.
The developer, Millennium Partners, has several entertainment complexes across the nation, including the Lincoln Square Complex of movie theaters in Manhattan. The company plans to spend $63 million on the Gowanus project.
"Having built entertainment centers of this kind before, we are confident that New York City residents and visitors will find this an exciting gathering place," Christopher M. Jeffries, president of Millennium Partners, said at a City Hall news conference with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Mayor Giuliani said the project, planned for completion by 2000, could be built without zoning changes and would not receive city tax breaks.
Still, plans for the entertainment complex have not received unqualified support from residents of the surrounding neighborhoods of Park Slope and Carroll Gardens. The project is to be built on the west side of Second Avenue, from 10th Street to 12th Street, on land owned by the United States Postal Service. Residents said they worried about the traffic the complex would generate and wanted assurances that it would provide employment opportunities and retail space for local residents.
"If this project is done properly, it can be wonderful," said Ben Meskin, president of Care About the Slope, a community group representing the south end of Park Slope. "We just want the developers to talk to us."
Stephen DiBrienza, a City Council member representing surrounding neighborhoods, said yesterday that the Mayor's news conference announcing the project had come as a shock to many residents who did not think the developers had satisfied their complaints.
"This an example of the Mayor, in making this sound like a done deal, putting his cart way out ahead of the horse," he said, adding that Brooklyn residents may file suit to block the project because of what he called "shoddy and inaccurate" information contained in an environmental review of the property by the Postal Service.
But yesterday's announcement came after a succession of meetings among the developers, neighborhood representatives and elected officials earlier this week at the behest of Nydia M. Velasquez, the Brooklyn Congresswoman. Ms. Velasquez said she had persuaded the Postal Service to postpone signing a lease until discussions took place involving Mr. Meskin, Mr. DiBrienza and other neighborhood representatives.
The discussions clearly did not satisfy everyone. Mr. DiBrienza said yesterday that developers had been "evasive and unresponsive." But Ms. Velasquez said executives of Millennium Partners had "made it clear they want to work with the neighborhood."
In one concession, she said, the developers had agreed to conduct a traffic study before they begin construction, and had indicated that they would provide signs, streetlights or other improvements that would ease congestion.
Jed Marcus, chief executive of Insite, a development company working with Millennium on the project, said late yesterday that a 99-year lease on the Postal Service property had been finalized. Under terms of the agreement, the developers will pay $500,000 a year for the 9.4-acre site, demolish one Postal Service building that until the early 1990's was used as a vehicle maintenance garage, and incorporate another Postal Service building on the site into their complex.
The Brooklyn project comes amid a surge of development at long-derelict sites elsewhere in the city. Just a mile away from the Gowanus site, developers have transformed the long-abandoned area above the Atlantic Terminal railway station into a huge shopping complex.. And at the site of the former Washburn Wire factory in East Harlem, developers announced in March that they would build a retail complex, with Home Depot and Costco as major tenants.
The plans for the Gowanus site were announced a week after the Marriott Corporation opened a 367-room hotel in downtown Brooklyn, which officials hailed as a sign that the borough is bouncing back economically.
"This is an absolutely remarkable investment that will aid in the resurgence of Brooklyn," Mayor Giuliani said of the Gowanus project.
Another investment in the area is being made by the city itself. Mr. Rose said the city is nearly finished with repairs of a 90-year old mechanical flushing system for the canal, designed to pull water from the New York Harbor and keep the waterway largely clear of of sewage.

HEADLINE: RESCUING RUSSIA: A special report.;
The Bailout of the Kremlin: How U.S. Pressed the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
Seven weeks ago the chief of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, assured the world's financial markets that there was no reason to panic about Russia.
"Contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining," Mr. Camdessus insisted as investors were fleeing the Russian markets, "this is not a crisis. This is not a major development." 
 This week, in a complete reversal, the I.M.F. and the Russian Government announced a bailout package that will inject $17.1 billion in new loans to the beleaguered nation over the next 18 months.
The Clinton Administration was the driving force behind the reversal, impelled by the specter of Russia's financial collapse. United States Treasury officials were worried that while negotiations with the Russians dragged on over forcing real economic change, the political peril to the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin was growing. They pressed the fund to double the amount of money it was willing to lend to Russia, even though it depleted the I.M.F.'s own resources for fighting the economic contagion that is spreading beyond Asia.
The Russian predicament once again casts a spotlight on the critical decisions made by the I.M.F. at a moment when the Asian financial crisis has made the institution more powerful than at any time in its 52-year history. Critics of the I.M.F. charge that in this case, fund officials underestimated the gravity of the crisis and dragged out the negotiations while the markets turned against Russia and the eventual cost of the bailout rose.
I.M.F. officials counter that it would have been a waste of money to offer yet another bailout to Russia without extracting a commitment to fundamental economic changes that are painful and politically unpopular.
By last week, the negotiations turned into a race to rescue the Russian economy before the Government's financial reserves were exhausted. Without new funds, Russian officials feared they would run out of money to prevent a default on Russia's debt and prop up its currency by the end of the month.
"Last week was the most dangerous period," Yegor T. Gaidar, the former Prime Minister who is now an economic adviser to Mr. Yeltsin, said in an interview.
"If we followed all the standard procedures, the money would have arrived too late. I think the position of the leading industrial nations was very constructive and the U.S. Treasury helped a lot."
The final package is not a permanent solution; it buys time for what American officials believe is the most reform-minded government in Russia in years. In Washington, however, there is palpable nervousness about the deal that was struck. It is unclear whether Mr. Yeltsin and his new Prime Minister will be able to fulfill their commitments to remake their economy.
The accord has set off a rally in Russian markets. Yesterday, after a series of ups and downs, the lower house of the Parliament approved key parts of the package as the Kremlin rushed to fulfill the I.M.F. requirements before the fund convenes on Monday to consider the rescue package. "We view this very much as a last chance for Russia," said Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the I.M.F., who directed the negotiations for the fund. "The country is running out of time."
 
The Origins
Asia and the Markets Descend on Russia
In May, the week before the annual summit meeting of Western leaders, the two American officials who have focused on Russia's economic reform went to Moscow to take the temperature.
One was Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, a former Harvard economist who has come to personify the new face of American financial power around the world. The other was David Lipton, a Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, an intense 44-year-old who has cultivated a strong relationship with Russian economic strategists.
The economic crisis that began a year ago in Asia has been a worry for Russia for months. As investors fled emerging markets, it was becoming more difficult for Russia to finance its chronic budget deficits by selling treasury securities. European and American bankers were offering loans, but they were pricey and Russian officials had been exploring the possibility of additional credit for the Central Bank's reserve of foreign currency.
But the new Russian Government, fresh from a bruising battle in the Communist-dominated Parliament to confirm the new Prime Minister, was still trying to find its footing.
In talking with their Moscow counterparts, Mr. Summers and Mr. Lipton cautioned the Russians they they were too absorbed in their own political and economic problems and insufficiently focused on the risk that they would catch the Asian flu, producing a panicked retreat by investors.
The Russians, however, were not alone in underestimating the potential fallout from the Asian crisis. The I.M.F. was also slow to respond, and when it did, critics say, it fueled investor anxiety by highlighting its differences with the Russians.
The monetary fund, created after World War II to stabilize currencies and foster economic growth, has been a leading proponent of better management of Russia's shaky economy, lower inflation, smaller deficits and better tax compliance. And while the fund has been impressed with the new Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, and his new team, the relationship between the fund and the Government is not always good.
I.M.F. officials complain that the Russians have failed to keep a series of promises they have made since 1992. For their part, Russian officials say the fund is constantly changing its Russian team and that some officials have a shallow understanding of the nation's complicated politics.
Most of the time, however, the tension is kept under wraps. But it burst into view in late May when the two sides tried to settle what Russia needed to do to receive the next $670 million disbursement on a three-year, $10 billion loan.
The talks fell short and Russia did not get the money. Martin Gilman, the chief I.M.F. official in Moscow, warned publicly that Moscow had not done enough to get the money and pointedly said he could not predict when the I.M.F. would be in a position to decide the matter.
"Such a statement was very bad news for the market," Sergei Aleksashenko, the deputy chairman of the Central Bank, said in an interview. "I have negotiated with the fund for five years and I cannot think of a single case in which the fund has made such a statement."
If the Russians were shocked, alarm bells rang when the bond and stock markets began a new week. Interest rates on loans to Russia shot up, a sign that investors considered them a risky buy, and the Russian stock market sank. It was the world's best performing market last year, but now it is down 50 percent since the start of the year and tied with Indonesia for the world's worst performance.
With the markets deteriorating, Mr. Kiriyenko made a late-night phone call to Mr. Camdessus, the fund's managing director, and assured him that the Russians were serious about changing their ways. The I.M.F. then rushed out a statement praising the Yeltsin Government's reform program. Mr. Camdessus issued his "this is not a crisis" line to try to stop the panic. John Odling-Smee, the head of the monetary fund's Russia department, flew to Moscow to complete the negotiations for the $670 million disbursement that the fund had been blocking.
But investors were pressing for a new, bigger loan package to strengthen the Russian Central Bank and to restore their confidence in the economy. The problem was that the bank's hard currency reserves were shrinking as it was using millions of dollars each business day to pay off investors and prop up its currency.
Judging by the I.M.F.'s public remarks, though, it looked like it had little interest in organizing a rescue and did not understand the extent of the crisis.
So President Yeltsin went directly to the power behind the fund: the Clinton Administration. He dispatched to Washington the Russian with the most credibility in the West, Anatoly B. Chubais.
Mr. Chubais had run Russia's privatization program. He was highly regarded but he was one of the most contentious figures in the country. Many Russians blame him for the pain and confusion of Russia's jerky transition to capitalism, and powerful business leaders have never liked the fact that he had refused to do their bidding.
Mr. Chubais had left his top Kremlin post as part of the shake-up that brought Mr. Kiriyenko into power during the spring. He was now running Russia's electrical monopoly, United Energy Systems.
Mr. Chubais was joined by Sergei Vasiliev, deputy chief of staff for the Russian Government and a veteran of the behind-the-scenes battle for economic reform.
 
The Meeting
Over Bagels and Juice, A Bailout Is Shaped
Arriving just before the long Memorial Day weekend, the Chubais team headed straight for the Treasury Building next to the White House.
They came not for money but for reassuring words of praise and public commitment from President Clinton that if Russia needed more aid, the United States would lend its support.
The next morning, Mr. Chubais and his associates drove through the diplomatic enclave of northwest Washington to the home of Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State and a longtime Russia expert.
Mr. Talbott told them that President Clinton was willing to support additional financial help to Russia under the right conditions.
The Russians drove on to Mr. Summers' house in the Maryland suburbs. Mr. Lipton and other top Treasury officials were there, all wearing blue jeans and sport shirts. The Russians were in suits and ties, preparing to meet later with the ever-formal Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Over bagels, muffins and orange juice, Mr. Chubais made his appeal: Washington had a historic opportunity to help Russia.
"It used to be that there were only a few reformers," Mr. Chubais said. "Then there were a good number of reformers. In this Government," he said, "They are all reformers."
As the conversation shifted to tactics, the group decided that the United States would send a signal that it stood behind Russia. But it would have be carefully worded so that the Congress would not be inflamed at the idea of another bailout. In return for aid, there had to be substantial reforms. The Russians would also have to tap commercial banks so that it was clear that not all of the burden fell on the monetary fund.
"It had to be clear that we would help out but that if they didn't take real action this time, they were headed over the cliff," an American diplomat said.
The next morning, a Sunday, President Clinton issued a brief, carefully hedged statement saying the United States would support financial assistance from the I.M.F. and World Bank "if necessary" and if Russia agreed to stiff conditions.
Mr. Clinton never mentioned any figures but Russian officials say the two sides agreed on $5 billion to $10 billion. The Americans favored the low end of the range and the Russians the higher.
 
The Deal
How a Small Bailout Got Very, Very Big
Quietly, the I.M.F. and the Russians opened negotiations over the rescue package. Their focus was not on how much money was needed, but on what Russia had to do to qualify for the loans.
Mr. Fischer, the fund's No. 2 executive and a former economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his principle was simple: The amount of aid would be linked to the depth of the reforms. More reform, more cash. It was not in the business of throwing money into a country to calm financial markets.
"It is fund doctrine that the stronger the measures the country takes the more assistance the fund can provide," he said.
Some Western economists, however, insisted that the I.M.F. was being too doctrinaire. They argued that it would make more sense for the fund to first determine what was needed to ease market turmoil and then tell the Russians what they would have to do to earn it.
Nor was meeting the requirements an easy task.
In a confidential memorandum, the fund handed Russian officials a tough list of demands. A main one was that the Russian budget deficit had to be drastically reduced 2 to 2.5 per cent of nation's output from 5.5 percent.
The plan made fiscal sense. Interest payments on Russia's debt were eating up 30 percent of the Russian budget. But the Russians were worried that they could not meet such an ambitious target and that they would be faulted for again promising something they could not deliver. President Yeltsin had submitted his own "anti-crisis" plan to the Parliament. But the I.M.F.'s analysis indicated the plan only went half way to meeting the goals.
To meet that target, the Government would not only have to slash spending, it would also have to beef up tax collection, an enormous challenge in a country where major companies thumb their nose at the State Tax Service and only 4 percent of the population filed tax returns.
While the demands were considerable, it was far from clear that the money the fund had in mind would be enough. The I.M.F. informed the Russians in early July that it was prepared to offer $5.6 billion in additional loans.
As the negotiations dragged on, the Russian economic picture worsened. A second attempt to sell off Russia's oil company, Rosneft, stalled. To attract investors, interest rates on Russian debt had risen higher than the rates paid by Nigeria, which was convulsed in its own upheaval. Russian coal miners, angry that they had not been paid, camped outside Mr. Kiriyenko's offices and demanded Mr. Yeltsin's resignation.
Returning from President Clinton's nine-day trip to China, the United States officials focused anew on Russia and were alarmed by what they saw. "We had a sense that Kiriyenko was running out of steam and that the Russian Government was getting politically more vulnerable," a senior State Department official said.
The sense of crisis was driven home when the Russians offered record interest rates at a auction for Russian Treasury bills on July 8 but were unable to attract enough buyers.
Now, Mr. Chubais and other top Yeltsin aides were becoming increasingly desperate. The Finance Ministry's ruble reserves to pay off maturing Treasury securities were shrinking fast. The Russian Government's internal forecast also showed that the Central Bank reserve of hard currency and gold, the funds it uses to prop up the ruble, would soon fall to $12 billion from twice that level a year ago. (By comparison, China has reserves of about $150 billion.)
Worse, every day the markets were open, both reserves were dwindling and it looked like the Government would be out of money before the negotiations with the I.M.F. would be wrapped up at the end of the month.
Mr. Chubais urgently appealed to Washington and at Treasury's urging, the I.M.F. doubled its offer to Russia to $11.2 billion. The World Bank kicked in several billion more. Japan made good on a $1.5 billion loan promised to President Yeltsin last April.
But the United States, which had offered $3 billion each in direct "backup financing" to Indonesia and South Korea last year, offered nothing to Russia. Officials feared that if they did, Congress would rebel, further threatening a long-standing effort in Congress to increase funding to the I.M.F., itself increasingly stretched.
Instead, the United States and its allies agreed to lend the fund $23 billion through an I.M.F. loan program not used in 20 years.
The I.M.F. insists that its tough approach worked. Mr. Yeltsin committed to a far-reaching effort to get Russia's budget under control. "What we had to do was accomplish real reform, to get the Russians out of this cycle of a crisis every six months," Mr. Fischer said.

Volvo's Profit Rose 48% in 2d Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Volvo A.B., Europe's seventh-largest car maker, said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose a greater-than-expected 48 percent, as sales in the United States and Europe rose and the company registered one-time gains from the sale of an investment. Volvo, based in Sweden, said its profit rose to 2.894 billion kronor ($362 million), from 1.961 billion a year earlier. 
 The company benefited from recovery in Europe's auto industry as the Continent's economy expands at its fastest pace this decade, suggesting sales of cars will keep rising.

Jobless Rate Declines

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
New York State's unemployment rate dipped slightly in June, and the number of private-sector jobs increased for the 16th month in the last 17, state statisticians reported yesterday.
Joblessness fell to 5.3 percent in June from 5.5 percent in May. The corresponding national unemployment rate for the month was 4.7 percent. 
 The State Labor Department said various segments of the economy reported hiring gains in June, including restaurants, food stores, manufacturing concerns, amusement and recreation services and lodging establishments.
Stephen Kagann, the chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki, said business, engineering and management services also performed well last month.
"Growth in these primarily high-paying, professional sectors is a positive economic indicator and demonstrate emerging economic growth," he said.
Over all, the Labor Department reported a 3,500-job gain between May and June, and an increase of 134,500 jobs, or 2 percent, between June 1997 and June 1998.
There were signs of lingering economic weakness, however. New York City's jobless rate of 7.4 percent in June -- though 2.2 percentage points lower than in June 1997 -- was still significantly higher than the state or national averages for last month.
And the counties with the highest joblessness in June anywhere in the state were both in New York City: the Bronx (9.1 percent) and Brooklyn (8.3 percent).

HEADLINE: A Woman's Worth: 1857 Letter Echoes Still;
Some Basic Disputes Over Feminism Persist

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN 

 BODY:
It wasn't until three years after the first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls in 1848 that Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton met. Yet the partnership they formed blossomed into an independent women's rights movement that won women the right to vote and set the foundation for 20th-century feminism's critique of American society.
Throughout their decades-long friendship, the two women maintained an intense and fascinating correspondance. There is an uncanny sense of recognition in reading these letters today. Science advances, laws are rewritten, the economy is transformed, but the debates about differences between the sexes and the role of women in marriage and the workplace remain. 
 With that immediacy in mind, The New York Times asked three writers to respond to excerpts from a letter Anthony wrote more than 140 years ago. Katha Pollitt is a columnist for The Nation and author of "Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1994). Dorothy Patterson is married to Paige Patterson, president of the Southern Baptists, and was on the seven-member committee that amended the denomination's essential statement of beliefs at the Southern Baptists' convention last month to include a declaration that a woman should "submit herself graciously" to her husband. Lynn Margulis, a scientist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is an author of "Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution" (Springer-Verlag, 1997) and "What is Sex?" (Simon & Schuster, 1997).
Reprinted at right, Anthony's letter to Stanton describes a debate Anthony had with the spiritualist and reformer Andrew Jackson Davis over the differences between men and women. Stanton had spoken on this issue in her address to the Seneca Falls convention, her first on women's rights, delivered 150 years ago tomorrow. In that speech, she scorned the notion that men were intellectually, morally or physically superior to women, and attacked the idea that the sexes were different but equal, saying that men "soon run this difference into the old groove of superiority."
Anthony argues that differences between men and woman are not inborn, but a result of society's influence. And she adds that reproduction is the "highest and holiest function."
This 1857 letter is included in a collection of correspondance and speeches by Stanton and Anthony and edited by Ellen Carl DuBois. Their writings trace the trajectory of their remarkable relationship.
At first glance, the two might seem something of an odd couple. Stanton, a member of one of New York's blue-blood families, married a prominent abolitionist and bore seven children. Plump and square, with a head of curls lined up like bedrolls and a penchant for naps, Stanton was known for her brilliance, education and cutting wit. Pictures of Anthony, on the other hand, invariably show her in a dark, somber dress, her hair tightly drawn into a severe bun and wire-rimmed spectacles perched on her nose. Unmarried her entire life, Anthony became a teacher after her father was wiped out in the economic panic of 1837. Though she fiercely believed that women should be able to support themselves independently, her first reformist efforts were not on behalf of her gender but of temperance.
Anthony, egged on by Stanton, eventually became fed up with the male leaders of the temperance movement, however, who bestowed second-class status on their female colleagues. Although it was Stanton who originally stoked Anthony's interest in feminism, it was Anthony who then drew her mentor more deeply into political reform: "In turning the intense earnestness and religious enthusiasm of this great-souled woman into this channel, I soon felt the power of my convert goading me forward to more untiring work." Stanton was the philosopher, Anthony the organizer.
Stanton often complained to Anthony of the difficulties of balancing her commitment to work with her family duties. Saying she would have to sit up all night to finish her speech on women's rights for the New York State Legislature in 1854, Stanton wrote to Anthony of the distractions at home: "Yesterday one of the boys shot an arrow into my baby's eye. The eye is safe, but oh! my fright when I saw the blood come and the organ swell and witnessed her suffering! What an escape! . . . Then, today, my nurse has gone home with a felon abcess on her finger. So you see how I am bound here." At another moment, she wrote, "It is in vain to look for the elevation of woman, so long as she is degraded in marriage."
Anthony served as Stanton's on-the-scene reporter, detailing the ins and outs of the reformers' struggles. Anthony's insecurity often comes through in her letters as she would appeal to Stanton for guidance. She fretted over a speech she had to give to the New York State Teachers Convention in 1856, writing: "If I get all the time the world has, I can't get up a decent document. So for the love of me and for the saving of the reputation of womanhood, I beg you, with one baby on your knee and another at your feet and four boys whistling, buzzing, hallooing Ma, Ma, set yourself about the work. It is but of small moment who writes the address, but of vast moment that it be well done. . . . Now will you load my gun, leaving me only to pull the trigger and let fly the powder and ball?"
The power of their intellect and vigor of their arguments make it seem natural to speak to them across the years. Pity that we can't hear their latest response.
 
 Collins, Sept. 29/57
Dear Mrs. Stanton
 
 How I do long to be with you this very minute, to have one look into your very soul, and one sound of your soul-stirring voice.
For a week, I was in such a home whirl. On Friday the 25th I left for the Collins Progressive Friends Meeting. Arrived Saturday A.M.
Mr. David set forth his idea of the nature of the sexes and their relation to each other . . . . He said woman's inherent nature is Love and Man's Wisdom. That Love reaches out to Wisdom -- Man -- and Wisdom reaches out to Love -- Woman -- and the two meet and make a beautiful blending of the two principles.
My soul was on fire. This is but a revamp of the world's idea from the beginning, the very same doctrine that consigned woman from the beginning to the sphere of the affections, that subjugated her to man's wisdom.
I said women. If you accept the theory given you by Davis, you may give up all talk of a change for woman: she is now where God and nature intended she should be. . . . such a doctrine makes my heart sink within me, said I. And did I accept it, I would return to my own father's house, and never again raise my voice for woman's right to the control of her own person, the ownership of her own earnings, the guardianship of her own children. For if this be true, she ought not to possess those rights. She ought to make final appeal to the wisdom of her husband, father and brother.
All day yesterday, the likeness and unlikeness of the sexes has been the topic of discussion. Phillip D. Moore of Newark took sides with me. Well on the love and wisdom side, we had Aaron M. Powell, George Taylor, Dr. Mary Taylor of Buffalo and a Mr. Lloyd of Pa. The discussion has been loud and long, and how I wished that you could be there. I tell you, Mrs. Stanton, after all, it is very precious to the soul of man, that he shall reign supreme in intellect, and it will take centuries if not ages to dispossess him of the fancy that he is born to do so.
The female doctor urged as a physiological fact that girl babies have from their births less physical vigor than the boy body. Then she claimed that there is ever passing from the woman out to man a "female arrow," an influence, she meant, that thrills his soul, all unlike that of man to man, etc. Well then here is a fact, a girl dressed in boy's clothes stands side by side with a young man and this "female arrow" is never perceived, a least not sufficiently to cause the recipient to suspect the sex at his side is other than his own.
Take that same being, array her in woman's dress, and tomorrow morning place her at the same spot . While the tones of her voice, the move of her hand, the glance of her are all the same as yesterday, her presence causes the sensuous thrill to rush to his very fingers and toes end. Now tell me the cause. Is the "arrow" in the being, does it go out to that young man from the brain, the soul, the femininity of that young woman, or is it in the flowing robes and waving tresses, in the knowledge of the difference of sex. The latter I say. At least to a very great extent. But say our opponents, such an admission is so gross, so animal. Well I can't help that. If it is fact, there it is. To me it is not coarse or gross, it is simply the answering of the highest and holiest function of the physical organism, that is that of reproduction. To be a mother, to be a father is the last and highest wish of any human, being, to reproduce himself or herself.
With best love,
SUSAN B. ANTHONY
 
Dear Susan B. Anthony: Three Contemporary Responses
 
Dear Susan B.
You have battled so nobly for the rights of your gender mates (to vote, to control the destiny of their own bodies, to act as guardians of their offspring and to manage their own financial resources) against the fancy that Man, in his Wisdom, is born to reign supreme in intellect.
Still, you provoke my response. Yes, there is the sensuous "thrill to rush to the man's very fingers and toes end" due to the "knowledge of the difference of sex," as you put it. But I disagree that your young man is fooled. He knows full well the "girl standing at his side and dressed in boy's clothes" has a triangular pubis. Her gait, her hip waddle, her peripheral glances betray her gender more profoundly than her long hair. Certainly if she were to don flowing robes open to the air and wafted by her waving tresses these might enhance his pleasure but they would not create his excitement in the first place. The urgency to mate persists in all people as in all other mammals because of the evolutionary drive to continue the species, the inborn imperative for genes to reproduce and hormonal differences that evolved over millions of years.
Both genders to a great degree are superficial. Some organisms I work with have four genders; some even more. (To biologists, genders are complementary mating types. In other words, an organism can mate and produce fertile offspring with a mature member of the same species who is of a different gender, but never with one of its same gender.) Hormonal differences lead to differences in men's and women's reproductive and other organs, metabolism, circulatory system, brain size and structure, and many aspects of behavior. Differences between men and women are never permanent and unchanging, but rather reflect frequencies in populations. For example, you'll find more tall people among a population of 20-year-old male basketball players than, say, 20-year-old female skaters. Similarly you'll find more weepers in the group of scorned lovers among women than men of the same age. But since the great gender differences are of relative number, rather than fixed type, generalizations are dangerous and the overgeneralizations (women=love; men=wisdom) are wicked.
A wonderful scientist friend of mine confided in me after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer how his life had changed. He had long since lost his sexual appetite and capacity to perform. With treatment, his raging hormones had subsided. Now for the first time in a long life he could, as he said, relate to women as people. This realization, this ability to take each person as an individual was not only new, it was delightful. Before the cancer, he confessed, we females, all of us, and not just his beloved wife, were to him titillating objects of potential pleasure. He now did not miss his once-active sex life. Sexually debilitated but strangely happy and encouraged, he remarked that his loss inspired him to listen to women undistractedly. Suffering a genital tumor ironically led him to enhance to twice the number of his many friends.
Although the detail of our sexual energies and their objects and objectives vastly vary, the existence of our sexuality itself is an undeniable truth. For two billion years, at least, all our ancestors have been sexual beings or they simply never would have survived. To me, a lover of knowledge, this truth so "gross," so "animal" deserves celebration not denial. All of us from fertile egg to embryo to corpse, are exactly that: warm, wet, furry animals compelled by the sexuality of our forefathers and foremothers to be, either directly or indirectly, our own exciting and excitable, provocative and provocable selves.
With fond admiration for the truth and beauty of your own rigorous efforts on our behalf.
 
LYNN
 
Dear Ms. Anthony,
You are to be commended for your untiring efforts in behalf of women, your intervention in cases of injustice, your successful efforts in securing for women the right to vote and your opposition to infanticide and abortion as "disgusting and degrading crimes."
Your letter to Elizabeth Stanton has crossed my desk with a request that I reply to some of the thoughts presented. You are precisely correct when you argue that the differences between men and women cannot be explained with "love" (as representative of women) and "wisdom" (as representative of men). This conclusion cannot be supported from the Bible, in which husbands are directed to "love their wives as Christ loved the church" (Ephesians 5:25) and wives are admonished to follow the example of the proverbs "woman of strength" who "opened her mouth with wisdom" (Proverb 31:26). Women do indeed have a tremendous natural capacity to love. Wisdom is presented in Scripture as a spiritual gift (1 Corinthians 12:8) and is thus available to women or men, according to divine distribution. Physiological differences obviously are present in the design of the human body. Modern diapers even accommodate gender differences! Required skill tests in the military have been adjusted to reflect different standards for women in order to accommodate those physiological differences from men.
Preoccupation with a personal agenda or political cause can blur the remarkable genders and can prohibit an appreciation of the role assignments God has given as well as open the door to personal bitterness not only toward the opposite sex but also toward God Himself.
We must indeed insist that women have protection from injustices in every venue, freedom to express themselves, and the opportunity to pursue the highest levels of achievement. However, in pursuing these goals, we dare not "throw out the baby with the bath;" i.e., we must not abrogate the directives God has given for relationships between husbands and wives and for responsibilities of parents to their children. To do so opens the door for a society in which the marriages fail, children become violent and society itself abandons all absolutes.
Biblical directives to men and women are based upon their equality. Both are created in the image of God; both are ultimately responsible to God. However, from the moment of creation, differences are evident in how men and women are to function in the world. God created the woman as a "helper comparable to him" (the man). This compound expression describes perfectly the complementarity God designed -- the woman is "comparable" or like the man -- also in God's image; but the woman is a "helper": she has a different function or role assignment than the man. Thus, when they become "one flesh" in marriage, their union brings commonality of personhood and uniqueness of role assignments, enabling them to function better together than either could do alone.
One other danger is to suggest that the union of one man and one woman in marriage is primarily for reproduction. There is a unique joy and reward in linking hands with the Creator Himself to produce offspring, the next generation. However, wedded bliss is not limited to procreation but includes spiritual fellowship, loving companionship and sexual satisfaction.
So, my dear Mrs. Anthony, we agree on the value of women to their families, to society, and especially to God, whose children they are! We agree that they are to be protected from injustices, respected, honored, and encouraged to reach their highest potential. We would probably disagree on defining that highest potential. From my perspective, for a woman who chooses to marry, happiness and productivity will come from willingly submitting herself to the servant leadership of her husband, thereby coming under his provision and protection, and willingly making herself available to conceive and nurture offspring if God so blesses.
For me as a wife, these responsibilities surpass all others and demand my freshest energies, greatest creativity and complete commitment. My determination to accept these priorities and the responsibilities associated therewith are ultimately in obedience to God, and thus my obedience is ultimately to Him.
 
MRS. DOROTHY PATTERSON

Dear Susan B. Anthony,
How I wish you could see the way the women's movement you helped to start has transformed our society -- for the better. The life patterns of men and women have altered unrecognizably since your day.
We go to school together, work together, share a vastly enlarged terrain of common interests, even borrow from each other's wardrobes. Women are professors, Supreme Court justices, union organizers, bus drivers and bartenders. Most of the flagrant legal injustices you fought -- the unequal marriage laws, for instance, that gave men automatic custody of children, despite much sentimental swooning over motherhood -- have been swept away. Your generation of feminists, who in an age without reliable contraception put their faith in "voluntary motherhood," i.e. marital celibacy, and who tended to emphasize the dangers of sex over its pleasures, might blanch a bit at the vast enthusiasm of both sexes for nonmarital and nonreproductive sex, abortion and birth control, small families, divorce, dirty dancing and sexy underwear -- even homosexuality.
In your day prostitution was a major industry, but even the most dissolute roue felt entitled to marry a virgin. Today a man who made such a demand would sound like a religious maniac or a pervert -- or someone who feared he couldn't measure up to comparison. Feminism is not the only cause of these momentous changes, but it has helped women to shape them according to their own needs and experiences.
Some things haven't changed, though. Women are still the second sex -- on the receiving end of a great deal of sexual violence, discrimination and cultural misogyny. Feminism is still blamed for every social problem under the sun, from juvenile crime (everything to do with children is still women's fault) to poverty. Tom Edsall, a respected political commentator with The Washington Post, even linked feminism with the Oklahoma City bombing, implying that once women discovered their clitorises (ask Mrs. Stanton), they no longer needed men, who had to compensate by joining violent militia groups that stressed "hyper-masculinity." There are plenty of people (including some women) who would like to see women put back in their place: subject to their husbands and dependent on marriage for a decent life, punished for having children out of wedlock or seeking a divorce, marginalized in the work place. "Stigma" is a popular word in policy circles these days.
Another thing that hasn't changed is the importance attached by many to the question of differences between the sexes. It seems that the more our actual lives converge, the more tightly we cling to the notion that inalterable bedrock natural principles prove that the process has reached its outer limit. Few men could get away with claiming, like your self-satisfied Mr. David, that women's "inherent nature" was love and man's wisdom. But men are from Mars and women from Venus? The double standard permanently imprinted on our genes by evolution? Biological differences in the brain that explain why women can't excel at math or chess, enjoy pornography, find their car in the parking lot -- even though lots of women do all those things? No one would deny that biological differences exist between the sexes, although it's not so easy to pin them down or explain why they matter. And here the historical record ought to give us pause. After all, in your day expert opinion was positive that college education made women infertile and drove them insane.
People are always saying feminism is dead -- in fact, Time magazine put a very unflattering dead-looking photo of you on its cover just the other week. But of course, that's nonsense. Millions of women today proudly claim to be feminists, and millions more (the great majority) support the movement's goals even if they reject the label. I think the sociologist Arlie Hochschild had it right when she said we are in the middle of a stalled revolution, in which women's demands for equality at work and home, for social respect have come up against some rather resistant features of American life, from the lack of reliable high-quality child care to men who don't do their fair share at home. The good news: the Treasury put your face on the dollar coin. The bad news: the coin looks like a quarter and annoys everybody. I'd say we need another 150 years.
In sisterhood,
KATHA POLLITT

A Closer Look at Slavery's Many Stages

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
For many people today, thinking about slavery in America conjures up the image of bent black backs toiling on enormous cotton plantations patrolled by whip-cracking overseers.
But in "Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America," to be published by Harvard University Press in September, Prof. Ira Berlin of the University of Maryland says the picture is much more varied and complex. 
 Billed as the first comprehensive account of American slavery, Professor Berlin's book is causing a buzz among scholars. "This is the first book to treat slavery in such a broad perspective covering all 13 colonies, the French and Spanish areas and the links to West Africa," Prof. Eric Foner of Columbia University says. "It shows there were different kinds of slavery at different times."
Indeed, Mr. Berlin depicts the slaves' world as highly diversified. It is a world where the first slaves reach North America already familiar with European ways and languages. It is a world where the North is as enthusiastic about slavery as the South. It is a world where many become artisans and soldiers and where some acquire freedom, property, even slaves of their own.
Mr. Berlin explains how the development of plantation farming -- tobacco around the Chesapeake Bay, rice and indigo in South Carolina and cotton and sugar in Florida and the lower Mississippi -- produced a vastly enlarged slave trade, direct from West Africa. This ultimately transformed these regions from what Professor Berlin terms "societies with slaves" into even more brutal "slave societies."
Professor Berlin goes back to the beginning of the slave trade, in the early 17th century. The first slaves were primarily Creoles, people of mixed race who had already rubbed shoulders with Europeans in the West Indies or the trading posts of West Africa. They worked alongside white laborers, often acquiring skills and buying their freedom. Anthony Johnson, for example, sold at Jamestown in 1621 as "Antonio a Negro," ended up a prosperous free farmer with a 250-acre Virginia estate.
This pattern lasted longest in the Northern states, where the absence of plantation farming kept the slave population below 50,000 throughout the 18th century.
But a growing labor shortage produced a mini-influx to the North in mid-century. Slave life became harsher. Many slaves spurned Christianity and returned to their African roots. They used their original African names and invented private role-reversal festivals like Negro Election Day, when slaves pretended to elect their black kings, governors and judges.
Although the Northern states freed their slaves after the Revolution, these laws were full of loopholes and slow to take effect. In the South, plantation farming brought an explosion in the slave population. Around the Chesapeake Bay, it rose from fewer than 5,000 in 1680 to more than 800,000 by 1810; in South Carolina and Georgia, from a mere 200 to more than 300,000, and in the lower Mississippi Valley, from none to more than 50,000.
But conditions varied among these slave societies. The danger of Spanish and Indian attack forced South Carolina to recruit slaves into its militia. As plantation owners moved into new towns, they took with them slaves who often set up small businesses, while in the countryside agricultural slaves were allowed to cultivate private gardens and therefore gained a measure of economic independence.
In Florida and the Mississippi Valley, Creoles at first gained considerable freedom, especially under Spanish rule. But a plantation economy requiring many slaves and harsher discipline developed in the 1790's after slave revolts in Haiti created a market for American sugar.
After the United States made the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, American planters poured down the Mississippi Valley to create another slave society ruled by King Cotton. Instead of the the stable, antebellum slave society depicted in literature and film, Professor Berlin argues, it was a time of upheaval marked by revolts inspired by the French and American Revolutions, by an enormous migration of slaves from the eastern states.
Mr. Berlin's new picture of early slave society may end up bringing revisions in the concept of the later slave culture. As Stephen Hahan, a historian of slavery at the University of California at San Diego, put it: "The traditional picture of the Old South as a tranquil gentocracy may need revision."

HEADLINE: More Maneuvering and More Delay for Banking Bill

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
As Congress prepares for its summer recess, leaders of the Senate Banking Committee have indicated they will delay until September consideration of a measure that would modernize the nation's banking laws.
Behind this delay is a series of meetings taking place in New York and Washington to solidify industry support of the measure and press important regulators -- mainly the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan -- to settle differences seen as the main obstacle to passage. 
 The House passed the measure -- which would remove barriers that now prevent banks, insurance companies and brokers from easily merging into large financial conglomerates -- by a one-vote margin in May. The House had never before passed the bill. The move to the Senate, which has approved a version of the bill in the past by wide margins, brings it closer to law after nearly two decades.
On Monday, in New York, Howard A. Menell, the chief of staff for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate committee, met in private with representatives of the insurance industry and some big banks to solidify their support of the measure and to resolve differences. On July 10, in Washington, a similar private meeting took place involving banking and insurance industry lobbyists, with Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who is the second-ranking committee member, acting as chairman.
"The message to us was that 'D'Amato wants a bill this year,' " said one lobbyist who attended the Gramm meeting but insisted on anonymity. "It was a calm, deliberate meeting in which Gramm asked us what we wanted to retain and delete from the House version. They are putting into place the procedures to get a bill passed and they are reaching out to the biggest players in banking, insurance and securities.
"The meeting with Gramm was enormously substantive and very, very serious. Senators like Gramm don't spend an hour and a half on a Friday afternoon for window-dressing or on a bill that's dead in the water."
Another financial services industry lobbyist, who also insisted ton anonymity, said: "They are moving a step at a time to put the pieces together to get a bill through. Every member of the committee recognizes that D'Amato is intent on getting a bill through and that compares to a couple of weeks ago when it was unclear whether D'Amato really wanted to move."
There had been some thought that the Senate Banking Committee might consider the measure this month and get it to the Senate floor before the August recess. But that timetable was not met.
Still, leading lobbyists say the delay is not necessarily bad. No one wanted committee passage in July and then a wait until September for the full Senate to take up the measure, providing four weeks for critics to take pot shots. Besides, two other important banking measures, a credit union bill and a bill dealing with burdensome banking regulations, are still before the committee, creating a logjam.
"There are a lot of positive signs now," said David Pratt, senior vice president of the American Insurance Association, which represents property and casualty companies. "There is a serious and positive effort to take time and do this bill right. We're detecting bipartisan support, and the committee is working to minimize all struggles."
The main concern involves a jurisdictional battle between Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin over whether the Federal Reserve or the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency should regulate banks. At a June hearing before Senator D'Amato's committee, neither regulator gave ground, and since then Mr. Greenspan has repeated his view that nontraditional banking activities, such as insurance, merchant banking, securities underwriting and real estate development, should be placed in bank holding company affiliates, regulated by the Fed, rather than established as bank operating subsidiaries, regulated by the Comptroller of the Currency.
But a new strategy has emerged: Industry leaders who back the measure, and those who are leaning toward supporting it, are being encouraged by Banking Committee members to resolve their differences as a way of pressing Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin -- neither of whom is eager to be seen as the obstacle to financial services modernization. The thinking is that if these two regulators conclude that the bill might pass, then they might compromise.
Right now, the House measure embodies the views of Mr. Greenspan and, lobbyists say, it appears that the Senate Banking Committee agrees with that viewpoint.
Because of that, some believe Mr. Greenspan has the advantage -- after all, the Senate could enact the same measure as the House.
If so, Mr. Rubin has said he will recommend a Presidential veto. But it is unclear whether President Clinton would accept this recommendation in light of the difficulty of getting the measure passed and the fast pace of financial services mergers. Besides, some lobbyists say, the President, too, would not want to be seen as blocking a bill to make American banks more globally competitive.
At the same time, however, lobbyists say Mr. Greenspan wants the bill so much that he may be more open to a compromise. For instance, he might budge and allow some of the new financial services activities to be regulated by the Treasury -- a move that could press Mr. Rubin to relent.
"If the legislation is to move, either Greenspan or Rubin has to blink," said Kenneth Guenther, a lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association. "Wanting the bill are D'Amato; Senator Paul Sarbanes, the ranking Democrat on the committee, who opposed it in the past, and Greenspan. That puts pressure on Rubin and the Administration."
Added pressure comes from the accusation that Congress has had an unproductive session. Passing this bill would improve that image. "This would be an important accomplishment for this Congress," Mr. Pratt of the insurance association said. "This is a good issue for senators to take home and say they did something to help keep the economy going at a high rate and to keep our country competitive with the rest of the world."

HEADLINE: G.M. and Union Agree to Start Arbitration on Wednesday

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., July 17

 BODY:
General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union said today that they would begin meeting with an arbitrator on Wednesday to resolve the legality of the union's crippling strikes here against the company, as bargaining between the two sides remained deadlocked.
G.M. and U.A.W. officials will meet in Detroit with Thomas Roberts, a 74-year-old arbitrator from California best known for having resolved many baseball salary disputes over the years. U.A.W. officials had supported arbitration but had resisted any quick hearing until a Federal judge, responding to a lawsuit by G.M., asked the two sides here two days ago to move more quickly. 
 While both sides insist that any settlement of the strikes will come at the bargaining table, negotiations have ground to a virtual halt in anticipation of the arbitrator's decision. Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for G.M. issues, said it was impossible to say how many days of closed-door hearings the arbitrator might hold before issuing a decision.
At stake in the arbitration is the U.A.W.'s ability to continue shutting down G.M. periodically by going on strike at just one or two important parts factories. Strikes by 9,200 workers at two parts factories here have forced G.M. to stop production at 26 of its 29 assembly plants in North America and at scores of other parts factories.
Under the U.A.W.'s national agreement with G.M., national strikes are illegal, but factory-level strikes are legal provided they involve disputes over health, safety, production standards or subcontracting. G.M. contends that the union has invented such disputes at the two factories here. The U.A.W. insists that these are real issues in the factories, but has been using the strikes here to demand that G.M. invest more money in new equipment here. The national agreement, which runs until late 1999, does not allow strikes over G.M. investment decisions.
The U.A.W. prefers local strikes because it has to pay strike benefits only to the workers who actually walk out, while most states allow temporarily laid-off workers to collect unemployment benefits instead.
G.M. said today that it had temporarily laid off 186,400 workers so far, including 1,300 workers today at a parts factory in El Paso and 5,100 workers at a group of parts factories in eastern Mexico. G.M.'s outside suppliers have laid off tens of thousands of additional workers.
The Labor Department has repeatedly offered the services of Federal mediators, and quietly did so again on Wednesday, a department official said today. But G.M. and U.A.W. officials said today that they could settle the issues themselves. While both sides have avoided the use of Federal mediators in dozens of previous strikes, some labor experts have speculated that the two sides may eventually allow President Clinton to play a role so as to create a face-saving way for the two sides to back away from their entrenched positions in a costly showdown.
The U.A.W. has been threatening strikes at more factories. Workers will hold a vote on Sunday at the giant Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., on whether to strike there.
The Saturn factory is the only G.M. assembly plant still producing cars or trucks in the United States, although 2,800 workers have been called back at another factory in Pontiac, Mich., to prepare for production this autumn of a new full-size pickup truck model. Strike votes are partly symbolic, because union leaders later decide whether an actual walkout is necessary.
The presidents and chairmen of more than 100 local G.M. units of the U.A.W. will meet here on Monday to discuss strategy and hold a rally with striking workers.

HEADLINE: The Short End of Long Hours;
A Female Lawyer's Job Puts Child Custody at Risk

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 13

 BODY:
Alice Hector thought she had found a way to be both a mother and a winning litigator at one of this city's top law firms.
Courts, of course, do not adjourn to let a lawyer tend to a sick child, and trials can stretch a workday to 14 hours. But Ms. Hector easily earned enough as a partner at Steel, Hector & Davis to hire a nanny to care for her two young girls when she was not around. And while she says she encouraged her husband, an unemployed architect and builder, to find a job, she benefited from the time he spent at home. 
 But now that the couple have split, a court has ruled that Ms. Hector cannot have it all. Noting Ms. Hector's long hours and the time that her ex-husband, Robert Young, spent at home and volunteering at the girls' school, the Florida appeals court gave primary custody to Mr. Young.
The June 24 decision devastated Ms. Hector and sent shock waves through the halls of Steel, Hector, which has a reputation for employing high-powered female lawyers, including Janet Reno, the Attorney General, and Patricia Seitz, the first female president of the Florida Bar Association. One of the firm's named partners is Ms. Hector's uncle.
"This means that if you work," she said, "there is a danger that you could lose your children."
Lance A. Harke, a partner at the 170-lawyer firm who represents Ms. Hector and has three young children of his own, added, "Every moment that you're not with your kids is a moment that can be used against you."
Mr. Young counters that the appeals court simply overturned a decision that discriminated against him and other stay-at-home fathers. The trial court had awarded primary custody to Ms. Hector, with liberal visitation rights to Mr. Young.
"The reason she was able to devote so much time to her vocation is that I made my vocation my kids," Mr. Young said. "Dads can be moms, too."
Whatever the final outcome of this case, it is a cautionary tale for mothers -- and fathers -- who try to balance parenthood with professional ambition, and also for professional firms or companies where there is pressure, whether real or imagined, to work long hours.
It is also powerful evidence that society and the law have moved far past the presumption that the mother, unless she is shown to be unfit, should automatically get custody. The appeals court, in fact, bent over backward to be gender-blind, referring not to "he" and "she," or "the father" and "the mother," but to "the architect" and "the attorney."
The case is not the first in which a successful, hard-working female lawyer lost custody or was threatened with it when her marriage turned sour. In 1994, Sharon Prost, a counsel to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, lost primary custody of her two sons to her former husband. And in 1995, the estranged husband of Marcia Clark, the Los Angeles County prosecutor, argued that he should get custody of the couple's two sons, citing Ms. Clark's 16-hour workdays during the O. J. Simpson trial.
And there are likely to be more such cases. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that nearly a quarter of women in two-income households earn the higher salary. Many of them, like Ms. Hector, probably put in more hours at work than their husbands. And, in some cases, mothers have lost custody in courts that seemed to be biased against working women, some studies show. "There is a strong undercurrent," said Melanie Berry, editor of Executive Baby, a newsletter for working mothers in Mount Airy, Md., "that women who are mothers should be home with their children."
Many women's groups have agreed that custody should be awarded to whichever parent has had primary responsibility for taking care of the children through the years -- a standard the Florida appeals court said it used in this case.
Although the court awarded primary custody to Mr. Young, Ms. Hector got liberal visitation rights.
But Ms. Hector said the three-man appeals court took a hard stand against her simply because she was a mother pursuing a challenging career, and she is asking for a new hearing. And she insists that despite her demanding job, she spent more time with her girls, now 9 and 12, than her ex-husband did.
Law firms have found it especially hard to accommodate working parents because of the pressure on lawyers to bill hours to clients and earn money for the firm, said Robin Hardman, communications director for the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group in Manhattan. "Law firms traditionally have had a very tough time," she said, "being family-friendly."
Mr. Young recently hired three female lawyers, all solo practitioners, to argue his case. The women -- two of whom are mothers -- said they had avoided working at a big firm like Steel, Hector because they wanted to keep flexible schedules.
"If you want to be a litigation partner at an extremely high-powered law firm, and you're married to man who has decided to stay home with the children," said Barbara Green, one of Mr. Young's lawyers, "it is generally best, if there is a divorce, for the children to stay with him."
Ms. Green said she had decided to set up her office in Coral Gables, a suburb of Miami, rather than in downtown Miami, so she could work a few blocks from her 9-year-old son's school. "You set your priorities," she said.
"Maybe," she added, "we should talk about making the workplace more humane."
Joseph P. Klock Jr., managing partner at Steel, Hector, said the firm would not have 25 women as partners if it had not made accommodations for working mothers. But he added, "The lawyer business is not 9 to 5."
"Any professional has to adjust their schedule to accommodate their family," he said. He called the appeals court decision an "incorrect" ruling that hurt all working women and a decision that he believes will be overturned.
Mr. Klock said he tells his own two daughters they can grow up to be lawyers or anything they want to be. "I don't want to have to tell them that if they do that," he said, "they better not have any kids."
Of course, few custody cases have a clear set of facts. That is the case here, which is why there is still a dispute between Ms. Hector, who turns 53 this week, and Mr. Young, 45, who now has a job as a senior program director at the local Y.M.C.A.
Both sides asked that the children not be named to protect their privacy.
Mr. Young said that Ms. Hector rarely made it home in time to have dinner with the girls and one year spent 100 days traveling because of work. And at least once, he said, Ms. Hector asked him to take the children away from home while she concentrated on a continuing trial. "She wanted no distractions," he said. "She didn't want to come home to any kids crying or anything that would cause her to lose sleep."
He points to testimony by the girls' teachers and mothers of the girls' friends who said they rarely saw Ms. Hector. The mothers also praised Mr. Young's volunteer work, which included founding a Brownie troop and coaching a soccer team.
"I'd walk down the hall, and most of the kids knew me," Mr. Young said. "They called me 'Coach Bob.' "
One mother testified that she once saw Ms. Hector read lawbooks while attending a school performance.
Ms. Hector said she did not read while her child was on stage. "I probably took a lawbook," she said, "so that I could bill hours and still be there."
She said that even though Mr. Young did not have a regular job, she still spent more time with the girls and also did most of the household chores. The housekeeper often picked up the children from school, she said, even though Mr. Young was at home. She also said that her former husband did not begin much of his school volunteer work until after she had filed for divorce and he worried that he could lose custody.
In her request for a new hearing, Ms. Hector said that from 1993 to 1996, she was with the children almost 70 percent of the time that they were not sleeping or in school, while Mr. Young was with them about 30 percent of that time. In her court brief, Ms. Hector gives this example of a typical morning: "Mother wakes up children, picks up the newspaper, gets the children dressed, feeds them breakfast, makes their lunch, cleans up the kitchen, feeds the animals, takes garbage and recycling to street, makes the beds and drives the children to school. Father in bed."
Mr. Young's version: "I let them sit at the table and have nice conversations because we had that at dinner."
Ms. Hector said that through the years, she has been consistently available for her children, while Mr. Young had spent months at a time away from home, including a year searching for buried treasure in the mountains of New Mexico. On that trip, Mr. Young had an affair, which helped prompt Ms. Hector to file for a divorce.
Ms. Hector said she often urged Mr. Young to get a job. "I wanted him to work," she said, "and support us and be a good husband."
But Mr. Young said he gave up a construction firm that he had owned in New Mexico, where the couple had met and first lived, to follow Ms. Hector to Miami so she could further her own career.
Mr. Young said he was not able to start a similar business in Florida because of the state's poor economy when the family arrived, his heavy business debt and his lack of computer training.
And even when he had a full-time job in New Mexico, Mr. Young contends that he had a different approach to being a parent from his wife. For example, he often toted a baby along to his construction sites.
In his current job at the Y.M.C.A., Mr. Young says he makes about one-tenth what his former wife earns, which he said was more than $300,000 a year, though she said it was much less. He is asking the court to order Ms. Hector to pay him both alimony and child support.
Ms. Hector said that in recent years, she limited the number of hours she works and was now spending only 40 to 50 hours a week at the office, which, she said, has lowered her income.
When she heard about the appeals court decision, Ms. Hector said she sat at her desk for four hours, shifting papers back and forth without looking at them.
"I was in complete shock," said Ms. Hector, who also has two grown children from a previous marriage. "I cried for days."
"I have worked and been a mother for 25 years," she said. "It always seemed to me that you just became more efficient and gave up your social life so that you could spend any time that you are not working with the children."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Trade Deficit Sets a Record As Exports Sag

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit shot up again in May to a record, the Commerce Department reported today, providing compelling evidence that the economy stalled in the spring.
The deficit rose to $15.8 billion in May, from $14.3 billion in April, a far bigger increase than economists had expected. It was the fourth consecutive month that the deficit reached a new high as Asia's financial crisis continues to ripple across the Pacific. 
 Exports declined for the second consecutive month, to $76.2 billion, the lowest level in 15 months, primarily because of weak demand from Asia for American manufactured goods and farm products. Imports rose slightly, to $92 billion, reflecting the effects of a strong dollar and a continued spending spree by American consumers.
For the first five months of the year, the cumulative trade deficit is $64.9 billion, a 39.6 percent increase over the period a year earlier.
"Some of our best world customers find themselves struggling in economic decline and financial instability," said William M. Daley, the Commerce Secretary.
Economists said the deteriorating trade situation had offset healthy domestic demand in the second quarter. They said it was even possible that the American economy contracted during April, May and June, in what would be a stunning turnabout from a 5.4 percent growth rate in the first quarter. The economy, repeatedly defying predictions of a slowdown, has grown steadily since March 1991. The Commerce Department will release its first estimate of second-quarter growth on July 31.
The trade troubles are one of several developments contributing to a sharp deceleration in growth. Others include the strike against the General Motors Corporation and a cutback in orders by companies seeking to reduce big inventories.
"The U.S. economy went into reverse in the spring," said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, which discarded its forecast that the economy grew 1 percent in the second quarter and now estimates the economy contracted at a 1 percent rate.
A number of other Wall Street firms and banks sharply cut their growth estimates. Joel L. Naroff, an economist at First Union Bank in Philadelphia, said there was "a very good possibility" that the economy shrank last quarter. A month ago, he had predicted growth of 1 to 1.5 percent.
Most economists said the economy was probably rebounding already, although the degree of its strength and the outlook for the rest of this year and next year remain uncertain. They said that there was little prospect of a recession and that the economy continued to exhibit many strengths, including low unemployment and an inflation rate that is almost nonexistent.
"If we had a negative quarter, it's probably a one-shot wonder," Mr. Naroff said.
The question now is whether the second-quarter slowdown is a blip or the beginning of something more fundamental. To a large extent, the answer will depend on whether Asia-induced weakness, which is primarily affecting manufacturers and farmers, will worsen and infect the consumer and service sectors of the economy, which despite some recent signs of slowing have remained generally robust.
Asia's woes are already taking a big toll in some places. AMP Inc., a maker of connectors for electrical equipment, said today that it would eliminate 3,500 jobs, or 7.5 percent of its work force, by closing plants in Loganville, Pa., and Kernersville, N.C. The company cited falling demand from Asia as a main reason for the cutback.
But the stock market has continued to boom despite nervousness among investors about Asia's effects on corporate profits. Job growth has remained healthy, and consumer confidence has held up.
"This may be as bad as it gets," said Michael Fenollosa, an economist at John Hancock, the Boston-based insurance company. "The second half of the year should see Asian economies stabilize and start to recover, which should stanch the hemorrhaging of our trade deficit."
If the trade deficit stabilizes, the G.M. strike is settled and companies work off their excess inventories, the economy could resume growing at an annual rate of 3 percent or higher by the end of the year, economists said.
But with Japan still struggling to pull itself out of a deep economic swoon and Indonesia and other nations still being battered by the fallout from the financial crisis that erupted a year ago, Asia remains a big question mark in any forecast.
Should the economy remain hobbled by Asia, that would eliminate concerns that a combination of strong growth and low unemployment was creating inflationary pressure that would require an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, even though there have been no signs of economy-wide price increases.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has held off pressure from some members of the central bank's policy-setting committee for an interest rate increase in recent months. The new evidence that the economy has slowed on its own seems to validate his position -- and to raise the question of whether the Fed's next move might be to reduce rates.
Today's trade figures showed that exports to the Pacific Rim countries dropped to $13.4 billion in May from $13.9 billion in April and from $17 billion in May 1997.
The deficit in trade of goods with Japan narrowed for the month, to $5 billion from $5.4 billion, but has expanded to $25.8 billion for the first five months of the year from $21.9 billion in the corresponding period last year. The Commerce Department said exports of soybeans and automobiles declined in May, as did imports from Japan of computers and electrical machinery.
The deficit with China expanded to $4.6 billion in May from $4.3 billion in April. For the first five months of the year, the deficit with China was $20.4 billion, compared with $16.9 billion in the period last year. Among the biggest declines in May were exports of aircraft, while imports from China of telecommunications equipment, shoes and clothing all increased.
The trade deficit with Indonesia narrowed slightly in May, to $573 million from $576 million in April. But exports continued to tumble, to $132.5 million in May from $160 million in April. Through the first five months of this year, exports to Indonesia totaled $906 million. During the corresponding period last year, exports were $1.8 billion.
In remarks to reporters at the White House, President Clinton said "the American people should be concerned" about the deteriorating trade numbers. He said the problem showed why Congress should act quickly on his request to provide more money to the International Monetary Fund, which has led efforts to restore stability to Asia.
"We need to restore growth in Japan, restore growth in Asia," Mr. Clinton said. "And our major goal here for our own actions should be to pay our fair share to the International Monetary Fund so we can support economic recovery, so they can afford to buy our products."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
3 Market Barometers Climb Into Record Territory Again

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Major stock market measures again reached records yesterday, but on modest gains. The Nasdaq composite index rose to its eighth consecutive high, propelled by earnings from Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.
"Earnings are coming in better than expected, and money's moving into the big stocks," said Tim Stevenson, a money manager with First Union's Capital Management Group. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.78 points, to 9,337.97, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 2.76, to 1,186.75, topping Thursday's highs. The Nasdaq composite index gained 8.20, to 2,008.76.
It was the third time this week that the Dow, S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq set records on the same day; before this week, the last time the three market barometers reached highs together was on April 21. The week's surge sent the Dow up 2.6 percent, past 9,300. The S.& P. 500 advanced 1.9 percent. The Nasdaq, which crossed the 2,000 milestone on Thursday, gained 3.4 percent.
Nasdaq's stalwarts rose to new highs. Microsoft was up 9/16, to 117 15/16, after reporting earnings that were better than expected. Dell Computer, whose stock has almost tripled this year, climbed 3 13/16, to 117 9/16, its eighth consecutive gain.
Sun Microsystems jumped 2 1/16, to 52, after reporting a 21 percent increase in profit. Strong United States sales offset a slowdown in Japan.
EMC, a maker of computer data-storage systems, led computer shares higher, rising 4 3/16, to a record 52 7/16, after topping estimates with a 47 percent increase in second-quarter profits.
Cisco Systems Inc., up 79 percent this year, rallied 4, to a record 99 3/4. Tellabs Inc. gained 1 15/16, to a record 86 11/16. On Thursday, Tellabs said quarterly profit surged 47 percent amid strong demand for its equipment, which directs traffic on phone networks.
Of the 162 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, about 60 percent reported earnings that topped expectations, while 16 percent fell short. Quarterly earnings are up just 2.3 percent from the period a year earlier, according to I.B.E.S. International. Excluding General Motors, Intel, Motorola and Compaq Computer, earnings grew almost 11 percent.
Pepsico Inc. rose 1 9/16, to 39 1/2, its first gain all week, after the soda and snack food company said on Thursday that earnings before special accounting adjustments rose 19 percent, topping forecasts.
Even as the major indexes gained, declining stocks outnumbered advancers, 1,550 to 1,383, on the New York Stock Exchange. Some investors see that as a bad sign. They note that stocks, as valued by price-to-earnings ratios, are near all-time highs and that the economic crisis in Asia has yet to be fully felt.
"We're getting a market that's driven higher by fewer and fewer stocks," said Thomas Hudson, manager of the $9 billion Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund. "If you're cyclical or exposed to Asia, the market is inflicting heavy damage. And nobody knows yet how serious Asia will be on profits."

Treasury Prices Fall As Dollar Weakens

BYLINE: By Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended lower in quiet trading yesterday, hurt in part by a weaker dollar.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/23, to 105 12/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.74 percent, from 5.72 percent Thursday. A week ago, the yield was 5.62 percent. 
 Traders and analysts said a report yesterday showing a wider-than-expected United States trade deficit for May failed to bolster a thinly traded market early in the day.
Uncertainty over a successor to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan and a long holiday weekend there also depressed trading, traders said. Japanese markets will be closed Monday for Marine Day.
"The trade data, pointing to lower second-quarter G.D.P., would have been positive," said William Gamba, senior vice president at S. G. Cowen. "But with Tokyo closed over the weekend and this being one of those summer doldrums Fridays, things have tapered off toward the end of the session."
Treasury prices followed the dollar lower in overseas trading yesterday after remarks by the top candidates to succeed Mr. Hashimoto raised the market's optimism about the chances for a Japanese banking overhaul, traders said.
Although the dollar had largely recovered by the start of New York trading, bonds were unable to get much mileage from the trade data.
The huge gap should have helped push Treasury prices higher, said Dan Seto, senior economist at Nikko Securities. "The Asia impact is clearly beginning to show through," he said. He added, however, that investors may be wary ahead of Tuesday's scheduled Congressional testimony from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

HEADLINE: Robert Connery, 90, Author and Instructor

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Robert Howe Connery, a prolific author as well as a teacher and administrator, died on July 3 at a retirement community in Falls Church, Va. He was 90.
Dr. Connery taught at various universities for over four decades. He was the author, co-author or editor of more than a score of books, including a classic study, "Rockefeller of New York: Executive Power in the Statehouse," written with Gerald Benjamin. 
 "I came across 'Rockefeller of New York' shortly after it was published in 1979," Gov.-elect Mario M. Cuomo said in December 1982. "It told me more about the workings of state government than all the other pertinent books, monographs, articles and white papers I had read combined."
Dr. Connery served Mayor Robert F. Wagner as Deputy City Administrator in 1965. He previously acted as senior consultant to the State Commission on Governmental Operations of the City of New York and executive secretary of the city's Committee on Modern Zoning. After his retirement from Columbia in 1976, city administrators continued to consult with him for some time.
He was president of the Academy of Political Science from 1966 to 1986 and edited some 40 volumes of its proceedings. His scholarly writings ranged widely over Federal, state and local issues. Even his 1935 doctoral dissertation, "Governmental Problems in Wildlife Conservation," stirred considerable interest. It led to his debut as a government consultant in a dispute between New York and New Jersey over shad fisheries in the Hudson River. It was followed by a similar undertaking involving fisheries of the Great Lakes. That eventually helped shape a treaty between Canada and the United States.
He was born in St. Paul and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1929. He received his master's degree there in 1930 and his doctorate in 1935 from Columbia, where he was an instructor at the time. During World War II, he served as a naval officer and historian on the staff of James V. Forrestal, the Secretary of the Navy, attaining the rank of commander. The experience prompted him to write, with Richard Leach, "The Navy and the Industrial Mobilization in World War II" (1951), and, with Robert G. Albion, "Forrestal and the Navy" (1962), which covered Forrestal's years in the Navy Department and the rapid expansion of the American armada he oversaw. After the war Dr. Connery taught at the Catholic University of America, Stanford, the University of Illinois and Duke before he returned to Columbia in 1966 as a professor of government. He served as a senior staff member for the Brookings Institution in the early 1950's, conducting surveys of foreign affairs, NATO and the United Nations.
The many books, chapters and articles he wrote or edited covered urban riots, municipal taxes, economic affairs, the unionization of city workers and sundry other subjects. A reprint of his 1935 dissertation is in print even today, as is "The Politics of Mental Health" (1968) and "The Federal Government and Metropolitan Areas" (1978).
Dr. Connery, who never married, leaves no immediate survivors.
