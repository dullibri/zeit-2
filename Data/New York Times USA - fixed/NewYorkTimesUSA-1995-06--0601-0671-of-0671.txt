HEADLINE: Gritty Book Sets Prudence Aside

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
"Don't approach history as something to be shaken for its cautionary fruits," the author Tobias Wolff wrote to Mary Karr in January 1991, as she embarked on "The Liars' Club," her memoir of her East Texas childhood, published this month by Viking. "Don't be afraid of appearing angry, small-minded, obtuse, mean, immoral, amoral, calculating, or anything else," Mr. Wolff wrote. "Take no care for your dignity." And indeed, Ms. Karr did not. She has written one of the rawest memoirs by a serious American writer in years: the story of her childhood in "the Texas Ringworm Belt," oil-refinery country where the cancer rate rivals Bhopal's and Chernobyl's, in a town Business Week called one of the 10 ugliest on the planet.
Ms. Karr's mother suffered from something known locally as "Nervous." She married seven times -- twice to Ms. Karr's father -- and spent stretches of Ms. Karr's childhood insensible from drugs and alcohol. She set fire to Ms. Karr's toys, and tried to kill her. And as if all this wasn't enough to make a person miserable, at the age of 7 Ms. Karr was raped by a neighborhood boy and a short while later molested by her babysitter, all of which she discusses explicitly. Indeed, she takes no care for her dignity in the memoir, which Michiko Kakutani, reviewing it in The New York Times, called "an astonishing book." 
 Still, for someone who minces no words on paper, Ms. Karr is oddly private in person. "At this time I feel very protective of my 74-year-old mother," she said recently on a visit to New York from her job as a professor of creative writing and literature at Syracuse University. (Mr. Wolff, who wrote about his own harsh upbringing in "This Boy's Life," is a colleague.) She will not reveal the true name of the town that became Leechfield, Tex., in her memoir. Nor will she talk much about her own drinking, except to say, "I can't drink alcohol." And she will not discuss her drug taking, though she mentions it in her book, or the possibility that she may have spent time in a recovery program. "You're not supposed to say," she said.
For anyone who doesn't come from East Texas, Ms. Karr's memoir is like an anthropologist's account of a foreign country. This is a place where people "hunker down," and "hork" hot dogs, and insult is an art form. "You could see evil in the crotch of a tree," Ms. Karr's mother says to someone who has criticized her. And when a local man wakes from a coma mentally impaired, he is "half a bubble off-plumb."
Ms. Karr's book has a cast of Southern eccentrics right out of a Flannery O'Connor story. Her mother read Sartre and Camus, and told her daughters bedtime stories about Athens in the age of Socrates and fin-de-siecle Vienna. Ms. Karr's father, an oil driller, was a storyteller too, a man who shaped raw experience into the rise and fall of narrative, who took a poet's joy in the language, and who let his daughter listen in when he was with his drinking buddies, the Liars' Club.
Mary Karr went on to lead a wild life of her own. She left home at 17, fled to California and camped out with a group of surfers in a Lincoln Continental.
Only when she was grown, and rummaging in the attic for some papers, did she confront the secret that shaped her family: the existence of two children kidnapped from her mother by one of her husbands, who then disappeared. Suddenly, the reasons for her mother's need for oblivion, and her many marriages, became clear. Her mother had "started marrying people to get her kids back," Ms. Karr said. The night of Ms. Karr's discovery, Ms. Karr and her mother got drunk. "Why didn't you tell me?," Ms. Karr demanded. According to the memoir, her mother replied, "I thought you wouldn't like me anymore."
"Her exact sentence stays lodged in my head," Ms. Karr writes, "for it's one of the most pathetic sentences a 60-year-old woman can be caught uttering."
Partly out of a desire to shape this chaos into meaning, Ms. Karr always wanted to be a writer. She published a poem in Mother Jones magazine, a result of a chance encounter with the poet Denise Levertov. She was admitted to a writing course at Goddard College, where she met Mr. Wolff and wrote an essay on the poet John Ashbery's use of "non-linear" time. She moved to Boston, where she was a marketing communications manager for a computer company in Cambridge and a research fellow in managerial economics at the Harvard Business School. "If you're a poor kid you do what you have to do to make money," Ms. Karr said. Still, she managed to publish two books of poetry.
Along the way, she married a man from a very different background, whose idea of family life, she writes, was to speak to "his mother on holidays, from one end of a long, glossy dinner table." She will not reveal his identity, except to say that he went to Harvard, is a poet and teaches at a prep school in Connecticut. The marriage produced a son, Devereux Milburn, now 12. Three years ago, the marriage broke up.
Few poets can live off poetry. Ms. Karr had been trying to write a novel about her crazy childhood, without success. In 1989, both she and Mr. Wolff won $25,000 Whiting Writers' Awards, cash prizes given annually to 10 promising writers. At a dinner with Mr. Wolff and his agent, Amanda Urban, she told some of her stories about her family. Ms. Urban was intrigued, and urged her to write a memoir, asking for a proposal, three chapters and a delivery date.
"I realized 'She's serious as a heart attack,' " Ms. Karr said in her throaty voice, adding that Ms. Urban got her a sizable advance ("a whole lot; I'm not supposed to say how much"). With every three chapters, she said, "Viking would give me more."
In a way, "The Liars' Club" is a helpless child's answer to a mother before whom she is powerless. Ms. Karr's quest for the truth about her family was a search for salvation. And in a way it redeemed her mother's life as well.
After the book was finished, her mother demanded to read it. "She lobbied like a banshee to see it: 'What if I die before it's done?' " Ms. Karr said, imitating her mother's Texas drawl. Last August, on the back porch of Ms. Karr's house in Syracuse, her mother sat "turning the pages and weeping" and apologizing for her actions while her grandson tried to console her.
"I said, 'You were an alcoholic,' " Ms. Karr recalled. " 'Plus, you were really nuts!' She just thought it was great. She reads well. She doesn't suffer fools. She laughed and wept. My mother is one of the more unconventional human units."
Her mother is sober now. "She's really kind of an amazing human being," Ms. Karr said. "She's been sober for 12 or 13 years. She went back to school before my dad died. She taught art in junior high school. She did most of the work for her Ph.D. A lot of this came from finding those children. My half-brother helped her get sober."
Ms. Karr refused to discuss her newly found half-brother and half-sister, except to say their reunion has been a happy one. Her mother remains "both very capricious and a delightable human being," Ms. Karr said. "That makes her irresponsible."
"If I hadn't discovered the past and gone through therapy, we wouldn't be close," Ms. Karr said. At the end of the book, there is a soaring passage about the redemptive power of truth. She writes that "what mother told us absolved us. . . . All the black crimes we believed ourselves guilty of were myths. . . . "
"It's only looking back that I believe the clear light of truth should have filled us, like the legendary grace that carries a broken body past all manner of monsters."
These days, Mary Karr, sober and the mother of an active child, says she's happy. Will she marry again? "I hope not!" she said. "I'd rather take a whipping. I'm doing something I call Date-a-rama," she said.
"I saw in some review that I was born unlucky," she said. "When I hear myself described in these bathetic terms, I think of kids who are in Rwanda or H.I.V. positive. I get up, suit up, and shut up. I teach two afternoons a week; it's a piece of cake. I live in the house Toby lived in when he wrote 'This Boy's Life.' We put a basketball hoop up in the driveway; kids come from all over. Who wouldn't be happy!"
After a pause she added, "One reason I'm happy is I think I should've been dead a hundred times over."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY'S BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
LEGISLATORS PASS A TAX CUT OF 30% FOR NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 26

 BODY:
The New Jersey Legislature passed the second half of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's 30 percent income tax reduction tonight, a year ahead of schedule, with many Democrats joining Republican majorities in the Assembly and Senate.
The Senate enacted the Governor's $16 billion budget with a party line vote of 22 to 17, and at 8:10 P.M. the Assembly passed the budget, 54 to 23, as well as the tax cut. 
 With her program winning approval, Governor Whitman scored the triumph of her young political career. Her promise to cut the income tax rate by nearly a third, which in 1993 had appeared to be a last-ditch move to jump-start a lagging campaign for governor, has propelled the telegenic, blunt-talking 48-year-old first termer to the upper ranks of the national Republican Party. If anything, she has augmented that reputation by delivering the $1.2 billion annual tax savings this year, a year ahead of her original three-year deadline pledge.
Governor Whitman is expected to sign the budget legislation this week.
The first 15 percent tax cut was enacted last year.
"Passage of this bill fulfills an historic promise Governor Whitman and the Republican Party made to the people of New Jersey in 1993, a promise skeptics said we could not or would not keep," said Chuck Haytaian, the Assembly speaker, who as an early supporter of the Governor's campaign pledge could also savor the triumph tonight.
Mr. Haytaian hammered the tax cut through the Assembly in the early afternoon on a vote of 63 to 14. In the end, 12 of the Assembly's 28 Democrats who are up for re-election in November denounced aspects of the Governor's tax cut but voted with her. Two other Democrats abstained.
Most of the 14 Democrats voting against the tax cut came from safe Democratic districts in the cities and inner suburbs, where the tax cut has been widely criticized as a gift to the rich.
"This is not a tax cut that will really enable us to attract new jobs and stimulate economic growth," Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Teaneck Democrat, said. "It is just another case of exploiting the exploited." Later she added, "It is the embodiment of a philosophy that says that there is a virtue in greed."
Even Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, the Democratic minority leader, could not bring himself to vote against the tax cut and was one of two Democratic abstentions.
The steady progress of Mrs. Whitman's tax program, combined with an approval rating approaching 60 percent in the polls, has evaporated early skepticism while augmenting her reputation as a leader possessing equal measures of public warmth and political muscle.
It has spurred national Republican leaders to raise Mrs. Whitman's name as a potential vice presidential nominee next year, a line of thinking the Governor has never shut the door to.
Democrats in the Senate had hoped from the outset to exploit lingering fears among several leading Republicans that state revenues would fall short of covering the cost of the cuts, but the Republican leadership kept pushing them aside.
The Democratic Senate minority leader, John Lynch of New Brunswick, sought a quick ruling from the State Supreme Court today on Mrs. Whitman's refusal to release the text of a much-disputed letter from the Internal Revenue Service early in the day. The I.R.S. inquired in March about the status of $769 million taken from the state pension fund in 1992 and used to balance the budget. Mr. Lynch's Democrats conducted a mini-filibuster in hopes of delaying a vote on the tax cut until the court ruled on whether the nature of the I.R.S.'s inquiry should be made public.
When the Supreme Court sent the matter back to the trial court at 6:30 this evening, the Democrats tried unsuccessfully to delay the budget and tax cut votes until a meeting with the judges, but the Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, insisted on a vote in time for the June 30 fiscal year deadline.
"The Governor has effectively thumbed her nose at the co-equal branches of government," Mr. Lynch said with some bitterness.
But even important members of the Republican majority had more concerns about the integrity of Governor Whitman's budget than about an I.R.S. issue that could, in any case, be drawn out over months if not years in litigation. Republican leaders such as Robert E. Littell, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, have for several months worried about the impact a softening economy and possible Federal aid cuts would have on the Governor's precariously balanced budget.
In the end, however, Mr. Littell supported his Republican Governor, although the Senate quickly ran into a second impasse when the first vote on the budget measure stalled at 20 to 17, with 21 needed to carry. With one Senator out of state at his daughter's college graduation, two Republicans with heavy public employee constituencies, Richard J. LaRossa of Ewing and Peter A. Inverso of Hamilton refused to vote.
In a statement that brought him close to tears, Senator Inverso, who is vice chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, explained that he had spent the day seeking assurances from Governor Whitman that she would not veto language he had placed in the budget to sidetrack the Governor's plan to put the management of 23 motor vehicle offices under private management. This privatization measure would cost some 300 public employee jobs, many from his district.
"Unfortunately, I have been unable to get the assurances of the administration to abandon the privatization policy," Mr. Inverso said. Still, at the crucial moment, he and his neighbor in the adjoining desk, Senator LaRossa, pressed the green buttons on the desks to give the budget a 22 to 17 majority for passage.
During the debate, the two parties divided along two main themes, the Republicans calling the tax cut and the new budget a triumph for the state economy and the Democrats complaining that it was bought at the price of nearly $30 million in special appropriations -- pork, they called it -- for the home districts of influential members.
Critics have focused on the fact that the largest dollar savings under Mrs. Whitman's 30 percent income tax rate cut will go to families earning more than $85,000 a year, while the Whitman Administration has pointed out that the largest percentage reduction will go to those earning less than that amount. In addition, the cut removes all taxes on the earnings of 380,000 New Jerseyans who earn less than $7,500.
Just over 45 percent of all households in New Jersey make less than $80,000. A family earning that figure would see its state tax obligations decline to $1,470 from $2,100, a savings of $630, or the full 30 percent. At $200,000, a family's taxes would decline by 16.6 percent, to $8,379 from $10,050.
At $16 billion, Mrs. Whitman's budget is just $500 million higher than spending totals last year and the year before, in itself a striking example of the Governor's fiscal restraint in a state where budgets increased on average nearly $1 billion a year throughout the last decade.
During the give and take on the budget negotiations, Mrs. Whitman yielded on only a few points, agreeing to postpone $68 million in business taxes she had wanted and allowing the lawmakers to add the special benefits their home districts.
Although the day ended in triumph for the Governor, it was clear that several Republicans continued to have second thoughts about aspects of her plan.
"It is my hope that the negotiations and fine-tuning that have been under way for the past few weeks will continue beyond today's vote," Senator LaRossa said.

HEADLINE: Crackdown Has Cali Drug Cartel on the Run

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CALI, Colombia, June 21

 BODY:
Until last month, Helmer Herrera Buitrago could relax in his penthouse bathtub while monitoring on closed circuit television who was coming and going from his private 14-story office and residential tower here.
To cruise around town, he could choose from a fleet of 70 cars, including a bullet-proofed Mazda equipped with louvers to allow his bodyguards to fire machine pistols at pursuers. 
 But hard times have fallen on this slender, mustachioed Colombian, whose personal empire allegedly includes much of the cocaine trade in New York and New Jersey. Over the last month, a special police squad has raided dozens of his businesses and homes, seizing cars, computer diskettes, bank statements, cellular phones and radio-activated beepers. Every day, television screens flash in bold red letters the reward for providing information that leads to the arrest of the kingpin -- $600,000.
"Pacho's getting desperate -- he can't take the pressure," a police lieutenant said, using Mr. Herrera's nickname. Colombian judicial authorities have said that his lawyers are trying to negotiate a surrender.
Two weeks after Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, known as the "chess master" of the Cali cocaine cartel, was captured cowering in a secret compartment in one of his houses, it appears that the glory days are over for the Cali drug traffickers, who earned an estimated $8 billion last year by controlling 80 percent of Colombia's cocaine exports.
Already there is evidence that the ability of the Cali cartel to refine cocaine and move it north -- it supplies most of the cocaine reaching the United States -- has been seriously disrupted. But whether the intensified law enforcement efforts here will reduce the quantity of the drug reaching the United States over time will depend on the ability of the Colombian Government to stamp out new cartels as they arise, and will also require si,ilar crackdowns in Bolivia, Mexico and Peru.
A turnaround in Colombia's policy started in January, when the new President, Ernesto Samper Pizano, realized that his laissez-faire attitude toward the traffickers could cause the United States, Colombia's largest trading partner and foreign investor, to impose economic sanctions. New policies were drawn up, but not in time to save Colombia from flunking an annual United States Government review of drug cooperation by its allies. Although Colombia was rated "uncooperative" on March 1, President Clinton waived sanctions on the ground of national interest.
 
Pressure by U.S. Brings Results
 The new get-tough policies have started to shake up Cali, which with two million people is Colombia's third largest city and which long profited from a cocaine-fueled investment boom. The capture of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela on June 9 was the culmination of three months of police pressure.
Since the 1970's, Colombian attacks on the drug business have been spasmodic, usually in response to heavy United States pressure. In one such concerted effort, the Government, with United States aid, has eradicated about one-quarter of the nation's coca leaf and opium poppy fields since January.
Despite this, the price of semi-refined cocaine is now half what it was in May. Colombian and American officials believe that this drop has come about because the Cali cartel's ability to arrange the financing, refining and transporting of drug shipments has been so severely disrupted.
So far, these officials believe, the American demand for cocaine is being met by stocks already in the United States. But they expect that the measures in Colombia will soon reduce the supply of cocaine reaching the United States and that cocaine prices there will rise later this summer as shortages move down the pipeline.
For the long term, the question is whether the Colombian Government will strike with equal force against smaller traffickers who try to replace the captured Cali bosses. Other questions are whether cocaine dealers in the two other producing countries, Peru and Bolivia, will develop the expertise and networks needed to meet the American demand, and whether Mexican dealers will seek a larger role in the trade.
The traffickers' fall has been swift.
Only six months ago, a high-ranking Colombian official telephoned Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, one of Gilberto's two brothers, to apologize for the way soldiers and police officers interrupted his daughter's first communion party in a Cali hotel. Today, Miguel is a fugitive with a $2.5 million price on his head.
A year ago, Colombia's Prosecutor General met with Pacho Herrera, the supplier for the New York area, and issued him a certificate stating that no judicial investigations were pending against him. Apparently the official, Gustavo de Greiff, saw nothing amiss in the rapid growth of Mr. Herrera's business empire, including 12 ranches and 32 companies. Three months ago, however, the new Prosecutor General, Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento, issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Herrera on charges of drug trafficking and illicit enrichment.
"The entire effort of the Colombian police has picked up enormously since March," said Robert H. Gelbard, the State Department's top narcotics specialist.
 
Crackdown on Cartel Pleases Colombians
 The anti-cartel campaign has strong support at home. Last month, 76 percent of respondents to a nationwide poll said they supported it.
Kicking off the crackdown, on March 2, the police arrested Jorge Eliecer Rodriguez Orejuela, the youngest of the trafficking brothers. A notary public was dismissed from government service late the same month after Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela appeared before him to sign a power of attorney. Also in late March, a court administrator was arrested on charges of appointing a judge hand-picked by Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela to preside over his own drug-trafficking trial. He was to have been tried in absentia. The trial was moved to Bogota.
At the same time, an elite police "search brigade" conducted the first of more than 400 raids intended to dismantle the cartel's communications, transportation and security apparatus.
One target is the cartel-controlled taxi companies, where an estimated 1,500 drivers worked as informants for the traffickers. In raids on cartel offices, the police seized advanced communications devices -- radios that distort voices, scanners to intercept police radios, videophones for visual confirmation of callers, and devices for scrambling computer modem transmissions.
"The C.I.A. tells me that the sophistication of the Cali cartel was about at the level of the K.G.B. when the Soviet Union fell apart," Fernando Botero, Colombia's Defense Minister, said here recently.
 
U.S. Agents Provide Valuable Information
 The C.I.A. has loaned technicians to the search brigade, and American Drug Enforcement Administration agents stationed here help the effort by buying information. "The information they get is very valuable," Col. Misael Murcia, commander of the search brigade, said of the help provided by American agents.
The search brigade was formed in January 1994, but the cartel quickly tapped its telephones, making many raids ineffectual.
The unit now acts under the assumption that its telephones are tapped and that the national toll-free tipster numbers also are tapped.
Hard tips do make their way to the police here. Two tipsters split a $1.5 million reward for the information that led to the capture of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. Buckling under the pressure, another cartel leader, Henry Loaiza Ceballos, surrendered on Monday, and a third, Phanor Arizabaleta Arzayus, said he would surrender next week.
[On Saturday, Victor Patino, a former police officer who rose to the No. 5 position in the gang, turned himself in.]
Determined to make more arrests by August, the first anniversary of Mr. Samper's administration, the Government is increasing the search brigade by 50 percent this month, to 9,000 police officers and soldiers.
Although a police intelligence officer was killed this month 50 miles north of here, the crackdown has been peaceful by Colombian standards. In contrast, Colombia's war on Pablo Escobar, the Medellin cartel leader, cost hundreds of lives until he was killed in December 1993.
 
Bribes, Not Bullets, Is Cartel's Policy
 "Escobar was a car thief, Rodriguez Gacha was a street punk," Colonel Murcia said of the Medellin cartel leaders. "The Rodriguez Orejuelas are very educated. It is not in their interest to use lead on us because, if they do, the Government will take everything away."
Indeed, the white-collar business leaders of the Cali cartel generally prefer bribes over bullets.
In a scandal that is rocking Colombia's governing Liberal Party, Mr. Valdivieso, the Prosecutor General, is investigating charges that the Cali cartel made payoffs to the Attorney General, the Comptroller General, the President of the House of Representatives and 14 other members of Congress.
Mr. Valdivieso, who occupies a politically independent post, is also investigating campaign contributions of $17 million made by cartel front companies during last year's congressional and presidential campaign season. Campaign aides to President Samper contend that Cali cartel figures offered to contribute, but that the money was refused.
"Their ace in the sleeve is what they have on the politicians," said a mid-level cartel employee. "They are going to negotiate. They are looking for sentences of eight or nine years, maximum."
An independent politician says that he met secretly last weekend with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. The politician, Bernardo Hoyos, said that Mr. Rodriguez Orejuela showed him photocopies of canceled checks totaling about $20 million written out to leading politicians. Mr. Hoyos would not cite names.
Under Colombia's existing plea bargaining and sentence reduction system, Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, who is 56, could spend as little as eight years in jail. The system is so generous that more than 1,000 Colombians have accepted plea bargain offers since the program started 18 months ago. The average sentence has been three years.
American officials warn that the crackdown on the Cali cartel could prove useless without stronger sentences and seizures of assets acquired through drug trafficking.
"These arrests are the first steps in a very long process," Myles R. Frechette, the United States Ambassador, said today. "There are other guys waiting for opportunities. The drug problem will take 15 to 20 years to solve in Colombia."

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls U.N.'s Critics 'Isolationists'

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 26

 BODY:
Fifty years after the adoption of the United Nations Charter here, President Clinton fiercely defended the organization today against Congressional critics he branded "the new isolationists." But he also called for a streamlined United Nations that "wastes less and produces more."
Speaking on the same stage where delegates signed the United Nations Charter in 1945, Mr. Clinton recalled President Franklin D. Roosevelt's observation that America's well-being is dependent on the well-being of other nations, and said, "Today more than ever those words ring true." 
 "So I say, especially to the opponents of the United Nations here in the United States, turning our back on the U.N. and going it alone will lead to far more economic, political and military burdens on our people in the future and would ignore the lessons of our own history," the President said. "Let us say no to isolation, yes to reform."
Mr. Clinton 's address came at the end of a morning of pageantry, poetry and paeans to the United Nations in San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, with much of the ceremony dwelling on the hopes of Mr. Roosevelt and President Harry S. Truman for a new global institution to avert another world war.
Maya Angelou read a poem for peace. And Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called United Nations peacekeeping operations "a manifestation of the world's capacity to work together."
But crowds of demonstrators outside -- some waving "Save Bosnia" placards -- underscored that the anniversary celebration comes at a time when the 185-member organization is increasingly under fire from critics who see its peacekeeping mission in Bosnia as a failure.
Because of legislation passed last year, the United States plans to scale back its financial support for United Nations peacekeeping operations in October, so it pays a quarter of their costs instead of more than 30 percent. This year the Republican-dominated House of Representatives passed a bill that would cut financial support for current peacekeeping operations by more than $1 billion and would limit the President's power to approve new missions.
Mr. Clinton pledged to work to keep the United States paying "its fair share" of United Nations costs. But he also said the bureaucracy-bound institution must make the same efforts as governments and corporations to scale back its staff and set clearer priorities.
"Over the years it has grown too bloated, too often encouraging duplication, and spending resources on meetings rather than results," he said. "As its board of directors, all of us -- we the member states -- must create a U.N. that is more flexible, that operates more rapidly, that wastes less and produces more, and most importantly, that inspires confidence among our governments and our people."
Mr. Clinton said the United Nations could no longer afford a "separate agency with its own acronym, stationary and bureaucracy for every problem." And he called on the United Nations to be more selective in its peacekeeping missions.
"Peacekeeping can only succeed when the parties to a conflict understand they cannot profit from war," he said. "We have too often asked our peacekeepers to work miracles while denying them the military and political support required and the modern command-and-control systems they need to do their job as safely and effectively as possible."
Mr. Clinton made only a brief mention of the Bosnian conflict but instead dwelled on the organization's achievements in other arenas, citing its effective use of sanctions, its food and vaccine programs and its peacekeeping efforts in El Salvador, Namibia and Cambodia.
He said the dangers of the cold-war era had been replaced by new threats of terrorism and ethnic nationalism, international crime, drug traffickers, famine and disease. "So my friends, in this increasingly interdependent world, we have more common opportunities and more common enemies than ever before," he said.
Mr. Clinton spoke before a huge Presidential seal projected onto the Opera House stage, while the morning's other speakers stood under a projection of the blue-and-white logo of the United Nations.
The California design company hired to stage the ceremony said it had chosen to put the seal on the backdrop because displaying it on the lectern would have distracted attention from the United Nations Charter mounted there.
Ginny Terzano, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Clinton had no reluctance about being photographed standing beneath a United Nations symbol. "It was quite a surprise to us," she said of the arrangement. "We didn't ask for it."

HEADLINE: Professor Will Step Down As Head of Black Studies

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
In a quiet end to his troubled chairmanship of City College's Black Studies Department, Prof. Leonard Jeffries will step down at the end of this month, college officials said last night. Earlier in the evening, the City University of New York's board of trustees approved the department's choice of a new chairman, described by colleagues as a political scientist with moderate views.
Dr. Jeffries, the fiery speaker whose anti-Semitic remarks polarized the campus and spurred a three-year legal effort by the college to strip him of his chairmanship, did not seek to renew his three-year appointment, which expired this year, Dr. Yolanda T. Moses, the president of City College, said. The eight-member faculty of the Black Studies Department voted unanimously to elect a new chairman. 
 The new department chairman is Moyibi J. Amoda, originally of Nigeria, who has been at the college and in the department since 1971.
Professor Jeffries, who will remain a tenured professor, could not be reached for comment last night. Some faculty members outside the department speculated that the college administration -- emboldened by a Federal appeals court ruling in April that upheld the college's rights in removing Professor Jeffries because of his remarks -- made it clear to the Black Studies Department that it would not tolerate Professor Jeffries's reappointment. But Dr. Moses denied any such pressure.
"Clearly, there was some determination internally that there was going to be a new chair," she said. "It wasn't done from outside at all."
Dr. Moses said she was pleased with the department's action, which she characterized as a firm decision to depart from Professor Jeffries's leadership of more than two decades. "They decided it was time to focus on the students and on the department, and a new person would lead in that direction," she said.
Dr. Amoda is a specialist in African politics who has written texts on political theory and economic development. The professor, who was in Nigeria and could not be reached for comment, briefly served as acting chairman of the Black Studies Department during the 1971-72 academic year.
Dr. Amoda, a 1965 summa cum laude graduate of Dartmouth College, received his master's and doctorate degrees from the University of California, Berkeley.
Dr. Moses, and a few faculty members who were reached last night, emphasized that Dr. Amoda was independent-minded and seemed to have stayed clear of interdepartmental politics during Professor Jeffries's long tenure.
"On those occasions the topic of Dr. Jeffries has come up, he has been extremely circumspect," said Bernard Sohmer, a mathematics professor, whom Dr. Jeffries called "the head Jew at City College" in 1991 remarks at a black arts and cultural festival that first brought him widespread attention.
Dr. Sohmer said that Dr. Amoda's views -- which he described as more mainstream than Dr. Jeffries's Afrocentric emphasis -- would bolster the department's academic reputation. Ideologically, Dr. Amoda seems to espouse the reverse of Professor Jeffries's racially separatist views, Professor Sohmer said.
"He's politically left of center," he said. "He thinks there should be a community of nations with less sovereignty and more cooperation."
It is not clear if the new chairman will have the political support to steer the Black Studies Department in a new direction -- one that Dr. Moses said she hoped would be less political and more scholarly.
Although Dr. Amoda garnered unanimous support during the election, there was some speculation last night about whether the department's faculty made that choice out of heartfelt conviction or because it was felt that to continue supporting Professor Jeffries was a lost cause. "I genuinely don't know if he can take this department into a new direction," said Jeffrey Rosen, the dean of social sciences, which includes the Black Studies Department.
When the college briefly installed a new chairman, Dr. Edmund W. Gordon, in the department in 1992it was widely acknowledged that loyalty to Dr. Jeffries had paralyzed Dr. Gordon's efforts to spark change.
Reached last night, however, Dr. Gordon, who is still on the faculty, sounded hopeful about the department's future. He said: "I would think that his decision not to run for the chairmanship means he will probably not interfere with Amoda and that the faculty is free to move in another direction."
After City College stripped Professor Jeffries of his department chairmanship in 1992, a Federal court jury in Manhattan found that the institution had violated his right to free speech. A Federal appeals court upheld the verdict in 1994, resulting in his reinstatement. But three months ago, the court reversed its own decision.

Hospitals to Get State Subsidies

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed legislation yesterday to give $475 million in subsidies to all hospitals in the state to help offset their costs for treating poor patients who are not covered by Medicaid or Medicare. But a new source of money must be found by next year or aid to hospitals will end, Health Commissioner Len Fishman told The Associated Press. The "charity care" reimbursement program has cost $1.5 billion over three years. The money has been raised by diverting tax dollars allocated to the unemployment trust fund, a source that may no longer be available.

HEADLINE: Congressional Proposal Adds Element of Risk to Sugar-Growing Business

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: BELLE GLADE, Fla.

 BODY:
When Paul R. Orsenigo, a vegetable farmer, decided to diversify last year and grow sugar cane, it seemed a sure bet. Cane is not only a hardier crop than leaf lettuce or parsley, he reasoned, it is also money in the bank because the Federal Government guarantees its price.
"Vegetable farming is a colossal gamble," Mr. Orsenig said recently as he drove through his 320-acre farm outside this town on the shores of Lake Okeechobee, 69 miles northwest of Miami. "Sugar cane helps you weather some of the bad years you have in vegetables." 
 But Mr. Orsenigo, 37, made his plans just in time to see the stability of sugar prices threatened by a fiscally conservative Congress, which is reviewing all farm price supports that were inaugurated during the New Deal in an effort to restore rural prosperity. Nearly 100 Representatives now support a House bill that would eliminate the Federal program of crop loans that guarantees participating sugar growers and processors a minimum price. That price has usually been about twice the price paid on the world market, though price supports for crops American farmers export are more in line with market prices.
To prop up the sugar price, the Government limits sugar imports and domestic production. A 1993 report by the General Accounting Office said that while the import limits insulated producers from lower world prices, the inflated domestic price costs American consumers and manufacturers of sweetened products $1.4 billion a year.
Known for its powerful lobby, the sugar industry, which is dominated by a limited number of corporations, has benefited from some form of Government intervention for decades and from the current price-support program since 1981. The program not only helps growers of cane and sugar beets but also indirectly allows their primary competitors, corn syrup manufacturers, to charge more and still be competitive.
That is why corporate giants like Coca-Cola and Hershey Foods Corporation have joined forces to fight the program, which they see as forcing up their cost of doing business, with such unlikely allies as the Audubon Society and the Everglades Coalition, which have long blamed fertilizer-laden runoff from sugar farms for encouraging a rampant growth of vegetation that chokes Florida's wetlands.
Environmentalists hope that eliminating the sugar loans would slow the growth of sugar fields, even shrink them, and accelerate restoration of the Everglades by allowing the Government to buy land sugar production has been claiming and return it to marsh wetlands and water retention areas.
Opponents of the sugar program argue that more than helping small farmers, it enriches a few wealthy growers -- at the expense of the environment and consumers big and small.
To growers like Mr. Orsenigo, a small farmer, the program offers a reasonable sugar price and jobs. To legislators bent on change, it is held up as one of the most egregious examples of corporate welfare.
"Production caps, special loans, import protections -- all of these are things very hard to justify these days when you're trying to balance the budget," said Representative Porter J. Goss, Republican of Florida, who voted for the program when it came up for renewal in 1990 but warned the industry then to begin planning for its demise. "This is not just about sugar but about Government involvement in the marketplace."
The debate is fiercest here in Florida, where more than half the nation's sugar cane is produced and where two growers, the United States Sugar Corporation and Flo-Sun Inc., account for two-thirds of that production. They are among the 1 percent of sugar cane farms that get 58 percent of the sugar program's benefits, the accounting office found.
Possible loss of the loan program is only one of several problems the industry has confronted lately. It has been criticized for its labor practices with migrant cane cutters, for its generous campaign contributions to both Republicans and Democrats and for its reluctance to clean up its pollution. In the recent settlement of a Federal lawsuit against the State of Florida, sugar growers in Florida agreed to pay $320 million in restoration and clean-up expenses in the Everglades, with taxpayers paying the rest of the $700 million costs.
The industry employs about 14,400 people in Florida, and 50,000 to 70,000 nationwide, but claims hundreds of thousands of indirect jobs in 42 states. In Clewiston, headquarters of U.S. Sugar, the five-month harvest season that begins each November brings with it the smell of molasses and cash.
"U.S. Sugar owns the town," said Barbara Fricke, an owner of Floyd's, a department store just outside Clewiston. "When U.S. Sugar has problems, there is less money in the town, and that's less money for us."
Sugar is the third-largest cash crop in Florida, after citrus and tomatoes, accounting for about 10 percent of the state's yearly farm revenue of $5 billion to $6 billion, officials said. Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, supports the Federal sugar program, as does Florida's Commissioner of Agriculture, Bob Crawford, who argues that it would be "economically suicidal" for the nation to remove protections while other nations continue to subsidize their sugar growers.
Sugar companies contend that without the loan program, many farmers would be wiped out, unable to ride out the price fluctuations and that imports would then flood the market because the United State would no longer have a bargaining chip to use as an incentive to other countries to influence them to drop their own subsidies.
More than 100 countries produce sugar, and all have some form of Government intervention in the market to insure low prices for domestic consumption, Federal agriculture officials said. Only about 13 percent of the sugar consumed in this country comes from abroad now.
"You can't get them to make that kind of adjustment in agriculture if they believe that you will unilaterally disarm in certain industries," Jorge Dominicis, a vice president with Flo-Sun, Florida's largest sugar cane grower with 180,000 acres, said of foreign competitors.
But opponents of the sugar program point at Flo-Sun, owned by two brothers, Alfonso and Jose Fanjul of Palm Beach, as the best example of how the sugar program works to enrich a few. The G.A.O. estimated the brothers received $64 million in additional revenue in 1991 because of it. Company spokesmen, however, said the figures were calculated using world market prices without figuring in national subsidies that help bring them down.
The industry also argues that the price supports exist at no net cost to the Government because the program is not a direct subsidy. And its officials scoff at the idea that sweetener users like Coca-Cola would pass on their savings to average consumers.
But critics like Representative Dan Miller, Republican of Florida, co-sponsor of the bill on crop supports, see the program as an anachronism that makes no economic sense. He said he envisioned a free market where efficient farmers will thrive and sugar prices would drop somewhere from the 22 cents a pound currently charged here to the 14 cents sugar commands in the world market. He added that he did not expect passage of the bill to cause production to decline much or have any cataclysmic change.
Sugar growers say they doubt their foes will succeed because of the potential political cost to legislators from sugar districts. Only 5 of 23 Florida Representatives have rallied behind the House bill so far. In addition to Florida, sugar cane is grown in Hawaii, Louisiana, Texas and Puerto Rico; sugar beets are grown in 14 states. Growers of sugar beets are also mobilizing to oppose the move to cut crop supports.
Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida and an ally of the sugar industry, said recently he feared a cycle in which "these other nations will have us hostage and we'll pay higher prices for a product we don't grow ourselves." Members of Congress such as Mr. Goss say they expect a phasing out over enough time to give the industry a chance to reconfigure itself or "grow something else."
Meanwhile, the realization that life as they know it might change is beginning to sink in here. Steve Weeks, Mayor of Belle Glade, with a population of 18,000, said the city has been trying to diversify, looking beyond agriculture. Already there are plans for an industrial park to attract businesses and a marina on Lake Okeechobee to draw tourists.
"We're in a great place. There are a lot of good ideas," said the Mayor, a Belle Glade native who says his own lumber yard business is at stake. "It's just going to take time."

HEADLINE: Securities Litigation Measure Nears Passage in the Senate

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
The Senate tonight moved swiftly toward a final vote on legislation that would make it far more difficult for investors to sue corporations and stockbrokers for securities fraud.
Opponents of the measure tried repeatedly today either to slow the bill or to modify its effects but were beaten back at every turn. The legislation is expected to pass as early as Wednesday morning with support from both Democrats and Republicans. 
 The House has already passed a similar measure. The Clinton Administration has not yet taken an explicit position but has suggested that some parts of the legislation are necessary.
One principal area of contention over the last several days of debate has been provisions that would shield corporate officers, and others who make predictions about a company's prospects, from stockholder fraud suits when their assessments prove unfounded and the stock price drops precipitously as a result. The bill would provide a "safe harbor," in which those who made such predictions could not be held liable under most circumstances.
The measure's opponents, chiefly Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, argued that allowing company executives, stockbrokers and accountants, among others, to make such statements free of liability would increase corporate irresponsibility. Mr. Sarbanes said small investors who had been deceived would be left with little recourse.
But supporters of the bill like Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said that at present the fear of being sued prevented corporate officers from making predictions that would be useful for investors.
After lengthy debate, the Senate beat back two Sarbanes-sponsored amendments that would have changed the safe-haror provisions of the measure. The main amendment would have deleted the safe-harbor provisions entirely, instead leaving the task to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Sarbanes said the matter was too technical to be included in legislation and should rather be left to the S.E.C. to deal with in regulations.
Arthur M. Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, has objected to the safe-harbor concept in the House and Senate bills alike and has asked that the matter be left to his agency. Nonetheless, the Senate easily defeated Mr. Sarbanes's proposal, 56 to 43.

GRAPHIC: Photo: If all goes as planned, the Senate today will pass legislation that would make it much harder for stockholders to sue companies in which they invest. The bill's chief sponsor, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, declared yesterday that frivolous lawsuits were "making it difficult for companies to raise the capital needed to fuel our economy."

HEADLINE: Panel Votes to Keep Tobacco Subsidies

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
Led by a bipartisan bloc of Southern representatives, the House Appropriations Committee today defeated an attempt to end the 50-year-old Federal Government subsidy to tobacco growers.
But in another move that cut as deeply across party lines, the committee by a surprisingly wide margin approved an amendment to extend a moratorium on new offshore oil drilling. 
 That vote reversed a subcommittee decision to leave the extension out of the legislation, which would have allowed the 13-year-old moratorium to end. The ban applies to much of the Pacific Coast, the Florida Gulf Coast, and Alaskan and New England coastal waters; the delegations of those states led the effort to extend it.
"The risks and potential hazards to the environment outweighed the economic benefits of new explorations," said Representative Frank Riggs, a Republican from California.
The committee, which has 32 Republicans and 24 Democrats, held firm on scores of cuts in Federal spending on science, the environment, and arts and humanities programs.
By unanimous voice votes, the committee approved appropriations bills that cover the Interior and Agriculture departments.
The full House of Representatives and the Senate must still vote on the appropriations bills, and losers in both fights vowed that they would find the means to bring the issues back up again.
Legislation within the Interior bill would eliminate the Bureau of Mines, the agency responsible for mine safety; make a 40 percent cut in energy-conservation programs, and strip the National Park Service of most of its money for land acquisition.
This bill would also cut the appropriation to the National Endowment for the Arts to $82 million from $134 million.
The tobacco-subsidy amendment failed on a vote of 17 yeas and 30 nays during the committee's consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill for 1996.
The debate began like a whisper but quickly rose to a storm.
"Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment, and it is controversial," said Representative Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, sponsor of the tobacco amendment and the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture.
Mr. Durbin's statement brought laughs from some committee members, and grumblings from others who represent tobacco-growing states.
"Tobacco is unlike any other crop subsidized by the United States Department of Agriculture," Mr. Durbin said. "Tobacco, when used as directed, will kill you.
"Why, in God's name, when we are talking about cutting Medicaid and education, are we still subsidizing the production and the manufacture of tobacco?"
By Washington standards, the Federal money that tobacco farmers receive is tiny -- currently $49 million, Mr. Durbin said, and much of that is offset by nearly $33 million in annual assessments that the Government collects from tobacco growers.
But the fight over tobacco portends an even bigger battle over Government subsidies for sugar, peanuts and other agricultural products. Representatives from agricultural-based states were quick to mount defenses today.
"It's an economic argument we are having here," said Representative W. G. (Bill) Hefner, Democrat of North Carolina. "It's not going to stop anybody from smoking or taking up the habit."
Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, provided the crossfire.
"If you adopt this amendment, it is the small farmer who you are going to hurt," he said. "We are not here talking about a health issue today. We are talking about whether small farmers are going to be able to grow tobacco."
The fight to extend the ban on drilling was driven largely by environmentalists fearful of oil spills and landowners who objected to more offshore rigs, which they feel would degrade their seaside vistas and devalue their property.
All 23 members of the Florida delegation and 28 of the 54 Californians in the House support the ban, as do the Governors of California, Florida and Alaska. Together they form a political front that is likely to withstand any attacks on the House floor.
"We've never busted that bloc before," said Robert L. Livingston, Republican of Louisiana, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who temporarily surrendered his gavel to lead the fight against extending the moratorium. .
But he was not ready to concede defeat.
"We may take it up on the floor," he told reporters after the vote. "We have to take a look at the numbers."

HEADLINE: With Money Threatened, Colleges Are Moving on All Lobbying Fronts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When Nannerl O. Keohane, the president of Duke University, recently visited Representative Richard A. Gephardt to seek his help in warding off proposed cuts in Federal support for university research, she was careful to say something nice about Matt.
Matt, who graduated from Duke two years ago, is the oldest son of Mr. Gephardt, the House minority leader. 
 It was a small thing. While the debate in Congress over Federal patronage for university research is sure to address great issues of social policy, like most Congressional legislation, it will be shaped by things both great and small, perhaps even where an important Congressman's son went to college.
Ms. Keohane's purpose in visiting Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, as in visits with other legislators, was to come to grips with what the president of Harvard, Neil L. Rudenstine, has called "the most hazardous moment" for Federal support for university research since World War II. Congressional budget cutters have proposed drastic reductions in the $11 billion in Federal money that goes to university research on everything from cancer treatments to cultivating better tomatoes.
 
More Than Money Is at Stake
 The money is not only important for the results, but for the universities' prestige and finances. The grants may include the salaries of the principal investigator as well as laboratory supplies and equipment and such indirect costs as heating and lighting.
Duke's share of the Federal research pie is $176 million a year, or about a fifth of the university's total budget. Johns Hopkins University, which receives the biggest share, is getting $674 million. M.I.T. receives about $267 million, Stanford about $264 million and Harvard $182 million.
With the 1996 Federal budget now in the hands of the authorizing and appropriating committees of the House of Representatives, university chancellors and presidents like Ms. Keohane have been flocking to Washington as lobbyists.
Some of the efforts of these academic salesmen appear to have paid off. For example, Charles Vest, the soft-spoken president of M.I.T., who has become the unofficial spokesman for research universities in Washington, recently met with Speaker Newt Gingrich to push for Federal support for scientific research.
The meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes, one of Mr. Vest's aides said, but stretched to an hour and a half at Mr. Gingrich's request. About a week later, Mr. Gingrich appeared on the NBC News program "This Week" and declared that he had asked all House Republican committee and subcommittee chairmen "to find every possible way to maximize the money that goes into research and development because I am concerned that we're going to cut too deeply into science."
 
Early Success In a Long Fight
 A number of college presidents, acting at the urging of the American Council on Education, an umbrella group representing 1,600 colleges, recently swarmed over Capitol Hill to campaign for passage of an amendment to the Senate budget resolution that would reduce a proposed $9.4 billion cut in Federal student loan programs over seven years to $4.4 billion. The amendment passed.
Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who co-sponsored the amendment, singled out the council for praise, saying it "set the stage for passage."
But the budget battle in Washington is far from over, and what appear to be early victories for universities can unravel over the course of the budget fight. A strong-minded appropriations subcommittee, which decides the actual dollar amount to be spent on specific programs, may decide to ignore the decisions of the authorizing subcommittee, which provides broad authority for Government programs and sets overall spending limits.
Further, university lobbyists must cope with the diffuse sources of scientific research money. Most of the $11 billion is channeled through the six agencies. These six, with 1993 research amounts (the most recent available), are the National Institutes of Health ($5.4 billion), the National Science Foundation ($1.6 billion), the Department of Defense ($1.6 billion), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ($631 million), the Department of Energy ($582 million) and the Department of Agriculture ($462 million).
 
Lacking Muscles, They Work on Egos
 Compared with the lobbies of the National Association of Manufacturers and the United Automobile Workers, among the boldest and well-financed groups, the university lobbyists are meek, perpetually hard-pressed financially and frequently disorganized.
Yet college and university leaders are not without significant means for encouraging members of Congress to accede to their wishes, including conferring honorary degrees, sharing valuable survey data that their political scientists have collected and, above all, providing prestigious speaking platforms.
Cornelius Pings, president of the American Association of Universities, among the first line of university lobbying groups, said that what he calls "the trained-minds argument" makes the strongest possible case for university research.
"We're ever more in a society based on information and knowledge, which allows us to compete in a world economy," he said. "The universities do the training for that."
Mr. Vest of M.I.T. said that in his talks with members of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation he frequently cited a study done a few years ago by the Bank of Boston on the economic impact that M.I.T. had in Massachusetts. It showed that no fewer than 300,000 people were employed in the state by companies utilizing the fruits of research conducted at M.I.T. "That usually elicits some real recognition," Mr. Vest said.
 
Biggest Universities Have Own Lobbyists
 Because many colleges and universities have come to believe that the national higher-education organizations cannot help them keep in touch with their home-state Congressional delegations as well as they can do the job themselves, a number have established part-time or full-time offices in Washington, thus creating a second layer in the higher-education lobby.
The University of California established one of the first permanent offices here in 1966, although the greatest growth of permanent university lobbyists in Washington took place in the 1980's. In that time about a dozen universities, including Harvard, M.I.T., Princeton and Duke, have opened offices in Washington. Most of them employ several people.
Also effective in helping preserve university research money are professional organizations like the 42,000-member Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, known as Faseb. After the Senate Budget Committee recently proposed cutting $8 billion from the National Institutes of Health, lobbyists for the biologists' group and similar professional associations demonstrated how effective they could be.
Mark O. Hatfield, the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said their lobbying greatly assisted him in mustering a vote of 85 to 14 to restore $7 billion to the National Institutes of Health budget.
"Faseb, the endocrinologists and the immunologists not only wrote letters," he said. "They were here on the Hill presenting themselves in person. They were vital to our success."
 
Personal Relations Part of Process
 Experienced Washington lobbyists say that in addition to political and philosophical considerations, legislation is invariably a mosaic of human relationships.
For example, Francis L. Lawrence, the president of Rutgers University, likes to joke with Rodney Frelinghuysen, a freshman Republican from New Jersey who serves on the House Appropriations Committee.
Over the years, Mr. Frelinghuysen has taken a lot of ribbing for having broken with a long-standing family tradition and gone to Hobart College instead of Rutgers.
Someone who knows both men said that a frown from Mr. Lawrence suggesting, "Oh, you're not going to let us down again!" is enough to make Representative Frelinghuysen crack a smile.
The friendship of Alfred F. Hurley, president of the University of North Texas, with Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican and majority leader, dates from the 1970's, when Mr. Armey taught economics at the university.
Two years ago, when Mr. Hurley feared that Pentagon budget cutters would shut down the campus Reserve Officers Training Corps unit, he appealed to Mr. Armey for help.
Mr. Armey said he would do what he could, Mr. Hurley recalled, but he said Mr. Armey added with a laugh, "Don't let anybody at the Pentagon know you're a friend of mine!"
The R.O.T.C. unit was spared. James J. Duderstadt, president of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and a former nuclear physicist, said he had an excellent rapport with Representative Vernon J. Ehlers, a Michigan Republican who said he was the first research physicist to be elected to Congress.
The feeling is mutual, Mr. Ehlers said. "When we're in a committee meeting discussing an issue like funding for nuclear accelerators," he said, "usually Jim and I are the only two people in the room who know what we're talking about."
George Rupp, the president of Columbia University, said he had personally lobbied all four members of the Senate who are Columbia graduates. He noted he was particularly encouraged by his relationship with Senator Judd Gregg, class of '69, a conservative Republican from New Hampshire and a member of the Senate Budget Committee.
"He's not imperial like some, but down to earth," Senator Gregg said of Mr. Rupp. He added that although he remained "totally committed" to balancing the Federal budget, after his conversations with Mr. Rupp, he intended to go easy on the university research budgets.

HEADLINE: CASTRO CONFERS WITH EXILED FOE

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 27

 BODY:
Fidel Castro said, "You've let your hair grow long."
Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo said, "It's not my style, but my wife likes it long, so long it is." 
 With that, and a handshake, two adversaries who last saw each other 30 years ago, when Mr. Castro put Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo in prison for 22 years, sat down to talk about Cuba and its future. They met for more than three hours last week in Havana, the first time Mr. Castro has received an opposition exile leader.
Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo, a guerrilla commander in the Cuban revolution who now heads Cambio Cubano (Cuban Change), an organization that advocates a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba, said that the granting of a meeting he had sought for the last two years demonstrated Mr. Castro's desire for political change. But experts on Cuban affairs, including some Clinton Administration officials, said it remained to be seen whether it was a significant overture.
In recounting his exchange with Mr. Castro in an interview at his home here on Monday, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo refused to disclose details of their conversation. But he said he had asked the Cuban President to be allowed to take his exile organization to Cuba as an opposition party.
In a statement in which he defended his decision to repatriate Cubans who flee the island on boats and rafts, President Clinton today reaffirmed his support for the American trade embargo against Cuba but said "we are prepared to respond with our own carefully calibrated response" if Cuba takes steps to institute "far-reaching political and economic reform."
A senior Administration official said Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo's visit had yet to prove to be something more than an "individual interaction" and did not constitute a meaningful change under the President's policy.
"What we're looking for is something more institutional than a meeting," said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "If Cambio Cubano were allowed to return and hold meetings and exercise their political rights, that's something that would be a meaningful change that we should recognize."
In the interview, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo said he had expressed to Mr. Castro his wish to move to Cuba and for all Cubans to "have the right to return to their homeland."
"That we could finish our conversation in a civilized way and leave the door open is very important," said Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo, who did not get any promises but said he found Mr. Castro "receptive and tolerant."
"Everything will be studied and everything will be taken into account," he said. "I exposed my arguments and I hope that he will analyze them and answer eventually."
Jose Ponce, first secretary of the Cuban interests section in Washington, said the meeting was "another sign of our flexibility" and willingness to deal with Cuban exiles who respected Cuba's sovereignty in trying to address its problems.
The meeting was a face-to-face between two longtime foes who once were allies in the victorious struggle to overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo, 60, broke with Mr. Castro in 1961 over his refusal to hold elections and returned three years later to organize a rebellion. He was captured and stayed in prison until 1986, when Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain intervened to win his release.
Two years ago, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo publicly renounced violence as a tool for political change and helped form Cambio Cubano to call for a peaceful transfer of power in Cuba.
Although respected for his political imprisonment, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo is belittled by conservative Cuban exiles who advocate a hard line, including a tightening of the economic embargo and a naval blockade, to bring Mr. Castro's Government down. In Spanish-language radio here, his visit to Cuba has been the theme of talk shows for days, with callers labeling him "traitor," "shameless," "less of a man" and "Spanish, not Cuban." He was born in Spain but moved with his family to Cuba when he was 11.
"People have given it importance because exiles are desperate for solutions," said Jose Miro Torra, head of Brigade 2506, a group of veterans of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. "But the visit is worth nothing."
While Cambio Cubano is small, with only a few hundred adherents, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo is part of a broad spectrum of views in the exile community on what to do to quicken the pace of change in Cuba. Polls consistently show an openness among many Cuban exiles to consider a variety of options to deal with the island.
For Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo, it was a sign of new tolerance that a few hundred supporters rather than protesters greeted him at the airport here upon his return from Cuba on Sunday. Only last year, a delegation that included his daughter, Patricia, was harassed and threatened by irate Cuban exiles after attending a reception in which they shook hands, kissed or chatted amiably with Mr. Castro.
Still, even those who lauded Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo were cautious, saying Mr. Castro had given no concrete signs that he was ready for a significant move toward democracy. Ramon Cernuda, an exile leader, noted that he, Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo and a Miami lawyer, Alfredo Duran, met with the Cuban Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, nine months ago in Madrid in what they thought would be the first of many more meetings.
"Nothing happened," Mr. Cernuda said. "We can't fall on the trap of mirages."
Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo said that during his 10-day visit to Cuba he discussed civil liberties, dissidents and political prisoners with Mr. Castro and Mr. Robaina, who also attended the meeting in a private office at Havana's convention center.
The exile leader said that his movements were not restricted and that he talked with dissidents, foreign reporters and former guerrilla comrades in arms from the city of Cienfuegos. He said his visit was briefly mentioned by both Cuban television and the state-owned newspaper, Granma.
Mr. Gutierrez Menoyo left for Mexico today at the invitation of President Ernesto Zedillo. It is the start of a campaign, he said, to try to drum up support for discussions with Cuba to overcome the hurdles to free elections. He said he trusted that the United States would eventually join in the effort, if only to avoid a crisis on the island that would unleash another wave of refugees.
"There is a road full of obstacles ahead of us and what is important is to reach an agreement," he said.
Of his visit, he said: "Castro may gain by improving his image but Cambio Cubano gains enormously. We are contributing to create a hope for change, and once that gets started in a country, there's nothing that can stop it."

 BODY:

ENVIRONMENTAL REFORM -- Senators battling Federal regulations are aiming at what would seem to be one of the least burdensome but most effective of environmental rules: requiring manufacturers to publicly disclose how much they pollute. At the urging of chemical companies, a provision to scale back the program has been tucked into a regulatory relief bill that may come to the Senate floor this week.
 
ECONOMIC ADVISERS -- An effort by Republicans on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government to kill off the Council of Economic Advisers has drawn criticism from past council chairmen from both parties, who say it provides the President with an important independent source of economic advice. Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot of Iowa, chairman of the subcommittee, says the President had enough economists in the Office of Management and Budget and the National Economic Council. But Herbert G. Stein, a council chairman under President Richard M. Nixon, said, "I think it's a stupid idea." 

TOBACCO SUBSIDIES -- Led by Southern representatives, the House Appropriations Committee defeated an attempt to end the 50-year-old Federal Government subsidy to tobacco growers. But in another alignment that cut as deeply across party lines, the committee by a surprisingly wide margin approved an amendment to extend the moratorium on new off-shore oil drilling.
 
LEGAL OVERHAUL -- The Senate moved toward a vote on legislation that would drastically alter the way companies are regulated by making it more difficult to sue corporations and stockbrokers when share prices drop suddenly. The bill is expected to pass as early as today with support from Democrats and Republicans alike.

HEADLINE: TV Guide Taps Editor to Lead On-Line Unit

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
News America Publishing yesterday named Barry Golson, executive editor of TV Guide, as editor in chief of a new unit for magazine development and new media.
Among his duties, Mr. Golson will oversee TV Guide Online, an electronic version of the magazine's television listings scheduled to go on the Internet in September. 
 Mr. Golson, 50, said he would also be looking at publishing possibilities, including CD-ROM and print, but declined to be more specific.
"You can assume that a CD-ROM based on TV Guide would be a natural kind of thing for us to do," he said. "You can assume that a lot of people have come to us with publishing ideas ranging from small to large. And at the same time we are going to put a total focus on bringing our biggest property on line in an interesting way."
He has already been working for some time on developing TV Guide Online. Its link to the Internet will the Delphi Internet Services Corporation, which, like News America, is a part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Last month, MCI Communications made a $2 billion investment in Delphi, joining the race to get onto the global computer network.
The urge to reinvent television listings keeps growing. The possibility that there might some day be 500 television channels made it clear two or three years ago that a small-sized magazine like TV Guide would be unable to list them all.
Now, the average cable system offers more than 12,000 program choices a week on roughly 30 channels. But viewers say that on most systems, the listings display scrolls too slowly to be of much use.
Yet another attempt to solve the problem comes from Starsight Telecast Inc. of Fremont, Calif, which recently introduced a new kind of on-screen guide that is available to owners of specially equipped TV sets, VCR's and set-top boxes.
Mr. Golson would not give any details about TV Guide Online, except to say that a "small test to test the muscles of our staff" was under way.
Mr. Golson was executive editor of Playboy from 1977 to 1989. He left to join News America as the founding editor of Men's Life, a publication whose own life lasted only one issue. It went on sale in September 1990 and quickly closed, one of many victims of the advertising recession.
A successor to Mr. Golson at TV Guide has not yet been named.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
Consumer confidence took its steepest fall in nearly three years in June, dropping to the lowest level since late last year, the Conference Board reported today.
The surprisingly big decline reported by the Conference Board, a New-York based business research group, was taken as a sign that consumers, their incomes growing slowly and saddled with high debt, will continue to spend cautiously in coming months. 
 Still, analysts tended to play down the effect of this latest economic reading on the Federal Reserve, which many believe is likely to lower short-term interest rates at a meeting next week.
They said that in recent years confidence had been more a mirror of current conditions than a predicting, or leading, indicator. "Confidence is sort of coming into line" with flat sales early this year, said Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch. He added that consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, "is not going to come roaring back."
The Conference Board said that its overall index skidded to 92.8 in June from 102 in May. This was the lowest since October, when the index, based on a survey of 5,000 households, stood at 89.1.
Eight of nine geographic regions -- the only exception being the eastern south-central states -- showed declines. As in May, the lowest confidence was in the Middle Atlantic region, followed by New England.
The expectations component, which seeks to gauge activity over the next six months, was especially weak, plunging to 81.3 from 93.1, on a small decline in the number of consumers who expected business to improve and a moderate increase among those who feared it would worsen. Expectations are now the lowest since November 1993.
"Despite the relatively large decline in confidence in June and other signs of a slowing in the pace of the nation's economic growth, the current confidence level has been historically associated with a reasonably strong economy," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center. "Still," he said, "the magnitude of the decline is somewhat disconcerting."
Today's report was somewhat at odds with preliminary June data on public confidence published by the University of Michigan last week. That report, according to subscribers, showed a rise to 92.3 from 89.8 in May, returning to about the same level as in April.
Bond prices, which tend to rise on weak economic data, rallied after the Conference Board report was released. But they retreated later in the day, weighed down by a lackluster auction of Treasury notes and a strong weekly retail sales report from Johnson Redbook.
"We still think the economy's essentially in an inventory correction" and will begin to pick up in the second half of the year, said John E. Barnds, director of business and banking analysis for NBD Bank in Detroit.
But slow income growth and concern over jobs will restrain this, he added, and he predicted that there would be relatively little benefit from home-mortgage refinancing.
Unlike in 1993, when refinancing boomed, today's relatively low long-term rates have mainly induced home owners to shift from adjustable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages. This means that relatively few people are reducing their monthly payments -- indeed, they are often higher -- and few are withdrawing equity that could spur other spending, Mr. Barnds said.
As for current business conditions, the Conference Board found people moderately less positive than in May. The June reading was 110.1, down from 115.4 last month and from the peak recent reading, in April, of 116.2.
For employment, slightly fewer respondents called jobs in the current market plentiful, while the number of those reporting jobs hard to get were unchanged. Pessimists continued to outnumber optimists by a fairly large margin on the question of future job opportunities.
The drop in overall confidence was the largest since July 1992, when the economy was clawing its way out of recession.
Geographically, the highest confidence by far, at a reading of 126.3, was recorded in the Mountain states. In second place, at 112.4, were the states of the eastern north-central region.

HEADLINE: In Muslim Cleric's Trial, a Radical Defender;
Left-Leaning Lawyer and Revolutionary Sympathizer Comes Back in the Limelight

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Lynne F. Stewart, counselor at law and radical at heart, strode through the Federal courthouse in Manhattan, a purple cloth tote bag crammed with legal papers dangling from her hand, a New York Mets cap on her head.
No formidable briefcase like those being borne about her. No sign of the dress-for-success standard of lawyering also abundant in the vicinity. 
 But if the round-faced woman with the quick smile looked readier for the stands at Shea Stadium than for a day's labor in this marbled arena, that notion swiftly evaporated when she entered a heavily guarded third-floor courtroom for another round as chief lawyer for the chief defendant in the biggest terrorism trial ever to come to an American court.
Ms. Stewart's client is Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the militant Muslim cleric charged with leading a lethal conspiracy that prosecutors say included the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and aborted plots to blow up the United Nations headquarters and the Hudson River tunnels.
For the past five and a half months, he and 10 Islamic co-defendants have sat in the courtroom as prosecutors have described a scheme of intrigue and violence that, they say, constituted a "war of urban terrorism" against the United States.
In the next few days, Ms. Stewart and the other defense lawyers will begin presenting their case, hoping to prove that the defendants were ensnared in a politically motivated effort by the United States to persecute Islamic radicals who did nothing more than vehemently oppose American policies in the Middle East.
"Did he disagree with U.S. policy?" Ms. Stewart asked early in the trial, speaking of Mr. Abdel Rahman. "He did. Did he conspire, seditiously or otherwise? He did not."
For the 55-year-old Ms. Stewart, the trial has meant a return to the legal limelight that in previous years saw her defending clients ranging from members of the radical, leftist group the Weather Underground to Larry Davis, the man accused of trying to kill nine police officers in a 1986 shootout. In fact, along with lawyers like William M. Kunstler and Ronald L. Kuby, she is a spirited stalwart in the left-leaning legal ranks whose members not only represent self-styled revolutionaries but also sympathize with their causes.
She sees her current client as just the sort that the radical-left bar ought to defend.
"He's being framed because of his political and religious teachings," Ms. Stewart said. That, she suggested in a recent interview, aligns him with others she has defended, people like David J. Gilbert, the Weather Underground member who was convicted in the 1981 Brink's armored car robbery in Rockland County, or Richard C. Williams, who was convicted of setting off bombs at military sites and corporate offices in the early 1980's.
For Ms. Stewart, who lives on the lower East Side and operates from a West Village office, those earlier clients were not simply professional accounts; they were revolutionaries in a society that she herself sees as desperately needing "radical surgery." Even as she argues that Mr. Abdel Rahman did not conspire in violent schemes in America, she herself says that violence and revolution are necessary to wipe out the economic and racial injustices of America's capitalist system.
"I don't believe in anarchistic violence but in directed violence," she said. "That would be violence directed at the institutions which perpetuate capitalism, racism and sexism, and at the people who are the appointed guardians of those institutions, and accompanied by popular support." Ms. Stewart declined to specify which institutions she would include in that definition.
Even Larry Davis, whose acquittal in the shootout with the nine police officers was a stunning triumph for Ms. Stewart and her co-counsel, Mr. Kunstler, was justified in using violence, she said.
"Larry Davis was a lightning rod of a case because it was at a time when a lot of black people were being assaulted and murdered by the police," she said. "I thought the Larry Davis case had captured the feelings of the third-world community in the city because here's a kid, whether you liked what he did or not, he stood up to the police."
While Ms. Stewart says that all her high-profile clients share the distinction of being revolutionaries against unjust systems or people whose cases expose those injustices, she readily acknowledges that some of her radical-left legal colleagues question whether Mr. Abdel Rahman is the kind of defendant they can feel enthusiastic about.
As an Islamic fundamentalist, she said they told her, he has long advocated the overthrow of the Egyptian Government in favor of a religious, authoritarian state that, they said, would make short shrift of far-left dissenters like herself.
"The entire left bar raised that issue," she said. "They said, 'You'd be the first to go.' " But "there's a tradeoff" she said.
"I certainly have deep sympathy for the struggle in Egypt," she said of the people who are fighting a Government they consider oppressive. The fundamentalist movement, she said, "is the only hope for change there, the one that gathers the imagination of the people, that motivates them."
Though her words are fiery, her tone is neither didactic nor missionary. In fact, the words flow in pretty much the same effervescent voice she uses to tell of the joys of taking her 9-year-old granddaughter to watch the Mets play at Shea Stadium, where "we yell, vent and carry on."
Of the World Trade Center bombing, she said, "I think that was pretty much anarchistic." She noted that Mr. Abdel Rahman denied any involvement in that bombing or in any of the other plots charged in the case, and that he insisted he was being persecuted for his strident opposition to United States policies in the Middle East.
He and his co-defendants are not accused of carrying out the World Trade Center attack for which four other men were convicted in an earlier trial. But the prosecution says that the attack was part of an overall conspiracy by the defendants to intimidate the United States into changing Middle East policies that they saw as aiding Israel and the Egyptian Government.
Recalling her own journey into radical dissatisfaction with American society, Ms. Stewart said she had grown up "just a Protestant girl from Queens," who led a sheltered youth as the daughter of schoolteachers living in an all-white neighborhood.
Among the experiences that changed her outlook were the poverty and squalor she found in Harlem when she began working there as a school librarian and teacher in the 1960's, about a decade before she went to law school at Rutgers University. "I did not know Harlem existed," she said.
"I said, 'Why are all these people living in these conditions? I wouldn't.' My answer was, 'Because they're kept here and society had an interest in keeping them here, and I was part of it and didn't want to be but wanted to change things.' "
Those who have worked with -- and against -- her use terms like "shrewd," "highly intelligent," and "hard-working" to describe Ms. Stewart, whose courtroom manner is steady, methodical, and, as she put it, "not abrasive."
"She's very proficient and is very, very prepared," said Charles E. Rose, a former Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn who faced Ms. Stewart in the 1986 bombing trial of Mr. Williams, the man convicted of setting off bombs at military and corporate sites.
Ms. Stewart, who entered the case only six weeks before the trial began in January before Judge Michael B. Mukasey, had unusually little time to prepare for Mr. Abdel Rahman's defense. The cleric from Egypt, who is blind and does not speak English, had insisted he would defend himself, but associates finally convinced him otherwise and contacted Ramsey Clark, the former United States Attorney General. Pressed by his own caseload, Ms. Stewart said, Mr. Clark brought her into the case.
Mr. Clark, who has not been at the trial much, remains a strategic adviser and handles various out-of-court matters, Ms. Stewart said. The third lawyer on the team, Abdeen Jabara, is in court daily.
To handle the long case, Ms. Stewart had to shift most of her other work to her son and law partner, Geoffrey Stewart. Her practice involves all kinds of criminal cases, she said, except child abuse. "I taught school for 11 years and see children as true innocents and have a hard time defending people accused of this," she said.
She also said she "wouldn't go out of my way" to work with Mr. Kunstler again. Some lawyers who know both of them say Ms. Stewart resentfully believes that Mr. Kunstler hogged credit for the Larry Davis acquittals. But Ms. Stewart insisted the rift stems from other disagreements over the case and said she and Mr. Kunstler remain friends. Mr. Kunstler denied seeking undue credit and praised Ms. Stewart's abilities.
Meanwhile, the demands of the Abdel Rahman trial have had an impact of another sort: they have sharply cut Ms. Stewart's attendance at Shea Stadium, where she has managed only one visit this spring, compared to one a week before the players' strike last year.
A lust for revolution and love of baseball are easily compatible, she said. "I've always said, when the revolution comes to this country, it'll be as American as apple pie and baseball," she declared cheerily.

David J. Gilbert was convicted in 1983 of murder and robbery for participation in 1981 Brink's armored car robbery in Rockland County, in which two police officers and a Brink's guard were killed. He and his co-defendants termed the robbery an "expropriation" needed to finance their fight to create an independent black nation.
 
Bilal Sunni-Ali was acquitted in a separate Federal trail related to the Brink's robbery. Mr. Sunni-Ali, a musician and supporter of an independent black nation, had been charged with conspiracy in a case that involved several armored-car robberies and four murders. Ms. Stewart was co-counsel with Chokwe Lumumba.
 
Larry Davis was aquitted in 1988 of attempted murder of nine police officers in a shootout that left six officers wounded. In the highly celebrated case, the jury accepted the argument that Mr. Davis had fired in self-defense, believing that the officers were trying to kill him. In a separate trial that year, he was acquitted of in the killings of four drug dealers. In both trials, Ms. Stewart was co-counsel with William M. Kunstler.
 
Richard C. Williams was convicted in 1986 of setting off bombs at military centers and the offices of several major corporations in the early 80's. In 1991 he was convicted of killing a New Jersey State trooper in 1981.

Early Gains In Treasury Issues Lose Momentum

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The plunge in consumer confidence helped Treasury securities make early gains yesterday, but it could not overcome a lackluster note auction or signs that the economy may not be slowing enough to allow the Fed to cut interest rates.
The 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to a price of 1141/32 for a yield of 6.54 percent, unchanged from the previous day. Intermediate notes and shorter-maturity bill rates were either down slightly or unchanged. 
 Traders attributed the early gains to a 9-point plunge in the Conference Board's June consumer confidence survey. The index fell to 92.8, its lowest level since October 1994, versus estimates of 101.5 and against May's revised 102.0.
But market gains were limited ahead of the Treasury's two-year note auction, because of investor concern over supply. Uncertainty about the outcome of next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and whether a rate cut was in the wings, made buyers hesitant, turning a usually easy sale of two-year notes into a harder sell.
Traders said that as a result, market participants grew apprehensive about today's auction of new five-year notes, which is generally a harder sell than the two-year issue.
The high yield at auction yesterday was 5.69 percent, down from 6.17 percent in May, and about three basis points higher than when-issued trading on Monday. Late yesterday the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.90 percent.
The consumer confidence report reconfirmed for some investors that the economy was headed for a mild recession. Those expectations were dampened in the last two trading sessions by the jump in durable orders last Friday and Monday's pickup in sales of existing homes. Also, the Johnson Redbook Service's weekly retail sales report released yesterday suggested some strength and indicated that retail sales so far through June are on pace to exceed those in May by 1.5 percent.
A Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, commented to reporters before a closed-door session with economists and business executives yesterday in New York that "we're still in a period of slow to moderate growth." But he added that he did not expect the economy to contract for two consecutive quarters. A recession is often defined as two successive quarters of economic contraction.
Reacting to the confidence report, Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said: "The fact that it declined was a modest surprise; the fact that it declined to the extent that it did was a major surprise. Clearly none expected it."
Mr. Fine noted that the Michigan consumer confidence survey of the first 15 days, reported on June 16, showed a noticeable increase, while the Conference Board's survey went the other way. "The fact that this disparity has occured is not unusual for a month-to-month period," Mr. Fine said. "It would be unusual, however, if it continued."
Not only the two measures of consumer psychology but all recent economic statistics paint a mixed pictures, he said. "The consumer confidence data certainly lends credence to the view that the Fed will lower the funds rate in July, but it is far from being the decisive factor," Mr. Fine said.
Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said: "Over all the market has acted pretty well. considering the recent gains it's had. Investor interest is still in the five-year to 10-year maturities, but basically the lower shorter maturities."
Mr. Roden sees a large buildup of money next week because huge amounts of bonds are retiring on top of the normal interest and principal payments. "All that reinvestment money could affect the markets," he said, citing in particular "the municipal bond market, where supply of new issues is thin."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 5.690%
Low Yield . . . 5.630%
Median Yield . . . 5.660%
Accepted at low price . . . 3%
Total applied for . . . $42,314,722
Accepted . . . $17,753,477
Noncompetitive . . . $914,000
Interest set at . . . 5.625%
 
The two-year notes mature on June 30, 1997.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall in Volatile Trading, With Dow Off by 8.64

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks fell in volatile trading yesterday as market players reacted to conflicting reports on the economy and worried about the direction of interest rates.
Technology shares, concentrated in the Nasdaq stock market, took the soundest beating in the market's third consecutive retreat. Those issues have been among the best performers in recent months. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 8.64 points, to 4,542.61, after advancing as much as 20 points earlier in the session. Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled a heavy 346.96 million shares, up from 296.72 million in the previous session.
Stocks started the session lower, resuming the downward course of the previous two sessions that had at least temporarily halted a four-month run of new highs. Again, weak overseas markets and lower bond prices helped set the sour tone.
Shortly after the market opened, however, stocks shot higher, gaining as much as 20 points on a Conference Board report showing consumer faith in the economy had unexpectedly plunged in June, with the board's index posting the biggest monthly decline in three years. Bond prices shot higher and that rally spilled over into stocks.
The markets' optimism was based on the belief that with the economy apparently weakening the Federal Reserve was more likely to lower interest rates at next week's two-day meeting of its policy-setting Open Market Committee, traders said.
"Consumer confidence dropped much more than expected, causing a rally in the bond market and encouraging those who have been betting the Fed would cut rates next week," said Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A. G. Edwards & Sons.
Bond investors like slow economic growth because it allays fears of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments.
One of yesterday's big losers was Champion International, which fell 2 5/8, to 51, after Loews said it would sell 5 million shares of the stock at $52.45.
Pepsico Inc., slipped 1 1/4, to 45 5/8, after Goldman, Sachs removed the company from a top investment list and a teamsters' strike against Pepsi appeared to widen.
Republic New York, gained 2, to 54 3/8, after Standard & Poor's said it would add the bank holding company to its S. & P. 500-stock index after the close of trading July 3.
Club Med gained 2 3/4, to 31 7/8. A board committee recommended that shareholders accept Club Mediterranee S.A.'s new cash offer of $32 a share. The suitor currently holds 70.8 percent of Club Med's shares.
On the Amex Home Oil rose 2 7/8, to 13, on news that Amoco's Canadian Petroleum Company unit was to make a cash offer to buy all common shares of the company.
Technology issues were pounded, with Intel losing 2 3/8, to 62 5/8, in Nasdaq trading, and I.B.M. tumbling 2 7/8, to 95 3/8, on the Big Board.
However, Softkey International was up 1 5/8, to 30 3/4. A public offering of 2.3 million common shares was priced at $28.875.
Technology stocks have risen 32.7 percent since January and 65 percent over the last year, according to calculations by Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. Semiconductor issues, meanwhile, are up 101 percent over six months, he said.
"When you have that kind of performance, it's only common sense to expect some kind of meaningful pullback," Mr. Johnson said.

Copper Prices Fall as Inventory Shows Slower Pace of Decrease

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices tumbled yesterday on the Commodity Exchange of New York amid signs that world supply was increasing.
On other markets, corn prices fell while crude oil rose. The Commodity Research Bureau index dropped 0.62 point, to 234.56. 
 Copper prices had been moving higher as falling stockpiles in the United States and around the world indicated demand from industrial consumers like auto makers and appliance manufacturers was continuing to outstrip new supply despite signs of economic slowdowns.
While copper inventories held in London Metal Exchange warehouses fell again today, dropping by 2,725 metric tons, to 175,775 tons, its lowest since December 1990, the pace of decline has slowed recently, disappointing some traders.
"Expectations were for around 4,000 to 5,000 tons" of inventory declines, said Lawrence Eagles, an analyst with the commodity brokers GNI Ltd.
Copper for July delivery on the New York exchange fell 3.55 cents, to $1.3715 a pound, its third consecutive decline after surging to a six-year high of $1.46 a pound on June 22.
Corn prices slid for a second day as rainfall drenched the Midwest, easing concern that hot, dry weather would damage this year's crop.
Up to two inches of rain fell yesterday on parts the Corn Belt from Iowa and Missouri to Ohio and forecasters are calling for more rain during the rest of the week.
"It's still very much of a weather market and conditions look great," said Don Roose, analyst with U.S. Commodities Inc. in Des Moines.
Corn for July delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 3.75 cents, to $2.635 a bushel, its lowest price in more than a month.
Crude oil climbed for the third time in four days as refineries lifted their crude oil consumption to meet robust gasoline demand, drawing down stockpiles.
This week's report from the American Petroleum Institute was expected to show crude stockpiles fell by as much as three million barrels last week as the brisk refining activity continued.
"Refiners who need the barrels are coming in to buy it," said Benedetto L'Abbate, a crude oil trader at the Agip Petroleum Company in Houston.
Crude oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 13 cents, to $17.77 a barrel.
After the market closed, the institute reported that crude oil stockpiles plunged by 6.2 million barrels, or almost 2 percent, to 319 million barrels, 8.4 million barrels below a year ago.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Off vs. Mark and Yen As Japan Trade Deadline Nears

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the yen and some other leading currencies yesterday as traders grew more skeptical that the United States and Japan would reach an accord on auto trade.
American and Japanese negotiators met again yesterday in Geneva in an effort to find some sort of agreement to open Japanese markets to American cars and car parts. Washington has threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs on $5.9 billion of Japanese luxury cars if no accord is reached by midnight tonight. 
 With the sanctions deadline hanging, currency traders said they were reluctant to bet on the dollar's direction against the yen. "There are too many questions that remain to make a strong bet one way or the other," said Joe Francomano of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York.
Others said they expected the dollar to benefit regardless of the outcome of the trade talks. "If the sanctions go in place, or if they strike some kind of accord, either way it's bullish for the dollar," said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "Either way, we're trimming the trade deficit."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar slipped to 84.29 yen from 84.36 yen on Monday. It was also weaker against the German mark, declining to 1.3870 marks from 1.3907 on Monday, after reports of rising prices in western Germany dampened speculation that the central bank there might lower interest rates.
A report from the German state of Bavaria said consumer prices had risen four-tenths of 1 percent in the most recent reporting month, compared with two-tenths of 1 percent the month before. Other western German states have also reported accelerating prices, and yesterday's report squelched remaining hopes of an interest-rate cut.
In other currency trading yesterday, the British pound fell against the mark for a second day amid concern that the Conservative Government could fall. The pound's decline was further spurred after a member of Prime Minister John Major's Cabinet, John Redwood, the Welsh Secretary, resigned Monday to take up Mr. Major's challenge to his opponents to contest the Conservative Party leadership.
Against the mark yesterday, the pound dropped as low as 2.1867, its lowest level since May 10, before settling at 2.1984 marks. It slipped against the dollar to $1.5826 from $1.5852.

HEADLINE: Loss of Economic Council Held Imprudent

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
An effort by House Republicans to abolish the Council of Economic Advisers has drawn criticism from past council chairmen from both parties, who say it provides the President with an important independent source of economic advice.
A proposal to cut funds for the council's operations will be considered on Wednesday by the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government. Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee, said last week that even without the council the President would have enough economists in the Office of Management and Budget and the National Economic Council. 
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's first chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers and now chairwoman of the National Economic Council, said Representative Lightfoot "has a notion that is not based on the reality of what is going on in government."
She said the Council of Economic Advisers, which was established in 1947, provided objective economic analysis, and had a role that was different from either the budget office or the National Economic Council at the White House.
"None of these people is underutilized," she said. "Everyone is working more than full time by any reasonable characterization of hours in a day."
The Council of Economic Advisers often looks at proposals for government action and "points out that some idea will have bad consequences," she said. For example, she cited warnings from the council early in the Reagan Administration that "large deficits and high long-term interest rates were putting pressures on the American manufacturing system."
Economists at the Office of Management and Budget, she said, have another mission -- budgetary analysis. And the National Economic Council, she said, arranges the meetings and memorandums from which the President makes economic decisions.
Herbert G. Stein, chairman of the council under President Richard M. Nixon from 1972 through 1974, was even blunter. "I think it's a stupid idea," he said, adding that the council was "the only group of economists in the Government that doesn't have some agency ax to grind."
The council has a staff of about 40. "It has a budget of $3.4 million," Mr. Stein said. "The President is making decisions about a $7 trillion economy. I think we can afford to give him the best possible advice."
Mr. Stein said most other government economists promoted the interest of the department or industry to which they are connected. He said the council's advice against building a supersonic transport aircraft during the Nixon Administration "saved the country more than the whole cost of the council for 50 years."
"The main thing the council does is give the President a view of his options," Mr. Stein said. "Even if he disagrees, he makes a better decision because he has seen what his options are."
Democrats on the subcommittee plan to oppose Mr. Lightfoot's proposal, arguing that it was inappropriate to be "playing games with the White House budget," as Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland put it. If the proposal is approved by the subcommittee, it could still be reversed by the full committee or the whole House, or by the Senate.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Campaign by car dealer pokes fun at sales pitches, angers other dealers -- and increases his business.

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
CAR-DEALER advertising can be a wasteland of shrieking prices and exclamation points. But one dealer, Swanson Chrysler Plymouth in St. Petersburg, Fla., has hit on a disarming formula: poke fun at and unmask some of the most misleading practices of auto dealers.
True, venal auto dealers are an easy target. But it is a perilous strategy, nonetheless, not only because it brings the advertiser's own occupation into disrepute but also angers fellow auto dealers. The local auto dealer organization, of which Swanson Chrysler is not a member, is especially angry. 
 For the last four months, Swanson Chrysler's 11 print advertisements in local newspapers have starred a leering, potbellied cartoon character named Craven Bamboozle. "He's the kind of guy only a mother could love," reads the ad that introduced the character, "except that his mother won't speak to him since he unloaded a lemon on her (at full price)."
But instead of merely setting up a straw auto dealer, the Swanson Chrysler ads go several steps further. They detail what the dealership calls common tricks of the trade, including the "Invisible Sales Manager," the "Guaranteed Trade-In Scam," and a densely detailed ad on what it calls "leasing scams." The leasing ad even includes the address of Florida's Attorney General so consumers can report rip-offs.
So far, Swanson Chrysler's strategy has worked. A medium-size dealership, Swanson Chrysler has been hurt recently by rumors that it was about to close because of the recent illness of the owner, Cosby Swanson Jr., who is 75.
Monthly sales had dwindled before the ad campaign began in February to fewer than 50 new cars and 50 used cars. Now the ad campaign has gained the dealership enough attention so that Swanson Chrysler's sales total more than 75 new cars and 65 to 70 used cars a month, at a time when overall industry sales are slow because of the weakening national economy.
The ad campaign is the brainchild of Cosby Swanson 3d, 40, one of three sons of the elder Mr. Swanson. He is helping to run the dealership now that his father is semiretired after recovering from a stroke.
"Our ad campaign is designed not so much to tell people about cars and their prices," Mr. Swanson 3d said, "but to convince them that down the line when they are ready to buy a car they ought to take a look at our dealership."
A former law student who also studied church history at an interdenominational seminary, the younger Mr. Swanson describes himself now as an unpublished short story writer. He writes the copy for the ads and developed the character of Craven Bamboozle, a television evangelist he used to portray in skits at the seminary.
A longtime friend in North Carolina, Mark Dubowski, is the cartoonist for the ads and helps edit Mr. Swanson's copy. Mr. Dubowski, a former advertising representative at Forbes magazine, said, "The purpose of the ads is not really to poke fun at dealers but make car shopping into something that you can not only laugh about but learn something useful, too."
The car salesmen lore came straight from the source, the longtime salesmen at Swanson Chrysler who had all worked at other car dealerships. "We had about two days of skull sessions and it all came pouring out," the younger Mr. Swanson said.
Dean Silvers, the dealership's 49-year-old general manager, has been in the auto business for more than 28 years. He and other salesmen contributed tales like the Invisible Sales Manager (the one who tells the salesmen to tell the customer her offer is too low) and the Guaranteed Trade-In (the car's price is secretly increased to take into account the large trade-in).
Mr. Silvers said Florida was a special problem for older and retired people. Salesmen at one dealership, he recalled, used to fight each other when a potential customer would drive in with a tennis ball attached to the car antenna.
The reason? It meant the driver was a frail or forgetful person who had trouble finding his car in the parking lot and needed the tennis ball as a reminder.
Mr. Silvers also used to advertise cars with especially attractive low prices but especially unattractive features so no one would buy it -- such as a Thunderbird priced $500 below wholesale but with a black exterior, black interior and no air-conditioning, in the middle of a Florida summer.
To Albert J. Leo, general manager of Scott Buick in Pinellas Park, Fla., the Craven Bamboozle ads strike a raw nerve, but not so much because they are satirical, he said, but because they contain inaccuracies about leasing, a large part of his dealership's business.
"We feel the ads are degrading and demeaning and not 100 percent accurate," said Mr. Leo, who is president of the St. Petersburg Dealers Association.
Well, grit your teeth, Mr. Leo. Craven Bamboozle will ride again, as early as this Fourth of July weekend. the younger Mr. Swanson received a letter from Helen Jane Spicer of Clearwater, Fla., who praised Swanson Chrysler's ads and contributed a story about herself and a supposed industry practice known as "unhorsing."
A dealer convinces a customer to take home a car for a test drive overnight. The next day the customer is astonished to find that her old car has been "sold," without a title or a sales agreement. Mrs. Spicer said it happened to her.
"We just couldn't not do it; it's so Craven Bamboozle," Mr. Swanson said.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Dust Off the SEATO Charter

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The foreign policy establishment is currently wrapped up in a mind-numbing debate about whether NATO should be enlarged. But if you think about it, the more urgent question for American foreign policy is whether SEATO should be revived.
Yes, you remember SEATO -- the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." Formed in 1954 by the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, France and the U.S., it aimed to deter China and the spread of Communism in Asia. SEATO was terminated in 1977, after the Vietnam war, leaving no trace outside of trivia quiz shows. 
 Of course, the old SEATO is not likely to rise from the ashes anytime soon, but think about this: The chances of the Russian military invading Eastern Europe today are virtually nil. Today's Russia has neither the intentions, nor, if Chechnya is any guide, the capabilities to threaten Eastern Europe. That is why we have the luxury of endlessly debating NATO enlargement. It can wait.
That is simply not the case anymore in Asia. There, a rapidly growing China increasingly has the capabilities, and some would argue the intentions, to expand aggressively into the South China Sea, to seize the oil-laden Spratly Islands and to more generally intimidate all its neighbors. Unlike Europe, where you at least have a core NATO alliance of 16 countries in place, Asia is a strategic no man's land. There is no formal security structure there, and the ad hoc balancing arrangements, involving the U.S., Japan, Korea and Russia, are just that -- ad hoc and uncertain, held together with Band-Aids and baling wire.
How long will this ad hoc structure be able to maintain a strategic balance with 1.2 billion Chinese, whose economy is growing at 10 percent per annum, whose work force adds 60 million job-seekers each year and whose huge army is steadily modernizing?
The optimists argue that the Chinese military, while improving, still has very little ability to project power far beyond its borders. It has no aircraft carriers, only a few old submarines and no aerial refueling capabilities. But when you have 3.2 million men under arms, you can be the Salvation Army and still intimidate your neighbors.
The pessimists argue that China has consistently lied about its defense budgets and strategic thinking. That makes its neighbors nervous, particularly when both the U.S. and Japan are slowing their defense spending and China is speeding its military modernization -- not to mention bullying Hong Kong, brazenly testing more nuclear weapons and beefing up its toeholds in the Spratly Islands, which are claimed by five other nations.
Senior U.S. officials say that this behavior has increasingly prompted some of China's neighbors to ask Washington whether the best policy in the coming decade is to engage China or formally try to contain it. The obsessive focus on NATO expansion has obscured this behind-the-scenes discussion.
At this stage, any formal containment of China would be premature. SEATO's resurrection can wait. Declaring Beijing the enemy now would only become a self-fulfilling prophecy. It may be inevitable, but as long as there is still a chance for shaping a benign China, the stakes are too big not to try.
The U.S. and its Asian allies need to stick with a combination of engagement and hidden containment. That means halting the shrinkage of the U.S. naval and army presence in Asia and establishing full diplomatic relations with Vietnam -- now -- because as China's historical enemy, Hanoi is one of the strongest counterweights to Beijing. It means getting Japan to understand that if it continues its unfair trade practices, it will corrode the strategic axis between Washington and Tokyo that is central to balancing China. And it also means conducting a sustained, high-level dialogue with China's leaders, and continuing to rope them into regional associations, like the APEC economic forum, in the hopes of taming their bullying instincts through interdependence.
It's the Woody Allen solution. His famous quip that "80 percent of success is showing up" is true in geopolitics as well. For now, formally trying to contain China would be a mistake. But we can keep showing up -- militarily, economically and diplomatically -- drawing red lines for China wherever necessary, building bridges wherever possible. And dusting off that SEATO charter just in case.

HEADLINE: Scalping Revision Is Being Postponed

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
The curtain has all but come down for now on a disputed effort to scrap the state's scalping law and allow ticket brokers to set their own prices for resale of tickets to Broadway shows and special events.
With New York's limits on ticket markups set to expire on Friday, the Senate and Assembly have been considering bills that would allow licensed brokers to charge whatever they want for tickets. Out-of-state brokers have been lobbying strenuously in behalf of those bills, but it seems likely they will be shelved for a while. Unable to agree on the measures, the State Legislature is expected to extend the current, spottily enforced law through next March. 
 For theatergoers, it is likely to mean little change: tickets to popular shows will remain hard to get at the box office but available from brokers, particularly out of state, at high premiums.
Were the bills to pass, a broker who bought tickets from the box office at the listed price of, say, $60 a seat, could legally resell them for $150 or $200 a ticket or higher, depending on the demand, which is just what brokers in New Jersey and Connecticut now do in spite of the current law. New York brokers, however, are limited to a markup of $5 a ticket or 10 percent of the face price, whichever is higher, although in practice many add fees raising the markup to about 30 percent.
But now the proposed bills, which include a $2 per ticket surcharge to go to the state and which have been strongly opposed by theater owners and producers, have fallen short, giving way to compromise bills that will merely extend the current law through March 1996.
The action, or lack of it, is the latest milestone in the long effort to regulate the big business of selling access to live entertainment events, an issue that the previous New York State Attorney General, Oliver G. Koeppel, turned into something of an investigative crusade. His successor, Dennis Vacco, is pursuing the inquiries but has not taken a strong public stand. The investigation into what was called a booming black market in prime tickets continues to inch along with no sign of a conclusion. New Jersey recently voted to try a free market in ticket resales, while Connecticut voted to keep its anti-scalping limits in place for events in that state. And just this week, a standoff between the rock band Pearl Jam and Ticketmaster over the distributor's ticket markups culminated in cancellation of most of the band's summer tour.
The free-market bills were sponsored by Senator Dean Skelos, Republican of Nassau, and Assemblyman Joseph T. Pillittere. Democrat of Niagara County. A formal vote to extend the current law is expected sometime before the Legislature adjourns this week. "One thing we don't want to do," said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester, "is to back into a restructuring of the historic pricing system."
Even the East Coast Ticket Brokers Association, representing out-of-state brokers pressing for an open market, appeared to concede yesterday that the effort was dormant for now. The group's second choice, said Robert Malito, a legislative agent, or lobbyist, was to extend the present system and work toward a new compromise bill.
If all this seems like a lot of sound and fury over what should be the simple business of buying a seat to a show or concert, the reality is that it is hardly a simple business. That was evident at an Assembly hearing last month, at which one main issue was whether lifting the constraints on ticket resale would actually lower ticket prices or send them through the roof.
It all boiled down, several speakers said, to an issue of fairness. Ticket buyers need to feel that they have a fair shot at getting good seats and not that the best seats are being squirreled away for profiteering. Also, several legislators said, Broadway is too treasured an asset to jeopardize by pricing experiments.
Barry Lefkowitz, executive director of the year-old brokers association, argued that removing the restrictions would "bring the industry out of the shadows and the underground," and help "end the black market" and lure brokers from Connecticut and New Jersey back to New York City, lowering prices.
But Assemblyman Brodsky took issue with his economics. He asked what sense there was to taking the limits off resale prices when there was no flexibility in the supply. He said, "All that's going to do is shoot the price through the ceiling."
Mr. Lefkowitz contended in turn that in four states where a free market was recently instituted, Texas, California, Illinois and Indiana, resale ticket prices have in fact dropped. He also argued that eliminating New York's markup limits would restore the competitive advantage of New York's brokers, who now cannot get the best tickets to offer clients.
Reflecting the opposition of many theater owners and producers to a free market in ticket resales, Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, said the brokers "should not be trafficking in our product." Allowing unlimited markups, he said, would only increase the pressure on box office employees to conspire to funnel tickets to brokers, which is already a big problem. In a free market, Mr. Schoenfeld added, theater owners and producers might themselves raise ticket prices to "legitimately share in the true value of our ticket."
In the end, one mystery remained: the sources of the tickets regularly sold at high markups by the out-of-state brokers and the scalpers who haunt theatrical and other entertainment events. "I've heard of these things, but I've never seen such a situation," said Mr. Lefkowitz of the brokers' group.

HEADLINE: Voters Spurn a Tax Rise In Orange County Crisis

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., June 27

 BODY:
Orange County voters today soundly rejected a half-cent increase in the sales tax to help bail their government out of bankruptcy, increasing worries about how the county would pay its debts and avoid drastic cuts in its schools and municipal services.
With 60 percent of the vote running against the measure after a third of the precincts were counted, backers conceded that they had failed. 
 In the past six weeks of campaigning, politics has taken precedence over policy as the county wrestles with the consequences of its $1.7 billion loss last December in bad investments made by county officials and their financial advisers in the bond market. As a deadline for repayment of $975 million in bond debt approaches this summer, neither the opponents nor proponents had prepared a clear recovery plan in the event that the tax increase was defeated.
The immediate outcome of the rejection was uncertainty. Without the $130 million that the tax would reap each year over its 10-year life, officials feared that the county would not have the money to repay its huge debts, forcing significant cutbacks in government and social services and even raising the prospect of a state takeover.
In a possible harbinger of future problems with the bond market, the county today found itself facing rejection when it tried to sell $155 million in new bonds. It had to offer unusually high interest rates on the bonds and it still had difficulty attracting investors. "There was a general buyers' strike," said Paul Nussbaum, a county financial adviser. "It was a clear-cut boycott on Orange County paper. Price was not an issue."
In a statement today, State Treasurer Matt Fong warned that the state could become more directly involved in county operations. "This remains a county problem and time is running out," he said. "It may escalate to a statewide problem if there is either a default or a repudiation of a legal debt."
But that is not a step most people in state government relish. Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a bill that would have given him the tools to take over most county operations. And political analysts said the state was reluctant either to become directly involved in the crisis or to use taxpayer funds to rescue one of the most affluent counties in the nation.
Orange County still hopes it will succeed in a difficult deal to defer, or roll over, its bond debt for a year, thus avoiding a default and buying time for more cuts and possibly a new effort to increase the sales tax.
"I think there is a high probability that a rollover will be successfully negotiated," said James L. Doti, an economic analyst who is president of Chapman University in the city of Orange and who backed the tax referendum, Measure R. In this rich, conservative county that many people regard as ground zero in the nation's anti-tax movement, the notion of raising the sales tax a half percent to 8.25 percent to repair the the damage caused by government officials has aroused widespread anger. On the other hand, the alternatives that have been put forward are surrounded by ifs.
Larry Kimbell, who heads an economic forecasting group at the University of California at Los Angeles, said, "There are going to have to be some bloody cuts, some big, bloody cuts, and even then there will still probably be a financial crisis."
Opponents of the tax have placed their hopes in a number of steps that economic analysts say are far less certain to solve the problems than a sales tax increase.
They have called for cuts in the government bureaucracy, and propose the sale of John Wayne Airport and the diversion of highway funds that many analysts say may be legally impossible. And they hope for a huge settlement from Merrill Lynch, which is being sued by the county for its role in the failed investments.
Pro-tax campaigners acknowledged misgivings that residents of this seaside county had not yet felt enough pain from the bankruptcy to impose a tax on themselves.
And if the voters of Orange County are not willing to feel some pain through a higher sales tax, Mr. Kimbell said, it is unlikely that state legislators in Sacramento or the county' creditors in the bond market will be willing to bail them out.
At the state level, he added, "If Orange County refuses to raise taxes, what are the odds that Californians would be happy to vote more taxes to bail them out? Zero."

Japan's Trade Minister Is Sounding Flexible
 Things looked bad in Geneva until Japan's trade minister perked up at some "creative alternatives" offered by Mickey Kantor and surprised the Americans with a new willingness to expand foreign access to the Japanese auto market. As tonight's deadline approached, though, it was not clear whether Japan would offer enough to persuade President Clinton to call off threatened tariffs on luxury cars. [Page A1.] 
 The myth: Detroit has banged persistently on Japan's door, only to be left with wilted sedans. The truth: the Big Three auto makers have barely tapped. [D4.]
 Europe has squeezed concessions out of Japan with a tough trade stance -- the kind of concessions Tokyo denies Washington. [D4.]
 
No Orange County Tax Increase
 Voters soundly rejected a sales tax increase intended to help Orange County, Calif., recover from its bankruptcy. The rejection added to Wall Street's worries about the county's ability to pay its debts. [A10.]
 
Young Smokers: Philip Morris Acts
 Philip Morris announced a broad campaign to keep minors from smoking, including nationwide ads, warning labels and the end of promotional giveaways. But critics shot back that the company is trying to undercut Federal efforts to regulate tobacco as a drug and state efforts to penalize sales to minors. [A14.]
 The Government will keep subsidizing tobacco growers, as it has for 50 years. [A14.]
 
A Selloff in H.M.O. Stocks
 Nearly every H.M.O. stock came under attack, with the selloff even including shares of United Healthcare -- despite the hopes surrounding a planned merger. Market Place. [D8.]
 Stocks fell in volatile trading, with the Dow off 8.64, to 4,542.61, after being up 20 earlier. Prime suspects: conflicting reports on the economy and interest-rate worries. [D8.]
 
Blow to New York Water Plan
 Calling it a risky "fiscal gimmick," Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi vowed to block a plan to sell New York City's water system to a quasi-independent public agency. [A1.]
 
Too Many Presidential Economists?
 Do enough economists hover at the Presidential elbow? Some members of a House subcommittee say so, and are trying to kill the Council of Economic Advisers, but the effort has been criticized by past council chairmen from both parties. [D2.]
 
The S.E.C. Wasn't Happy
 It was billed as a "Snow White" sequel, with vast revenue. But the S.E.C. said investors in "Happily Ever After" were defrauded. [D2.]
 
Pollution: Speak No Evil?
 Manufacturers are required to disclose how much they pollute, imposing little burden beyond the paperwork. Yet the Senate's regulation-slayers are trying to halt the rapid rise of such disclosure. [A16.]

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFICIALS SAY JAPAN EASES A BIT ON TRADE STANCE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Wednesday, June 28

 BODY:
As American sanctions loomed against Japanese luxury cars, Japan's Trade Minister showed new willingness to expand foreign access to the Japanese automotive market, American officials said early this morning. But it was not clear whether Tokyo would offer enough to persuade President Clinton to call off the 100 percent tariffs that are set to take effect within 24 hours.
The sudden flexibility by the Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, Ryutaro Hashimoto, clearly took American officials by surprise. Mr. Hashimoto and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, met three times on Tuesday, ending their final session at 1:45 this morning. A Japanese official said the negotiators planned to meet again late this morning. 
 When the final session broke up this morning, it was not clear if the talks had reached the final stage of dealing with the most contentious issues, including commitments by Japan's auto makers to buy more American-made components.
"The impression we have is that he wants a deal," a senior American official said of Mr. Hashimoto. "But it is still unclear how far he can go."
If an agreement comes together, it would hinge on a side document, agreed to by Japan's car makers but not signed by the Japanese Government, that would lay out a series of "voluntary plans" for increased purchases of American auto parts.
Japanese officials said that the United States had proposed to word any such separate agreement in a way that assures the Japanese car industry that it would not be subject to penalties even if the car manufacturers failed to meet a series of benchmarks set out in the agreement. Those benchmarks would aim to verify that Japan's auto industry was buying an ever-increasing number of American components.
Officials were closeted in the meeting and unavailable to comment in detail on the latest reports.
Any such deal -- which still appeared to be just out of reach this morning -- could carry political risks on both sides of the Pacific, with each country undoubtedly tempted to describe the accord in different terms. Washington could be counted on to say that it won a major victory by getting Japan to agree to "measurable progress" in increasing parts purchases. Tokyo would certainly insist that it had defeated American efforts to get Japan to agree to "numerical targets."
The Japanese Government, by not being a party to that part of the accord, could argue that it had not engaged in "managed trade," even if it had choreographed every move.
The feverish late-hours maneuvering was a marked turnaround from the negotiating earlier on Tuesday. In the morning, top Administration officials in Washington had joined in a conference call with Mr. Kantor at which he described, in very pessimistic terms, his first negotiating session with Mr. Hashimoto, one of Japan's top politicians and a leading candidate to be the next prime minister. "It sounded like this whole thing was over, that there was no progress," said one official familiar with the briefing.
But a few hours later, Mr. Hashimoto's tone changed, and he discussed in great detail a paper handed to him by Mr. Kantor that laid out what one American official called "creative alternatives."
With the talks at a critical stage, Mr. Clinton faces a difficult choice today: take what Tokyo is offering now or move ahead with the sanctions on the bet that another, perhaps better, deal lies ahead once the Japanese car makers begin to feel some financial pain. American negotiators have made it clear that they believe the Japanese car makers have a backup plan, one they may not be willing to disclose until after sanctions go into effect at 12:01 A.M. Eastern time Thursday in the United States.
Mr. Clinton has little to lose politically in most areas of the country from placing the 100 percent tariffs on the wholesale value of 13 luxury models shipped to the United States. After two years of frustrating negotiations, he has been pressed to take a hard line by several members of his Administration.
In Portland, Ore., on Tuesday at a daylong discussion of the economy of the Pacific Rim, Mr. Clinton defended his Administration's stance, speaking in a region of the country heavily dependent on trade with Asia. He said his approach was not intended to be protectionist, but was simply necessary to pry open markets for American products.
"I want to tell you, to the people of the Pacific Northwest, I am not trying to launch a new era of protectionism," Mr. Clinton said. "But we have tried now for two or three decades to open this market and this is the last major block to developing a sensible global economic policy."
But others in the Administration are less comfortable with the strategy of pressing Japan to the wall, especially because of criticism that the United States is undercutting the World Trade Organization, the dispute-settlement body that Mr. Clinton strongly supported when he pressed Congress last fall to adopt the global trade pact.
One reason it is so difficult to predict an outcome is that the American negotiators say they are still uncertain who is making many of the decisions for the Japanese.
Mr. Hashimoto is clearly in the lead and, like Mr. Kantor, he has demonstrated that he prefers to cut a deal after engaging in a lot of back-and-forth that allows him to take the measure of his opponent.
For all his dominance of the Japanese side, however, Mr. Hashimoto cannot act alone. While the bureaucrats who have spent their lives working at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have been divided over the merits of a deal, the lead negotiator, Vice Minister Yoshihiro Sakamoto, is widely viewed as reluctant to make concessions. He has repeatedly said that Japan has a solid case against the sanctions at the World Trade Organization and should press its argument there.
The unknown factor is the political calculation in Japan of the effect of a prolonged dispute with the United States. Tokyo officials worry that the dollar could plunge further, making it harder for all Japanese manufacturers to sell their products at a profit in the American market. Also, political pressure could build in Japan for retaliatory measures.
Mr. Hashimoto, at least in public, is keeping expectations low. Late last night, in one of his few comments to reporters, he said, "I was never optimistic from the beginning." When asked whether an agreement was at hand, he simply said: "I don't know."
In another overture to the United States by a Japanese auto maker, the Toyota Motor Corporation was expected to announce as early as today in Tokyo its plan to increase production of cars in the United States and other countries. The plan is also likely to include promises to increase research and development outside Japan and perhaps to increase local procurements of parts for foreign factories.
Japan's other major auto makers are also preparing such plans but might not announce them unless required to do so to bring a successful conclusion to the negotiations.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Gets Economic Tonic; Critics Call It Bland

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 27

 BODY:
The Government announced a package of measures today meant to ward off recession in Japan, but economists dismissed the steps as unlikely to make much difference and investors responded by selling off shares.
The reaction underscored fears that if the Government was unable to stimulate the economy, conditions might worsen before they improve. As Japan moves into its fifth year of economic troubles -- and its eighth rescue package -- the fragile economy is teetering on the brink of recession. Last week, the Government reported that the economy had expanded a mere one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter of 1995 from the prior three months. 
 A stronger Japanese economy would help the United States as well, so officials in Washington have been prodding the Tokyo Government for stimulative measures in the hope they would entice Japanese consumers to buy more American products.
In its latest package, the Government offered a relatively broad array of measures and indicated it would back up its revitalization program with additional funds later in the year. But today's package nonetheless seemed to reflect the Government's reluctance to take any bold steps before elections are held next month.
With a political battle looming, and the possibility of shifts in the national leadership, the nation's economic woes have been a sensitive issue. In describing the plan announced today, Government officials seemed hesitant even to hint at the severity of the economy's troubles. As late as this morning, the text of the announcement was modified to remove language referring to the growing "concern over the future" of Japan's economy.
Instead, the Government tried to reassure the public, with Kozo Igarashi, a senior Cabinet official, saying, "We are convinced that the measures certainly will bring about an economic recovery."
Jesper J. Koll, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd., said, "Today's announcement highlights the lack of leadership from either the bureaucracy or the politicians."
But Mr. Koll cautioned that the Government's role might be limited even if it were to offer a plan seen as more effective. "The perception, unfortunately, is that there is someone in the Government who can push a button and the economy can go back to 3 percent," he said. "We're getting patchwork packages that plaster over some of the cracks in the system. But it's difficult to gut the entire building and construct something entirely new."
Still, some economists said today's measures, however meager, were nudging the rescue attempt in the right direction. "They felt a need to put something out that shows they have a broad-based conception of what needs to be done," said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. "The energy level is higher."
Investors, however, snubbed the measures. Stock prices, already slipping in the morning, fell further after details of the package were released in the early afternoon. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index tumbled 386.31 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 14,759.05.
[The decline of the Nikkei was continuing on Wednesday. At midday, the index was down another 126.14 points, or almost nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 14,632.91.]
The Government package did not provide fresh money to stimulate the economy. But it would extend existing tax cuts and take some funds allocated for public works projects in the second half of the fiscal year, which began on April 1, and spend them in the first six months.
The Government would spend 14.5 trillion yen, or $173 million, before September. That amount, which is more than 70 percent of the spending planned for public works in the full year, represents 3 percent of Japan's economic output.
In what might be a controversial step, the Government suggested that it would consider expanding the use of public funds to help support the nation's ailing banks, which have a bad reputation among Japanese consumers. A council is being formed to study how such funds could be used, but there were few details, and some economists said the measures offered little more than the Government's earlier pledge to stand behind the banking system.
Perhaps as a bone to the United States, which has been pushing for Japan to further open its markets, the package included a general plan to evaluate ways to increase foreign investment and improve access to the Japanese market. But rather than offering numerical targets for buying imports or specific measures to open markets, the Government said instead that it would publish a white paper next month on deregulating the economy.
The package did suggest that as part of its effort to deregulate the economy, the Government might adopt quantitative goals for bringing prices in Japan more in line with prices elsewhere in the world. American imports are often twice as expensive in Japan as at home.
International investors, who have had a big role in the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, have been intensely concerned about Japan's ailing stock market and financial system. Today's measures included provisions to create a second over-the-counter market and suspend the dividend tax on stock repurchases. But with the stock and real estate markets depressed, the steps offered only modest hope for a revival.

HEADLINE: A DEAL ON AUTO TRADE;
U.S. Dealers in Japanese Cars Relieved at Escaping Big Tariffs

 BODY:
Yesterday's trade agreement averts the punitive tariffs that would have made Japanese luxury cars so expensive in America that practically no one would have bought them. Auto importers hailed the accord, saying it would preserve jobs at dealerships that sell the Lexus, Infiniti, Acura and other models.
Typical was the statement from Nissan North America, which handles Infiniti imports. "The real winners in this settlement," said Timothy MacCarthy, vice president of government affairs for the importer, "are the thousands of dealers and employees, whose jobs were saved, and American consumers, who will continue to benefit from free trade and competition." 
 The statement added: "We want to assure our customers that Infiniti dealers have a good supply of vehicles in inventory. Nissan plans to resume its normal production schedule immediately."
Toyota's American arm also praised the agreement, issuing a statement that said, "We at Toyota, our Lexus dealers and their employees are relieved that good sense prevailed on both sides of the table."

HEADLINE: Human Rights Group Denied Accreditation for U.N. Event

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 28

 BODY:
Freedom House, the New York-based human rights organization that monitors political liberties, civil rights and press freedom worldwide, has been denied participation in United Nations events as an accredited unofficial group.
Several other organizations faced challenges last week from a loose coalition of nations, including China, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Iran and the Sudan, which has been campaigning to curtail the growing influence of human rights groups in international affairs. These countries are all members of a committee within the Economic and Social Council that recommends what organizations should be given the right to take part in United Nations conferences and other meetings. 
 When the committee ended its meetings last week, only Freedom House among dozens of applicants had been rebuffed. More than 1,000 other unofficial groups are already accredited.
Another application that was challenged was submitted by Physicians for Human Rights, a Boston-based group that does extensive volunteer work for the United Nations at its own expense, including exhuming victims of genocide, testing DNA samples to reunite families after civil wars and advising war crimes panels. But the group's application was finally approved when India, which objected to the organization's reporting on the medical evidence of military atrocities in Kashmir, apparently was unable to gain enough support to block it, diplomats said.
The Economic and Social Council, meeting in Geneva in July, has the final say on what groups are finally admitted. But Freedom House does not expect to succeed in overriding the decision made on June 19.
"Ecosoc is not under any compulsion to accept," said Christopher Kean, projects director for Freedom House, using the diplomatic shorthand for the Economic and Social Council. "But people I've spoken to cannot remember a time when Ecosoc has gone against a recommendation by the committee."
James P. Rubin, spokesman for Madeleine K. Albright, the American representative at the United Nations, said today that the United States "strongly supports Freedom House's application."
"It is particularly disturbing that an organization like Freedom House, which is effective in shedding light on abuses should be opposed in this way, and we are going to continue to work on this issue," he said. The United States delegation has also been battling obstacles to wide participation in an international conference on women in Beijing in August and September.
In the 1950's at the height of the cold war, Freedom House had been accused of being the recipient of Central Intelligence Agency money. This accusation was never substantiated. In an interview tonight, Leonard Sussman, the director of the organization for 21 years and now its senior international scholar, dismissed the assertion, and said that from its inception in 1941 the organization had supported both conservative and liberal causes.
Nine countries voted to admit Freedom House: Britain, Bulgaria, Chile, Costa Rica, Greece, Ireland, Paraguay, Russia and the United States. Nine voted against: China, Cuba, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Philippines, the Sudan, Swaziland and Tunisia. Madagascar was absent. In case of a tie, an application is rejected.
"The Paraguayans and Russians put the case best," Mr. Kean said in an interview today. "They said that they did not agree with what we had said about them, but that democracy is about accepting differences of opinion." The Philippines apparently decided to vote against Freedom House after being shown how Manila rated in the organization's last report, in which the country was described as "partly free."
At the Committee to Protect Journalists, Bill Orme, the executive director, said that his group had decided not to fight a long battle for so-called consultative status in the United Nations, but were willing to apply for similar access to Unesco.
Unesco had encouraged their application, Mr. Orme said. But then they were turned down on the ground that the Committee to Protect Journalists was not an international organization.

U.S. and Japan Set Deal With Just Hours to Go
With just hours left before $5.9 billion in sanctions were to kick in, the United States and Japan found common ground on automotive trade. After long, turbulent talks, the key bargainers proclaimed a new era for two scrapping nations. But a close look shows an accord that is often deliberately vague and may fall short of President Clinton's goal of cracking open Japan's markets. [Page A1.]
 
On Capitol Hill, praise was cautious and muted. Some Democrats wanted more, while Republicans fretted about confrontational tactics. And Phil Gramm said, "The President was only shooting blanks." [D7.] 

Japanese auto companies will now -- surprise! -- do exactly what they were planning to do: become even tougher competitors here. [D6.]
 
"We didn't cave in," said a Japanese trade official, insisting that Tokyo had agreed to no targets, had specified no figures. [D6.]
 
China hungers for cars, Detroit is eager, but bureaucracy and logistics still intrude. [D7.]
 
Senate Passes Lawsuit Limits
A measure to discourage shareholder lawsuits passed the Senate by a surprisingly large margin after a flood of ads on both sides. Backing it were accounting firms and brokers, while consumer groups and regulators opposed it, concerned that duped investors would have little recourse. [A1.]
 
New Head for Endangered Council
The Council of Economic Advisers got a new chairman -- even as House Republicans moved closer to ending its financing. [A18.]
 
"It would be a pity to throw away a bargain" -- that summed up the reaction of many economists to the notion of scrapping the council. Peter Passell: Economic Scene. [D2.]
 
Monsanto to Acquire Calgene Stake
Monsanto will buy half of Calgene, known for its genetically engineered tomato. [D3.]
 
Healthy Profits at Morgan Stanley
Morgan Stanley reported a healthy increase in quarterly profits. [D5.]
 
Disclosure on Pension Plans
If their pension plans have too little money to pay promised benefits, big companies must break that news to workers this year -- and warn them of possible consequences. [D3.]
 
T.W.A. to Try Bankruptcy, Again
T.W.A. is trying bankruptcy again, but this time it hopes to emerge with less debt and a more realistic strategy. [D3.]
 
Prudential Is Sued Over New Era
Prudential Securities has been sued by two charities and a philanthropist seeking to recoup some money they stand to lose in the New Era bankruptcy. [D5.]
 
USAir? What Does Buffett Know?
USAir looked just fine to two big institutional investors even though the great Warren Buffett gave it a thumbs down. Sure enough, the stock doubled. Market Place. [D10.]
 
Stocks Rally, Then Fade
Stocks rallied strongly on the trade agreement, then slipped on weakness of technology shares. Still, the Dow industrials ended up 14.18 points. [D10.]
 
Broadway, in a Plain Wrapper
Beef. Milk. Broadway. National commodities all -- at least that's the goal of theater marketers who want people "to think of Broadway as a brand" and whose ads read "Celebrate Broadway" and "Destination Broadway." Advertising. [D8.]
 
"HIStory": No Sales Thriller
Michael Jackson's "HIStory" sold 391,000 copies its first week, making it No. 1 on the pop charts. Sony expected more. [C14.]

HEADLINE: Chicago's Mayor Gains School Control That New York's Mayor Would Envy

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 28

 BODY:
Mayor Richard M. Daley will essentially take over the city's schools on Thursday with the announcement of his handpicked choices for a "superboard," a scaled-down panel of five members, to run the nation's third-largest school system.
The move is the culmination of what could prove to be a decisive springtime for public education in Chicago, whose school system has for years grappled with financial crises, low test scores and high dropout rates. 
 In one of the last acts of the lame-duck 15-member school board, eight schools, including highly regarded Lindblom High, were recently shut down because they had been underutilized. And in what some education monitors here regard as a fitting farewell to that board, its president, D. Sharon Grant, resigned on Tuesday, four days before the end of her term, indicted on charges of having failed to file Federal income tax returns since 1977.
The centerpiece of the effort to turn the schools around was a bill, enacted by the State Legislature this spring, that gave Mr. Daley the kind of power that other big-city mayors, certainly Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, would wish for themselves: the right to select the head of the city schools -- and to do so without the advice or consent of any legislative or educational body.
Mr. Daley will also appoint every other top decision-maker for the system, which has 410,000 students, 45,000 employees and a budget of $2.9 billion. And his former chief of staff, Gery Chico, is expected to be the first president of the new board, which takes control at the end of this week.
The change in Chicago is much like that sought by Mr. Giuliani in New York. "We were astonished to find it was almost a mirror image of what we've been advocating in New York City," said Richard J. Schwartz, senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani. But legislators in Albany have proved far less eager than those in Illinois to give the Mayor such sweeping control over education.
Indeed, even supporters of the change here temper their optimism with some expressions of uneasiness.
"It concerns me that we've given that much power to a single political actor," said John Ayers, executive director of Leadership for Quality Education, a business group that backed the legislation. "I think in my gut it's going to work out, but it's going to be a bit of a white-knuckle ride."
Linda Lenz, editor and publisher of The Catalyst, a magazine that monitors school reform efforts in Chicago, called the overhaul "stunning."
"It's an opportunity for great good," she said, "or great catastrophe."
Under the newly enacted law, the Mayor's complete control will expire after four years. At that point, the board will grow to seven members, all of whom will require City Council confirmation. In the meantime, said Fred Hess, executive director of the Chicago Panel on School Policy, a group whose particular interest is school finances, Mr. Daley has the power of an autocrat.
"My guess is it will work for getting the management of the schools back in line," Mr. Hess said. "But the bad part is he has complete control of jobs, contracts and patronage."
Already the Chicago Teachers Union has gone to court in an effort to block enforcement of a part of the law that bars teachers from striking for the next 18 months and limits the scope of their collective bargaining to salaries and benefits. Class size, long a subject of contract negotiations, will now be set by the new school board.
But Jackie Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the 32,000-member teachers union, said it had no objection to the Mayor's appointing a new board. She called the boards of the last 15 years "dismal failures."
"I don't know what's going to happen with the Mayor," she said, "but can he do any worse?"
The Mayor's authority to appoint members to the school board dates from long before the new law. But the old authority was extremely limited, because he had to choose from a list of candidates submitted to him by a nominating commission that often included his political enemies.
Now the Democratic Mayor has all the authority he could have wanted, delivered to him by a Republican-controlled Legislature that has effectively shut off his ability to place blame for the poor state of the schools on his powerlessness to do anything about it.
"This is Republican legislation that they handed him," said the Mayor's spokesman, Jim Williams. "But he's not running away from it. He's often said, 'If you hold me responsible, give me the authority to make sweeping and profound change.' Now he has that authority."
Only time will tell whether the Legislature has handed Mr. Daley a noose instead of a gift. That Legislature did not include in its package what many experts say is more crucial to the ultimate success of the schools here: more money to run a system that in recent years has had to do everything but collect cans in the alley to make ends meet. "Without more dollars," Mr. Ayers said, "it's kind of like a gift that eats."
The school system must patch a $150 million budget deficit for the coming school year, and the following year looks even worse. No one expects much help from the state, which ranks near the bottom nationally in state aid to school districts, and the Mayor has said that finding additional city money will be extremely difficult.
The new changes leave in place the basic elements of the city's last round of school reform, in 1988. That year parents, neighborhood advocates and school staff were given much more say in the day-to-day running of the schools, from selecting principals to picking out what books students read.
As a result, school reform groups say, there has been some improvement. Test scores are inching up, and the dropout rate has dipped to 42 percent in 1994 from 51 percent in 1991. Overcrowding persists, however, particularly in Hispanic neighborhoods, while other neighborhoods have lost schools because there were not enough students.
What Anne Hallett and Diana Lauber of the Cross City Campaign for Urban School Reform want to seenow is even more local control.
A committed reform movement, Ms. Lauber said, has been built in the last few years, and it will be closely watching Mr. Daley's every step.

HEADLINE: A DEAL ON AUTO TRADE: THE AGREEMENT;
U.S. SETTLES TRADE DISPUTE, AVERTING BILLIONS IN TARIFFS ON JAPANESE LUXURY AUTOS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 28

 BODY:
The United States and Japan reached a broad but ambiguously worded accord today on automotive trade, ending a two-year dispute just hours before $5.9 billion in tariffs against Japanese luxury cars were scheduled to go into effect.
President Clinton canceled the trade sanctions after a settlement was reached in marathon and turbulent negotiations here between the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and his Japanese counterpart, Ryutaro Hashimoto. 
 The talks over expanding American access to the Japanese automotive market were so heated that as late as 8 A.M. here, the effort to strike a deal had all but collapsed. It was pieced together anew, Japanese and American officials said, only after Mr. Kantor asked Mr. Hashimoto to come to the small United States trade office. Mr. Kantor then told Mr. Hashimoto, "Ryu, if we don't do it now, it won't get done."
The two negotiators emerged from that office 10 hours later, clearly exhausted, heralding the accord as the beginning of a new era for two countries whose economic disputes had begun to tear at their political alliance. "This agreement is a significant step to fundamental change," Mr. Kantor said. "It is broad, detailed and quantifiable."
In Washington, the President, who had vowed to go ahead with the sanctions unless Japan relented, said the agreement "will not solve every problem in our relationship, but for today we have proof that hard bargaining and good faith can overcome apparently insurmountable conflict."
It was far from clear, however, whether Mr. Clinton had met his own oft-stated goal of reaching a landmark accord that would break the back of Japan's tightly linked network of manufacturers and suppliers, forcing them to change forever their buying habits.
While the accord seems likely to increase purchases from the United States, the specifics described by both sides pointed to an accord that was deliberately vague in many crucial sections. No text of the actual agreement was released today. Nor does the agreement constitute a binding commitment by either the Japanese Government or Japan's car makers to increase substantially the purchase of American parts.
The breakthrough was greeted with relief in financial markets. The dollar rose against all major currencies as investors concluded that the deal would help avert a trade war. Stocks and bonds also rallied.
In the negotiations, the Japanese Government agreed to make major changes in its regulatory system that should make it easier for American companies to sell replacement parts in Japanese repair shops, which until now have been strictly controlled by the car makers. A far broader number of garages will now be permitted to conduct repairs for the strict automobile inspection that the Japanese call the "shaken." An inspection often leads to several thousand dollars worth of repairs. In opening that market to competition, the United States is relying on expectations that more shops will use American-made parts.
Tokyo also endorsed a substantial increase in the number of dealers who handle American cars, a figure that Mr. Kantor put at 200 more dealerships within a year, and 1,000 by the end of the decade. But again Mr. Hashimoto said in writing that "the Government of Japan has had no involvement in this forecast because it is beyond the scope and responsibility of government."
In Tokyo, the agreement was generally seen as not requiring Japan's major auto makers to do much more than they would have done anyway.
Japan's five major automobile companies released "voluntary plans" today that Mr. Clinton estimated would amount to approximately $9 billion in added sales for American companies over the next three years.
But many of the company-issued plans had few, if any, hard numbers. The Japanese Government stipulated in writing that any purchase estimates were not formal commitments, did not carry Government backing and were not enforceable. Nor did Japan endorse Mr. Kantor's arithmetic. An announcement issued by the two officials said: "Minister Hashimoto said that Ambassador Kantor's estimates are his own, and neither shared by the Minister himself nor the Government of Japan."
Mr. Kantor released his own breakdown of those estimates, indicating that more than two-thirds of the increased purchases, about $6.75 billion, would be met by Japanese auto plants situated in the United States. That would be an addition to current purchases of about $17 billion. The suppliers would include American car parts companies and Japanese companies that have operations in the United States, and are regarded as American companies for the purposes of the agreement.
In a sign of the chaos that surrounded the last few hours of the negotiations, that statement was included on a one-page document, apparently used in the negotiations, that was mistakenly released by Mr. Kantor's office. The document still had blanks for estimated parts purchases, suggesting that the final figures were only settled upon at the last minute.
On one critical issue the American negotiators clearly got far less than they wanted. Japanese auto makers did agree to use more foreign-made components in automobile factories in Japan, but much less than originally sought by the Administration. The issue was considered critical to breaking the "keiretsu" system of suppliers, which has been blamed for many of the troubles American companies encounter in Japan.
The Japanese companies agreed to import $6 billion in foreign parts for their domestic operations by 1997, a figure that combined purchases from the United States, Europe and Asia. Previously, Japanese companies set the same goal for 1994, but did not get even halfway to it, importing about $2.5 billion in parts. Meanwhile, Europeans have insisted that every benefit offered to American companies must also apply to them, a requirement that was endorsed in today's deal.
"We did the best we could on this," Mr. Kantor said. "Given the state of the Japanese economy, we had to be realistic."
While the specifics appear vague, "we have set a standard," Mr. Kantor said. "This is more than moral suasion, this is two Governments saying what we expect the companies to do. It is not something the firms can ignore."
Mr. Kantor also estimated that the five major Japanese auto companies would increase their production of cars in the United States to 2.65 million units by 1998, up from 2.1 million now. But it is unclear how much of that would have happened without the political pressure from the Administration.
Mr. Hashimoto agreed to send a letter to Japanese auto dealers telling them that they were free to carry foreign vehicles, but it was questionable how much difference such a letter would make.
Arguments over the numbers -- what they would amount to, and whether they would be published at all, even as estimates -- occupied much of the last-minute wrangling.
The deal was apparently nearly in place on Tuesday night, when Mr. Kantor finished his talks with Mr. Hashimoto at about 1:45 A.M., and the deputies working for the two men continued to talk through the night. Mr. Kantor soon regretted leaving the talks, even for a few hours.
The bureaucrats who run the Ministry of International Trade and Industry began unwrapping the deal, American officials said, pulling back from some of Mr. Hashimoto's concessions. "The whole thing blew up," a senior American official said. So at 8 A.M. Mr. Kantor asked Mr. Hashimoto over to the American trade office and issued something of an ultimatum. Time was running short, he said, and if the ministry bureaucrats were not brought under control, the sanctions would go into effect.
It worked. At midday, one of the top negotiators reported that the Japanese "have moved an awful lot in the last three hours."
By then, Mr. Kantor was left with the clear choice of accepting an agreement that fell short of what he originally wanted -- particularly on the purchase of American parts for factories in Japan -- or risking the political and diplomatic fallout of allowing the sanctions to be put on Japanese luxury cars. He decided, officials said, that he was unlikely to extract substantially more from Japan after the sanctions went into effect. Whether that was an accurate judgment will probably be debated for months to come.
One of the biggest fears was that sanctions could set off another plunge in the dollar. Another general worry was over what would happen to the American-Japanese relationship, which has been on uneasy ground for years.
"We were ready to go to sanctions, without question," a senior Administration official said. "But it is a big step, something you don't do to an ally lightly. So if there was a way to avoid it, we wanted to. And it was very speculative about whether, if we went to sanctions, we would get more."

HEADLINE: Diplomas Are Denied to 17 In Washington Irving Furor

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
At 8:30 A.M. yesterday, the new graduates filed into the main office at Washington Irving High School and collected their diplomas. But 17 of their classmates, whose diplomas had seemed certain at the graduation ceremony on Monday, were not among them.
Their principal, it was found, had improperly intervened to graduate them even though they had failed required courses. Some teachers had complained that the principal, Robert B. Durkin, had bypassed their authority, and by early Tuesday evening, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines had removed Mr. Durkin from his job, effective Friday. He also ordered a review of the academic records of 19 students. 
 The review found that two of the students had done enough work to qualify them for graduation. In one case, the principal intervened with a hefty economics assignment; in another he allowed a student who had missed too many gym classes to make up the credits through an after-school dance program. But the fate of the other 17 students was uncertain; their diplomas were still being withheld yesterday, according to Board of Education officials.
On a day that would normally be spent with students signing yearbooks, making summer plans, exchanging addresses and relishing the end of high school, the diplomas the Washington Irving seniors waited years to touch, wave and show off became a symbol of scandal at the school on Irving Place in Manhattan.
"Every time we go somewhere to get a job, they're going to think the diploma is not legitimate -- especially when they see it says 1995," said Diana Irving, 19, after picking up her diploma.
Some students signed petitions to protest the principal's removal. They argued over whether Mr. Durkin should leave, they witnessed a bitter fight among two groups of teachers -- one siding with Mr. Durkin and the other opposed -- and they saw administrators running out of the school building crying.
"This is our day to shine," said Rashema White, an 18-year-old graduate. "They messed up our whole day."
O'Neill Ellis, 17, learned Tuesday that he would not receive a diploma. He had failed an economics class, but Mr. Durkin allowed him to make up the credits by reading 15 chapters of an economic textbook and writing an 11-page report. When Mr. Ellis heard that Mr. Durkin had been removed, he suspected his diploma would be revoked, he said in an interview last night.
"I understand we might have messed up," he said. "But I don't see why they should have taken back our diplomas. It's not like I did a little two-page project. It took 11 pages, it required thinking."
He said that he knew he was behind in the class but that the teacher, whom he did not identify, refused to allow him to make up the work. He said he had received above-average grades in his other classes, with a 75 average, and said that he had got an 82 on the final economics exam.
Mr. Ellis said he had been accepted by Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, where he will enroll to study business finance once he receives his diploma. He said he will attend summer school to make up the economics class.
Another student who failed the same economics class, Gilberto Gonzalez, received his diploma late yesterday afternoon. Mr. Durkin assigned him the same economics textbook assignment and gave him a passing grade for the class. Board officials agreed with the principal's assessment.
Mr. Gonzalez said the teacher had failed him because he was absent from school for more than a month, suffering from an ankle injury and asthma. In an interview outside the school, he said his teacher had refused to give him work to complete at home. He said he had received passing grades, with a 65 average, and said that he had gotten a 97 on the final economics exam.
After receiving his diploma, Mr. Gonzalez said, "I feel great, I feel so great. If it wasn't for Mr. Durkin giving me a second chance, I wouldn't have gotten my diploma."
An English teacher, Linda Winkler, described a case involving a student in her class. She said the principal gave a passing grade to a student who had been absent from her class at least 50 times since February.
She said the student, whom she did not identify, did little homework and refused to take the final exam. She said she gave the student a 45, out of 100, which is a failing grade. She later found out, she said, that the principal had assigned the student an independent project that involved writing a book report on the novel "To Sir With Love." The principal gave the student a 65 in the class. Ms. Winkler said this angered her because she had assigned four book reports to students during the term.
"I think it's wrong to reward a student in that position," she said. "In the past few years it has reached the point where the standards are so low that if things are barely legible, they are passable."
Several teachers have said they agree with her allegations that the interference was improper.
But Mr. Durkin's removal, pending a formal disciplinary hearing, spurred an outpouring of support for him yesterday.
Teachers, students and community leaders praised Mr. Durkin for improving the security and the academic standards at a school that once was considered one of the city's worst high schools. About 40 people gathered last night in the school's library to voice support for Mr. Durkin and organize opposition to his removal. Outside the school, some of Mr. Durkin's supporters posted signs saying, "Save our principal Mr. Durkin."
In a letter to Mr. Durkin, Gregg Lundahl, a social studies teacher, said, "I am shocked and outraged at the recent events. I believe that you have been character-assassinated by a handful of the faculty who have a bone to pick with you."
More than a dozen other teachers voiced their support for Mr. Durkin and said he was opposed by some faculty members because he tried to run a tighter ship.
"What I think went on here is that there are teachers who don't want to teach," said an English teacher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "They fill the blackboard with vocabulary words and the kids are asleep, so he gives them an unsatisfactory rating. He makes them work."
Roz DeFelice, a health teacher who first made public the allegations against Mr. Durkin, denied that her motives were personal. "If I find a principal is breaking a rule, I have to report it," she said. "I reported what I saw. I don't know if I'm correct about it -- it's up to the board to investigate. They obviously found something."
Several students and teachers suggested Ms. DeFelice was conducting a personal vendetta against Mr. Durkin, whom many described as tough and, at times, dictatorial. One student said Ms. DeFelice routinely referred to Mr. Durkin as "Mr. Jerkin."
Ms. DeFelice said, "I do not like Mr. Durkin. Mr. Durkin knows it and everyone else knows it. But I did not make him break the law; he did that himself."
Ms. DeFelice said she believed Mr. Durkin had graduated the students because he wanted to improve the school's reputation so he would receive early tenure, which can be granted after three years of service. Some of the teachers suggested that Mr. Durkin, who became Washington Irving's principal in 1992, was to receive early tenure on June 30. But John J. Ferrandino, the superintendent in charge of the Division of High Schools and the person who would approve any granting of tenure, said Mr. Durkin was not among the candidates for early tenure.

Diplomas of the other 17 are being withheld. (Frances Roberts for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: What's Next: Ads on School Buses?;
In Tune With Giuliani, Agencies Ponder Billboard Revenue

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Most people look at New York City's litter baskets, schoolhouses, parking meters, garbage trucks and the like and see the chattel of municipal government. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration sees a far more lucrative possibility: ad space.
And it's for sale.
The city's Parks and Recreation Department hopes to raise $10 million this year by selling ads on virtually anything in its domain other than rocks and trees. The Board of Education plans to offer the sides of yellow school buses for advertising. The Sanitation Department wants to sell prime space on 25,000 sidewalk trash cans -- and even its garbage trucks. 
 With a city strapped for cash, Mr. Giuliani has endorsed the proposals and included some in the new budget -- at least in part to offer some balm to soothe the sting of spending cuts. In fact, the Mayor's budget office has prodded agencies to think of almost any public space as a potential billboard.
And the ideas are pouring in: Ads on dog runs. Ads on municipal buildings. Ads on newsstands and on still more bus shelters to pay for public pay toilets that would also carry, yes, more ads. In these hard times, officials say anything is possible within still to be detailed bounds of reason and taste.
It would be an exaggeration to say the city's for sale, but "Your Ad Here" has never held so much potential on public property. At least a dozen ideas are now snaking through the approval process.
A few are far advanced, with others still in planning. The Board of Education plans to begin soliciting bids for the school buses any day now, with school buildings to follow. The Parks Department, the agency in the vanguard, is already reviewing offers to place ads on basketball backboards in playgrounds, and yesterday it collected general ideas from eight eager advertisers.
"The whole point of it is that during times of budgetary stress, one looks for creative ways to find sources of revenues that don't impact on the economy of the city," the Mayor's Budget Director, Marc V. Shaw, said. "Advertising is one of those areas." Some people, of course, are appalled. They say the plans represent a gross commercialization of public property, even in a city that is probably the most ad-soaked metropolis in America.
"New York City is a place where serenity is difficult to find as it is," said City Councilman Thomas K. Duane, a Manhattan Democrat, whose subcommittee plans to hold a hearing today on ads being considered for parks. "I don't think the city should pile on."
Mr. Duane and others vow to fight.
No sooner, for example, had the Parks Department proposed erecting advertising on the small triangle in Times Square occupied by the TKTS booth than a coalition formed to oppose it. Its leader, Jeffrey Katz, called the idea "an act of violence" to the statue of the Rev. Francis P. Duffy, the World War I chaplain, that lends its name to the triangle.
"I don't think you can think about putting an advertisement for underwear next to Father Duffy," said Mr. Katz, the president of Sherwood Equities, a company that owns buildings around Times Square.
The city and its related agencies have allowed advertising on municipal property for years -- from the subways and buses to the bus shelters, which now generate about $4 million a year. But with a Republican Mayor who champions "privatization," the concept has extended to places that remained untapped.
"There's a different aura now," said Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the Sanitation Department, which hopes to lure advertisers to its litter baskets and eventually its fleet of 2,100 garbage trucks.
Even the City Council has joined in. It is considering legislation to permit ads on independent public pay phones, just like Nynex. And Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Queens Democrat, said the city should sell ads on parking meters, something that has been tried in Baltimore.
"Is there a point where you can have too much?" he said. "Yes, but we haven't reached that yet."
In the case of parks and schools in particular, the ads are intended to raise money that would otherwise have to be cut from services.
The Board of Education hopes to raise an estimated $5 million from ads on 2,000 of the yellow school buses -- something allowed for the first time as part of a new contract with private bus owners and drivers.
The board has cast a wide net to invite companies to place bids next month -- making it clear that only "soft advertising" would do. That means no guns, cigarettes, liquor or waifish, half-nude models. "Every dollar that we bring in," a board spokesman, John H. Beckman, said, "is a dollar that we can avoid cutting from a program to serve kids."
In another case, the city hopes the ads will pay for an amenity as scarce as advertising is abundant: public toilets.
As part of an effort to reduce clutter on sidewalks, the Mayor has proposed hiring one company to maintain all bus shelters and newsstands and build 30 new toilets in exchange for selling ads on the structures. The city's share of the take could total $8 million.
Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, who is overseeing the proposal, said the city would in all cases strike a balance between revenues and exploitation, involving the public and elected officials in the debate over what is or is not appropriate.
"There are people -- I think a minority -- who are opposed to any street advertising," she said. "There are those who want more of it. I think there is this great middle ground."
It remains to be seen how lucrative the proposals could be, and for now the Mayor's office has no hard estimate of how much the ads could raise altogether. Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society of New York, which came of age opposing the proliferation of billboards 90 years ago, said the "limited amount" that might be made would not be worth it if the ads eroded the city's quality of life.
"This visual assault, if it's not carefully handled, will erode the qualities that make the city special," he said.

HEADLINE: Tax Defeat Makes Orange County's Fate More Perilous

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Now that the voters of Orange County, Calif., have overwhelmingly said no to an emergency tax increase, it has become even trickier to resolve the severely pressed county's financial problems. And chances that the state of California might immediately step in to help appeared to be diminishing.
In a watershed vote on Tuesday, the electorate of the conservative Southern California area rejected, by a margin of more than 3 to 2, a proposed half-cent sales tax increase intended to lift the county out of bankruptcy. 
 The increase would have raised the combined state and county sales tax rate to 8.25 percent, from the current 7.75 percent. Without it, many in the municipal bond market contend, the financial situation in the county has gone from bad to worse, threatening to hurt the broader municipal bond market.
The tax was to have provided the county, which is short of cash, with $130 million in new revenue each year -- a key component in paying nearly $800 million in debts that come due in the next few months. Without the tax, it is unclear how the county will meet those debts, and yesterday, Standard & Poor's Credit Rating Service declared all that debt to be in default.
More important, perhaps, the vote was being viewed yesterday as a sign of a stubborn unwillingness on the part of this affluent area south of Los Angeles to honor its financial obligations after losing $1.7 billion last year in risky bond-market investments. The county filed for bankruptcy protection in December.
Paul Nussbaum, a Wells Fargo executive and assistant to the interim Orange County executive, William J. Popejoy, said that with the defeat of the sales-tax increase, debt holders might now receive less than full repayment.
"Obviously getting back 100 cents on the dollar is off the table," Mr. Nussbaum said. "This is turning more into a typical bankruptcy, where everyone develops a bunker mentality. After this vote, no one is going to remember Orange County just for Disneyland."
Many in the municipal bond market fear that Orange County's actions have begun to shake the market's foundations. Many California municipalities have already been forced to pay more to get investors to buy their debt, and there is concern that this pattern could spread in the $1.2 trillion municipal bond market. Munis have long been considered one of the safest forms of investments. Now, some worry that safety-oriented investors will shun the bonds, forcing states, counties, cities and special districts to offer higher interest rates to obtain essential financing.
In Sacramento, California's State Treasurer, Matthew Fong, said yesterday that it would be premature to begin considering state oversight of Orange County's finances, although demands for just that were increasing on Wall Street and among Orange County's debt holders.
One idea being discussed was the establishment of a fiscal control board similar to the Municipal Assistance Corporation of New York, which would issue new bonds to pay the county's debts and back them with new taxes.
A proposal from a California State Senator, Lucy Killea of San Diego, that had been passed by the Legislature would have replaced the Orange County Board of Supervisors with a powerful county executive and diverted some property-tax revenue to repay new debts. But Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed the bill, and though it is being prepared for reconsideration, hopes are fading that the Governor and the State Treasurer will embrace the new proposal.
"The critical mass for a state takeover is not there," Mr. Fong said. "Orange County has given the state a black eye, but it's not a knockout blow. Because of that, it is premature to talk of a state takeover."
Mr. Fong added that if current debt holders agreed to a proposed rollover plan and extended the maturity of their short-term debt by a year, the county would gain some breathing room to explore new options. One hope, he said, would be to collect from the county's broker, Merrill Lynch & Company, which it has sued over the investment losses. Or, he said, "whatever else the county supervisors can conjure up." Asked for possible details, Mr. Fong replied, "That's a good question and there's no obvious answer."
Merrill Lynch said yesterday that Orange County should not count on proceeds from any lawsuit as part of its recovery plan. "We are very confident of our legal position, and we do not think there is a basis for Merrill Lynch to pay for problems it did not create," Timothy Gillis, a spokesman for the brokerage firm, said.
Many municipal experts said that even if Orange County did collect money from Merrill, such protracted litigation could not provide the quick fix the county needed.
Without the sales tax, municipal-finance experts see Orange County's situation as dire. "They are fiddling while Rome is burning," remarked Joseph Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer. "This story goes from worse to worse to worse. California is displaying real political indecision from top to bottom, and it shows just how fragile the California markets are. Orange County is trading one of the real cornerstones of the municipal market -- the full faith and credit promise of general-obligation debt."
Jane Eddy, an analyst with Standard & Poor's, said the voters' rejection of the tax increase had created a "real disaster." She added, "The county has no other financial options, and even if the debt holders agree to roll over their debt, there is nothing to indicate that they will be paid a year from now." For that reason, Standard & Poor's declared the debt in default.
Moody's Investors Service, another rating service whose judgment is key to the sale of municipal bonds, called the county's action "outrageous and unprecedented." In a written statement, Moody's said, "Orange County has utterly failed to take responsibility for its own actions and their consequences."
Karen Krop, an assistant vice president at Moody's, said that given the well-known antitax views of Orange County residents, even a state takeover might not provide the answer. If some of the county's property taxes were diverted to pay its debts, she said, "you can imagine the kind of uproar that you would hear."
In the next two months, the county is obligated to repay $800 million in short-term notes, and holders of these notes expressed interest yesterday in state intervention in the hope that they would be paid in full.
Holders of $600 million in taxable notes, which the county has threatened to repudiate by challenging their legality, met in New York yesterday. A spokesman for that group termed the situation "very grave" and said the noteholders were disappointed by the sales tax rejection.
Bennett J. Murphy, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents Orange County bondholders, said the vote "puts it back at square one."
If the county fails to repay the creditors fully, he added, "it has to be prepared for a long serious drought" before ever borrowing again.
Robert Moore, a Chicago lawyer who heads the overall creditors' committee, called for a state oversight board. "If they are going to act, now is the time," Mr. Moore said. "We are facing great uncertainty."

HEADLINE: Agreement Is Reached On Allowing Casinos

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 28

 BODY:
State legislative leaders said today that they had reached agreement on a constitutional amendment that would allow casino gambling in designated parts of the state, including the Catskills and Niagara Falls but excluding New York City.
The leaders said they expect the resolution, the first step in a long process of removing the State Constitution's prohibition on casino gambling, to pass in both houses when it comes to a vote on Thursday. 
 "I predict it will pass because it's the common sense thing to do," said Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, the Senate majority leader. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said, "I am fairly confident it will pass in my House."
But though support from the legislative leaders usually guarantees passage of a bill, some proponents of the amendment expressed concerns about its fate in the Republican-controlled Senate, where Democratic votes will be needed for passage.
"We'll have a major floor fight and it's going to be a close vote," said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester Republican, a leading advocate of the resolution.
Late today, Senate Democratic officials said Mr. Bruno had not shown them the language in the bill, had not included them in negotiations and had made no effort to win their votes on the resolution, even though the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for the summer by Friday.
The agreement reached between Mr. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, and Mr. Silver would allow casinos in four places: the Catskills, the City of Niagara Falls, the City of Buffalo, and Warren and Saratoga Counties near Lake George.
The agreement calls for one casino in each place except for the three Catksill counties, Greene, Ulster and Sullivan, where a larger, as yet undetermined number of casinos would be authorized.
The resolution would also allow eight harness and thoroughbred horse-racing tracks around the state to have slot machines and video gambling. But Belmont and Aqueduct race tracks would be excluded.
The agreement does not allow casinos in New York City, despite some 11th-hour lobbying efforts by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to have the city included. Mr. Giuliani called the omission baffling today, adding that the Legislature was "making certain that New York City doesn't get its fair share of revenues."
Mr. Silver said he had problems with allowing casinos in New York City because the city would become "the casino capital of the state" and hurt the viability of casinos in areas like the Catskills. But he also said the Republican Mayor, with whom he has clashed repeatedly, did not call him for support and never offered a specific proposal.
To amend the State Constitution, two consecutively elected Legislatures must pass a resolution calling for a statewide referendum. That vote could not take place until 1997 at the earliest. Under the proposed amendment, a casino could not open until the county involved also held a referendum.
Federal law allows casinos on Indian reservations. In New York State, the Oneida Indians operate a casino near Syracuse, and the Mohawk Indians plan to open more near the Canadian border.
With the resolution's fate still in doubt, lobbyists on both sides of the issue buttonholed Legislators today, offering a tiny hint of the hugely expensive battle certain to ensue if the resolution passes.
On one side, lobbyists representing hotels, tourism businesses and race tracks warned lawmakers that tourism dollars are being siphoned away from New York State by surrounding states with casinos.
On the other side, religious groups including the New York State Catholic Conference, which represents the state's Roman Catholic bishops, circulated memos arguing that casinos will increase crime, drug use, prostitution and political corruption.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall warned that the economic growth promised by gambling proponents could be illusory, and he called for further study.
"If you see first passage now, there will be very little discussion about it until the same time next year," said Mr. McCall, a Democrat.
But Mr. Silver argued that first passage was needed now to encourage casino companies to consider New York as a place to invest. "We should do it so people don't commit their resources elsewhere," he said.
Gov. George E. Pataki also said today there was a strong likelihood the Legislature would approve the first increase in minimum liability rates for drivers since 1957. The Governor favors increasing the minimum coverage to $25,000 for bodily injury to one person, $50,000 for total injuries to more than one person and $10,000 for property damage. Current numbers $10,000, $20,000 and $5,000.
The insurance industry has opposed the bill, saying it would lead to higher auto insurance rates and increase the number of uninsured drivers. Trial lawyers, along with many consumer and auto safety groups, support the bill, saying it raises absurdly out-dated payments.
In other action, the Assembly, by 141-8, passed a bill tonight that would require convicted sex offenders to register with the state when released from prison.
The Senate has already passed the bill, and Mr. Pataki has promised to sign it into law.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Will Presidents miss a few economic aides? Some say yes.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHEN the President wants economic advice, he can always turn to his National Economic Council, the Office of Management and Budget or the Cabinet agencies. So why not jettison the Council of Economic Advisers, a 48-year-old symbol of an era when economists had the hubris to believe they could smooth the way to permanent prosperity?
Such reasoning, spiced with more than a dash of partisanship, apparently explains the House Republicans' inclination to deny funds for the council. But in the view of conservative as well as liberal economists, it represents myopia with a capital M. "It would be a pity to throw away a bargain," argues Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the council under President Ronald Reagan. 
 As Federal agencies go, the council, with a professional staff of 27 and a payroll of less than $4 million, barely rates an asterisk in the trillion-dollar-plus Federal budget. Still, it seemed a plausible enough target for Republicans determined to match cuts in Congressional staff with trims in executive branch operations.
The Clinton Administration attacked the Republican effort again yesterday as it named a new chairman to the council, Joseph E. Stiglitz, who replaces Laura D'Andrea Tyson. Still, Republicans on a House Appropriations subcommittee voted yesterday to eliminate the council.
If the Republicans succeed, the Republic will no doubt survive. For one thing, the once-primary role of the council in balancing the risks of recession and inflation has fallen to the keepers of the money supply at the Federal Reserve: The ability to use tax and spending policy to fine-tune economic growth has withered in an era of $200 billion-plus budget deficits. And in any event, the President would still be able to staff the White House with professional economists.
But Mr. Feldstein, now the head of the National Bureau of Economic Research, thinks much would be lost in downgrading the job. "The council has built a remarkable reputation," he said. "There's just no way you could recruit comparably qualified economists" without the nameplate on the office door.
Michael J. Boskin, the council chairman under President George Bush, acknowledges that the Cabinet agencies employ some fine economists. But council economists, largely recruited from academia, "bring a fresh look," he argues, "one free of institutional bias." You need outsiders, he suggests, to settle differences between, say, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department.
Then, too, even the most ambitious members of the council tend to be economists first and politicians second. For while partisanship sometimes colors their public pronouncements, most council members understand they will not be in government for long. "They are under pressure from the profession to retain their intellectual independence," says James Tobin, a member of the council in the Kennedy White House.
The benefits of this intellectual independence are not hard to find. In 1961 Mr. Tobin convinced a skeptical President John F. Kennedy of the virtues of tax incentives for business investment. In 1967 Arthur M. Okun tried to persuade President Lyndon B. Johnson to pay for the Vietnam War with a tax increase -- a policy shift that would likely have contained the inflationary fires to come. And in 1982, Mr. Feldstein fought the good fight against slashing taxes before taking on government spending.
By the same token, council economists, liberal and conservative, have manned the battlements against ill-justified interference with free markets. Council economists under President Reagan held back the tide of trade protectionism. In 1990 the council fought for market-based incentives to cut the cost of containing acid rain. In 1993, Ms. Tyson warned the White House of the striking similarities between the organization of the Clinton health care bureaucracy and the Bulgarian ministry of farm machinery and shoe polish.
A less appreciated benefit of the council has been to raise the quality of policy economics. A discipline that accords its highest honors to theorists or ideologues and disdains hands-on experience would have much less of value to say, for example, about ways to contain inflation or the pros and cons of deregulating the electric power industry. "Just compare American economists to their European counterparts," suggests Richard L. Schmalensee, a former council member who now teaches at M.I.T.
The council has been on the endangered species list before. After Mr. Feldstein went public with his critique of voodoo economics, the Reagan White House vowed to rid itself of apostates. But that wound was self-inflicted. Congress is now threatening to deprive future Presidents of easy access to top-rank economic analysis. And, in the words of Mr. Schmalensee, merely "to save the cost of the radio on one stealth bomber."

HEADLINE: Cravath Lawyer and Brother Are Guilty of Insider Trading

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
A former senior associate at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the blue-chip Wall Street law firm, and his brother, pleaded guilty yesterday to insider trading in a case that shows how even well-paid young lawyers can fall prey to the temptation to pass on confidential information.
With the recent upswing in big mergers and takeovers, there has been a steady increase in insider trading cases, some of them involving lawyers and investment bankers and their family members. But yesterday's guilty plea is the first such case to involve Cravath, a firm that represents many of the biggest American companies, and that has prided itself on its clean record. 
 The former Cravath senior associate, Richard W. Woodward, 34, was accused of passing along confidential information on a dozen prospective mergers and acquisitions to his brother, John T. Woodward, 36. The brothers each pleaded guilty to one count of insider trading in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The two also settled a complaint brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and agreed to pay back $110,000 of their profits.
According to Federal investigators, Richard Woodward, a resident of Middletown, N.J., joined Cravath in 1989 and worked as a skilled and valued lawyer on much of its most important merger and acquisition business. For several years, even as the law firm regarded him as a hard-working and successful employee, Mr. Woodward passed information on deals involving such important Cravath clients as CBS, ITT, Johnson & Johnson, King World Productions and S. G. Warburg from 1990 to 1995.
John Woodward, a 36-year-old electrical supply salesman from Little Silver, N.J., who is currently unemployed, used this information to trade in the securities markets, the United States Attorney's Office said. He made profits of about $578,000 by buying the securities of 12 companies that were either Cravath clients or possible merger partners for these clients. These purchases were made in advance of possible merger and acquisition announcements. Another unnamed friend of Richard Woodward's and other unnamed people that he "caused to trade" made profits of about $355,000.
The United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan and the S.E.C. declined to identify these people but said their investigations were continuing.
The indictment detailed a dozen cases involving insider trading by the Woodward brothers. A typical example was the proposed acquisition of Vista Chemical by the AMC subsidiary of a German Company, RWE-DEA A.G. In February 1990, AMC retained Cravath in connection with a tender offer it was considering for Vista Chemical. Richard Woodward was among the team of Cravath lawyers assigned to represent AMC and therefore obtained "confidential, material and nonpublic information concerning the transaction," the United States Attorney's Office said.
A few months later, Richard Woodward "disclosed the potential tender offer" to his brother, John, who around Nov. 30 bought about 2,000 Vista Chemical shares for about $25 a share. AMC announced its tender offer on Dec. 13, causing Vista Chemical's stock price to rise to $54 a share from $29 a share. John Woodward then sold his Vista Chemical stock for a profit of about $57,000.
The insider trading became apparent to regulators earlier this year, according to the S.E.C. and Cravath. The National Association of Securities Dealers was investigating unusual trading in the shares of a company that had been acquired in 1994 by a Cravath client. It first notified Cravath of its inquiry in January and later passed on a list of stockholders who had traded the stock before the announcement of the deal. The law firm said it noticed the name John T. Woodward and confronted Richard Woodward.
"We fired him the same day we called the S.E.C.," said Samuel C. Butler, presiding partner at Cravath. "It's a tragedy, on the one hand I feel terribly sorry for him, his wife and his children, but on the other hand, I feel outraged at this breach of trust."
In a statement, Cravath said that all clients mentioned in the indictment and S.E.C. complaint were notified as soon as the firm learned that transactions in which they were involved might be under investigation. The two brothers, who have cooperated with the Government, are scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 15 on the felony charge, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
The insider trading case illustrates how one employee can for several years, without detection, operate a systematic scheme to profit from inside information involving a dozen major companies. The current takeover boom means that there will almost certainly be more such cases as some professionals find themselves unable to resist the chance of quick and easy, but illegal, profits, either for themselves or for their friends and families.
"The general feeling is that we're seeing more insider trading investigations now than we've seen since the takeover boom of the 1980's," said Daniel A. Nathan, an assistant director in the S.E.C.'s enforcement division. "In terms of filed cases we're ahead of where we were a year ago," he added, saying that in the 12 months ended October 1994, the S.E.C. had filed about 45 such cases, compared with 30-plus in the year earlier.
At yesterday's hearing before Judge Lawrence M. McKenna, Richard Woodward "acknowledged that he had disclosed matters on which he'd worked to his brother," his lawyer, Mark R. Hellerer, said.
Richard Woodward recognized it was reckless of him to do so, and that it breached his duty to Cravath and to his clients. He said Cravath was not involved in any way and sincerely apologized."

HEADLINE: Space Linkup With $100 Billion Future

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 28

 BODY:
If the linkup of Americans and Russians in space two decades ago was the equivalent of a date, the one set for Thursday is the start of a $100 billion marriage, a delicate one that could easily be undone by technical setbacks or political shifts.
The space shuttle Atlantis is to dock with the Russian space station Mir about 9 A.M., hooking up a pressurized tunnel through which astronauts can float in shirt-sleeves. If successfully joined, the two craft will form a structure bigger and brighter than any other to probe the heavens in the 38 years since the space age began. 
 The joined spacecraft will have a record mass of about 200 tons and will hold a record 10 people -- 6 Americans and 4 Russians, 8 men and 2 women. The five-day linkup features biomedical research and a crew swap. More important, it foreshadows bigger things to come.
Over the next two years, the American winged spaceships and Mir are to dock seven times in preparation for building a 460-ton international space station larger than a football field. The orbital base is to house Americans, Russians, Japanese, Europeans and Canadians who will do science experiments, observe the heavens and the Earth and study their responses to weightlessness in the hopes of learning how humans might one day survive trips to Mars and beyond.
The linkup will not reveal the ultimate fate of the East-West marriage and its offspring. But experts say it will test the relationship technically because of the docking's complexity and politically because of growing tensions between Washington and Moscow.
"We're embarking on a very challenging technical and political feat," Daniel S. Goldin, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in an interview. "To deny both issues is to deny reality."
Before liftoff on Tuesday, Captain Robert L. Gibson of the Navy, the shuttle commander, said the docking was "the biggest challenge we're facing," adding that the mission was "very ambitious." That is astronaut talk for perilous.
In space, the laws of mass and momentum, unfettered by such earthly influences as weight and friction, are unforgiving and ready to punish a false step by sending spacecraft crashing into one another other, endangering astronauts. Whether in orbit or deep space, objects set in motion tend to stay that way, never slowing down except when encountering an opposing force or another object.
With such perils in mind, American and Russian officials have framed the docking as an exceptionally slow ballet, with the final closing rate between the partners set at about one inch per second. Astronauts in simulators have practiced missteps and recoveries endlessly to give them as much experience as possible in sidestepping disaster.
"We've tried to predict everything," Viktor Legostaev, a top Russian designer for the mission, said in an interview. "But who knows? Maybe we will have problems."
The Russians are nervous because in 1975 the second of two dockings between the relatively puny Apollo and Soyuz capsules was accompanied by a jarring bump, undisclosed at the time. At Apollo's controls was Donald K. Slayton, flying slightly fast and off center.
"The force was twice what we predicted," Mr. Legostaev said. "There was no damage. But we thought about things breaking, because of the torques and forces."
The Apollo capsule carried three Americans and had a mass of about 20 tons, while the Soyuz carried two Russians and had a mass of about 7 tons -- paltry sums by today's standards. The Atlantis carries seven astronauts and has a mass of about 100 tons while the Mir has three astronauts and has about the same mass.
After docking for two days, the Apollo and Soyuz separated with their respective crew members. The docking had been arranged by the Nixon Administration during a temporary thaw in the cold war. It was a one-time spectacular, after which good feelings quickly dissipated.
In contrast, the docking of Atlantis and Mir is to be the start of a virtual merger of the manned space programs of East and West, involving thousands of ground personnel, hundreds of projects, dozens of astronauts and a flurry of dockings.
After the current mission, the American winged spaceships and Mir are to link up once more this year, three times in 1996 and twice in 1997, mainly as warmups for the international space station.
Assembly flights for the big space outpost are to begin in late 1997 and end in 2002, after which it is to operate for a decade or more. As envisioned, the station will have seven laboratories, house six astronauts and be 361 feet wide and 290 feet long.
A foreign-policy pillar of the Clinton Administration, the international station is meant to symbolize a new era of East-West accord and to engage Moscow in constructive space work in return for ending practices that upset Washington, like exporting advanced rocket gear to developing countries.
The deal includes financial aid to Moscow in the form of a $400 million contract for space hardware and launching services, which is seen by Washington as a way to help prop up Moscow's space program as the nation moves toward a more open society and economy.
NASA says the space station will cost American taxpayers $43 billion, with contributions from foreign users pushing the total cost as high as $60 billion. But some Congressional estimates put the figure at $100 billion. Those figures do not include the more than 70 launchings of gear and people needed for its assembly, outfitting and utilization.
Congressional investigators at the General Accounting Office recently estimated that the American part of the international station, with the inclusion of $50.5 billion in shuttle transportation costs, would total $93.9 billion. NASA disagreed with that total, saying the shuttle would fly even if the international station were canceled.
Also not included in the total is the expense of the shuttle-Mir linkups, which NASA says are relatively minor. For instance, the docking system of Atlantis cost $95 million. NASA says shuttle flights cost $400 million apiece. Independent experts say they often cost twice that amount.
The linkups and the space station currently enjoy bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. But private analysts say the venture might suffer amid growing Federal budget battles and the ambivalence among members of Congress about aiding Russia.
"It's not too hard to see how the mood could change with unexpected suddenness," said John E. Pike, head of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington that backs the East-West endeavor.
Some scientists oppose the station, saying it threatens to gobble up a growing share of the shrinking Federal science budget, eroding the nation's ability to meet future challenges in fields ranging from communications to medical research.
But other experts say the space station and the Shuttle-Mir linkups are important not only for space exploration but as an investment in global peace, helping Russia become a responsible member of the global community.
"We're always going to have differences with them, just like we do with Japan," said Thomas P. Stafford, the American astronaut who led the Apollo-Soyuz linkup 20 years ago, and whose own docking, the first, went smoothly.
"But in the long run," he added, "for stability in the world, we're going to work with Russia and we're going to have good relations with them."


GRAPHIC: The docking of the American space shuttle Atlantis with the Russian Mir Space station is the first of seven such missions that are to pave the way for assembling a multinational space station. It is a larger and much more complicated job than the Soyuz-Apollo linup achieved two decades ago (shown to scale below).
Diagram: "A CLOSER LOOK: A Complex Linkup In Space"
 The Mir and the shuttle each weigh about 100 tons. The new project involves maneuvering the shuttle very showly, at some points about an inch a second, to line up its docking mechanism with that the the Mir. Then, two inches away, the shuttle fires its jets to complete the linkup. Each docking assembly has three "petals" that interleave like a flower to form the link. Twelve sets of hooks and latches on the shuttle mechanism grip a similar assembly on the Mir. The entire docking and latching process is expected to take about an hour, beginning at 9 A.M., Eastern standard time. (Sources: NASA; Rockwell International)

HEADLINE: A DEAL ON AUTO TRADE: THE JAPANESE;
Number of Parts to Be Bought Is Unclear

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, June 29

 BODY:
While President Clinton praised the auto trade agreement for pushing Japan's automobile industry to buy more American-made parts, there are no concrete goals for how much in American or foreign parts the Japanese companies will actually buy.
Securing such goals had been a main Washington objective, and there seems to be a big discrepancy between what American officials said the new trade agreement will do and what the Japanese company plans actually say. 
 President Clinton said Wednesday that the agreement will lead to an increase in purchases of American parts of almost $9 billion, or 50 percent, in three years.
But that is a United States Government estimate of what the agreement will accomplish. The Japanese Government said it had no involvement with such figures and did not agree to any targets.
"We didn't cave in," said a jubilant Japanese trade official.
Instead of setting goals for parts purchases, the Japanese companies promised to take such steps as working more closely with potential foreign suppliers or publishing guidebooks describing their procurement procedures.
The Honda Motor Company, for instance, promised to "further increase local procurement though a focused effort to purchase more parts for American-made engines and transmissions," including shafts, gears, sensors and other parts it specifies. The Nissan Motor Company said it would set up an in-house "imports promotion committee" to increase imports of parts.
Such procedural steps agreed to in past trade agreements have not always led to increased sales of American products in Japan. That is the main reason the Clinton Administration had insisted the automobile trade agreement would have to be "results oriented."
Setting such goals also seems to work. The Japanese companies have largely achieved a goal set in 1992 to double purchases of American parts to $19 billion by the fiscal year that ended in March.
Much of the effort announced in the plans seems to be aimed at increasing procurement of parts for use in the companies' overseas factories. There is not as much language devoted to increasing imports of foreign parts into Japan. In that sense, the agreement might not go far toward achieving one of Washington's major goals -- breaking up the keiretsu system, in which the auto manufacturers buy mainly from their long-term Japanese suppliers.
Still, the fact that the Japanese companies did not announce specific targets does not necessarily mean they will not significantly increase their purchases of American parts. Because of the yen's rise, it makes economic sense for them to purchase more foreign parts. And the new trade agreement might be the excuse they need to switch from their Japanese keiretsu suppliers.
Regarding the issue of increasing the number of Japanese car dealers that sell American vehicles, the manufacturers generally said they would reiterate to their dealers that they were free to carry other brands and would set up mechanisms for handling grievances from manufacturers that feel they are being denied access to dealers.
Regarding sales of replacement parts, Honda said it would set up a new division to procure such parts from abroad and sell them through its dealers. Toyota said it would study setting up a new company to do the same thing.
All the plans announced last night talk about expansion of production and procurement in Europe and Asia as well as North America. This is in part because European and Asian nations have expressed alarm that an agreement between the United States and Japan would favor American suppliers at the expense of European or Asian companies.
The one area in which the Japanese companies often mentioned specific numbers was for increased production of cars or engines in the United States. The United States calculated the five companies would increase their automobile output in the United States from 2.1 million to 2.65 million cars by 1998. The companies also planned to increase their exports of American-made cars to Japan and elsewhere.
But many of the plans for increased American production had already been announced or were being contemplated because the rise of the Japanese yen has forced the Japanese companies to shift manufacturing away from their own country.
The plan announced by Honda, for instance, contains nothing new, a spokesman, Yo Harada, said, explaining that the document mainly repeats commitments to increase North American production, announced last July. The Toyota Motor Corporation, however, promised a new increase in North American production.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Last-Minute Deal With Japan Increases the Dollar's Value

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The 11th-hour agreement between the United States and Japan on trade in autos and auto parts was greeted with enthusiasm on world currency markets yesterday, as dealers bought dollars and sold yen, relieved that a damaging -- and possibly widespread -- trade war had been averted.
"A cloud has been lifted," said Richard E. Witten, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "Nobody likes trade wars." 
 The possibility of a full-scale trade conflict has been one reason for the dollar's weakness against the yen this year, so when word that a settlement had been reached flashed across traders' computer screens yesterday, it was not surprising to see the dollar increase in value.
Late in New York, the dollar rose to 85.52 Japanese yen from 84.29 yen on Tuesday. It also rose to 1.3968 German marks from 1.3870.
It will be some time before the agreement leads to a narrowing in the American trade deficit with Japan, and indeed the terms and effect of the deal seemed in question late yesterday. Still, analysts said that an end to the sniping that has gone on between Washington and Tokyo over auto trade was likely to allow currency traders to focus on other issues -- ones that favored a rise in the dollar's value.
"To the degree that trade frictions between the two countries have been relieved, the political motivation for an ever-rising yen and an ever-falling dollar has been relieved," said Neal M. Soss of Soss & Cotton Enterprises, a New York economic consultant. "And if you add the notion that the dollar is grossly undervalued against both the yen and the mark, then you could see further dollar appreciation."
Scott E. Pardee, vice chairman of Yamaichi Securities International, said that even though trade disputes involving Eastman Kodak and Federal Express remained unresolved, the nature of those quarrels with the Japanese, and the manner in which they were ultimately resolved, was not likely to concern currency markets. Compared with autos, the amounts of money involved were much smaller, he said.
More than half the $66 billion deficit the United States ran with Japan last year was in autos and related products.
Now, currency traders "will be looking more closely at economic fundamentals," he said. At the moment, those fundamentals include an extremely wide difference between short-term interest rates in Japan and those in the United States, as well as continued weakness in the Japanese economy.
"The only reason to hold yen with interest rates in Japan at 1 percent instead of investing the money in 6 percent short-term U.S. rates is you think the yen is going to appreciate," Mr. Soss said. "That could turn into an argument for a weaker currency."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Rise After Trade Accord Spurs Dollar

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities bounced higher yesterday, erasing early losses after a breakthrough in trade negotiations with the Japanese buoyed the dollar.
Before that, prices were down as the market geared up for a five-year note auction after a mediocre two-year auction on Tuesday. 
 The market has had many concerns these days, among them the United States-Japanese trade negotiations, which went to the wire. Other concerns have been the supply of new debt issues coming to the market and whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee less than a week away.
The 30-year bond rose 17/32 , to a price of 11418/32 for a yield of 6.52 percent, down from 6.54 percent on Tuesday.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco, said the successful trade negotiation and subsequent surge in the dollar were key factors in the market's about-face. "But even after rebounding on trade-agreement news, trading was still somewhat cautious going into the five-year note," he said.
The auction of five-year notes turned out to be a well-sold affair, even with retail interest from small investors somewhat subdued. Traders said the $11.5 billion of five-year notes were priced for a high yield of 5.90 percent, the lowest in almost a year and a half, when it was 5.61 percent on Feb. 24, 1994. Last month the yield was 6.25 percent.
Analysts say yields are moving lower amid expectations that the Fed will lower rates to help bolster the economy.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, believes the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, will move to cut interest rates next week.
"Chairman Greenspan desperately wants to achieve a soft landing and prevent the economy from skidding into a recession," Mr. Sohn said. "The Federal funds rate will be cut by half a point. The prime rate and other loan rates should follow."
Then there is the political factor, Mr. Sohn said. "In a democratic society, Mr. Greenspan cannot ignore political reality," Mr. Sohn said. "The White House wants to lower interest rates; President Clinton doesn't want to go back home to Arkansas in 1997."
Mr. Sohn said Congress was likely to cut about $50 billion from 1996 spending. "There has always been an unwritten quid pro quo between Congress and the Federal Reserve Board," he said. "Interest rates will be cut if Congress trims spending."
Even with the market holding its gains and feeling good mainly because of the dollar, Mr. Hale said trading was likely to be cautious heading into a holiday weekend and ahead of the Fed meeting next week, as well as the employment report next Friday.
"I am 99 percent sure the Fed will go with the rate cut at the meeting and not wait for the employment number," Mr. Hale said. There is no consensus on how much the cut will be, he said, but it could be 25 or 50 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Mr. Sohn said there was a risk for stocks and bonds. "If interest rates are not cut either in July or August, both markets will be disappointed," he said. "Interest rates would rise, hurting bonds. Projections for corporate earnings would be scaled back, damaging stocks."
Analysts said import-export prices for May, released yesterday, put pressure in early trading, as import prices rose 1 percent and exports three-tenths of a percent, both causing inflation flags to flutter.
Municipal bonds were steady yesterday with some investors reluctant to buy tax-exempt securities after voters in Orange County, Calif., voted down a tax increase to prevent default on its debt.
Traders said investors were concerned that other municipalities might decide to walk away from their debt through bankruptcy filings. The average yield to maturity for the Bond Buyer's index of 40 municipal issues rose a basis point, to 6.17 percent.
Some California borrowers paid the price for that concern yesterday. Alameda County, Calif., sold $85 million in one-year notes at prices to yield 6.40 percent, 30 basis points more than same-maturity Philadelphia notes and 25 basis points more than Colorado paper, both rated lower.
In the corporate debt market, corporations have sold 61 percent more bonds in the second quarter, as the sharp drop in interest rates cheapened the cost of borrowing in the financial markets.
The Standard & Poor's Ratings Group said companies issued $68.9 billion in bonds in the three-month period, up from the first quarter's $42.8 billion.
Industrial companies led the surge in new bonds, nearly doubling their sales in the period to $20.4 billion.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 5.905%
Low Yield . . . 5.850%

HEADLINE: Serial Bomber Threatens Blast, Then Calls the Scheme a Prank

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
The self-described anarchist whose mail bombs have terrorized executives and researchers for 17 years has threatened to blow up an airliner flying out of Los Angeles International Airport within six days.
The threat, made in a letter received on Tuesday by The San Francisco Chronicle, set Federal authorities scrambling to tighten security at California airports today, delaying flights and disrupting mail delivery. 
 But in a suspicious piece of mail sent to The New York Times, the suspect said the whole thing was a hoax. That piece of mail was received by The Times today at its New York office and turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which opened it and authenticated it late tonight.
"Since the public has a short memory, we decided to play one last prank to remind them who we are," the letter said. "But, no, we haven't tried to plant a bomb on an airline (recently)."
Nonetheless, the F.B.I. indicated it would continue to take the threat seriously.
The bomber's boast that the threat to the Los Angeles airport had been merely a prank came after a day that saw considerable dislocation at West Coast airports.
Passengers were evacuated from an already-landed United Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, after crew members found a transistor radio in the rear of the Boeing 747 jet and suspected it might contain a bomb. It turned out to be simply a radio.
A United Airlines jet with 105 passengers and 5 crew members en route from Portland, Ore., to San Francisco returned to Portland International Airport this evening after a bomb threat. It proved to be unfounded, the authorities said.
In his letter to The Chronicle, the person claiming to be the bomber, wrote: "WARNING. The terrorist group FC, called unabomber by the F.B.I., is planning to blow up an airliner out of Los Angeles International Airport some time during the next six days."
In a letter mailed in April to The New York Times, a person claiming to be the bomber asserted that FC was an anarchist group conducting terrorist actions "to promote social instability in industrial society." The writer said he wanted to tell his story and was working on an article of 29,000 to 37,000 words "that we want to have published." The newspaper said it would determine what action to take when and if such a manuscript was made available to The Times.
The bomber in the case -- code named Unabom by the F.B.I. because the initial targets were universities and airlines -- has mailed 16 bombs that have caused 3 deaths and 22 injuries since 1978.
One bomb caused a fire in an airliner's baggage compartment, and that incident may have been the subject of the oblique reference in the latest letter to another airline bombing.
But the threat received on Tuesday broke a pattern: none of the previous bombs were preceded by a warning.
The F.B.I. was "very sure" that the letter to The Chronicle was genuine, said Jim R. Freeman, the special agent in charge of the bureau's San Francisco office and the head of the task force investigating the Unabom case.
The Federal Aviation Administration, the Los Angeles police, the F.B.I. and other law-enforcement agents set up operations today at Los Angeles International Airport, which is the world's fifth busiest, handling nearly one million passengers a week.
In the letter that was part of the packet received by The Times today, the writer said: "In one case we attmpted unsuccessfully to blow up an airliner. The idea was to kill a lot of business people who we assumed would constitute the majority of the passengers."
The letter went on: "But of course some of the passengers likely would have been innocent people -- maybe kids, or some working stiff going to see his sick grandmother. We're glad now that that attempt failed."
In 1979, the bomber placed an explosive designed to go off at high altitude in a mailbag aboard an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Washington. It caught fire without exploding; 12 passengers suffered smoke inhalation.
In a passage discussing the morality of past acts, the letter said, "We don't think it is necessary for us to do any public soul-searching in this letter. But we will say that we are not insensitive to the pain caused by our bombings.
"A bomb package that we mailed to computer scientist Patrick Fischer injured his secretary when she opened it. We certainly regret that. And when we were young and comparatively reckless we were much more careless in selecting targets that than we are now."
Today's threat temporarily stopped mail deliveries throughout much of California. All air mail in Northern California was halted, said Horace Hinshaw, a spokesman for the United States Postal Service in San Francisco. Although the authorities resumed air delivery of most letters, 40 additional postal inspectors were assigned to sort through packages, said a senior postal service inspector in San Francisco, Dennis Hagberg. The postal service routinely ships mail on commercial and cargo airlines, as do private delivery services.
The F.B.I. knows little for certain about the suspect, though it believes he lives not far from the state capital, Sacramento. That suspicion led today to the suspension of mail headed from Northern California to the Los Angeles area.
The little that is known about him is what can be gleaned from his letters to newspapers and from his choice of targets, which in recent years have included scientists, industrialists and lobbyists and have evinced a fascination with wood and wood products.
The letter received by The Chronicle bore the return address of Fredrick Benjamin Isaac Wood, 549 Wood Street, Woodlake, Calif. While the town of Woodlake exists, there is no Wood Street there, and apparently no resident by that name, the police said. The bomber's letters rage against technology and science. After gravely wounding David Gelernter, a well-known professor of computer science, with one of his bombs in 1993, the bomber wrote him a taunting letter, saying: "People with advanced degrees aren't as smart as they think they are. If you'd had any brains you would have realized that there are a lot of people out there who resent bitterly the way techno-nerds like you are changing the world."
The letter went on to blame computers for a litany of woes, including invasion of privacy, genetic engineering and "environmental degradation through excessive economic growth."
In the lengthy letter received by The Times two months ago, an agenda was set forth for "the destruction of the worldwide industrial system." Investigators who studied the letter say that while the bomber claims to represent a terrorist group, they believe that his bombs are the work of a loner.

Biotechnology Gets a Boost

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A bill intended to stimulate the development and expansion of biotechnology and other high-tech industries in New Jersey was signed into law yesterday. The bill authorizes the State Economic Development Authority to establish a financial assistance program for new and growing companies that are often considered too high-risk to meet the agency's criteria for loans, said State Senator Robert W. Singer, a Republican of Ocean County and one of the bill's sponsors. "This is a response to where we felt we were going as a state as to future jobs," Senator Singer said.

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup: Congress and White House Make Last Effort to Compromise on '95 Budget;
New Economic Adviser

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR., By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 28

 BODY:
The Clinton administration chose a new head of its Council of Economic Advisers today, even as House Republicans moved forward in an Appropriations subcommittee to eliminate the panel's financing.
The subcommittee restored some money the Republicans had sought to remove from the National Security Council, leaving that agency with only slightly less financing than President Clinton had requested in his budget in February. The votes were along strict party lines and left some Democrats unhappy at what they said were incursions into Presidential prerogatives. 
 Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said eliminating the agency, which was established in the Employment Act of 1946, would be shortsighted and would increase the chances of Mr. Clinton and future Presidents slipping into costly policy errors.
He called the vote on the council unacceptable, seeming to imply a possible veto by the President.
Mr. Clinton's choice for chairman of the economic council, announced at the White House today by Mr. Panetta, was Joseph E. Stiglitz, now one of the council's three members. Dr. Stiglitz, 52, who became an economics professor at Yale University at the age of 26, has been a chief architect of the Administration's "reinventing government" efforts, including its proposals for changes in telecommunications, banking and environmental regulations, and for restructuring the system of air traffic control.
The Administration also said today that it would nominate Alicia H. Munnell, an Assistant Treasury Secretary, to fill a vacancy on the economic council. Ms. Munnell, 52, had been mentioned in news reports several weeks ago as a possible replacement for John P. LaWare, who has retired, on the Federal Reserve Board. At that time, 10 Republican senators wrote a letter to the President, which seemed to argue against her selection.
Ms. Munnell has aroused strong opposition in the banking industry because of a study she conducted on mortgage lending while senior vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The study concluded that banks were engaging in racial discrimination when making mortgage loans.
Others have complained about interest Ms. Munnell has expressed in taxing pension funds. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

HEADLINE: Rally Falters In Tokyo Stocks

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, June 29

 BODY:
Japanese stocks surged early today on optimism over the auto trade accord between the United States and Japan before retreating to close lower.
The dollar fell slightly here. At the end of the day it stood at 85.31 yen, down from 85.52 yen in trading Wednesday in New York. 
After rising as high as 14,904, the Nikkei index of 225 issues ended at 14,507.17, down 110.90 points, or 0.76 percent. Traders said concerns about the Japanese economy drove stocks lower.
"The basic problem was not the trade talks," said Shigeru Akiba, director of yen equity trading at UBS Securities. "Structural problems still exist, and there needs to be drastic measures to sort them out."
Stocks of auto makers and electronics companies did show gains.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasuries Tumble On Signs of Economic Heat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices tumbled yesterday after a report showing unexpected strength in the housing market dashed many traders' hopes of a cut in short-term interest rates next week.
A string of reports in recent months have portrayed an economy slowing sharply, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve would be compelled to cut rates to avert a recession, despite some public reservations by its chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
 But a report showing a surge in new-home sales in May, and a separate report showing a drop in weekly unemployment claims, indicated yesterday that the economy might not be as weak as previously thought.
New-home sales figures are seen as forward-looking because of the impact of the housing market on makers of appliances and other home furnishings. The data are also considered volatile and rarely command great influence on the finance markets. Yesterday's report, however, received greater attention than usual because it was the last significant Government report before the Fed's interest-rate policy makers meet on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 127/32 , to 112 24/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.64 percent, from 6.51 percent on Wednesday. The rise in the yield, a benchmark for many consumer loans, was the sharpest since an increase of 15 basis points on June 9, to 6.72 percent, according to CS First Boston. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The selloff on June 9 was prompted by speculation, later discredited, that Japan was urging investors to sell off their American holdings in retaliation for the threat of United States trade sanctions.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of new homes rose 19.9 percent in May, the biggest increase in nearly three and a half years. Sales came to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 722,000 units, much higher than economists' estimates of 593,000 units. And the April figure was revised upward to 602,000, from 580,000.
The report was the second piece of evidence this week that lower mortgage rates were causing stronger activity in the housing sector, which is one of the chief engines of economic growth. On Monday, the National Association of Realtors, a trade group, said sales of existing homes gained 4.7 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.55 million.
The Labor Department's weekly report on new applications for jobless benefits also pointed to strength in the economy. The department said first-time applications fell to 368,000 in the week ended last Saturday from 396,000 in the previous week.
After yesterday's data, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates next week, said Eric Hamilton, a senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston. "They have done an extremely good job controlling inflationary pressures, and they're not about to let their guard down now," he said.
Still, other analysts said the market had overreacted to the data, ignoring signs of strength in earlier economic reports.
"The market over the last five trading days was being set up for exactly this kind of short-term disappointment," said Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director of ASB Capital Management, a Washington company that manages about $6 billion in bonds. "For example," he said, "durable goods orders were up 2.5 percent for May, and we also find out that machine tool orders in May jumped 5.1 percent. We saw a 4.7 percent surge in existing-home sales on Monday, which was followed by today's 19.9 percent jump in new-home sales. And we gleaned from the Fed's beige book several weeks ago that the economy didn't appear to be as soft as previously believed.
"The bottom line is that prior to the release of these numbers today, the bond market was a nervous bloodhound, whose wide-stretched and splayed nostrils were heavily laden with the thick scent of recession."

HEADLINE: Buenos Aires Journal;
A Rustle of Silk, and Argentina's Secret Is Out

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
Calextina Alfaro came to Buenos Aires from a slum in La Paz, Bolivia, a year ago, drawn by an odd piece of market intelligence: Argentine women were crazy for underwear.
Mrs. Alfaro was not ill advised, she recalled on a recent afternoon, as well-heeled Argentine women hovered over her sidewalk display of frilly pinks and brilliant whites, neatly arrayed on a blue blanket in the fashionable Recoleta district. 
 "Do you have the panties to go with this bra?" asked one stylish shopper, plucking an item from Mrs. Alfaro's blanket-top boutique. "Oh, what a shame. Will you be here tomorrow?"
Why would an underwear merchant be anywhere else? According to officials of the local textile industry, Argentine women spend two to three times as much on underwear as their counterparts worldwide. An average middle-class Argentine woman spends about $400 a year on underwear, or the equivalent of one month's salary for a typical worker here.
And as if the conventional demand were not enough, chic Argentina has taken up underwear as outerwear. Embracing as their own a trend that had a brief life in the discos of Europe and America, many young women here wear silky nightgowns to nightclubs and parties, and some wear elegant bras and body suits as outer clothing when going out on the town.
Practically everywhere one looks in Buenos Aires, in magazines and store windows, on billboards and television, there are advertisements for undergarments.
Merchandisers calculate that in Buenos Aires alone there are more than 2,000 shops and boutiques that specialize in women's underwear and lingerie. As a comparison, there are 1,460 grocery stores in the city. And that does not begin to count the street vendors like Mrs. Alfaro who have now begun to spread their blankets in this market niche.
With the rise in unemployment and illegal immigration from neighboring countries, there has been a blossoming of curbside commerce in Buenos Aires, as peddlers hawk everything from toilet paper and toy guns to roasted peanuts and electric plugs. City officials could not estimate the exact number of street vendors but said they believe the number has risen steeply in recent years. The peddlers set up shop in front of popular stores, and shop owners often call the police to chase them away.
It was only natural that a business estimated at $500 million a year would not be forever contained in discreet boutiques and upscale shops, but as the business has spilled onto the sidewalks, proprietors of upscale shops howl about unfair competition, and some women say a matter of sexual mystique is being degraded into a cheap commercial venture.
Although Argentine women have a reputation for being finicky and buying only the best, they are patronizing street underwear vendors like Mrs. Alfaro in great numbers, but guiltily.
"Lots of Argentine women, who would never have dreamed of it before, buy them, making sure nobody is looking," said Maria-Sol Rocababo, a 26-year-old student, who says she buys underwear on the street because she finds the $5 sidewalk bras and panties as good as garments that sell for several times that amount in the shops. "I've seen them sneaking around with a look of shame."
"The word is spreading around that this stuff is good quality," she said. "And, after all, your husband isn't going to know you bought them from a Bolivian, is he?"
Some women said they would never buy underwear on the street, no matter how hard times are, expressing a bias against the foreign products.
"I would never trust the stuff those Bolivians sell," said Flavia Forrester, 32, who heads a language institute.
"I can't try it on and I don't know how it would look," added Margarita Michel, 49, a translator. "Times are hard, yes, but I would never compromise this personal pleasure of mine. I like beautiful underwear."
Mario Beteo, who owns Boutique Marianne, said shopkeepers resent competition from merchants who have no overhead, no electric bills, no rent. "We abide by the law, yet they steal our business," he fumed.
Ricardo Chillida, executive vice president for Vivarasa S.A., which has a license to manufacture several popular foreign brands here, said the underwear being sold on the street was made using cheap labor in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela and smuggled into Argentina by a highly organized "underwear Mafia."
What, if anything, does this fascination say about the women of Argentina? Speculation on that question is as popular as silken briefs.
"The pursuit of sophisticated underwear is related to the fact that we Argentines are basically very insecure women," mused Maria Teresa Ferrari, a fashion writer for the women's magazine Para Ti, who postulates that this "machista" striving is the logical female adaptation to a macho society. "We will go to any extreme to seduce the male, keep him happy and not lose him."
Giselle Jorman, who owns an upscale shop called Marigold, elaborated on the theme of sexual competition, noting that Argentine women use their underwear not only to seduce men but also to intimidate other women. "In the locker room, at the paddle-tennis court, these are times when women often use underwear to compete against other women."

HEADLINE: A DEAL ON AUTO TRADE: THE MARKET;
But Is Japan Indeed Protectionist?

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 29

 BODY:
When Americans export tulips to Japan, the fragile bulbs are individually inspected for germs and then shipped to a quiet field, where they are grown under the scrutiny of Japanese regulators for a full year before they can be sold on the market.
When Americans want to export pharmaceuticals, even simple products like Tylenol, they must first present years of experimental data to Japanese authorities for approval. And since the regulators say that Japanese may react differently from Americans, the data must be from Japanese clinical subjects. 
 Is this a loving and protective Government? Or just a protective one?
While the United States and Japan have reached a settlement in the auto trade dispute, economists are still fiercely debating how protectionist Japan is.
In the finger-pointing over the last month between Tokyo and Washington, many Americans have the impression that Japan is virtually closed to American goods. But experts say that view is far too simple. While Japan is an extremely difficult market to break into -- for Japanese companies as well as American ones -- the barriers tend to be fuzzy and uncertain, and thus to invite debate.
The obstacles to importing tulips and drugs are striking, but in most cases there is room for dispute.
Economists note that on the surface Japan has a very open market. "The formal economic evidence that Japan is more protectionist than other countries is inconclusive," said William R. Cline of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "Everybody agrees that at least in manufactured goods, the classic definition of protectionism -- which is Government restrictions -- would not show Japan as highly protectionist because tariffs are low and quotas are negligible."
Over the last decade, the Japanese have dismantled or lowered many of their economic barriers, so that the average tariff rate is 3.3 percent, compared with 3.2 percent in the United States and 3.7 percent in the European Union. And Japan imposes quotas on 66 categories of imports, compared with hundreds, perhaps thousands, in the United States -- so many that neither the Customs Service nor the Commerce Department could provide statistics.
Imports rose by only one-fifth over the last five years, compared with a 30 percent rise in exports in the same period, but Americans have nonetheless been making inroads in this country. McDonald's is the most popular and prevalent fast-food chain in Japan, and many young Japanese listen to Michael Jackson or Madonna.
Even so, the Japanese market continues to elude many American companies, and some argue that while in formal terms, Japan's market may be open, in practice it is not. It does not matter to a tulip merchant, for example, whether there is a low duty on tulips if he has to bear the cost of planting in Japan for a year.
There is a lingering effect from a history of mercantilist protectionism, and Japan has a sticky web of bureaucracy and volumes of regulations. Some argue that deep cultural traditions shape all aspects of society from the way Japan organizes its economy to the way it runs its businesses and crafts its corporate goals, and that these customs, often nebulous, lock out foreigners.
Because the barriers can be fuzzy, economists sometimes look at market-share statistics to show that something is wrong. For example, imports account for only 3.2 percent of Japan's overall economy, compared with 8 percent for the United States, according to Edward J. Lincoln, an economist working for the United States Embassy in Tokyo.
"Japan is an advanced industrial society with high income levels," Mr. Lincoln said. "But it appears to behave in ways reminiscent of a small developing country, and this irritates people."
The problem with using market-share statistics is that while they raise suspicions, they do not necessarily prove protectionism.
Most European countries have a far higher percentage of imports than the United States, but this does not show that Europe is more open than America. Likewise, Americans have a reputation of being uninterested in foreign movies and foreign books, but the low market share of foreign films does not mean that Washington protects Hollywood.
A prime focus of American frustration is the clubby business world of keiretsu, tightly knit alliances that tie Japanese manufacturers to suppliers and distributors, or to other companies in different markets. American officials say these alliances engage in collusive behavior; Japanese prefer to call it collectivism or cooperation.
Japanese companies seem to place less emphasis on cost than American companies do, and more emphasis on relationships. They like to have longstanding contacts with suppliers, and to be absolutely sure that the suppliers are dependable. This naturally makes it hard for anyone to break in.
"If we say that keiretsus are part of the problems, then we have to probe more systematically than we do," said Jagdish Bhagwati, a trade economist at Columbia University. "They buy from their group-related suppliers and I.B.M. makes its own chips inside so nobody can sell to I.B.M. anyway. G.M. uses suppliers to make parts in house, and if you rent at Hertz, it's owned by Ford. So the fleet has been changed to Tauruses and it's hard to get Japanese cars."
Many economists say the Japanese business system does not so much discriminate against foreigners as against outsiders, whether Japanese or foreign. A keiretsu would not buy a new Japanese product any more than it would buy an American one.
Likewise, those American companies that have established themselves as insiders in Japan seem quite content with a clubby business structure that now works to their advantage.
Perhaps, then, protectionism is in the eye of the beholder. "Japan is not as open as they say they are," an American official in Tokyo said. "And it's not as closed as we say they are."

HEADLINE: Move to Allow Casinos Wins Senate Vote

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 29

 BODY:
The State Legislature passed a resolution today that began the long, costly and contentious process of trying to bring casino gambling to New York.
The approval was a stunning reversal of fortune for casino supporters, since a proposed constitutional amendment to allow casinos appeared all but dead in the Republican-controlled Senate just hours before. 
 But in a show of the raw political power that Albany's legislative leaders can wield, the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, resuscitated the amendment late in the day by cajoling about a dozen Republicans to switch their votes. Mr. Bruno had strongly supported the amendment, and its rejection would have been viewed as an embarrassment.
"In this system, when the leadership of the Legislature sets its mind to do something, it happens," said Lester M. Shulklapper, a lobbyist for the Catskill Resort Association, a group of hoteliers who support casino gambling.
Several more obstacles must be crossed before the first casino is allowed to open. The next elected Legislature, which comes to office in 1997, must pass the resolution again. Then the issue would be placed on the ballot for a public referendum. The earliest it could reach voters would be November 1997.
The resolution would allow casinos in designated areas of the state, including Niagara Falls and the Catskills, but not in New York City or Long Island. It passed in the State Senate by 34 to 21, in almost a straight party-line vote. The resolution passed by 88 to 62 in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, where 27 Republicans joined 61 Democrats in supporting the measure. The Governor's signature is not needed on a constitutional amendment.
Speaking in favor of the amendment on the floor of the Senate this evening, Mr. Bruno said that the spread of tax-exempt Indian-owned casinos in New York State and Connecticut had obliterated his moral opposition to state-sanctioned gambling and made him think New Yorkers should have the right to decide whether they want casinos outside Indian reservations.
Passage of the proposed amendment today now sets off what is sure to be an expensive lobbying campaign pitting religious groups that oppose gambling against local governments, hotels, resort companies and the casino industry.
Mr. Shulklapper said New York State's long but unconsummated flirtation with casino gambling had kept well-heeled casino interests on the sidelines of the debate. But first passage of the amendment will change that, he said.
"I think we'll see casino money coming from all across the country," he said. "All of them are very excited about New York State."
But gambling opponents argued that the huge amounts that casino interests are likely to spend on lobbying in Albany would lead to political corruption throughout the state. "It undermines the integrity of government at all levels, right from local government to the Capitol," said Senator Frank Padavan, a Republican of Queens and a leading critic of casino gambling.
The amendment would allow casino gambling in four places: the Catskills, the cities of Niagara Falls and Buffalo and either Saratoga or Warren County near Lake George.
The agreement calls for one land-based casino in each of those regions except for the three counties of the Catskills, Greene, Ulster and Sullivan, where a larger but undetermined number of casinos would be authorized.
Under the amendment, all casinos would have to be approved by voters in the affected counties.
The resolution would also allow eight harness and thoroughbred horse racing tracks around the state to have slot machines and video gambling. But Belmont and Aqueduct race tracks would be excluded.
Gambling at race tracks would be limited to racing days and to a maximum of eight hours a day. A part of gambling profits would be dedicated to helping the horse racing and breeding industry, compulsive gamblers, local governments and economic development.
The casino amendment appeared dead in the Senate earlier today when the Senate minority leader, Martin Connor, a Democrat of Brooklyn, said that all but one of his 25 members would vote against the bill because there had not been enough public debate on it.
About 13 Democratic votes were thought needed to pass the amendment, because about half of the 36-member Republican majority had said they were morally opposed to casino gambling.
But at 6 P.M., with the end of the Legislative session hours away, Mr. Bruno, who had predicted that the amendment would pass, called a closed-door meeting of his caucus to implore them to support the amendment. When they emerged, all but three had agreed to vote yes.

HEADLINE: A DEAL ON AUTO TRADE: THE WHITE HOUSE;
At the End, U.S. Blunted Its Big Stick

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 29

 BODY:
In the long and tortuous history of trade disputes between Japan and the United States, no President has ever talked a tougher game than Bill Clinton. No Administration threatened so convincingly to use its big stick unless Tokyo agreed to fundamental, precedent-shattering change in the way it did business.
Mickey Kantor, Mr. Clinton's aggressive trade representative, spoke repeatedly in the months leading up to Wednesday's accord on automotive trade of the need for a "momentous shift" that would "break the back" of the network of collusive relationships that keep outsiders -- foreign and domestic -- at bay. 
 For the first time, an American administration was unified in its willingness to use the blunt and ugly weapon of punitive trade sanctions to achieve its goal. A few days ago, Vice President Al Gore summed up the Administration's stance: "We're not going to blink."
But in the end, Mr. Clinton settled for a deal that requires far less change in Japanese business practices than his political oratory suggested would have been acceptable.
Even some of Mr. Clinton's closest economic aides conceded today that they might have let him set too high a hurdle. Almost any accord was going to fall short of the broad objectives of remaking the structure of Japan's auto industry. Some are also wondering if they jumped too early: Could Washington have won broader change it if had gone through with its threatened sanctions?
"These are questions we'll be asking ourselves for a long time," a senior Administration official deeply involved in the issue said hours after Mr. Kantor and Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, declared that they had bridged the unbridgeable. "But we all looked over the precipice and discovered we couldn't see the bottom. The sanctions were a big risk. So we took what we had in hand."
Clearly Mr. Clinton got more than he would have without resorting to extreme pressure, maybe a lot more. For all the confrontational language, however, he ended up with an agreement that goes only modestly beyond past accords.
It is filled with goals but few commitments. It contains some specific, important regulatory changes but no declarations of broad reform. There are an impressive series of benchmarks to measure progress but no penalties if progress is not made.
If Japan's economy recovers over the next three years, the agreement may yield the $9 billion or so more in American auto-parts sales that Mr. Clinton says it will. The goal, though, was not just sales but dismantling the system that Japan had built up over 40 years.
Today, Mr. Kantor argued in a telephone interview from Denver, where he is the host of a meeting of Latin American trade ministers, that the accord was being vastly underrated.
"This is more than a step forward," he said. "I think it is fundamental change. It is not total change. But we have done a number of things we said we would do. We've made sure the Japanese markets will be open to autos and auto parts. We gave the right signal to the rest of Asia. And the U.S. public is more convinced than ever this President will make sure trade is a two-way street."
To no one's surprise, however, Mr. Kantor and his negotiating team also ran headlong into the three realities of economic diplomacy with Tokyo that have changed very little since Richard M. Nixon declared 25 years ago that the trade deficit with Japan, then a fraction of tens of billions of dollars now, had reached intolerable proportions.
The first is that even the most comprehensive trade agreements are, by nature, maddeningly narrow and precise. They are tiny little ice chips off the glacier. The White House said it wanted an accord that would remake the world's second-largest economy and strike fear into the hearts of Asian countries tempted to imitate Japan's model. But what it got was an agreement that expands the number of garages and mechanics who are permitted to make repairs for car inspections in Japan and that cajoles Toyota dealers into thinking about putting a Ford Taurus in their windows.
"There is always a mismatch between the loftiness of the goals and minutiae of the issues you actually negotiate," one of the principal negotiators said today.
The second reality is that "equal access" to Japan's markets is a very subjective thing, as dependent on Detroit's willingness to invest heavily as on Japan's willingness to open its doors. Chrysler took an important step, if decades late, the other day in announcing a $100 million investment in a modest car-dealer franchise that should expand its tiny presence in Japan's big cities. But for all the shouting, none of the Big Three has declared how many billions each will spend to seriously take on the Japanese car market, the world's second largest.
Now they have the opportunity. Mr. Kantor made the most headway in his demands that Tokyo crack down on car companies that put pressure on their dealers not to handle competitive American lines. By Mr. Kantor's estimates -- estimates Mr. Hashimoto declined to endorse, but did not dispute -- more than 200 such showrooms will be opened over the next year, and 1,000 in the next five years.
Japanese officials say this is a major advance, but one that will fall apart if the Big Three fail to invest heavily in some of the world's most expensive car dealerships. And they clearly think that even if you can take the Shinoda family to the showroom, you can't persuade them to buy oversized Cadillac Sevilles.
The third reality is that broader political alliances still count for a lot. The Clinton Administration, the most export-focused one in decades, decided that it was not worth risking its most important relationship in the Pacific for the extra concessions it might have gained.
"In the end, I think people got scared," said Alan Tonelson, a fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute, a member of a group of trade hawks who were trying to stiffen the Administration's resolve. "Boeing was afraid of retaliation; the American car companies were afraid of what kind of investments they would have to make; the intelligence agencies and the State Department were concerned that the broader relationship might be in jeopardy. So here's the message we ended up with: We talk loudly and carry a tiny stick."
Mr. Kantor argues that the stick is in the accord itself. This is the first agreement, he noted, to contain a specific set of criteria for annual measurement of progress. "The key is to have a way to keep the pressure on," he said.
But already the Japanese are saying that the benchmarks are vague because they did not agree to specific targets, a point their officials are heralding in Tokyo as an enormous victory. It is still hard to say which side is closer to the truth. The final agreement was put together so hastily that neither Government has yet to publish the final text.


GRAPHIC: Japan and the United States have been arguing over access to the Japanese market for a century. In recent years Japan has shipped far more goods to the United States than it has imported, with the imbalance swelling to about $70 billion in the 12 months ended March 31. Here is a breakdown of the trade flows that produced that imbalance. Both imports and exports are valued at United States ports; figures are in billions of dollars.
 
VEHICLES AND PARTS
Chart: "Dissecting the U.S.-Japan Trade"
Official trade barriers are not high, but the high quality of Japanese cars and the structure of the Japanese auto industry combine to make imports difficult. Inspection procedures, to be modified under the agreement announced Wednesday, have discriminated against foreign-made replacement parts.
 
MATERIALS
Unites States producers say their low-cost goods would do even better in Japan if not for regulatory barriers.
 
AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
Japan is the world's largest importer of food, but quotas and high tariffs keep out imported wheat, rice and sugar. United States suppliers hold high market shares in unprotected categories.
 
TECHNOLOGY
Sales to Japan have been hampered by regulatory barriers, especially in the telecommunications sector, as well as Japanese efforts to enhance technological capabilities of local firms. The 1987 Semiconductor Trade Agreement improved United States market access for semiconductors and the United States market share subsequently increased. (Some analysts, however, cite changing technology as the main reason for this increase.) Boeing sells large numbers of aircraft to Japanese airlines.
 
OTHER GOODS
American steelmakers say a Japanese cartel keeps their products out. Japan has imported more clothing and textiles in recent years, and the American toy retailer Toys "R" Us has set up outlets in Japan, but in both cases most of the goods come from other Asian nations, not the United States.

HEADLINE: Congress Passes G.O.P.'s Budget-Balancing Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
On basically party-line votes, the House and the Senate today adopted a seven-year Republican plan that is supposed to cut taxes, limit spending for Medicare and other social programs and balance the Federal budget by the year 2002.
The votes showed in stark colors how much the political landscape has changed since Republicans won control of Congress in the election last November. 
 The plan, called a budget resolution, is just a framework, setting overall levels for revenue and spending in broad categories like health, defense and transportation. The devilish details of which taxes would be lowered and exactly how spending would be restrained will not be decided until other legislation is voted on this fall.
At that point, President Clinton will move into the picture. He wants smaller tax cuts, more spending for health and education and a longer path to a balanced budget. In a letter to Republican leaders this week, the President said he would veto any bill that would, as the Republican budget envisions, cut taxes by $245 billion and restrict spending for Medicare and Medicaid by $450 billion over seven years.
"The hard part comes after we pass this resolution," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader.
But regardless of all that lies ahead before the budget is finally resolved, Republicans rejoiced that they were fulfilling the keystone promise to balance the budget that they made in their election campaign last year.
"Today truly is a historic day," said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, after the 239-to-134 vote. The tally in the Senate was 54 to 46, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed.
For such a momentous occasion, the debates were rather spiritless for most of the day -- a consequence, no doubt, of the fact that the outcome was never in doubt and that the same arguments have been made so many other times this year.
Fewer than half a dozen Representatives were present when the House took up the matter this morning. And, as is usually the case nowadays, what the Senate called a debate entailed one Senator after another rising and delivering a long speech to mostly empty chairs.
Republicans argued that budget deficits were draining the economy, that Americans were overtaxed, that the Medicare program was in danger of bankruptcy, that the Federal Government had become too large and unresponsive and that future generations were being short-changed because of Democratic profligacy.
Democrats countered that Republicans were protecting the privileged at the expense of the nation's elderly and children. Balancing the budget is a worthy goal, the Democrats maintained. But they said it should be done more slowly than the Republicans want and at less cost to the Government's social programs.
But as the day wore on, the debate picked up. In the House, it rose to a climax in the closing speeches. With less than 10 minutes to go, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, moved into the well of the House -- knowing as he has so many other times this year that he was speaking in a losing cause.
The Republican budget, he said, was "extreme" and "unfair." Medicare cutbacks would seriously harm retired people. More than half the tax cuts would go to families with incomes exceeding $100,000.
"What was middle-class squeeze becomes middle-class squash," he declared, adding: "I tell you, my friends, we can do better than this."
Mr. Gephardt sat down, and Mr. Kasich moved to the microphone, his Republican colleagues rising in ovation. At 43, Mr. Kasich is the youngest committee chairman in the House, and this year he has risen from obscurity to become one of the most important politicians in the country.
"We run for office," he declared, his hands waving, his sentences clipped. "We leave our families. We get on planes. We run all over. And we wonder sometimes why we do it.
"Well, today, we're making history. Today, this is a giant step. We're saving America. And every member should leave this chamber today with their heads held high, realizing this is why we came -- to put America over politics, to put the future over the present. And frankly, folks, the American people appreciate it.
"God bless America," he concluded. "God bless this Congress in taking this giant step. Because we are about to guarantee a prosperous America and a better planet."
The House then began to vote. By 4:30 P.M., the Republican budget had been approved. Eight Democrats joined 231 Republicans in favor of the measure. One Republican (Representative Michael Patrick Flanagan of Illinois), 192 Democrats and one Independent (Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont), voted against it.
On the other side of the Capitol, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, a Democrat from West Virginia who is one of the Senate's leading authorities on health matters, argued that the Republican plan would cause devastating damage to the Government's health care programs.
But Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said of Mr. Rockefeller and other Democrats: "They don't want to do anything. They want the deficit to hang around our necks and around our children's necks until it throttles them."
With Congress about to leave for the Fourth of July recess, Mr. Domenici cited the Boston Tea Party of 1773, saying: "That, too, was described as a revolution, one that helped to bring a better future. In the spirit of the Boston Tea Party, free our young people from their debt."
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, held up a chart showing that under the Republican plan, the average American family with an income below $75,000 would lose $900 more in Government benefits over the next seven years than it would receive in tax cuts. But the average family with an income of more than $350,000, he said, would have a net gain of $350,000.
Closing the debate, Senator Dole brushed those arguments aside. The budget, he said, would provide "freedom from crushing debt, freedom from excessive taxation, freedom from big government, freedom from worries about Medicare surviving."
Under the measure, the $245 billion in tax cuts would not go into effect until the Congressional Budget Office certified that legislation had been enacted that would put the budget on a path to balance. The Republicans are anticipating that the tax cuts will include a $500-per-child tax reduction for most middle-class and wealthy families, a lower capital gains tax and some new tax breaks for businesses.
The budget resolution establishes how much the committees of Congress can allocate in various areas.
The biggest savings would be in Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and the disabled, and Medicaid, the health program for the poor, which covers much of the nation's nursing-home expense. Smaller savings were ordered across the board, but they would fall heaviest in the areas of welfare and other benefits.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From High Court Ruling in Racial Districting Case

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court decision in Miller v. Johnson, holding that the use of race as a "predominant factor" in drawing electoral district lines is presumably unconstitutional. The vote was 5 to 4. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined. Justice O'Connor filed a concurring opinion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, Stephen G. Breyer and David H. Souter dissented. Justices Ginsburg and Stevens filed dissenting opinions.
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Justice Kennedy
 The constitutionality of Georgia's Congressional redistricting plan is at issue here. In Shaw v. Reno, we held that a plaintiff states a claim under the Equal Protection Clause by alleging that a state redistricting plan, on its face, has no rational explanation save as an effort to separate voters on the basis of race. The question we now decide is whether Georgia's new 11th District gives rise to a valid equal protection claim under the principles announced in Shaw and, if so, whether it can be sustained nonetheless as narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. . . . 
 In 1965, the Attorney General designated Georgia a covered jurisdiction under Sec. 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act. . . . In consequence, Sec. 5 of the act requires Georgia to obtain either administrative preclearance by the Attorney General or approval by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of any change in a "standard, practice or procedure with respect to voting" made after Nov. 1, 1964. The preclearance mechanism applies to Congressional redistricting plans, and requires that the proposed change "not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color." . . .
Between 1980 and 1990, one of Georgia's 10 Congressional districts was a majority-black district -- that is, a majority of the district's voters were black. The 1990 decennial census indicated that Georgia's population of 6,478,216 persons, 27 percent of whom are black, entitled it to an additional 11th Congressional seat, App. 9, prompting Georgia's General Assembly to redraw the State's Congressional districts. . . .
Elections were held under the new Congressional redistricting plan on Nov. 4, 1992, and black candidates were elected to Congress from all three majority-black districts. On Jan. 13, 1994, appellees, five white voters from the 11th District, filed this action against various state officials (Miller Appellants) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. . . .
Finding that the "evidence of the General Assembly's intent to racially gerrymander the 11th District is overwhelming, and practically stipulated by the parties involved," the District Court held that race was the predominant, overriding factor in drawing the 11th District. Appellants do not take issue with the court's factual finding of this racial motivation. Rather, they contend that evidence of a Legislature's deliberate classification of voters on the basis of race cannot alone suffice to state a claim under Shaw.
They argue that, regardless of the Legislature's purposes, a plaintiff must demonstrate that a district's shape is so bizarre that it is unexplainable other than on the basis of race, and that appellees failed to make that showing here. Appellants' conception of the constitutional violation misapprehends our holding in Shaw and the equal protection precedent upon which Shaw relied.
Shaw recognized a claim "analytically distinct" from a vote dilution claim. Whereas a vote dilution claim alleges that the State has enacted a particular voting scheme as a purposeful device "to minimize or cancel out the voting potential of racial or ethnic minorities," Mobile v. Bolden (1980), an action disadvantaging voters of a particular race, the essence of the equal protection claim recognized in Shaw is that the State has used race as a basis for separating voters into districts.
Just as the State may not, absent extraordinary justification, segregate citizens on the basis of race in its public parks, buses, golf courses, beaches and schools, so did we recognize in Shaw that it may not separate its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race. The idea is a simple one: "At the heart of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not 'as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class.' " . . .
When the State assigns voters on the basis of race, it engages in the offensive and demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race, because of their race, "think alike, share the same political interests and will prefer the same candidates at the polls." Shaw. Race-based assignments "embody stereotypes that treat individuals as the product of their race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts and their very worth as citizens according to a criterion barred to the Government by history and the Constitution." . . . They also cause society serious harm. As we concluded in Shaw:
"Racial classifications with respect to voting carry particular dangers. Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may Balkanize us into competing racial factions; it threatens to carry us further from the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters -- a goal that the 14th and 15th Amendments embody, and to which the Nation continues to aspire. It is for these reasons that race-based districting by our state legislatures demands close judicial scrutiny." Our observation in Shaw of the consequences of racial stereotyping was not meant to suggest that a district must be bizarre on its face before there is a constitutional violation. Nor was our conclusion in Shaw that in certain instances a district's appearance (or, to be more precise, its appearance in combination with certain demographic evidence) can give rise to an equal protection claim, a holding that bizarreness was a threshold showing, as appellants believe it to be.
Our circumspect approach and narrow holding in Shaw did not erect an artificial rule barring accepted equal protection analysis in other redistricting cases. Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary element of the constitutional wrong or a threshold requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the Legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines. The logical implication, as courts applying Shaw have recognized, is that parties may rely on evidence other than bizarreness to establish race-based districting.
Our reasoning in Shaw compels this conclusion. We recognized in Shaw that, outside the districting context, statutes are subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause not just when they contain express racial classifications, but also when, though race neutral on their face, they are motivated by a racial purpose or object. . . .
Shaw applied these same principles to redistricting. "In some exceptional cases, a reapportionment plan may be so highly irregular that, on its face, it rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to 'segregat(e) . . . voters' on the basis of race." In other cases, where the district is not so bizarre on its face that it discloses a racial design, the proof will be more "difficul(t)." Although it was not necessary in Shaw to consider further the proof required in these more difficult cases, the logical import of our reasoning is that evidence other than a district's bizarre shape can be used to support the claim.
Appellants and some of their amici argue that the Equal Protection Clause's general proscription on race-based decision making does not obtain in the districting context because redistricting by definition involves racial considerations. Underlying their argument are the very stereotypical assumptions the Equal Protection Clause forbids.
It is true that redistricting in most cases will implicate a political calculus in which various interests compete for recognition, but it does not follow from this that individuals of the same race share a single political interest. The view that they do is "based on the demeaning notion that members of the defined racial groups ascribe to certain 'minority views' that must be different from those of other citizens," the precise use of race as a proxy the Constitution prohibits. . . .
In sum, we make clear that parties alleging that a State has assigned voters on the basis of race are neither confined in their proof to evidence regarding the district's geometry and makeup nor required to make a threshold showing of bizarreness. Today's case requires us further to consider the requirements of the proof necessary to sustain this equal protection challenge. . . .
In our view, the District Court applied the correct analysis, and its finding that race was the predominant factor motivating the drawing of the 11th District was not clearly erroneous. The court found it was "exceedingly obvious" from the shape of the 11th District, together with the relevant racial demographics, that the drawing of narrow land bridges to incorporate within the district outlying appendages containing nearly 80 percent of the district's total black population was a deliberate attempt to bring black populations into the district.
Although by comparison with other districts the geometric shape of the 11th District may not seem bizarre on its face, when its shape is considered in conjunction with its racial and population densities, the story of racial gerrymandering seen by the District Court becomes much clearer. . . .
As a result, Georgia's Congressional redistricting plan cannot be upheld unless it satisfies strict scrutiny, our most rigorous and exacting standard of constitutional review. . . .
To satisfy strict scrutiny, the State must demonstrate that its districting legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest. There is a "significant state interest in eradicating the effects of past racial discrimination." The State does not argue, however, that it created the 11th District to remedy past discrimination, and with good reason: there is little doubt that the State's true interest in designing the 11th District was creating a third majority-black district to satisfy the Justice Department's preclearance demands. . . .
Whether or not in some cases compliance with the Voting Rights Act, standing alone, can provide a compelling interest independent of any interest in remedying past discrimination, it cannot do so here. As we suggested in Shaw, compliance with Federal antidiscrimination laws cannot justify race-based districting where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a constitutional reading and application of those laws. The congressional plan challenged here was not required by the Voting Rights Act under a correct reading of the statute. . . .
We think it inappropriate for a court engaged in constitutional scrutiny to accord deference to the Justice Department's interpretation of the act. Although we have deferred to the department's interpretation in certain statutory cases, we have rejected agency interpretations to which we would otherwise defer where they raise serious constitutional questions. When the Justice Department's interpretation of the act compels race-based districting, it by definition raises a serious constitutional question . . . and should not receive deference.
The Voting Rights Act and its grant of authority to the Federal courts to uncover official efforts to abridge minorities' right to vote have been of vital importance in eradicating invidious discrimination from the electoral process and enhancing the legitimacy of our political institutions. Only if our political system and our society cleanse themselves of that discrimination will all members of the polity share an equal opportunity to gain public office regardless of race.
As a Nation, we share both the obligation and the aspiration of working toward this end. The end is neither assured nor well served, however, by carving electorates into racial blocs. "If our society is to continue to progress as a multiracial democracy, it must recognize that the automatic invocation of race stereotypes retards that progress and causes continued hurt and injury."
It takes a shortsighted and unauthorized view of the Voting Rights Act to invoke that statute, which has played a decisive role in redressing some of our worst forms of discrimination, to demand the very racial stereotyping the 14th Amendment forbids.
 
BY JUSTICE O'CONNOR,
Concurring
 I understand the threshold standard the Court adopts "that the Legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations" to be a demanding one. To invoke strict scrutiny, a plaintiff must show that the State has relied on race in substantial disregard of customary and traditional districting practices. Those practices provide a crucial frame of reference and therefore constitute a significant governing principle in cases of this kind.
The standard would be no different if a Legislature had drawn the boundaries to favor some other ethnic group; certainly, the standard does not treat efforts to create majority-minority districts less favorably than similar efforts on behalf of other groups. Indeed, the driving force behind the adoption of the 14th Amendment was the desire to end legal discrimination against blacks.
Application of the Court's standard does not throw into doubt the vast majority of the Nation's 435 Congressional districts, where presumably the States have drawn the boundaries in accordance with their customary districting principles. That is so even though race may well have been considered in the redistricting process. But application of the Court's standard helps achieve Shaw's basic objective of making extreme instances of gerrymandering subject to meaningful judicial review.
I therefore join the Court's opinion.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Ginsburg
 Two terms ago, in Shaw v. Reno, this Court took up a claim "analytically distinct" from a vote dilution claim. Shaw authorized judicial intervention in "extremely irregular" apportionments, in which the Legislature cast aside traditional districting practices to consider race alone in the Shaw case, to create a district in North Carolina in which African-Americans would compose a majority of the voters.
Today the Court expands the judicial role, announcing that Federal courts are to undertake a searching review of any district with contours "predominantly motivated" by race: "strict scrutiny" will be triggered not only when traditional districting practices are abandoned, but also when those practices are "subordinated to" and given less weight than race.
Applying this new "race-as-predominant-factor" standard, the Court invalidates Georgia's districting plan even though Georgia's 11th District, the focus of today's dispute, bears the imprint of familiar districting practices. Because I do not endorse the Court's new standard and would not upset Georgia's plan, I dissent. . . .
Before Shaw v. Reno, this Court invoked the Equal Protection Clause to justify intervention in the quintessentially political task of legislative districting in two circumstances: to enforce the one person-one-vote requirement and to prevent dilution of a minority group's voting strength.
In Shaw, the Court recognized a third basis for an equal protection challenge to a State's apportionment plan. The Court wrote cautiously, emphasizing that judicial intervention is exceptional: "(S)trict (judicial) scrutiny" is in order, the Court declared, if a district is "so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting." . . .
The problem in Shaw was not the plan architects' consideration of race as relevant in redistricting. Rather, in the Court's estimation, it was the virtual exclusion of other factors from the calculus. . . .
The record before us does not show that race similarly overwhelmed traditional districting practices in Georgia. . . .
In contrast to the snake-like North Carolina district inspected in Shaw, Georgia's 11th District is hardly "bizarre," "extremely irregular" or "irrational on its face." Instead, the 11th District's design reflects significant consideration of "traditional districting factors (such as keeping political subdivisions intact) and the usual political process of compromise and trades for a variety of nonracial reasons." . . .
Along with attention to size, shape, and political subdivisions, the Court recognizes as an appropriate districting principle "respect for . . . communities defined by actual shared interests." The Court finds no community here, however, because a report in the record showed "fractured political, social and economic interests within the 11th District's black population."
But ethnicity itself can tie people together, as volumes of social science literature have documented even people with divergent economic interests. For this reason, ethnicity is a significant force in political life. . . .
To accommodate the reality of ethnic bonds, legislatures have long drawn voting districts along ethnic lines. Our Nation's cities are full of districts identified by their ethnic character as Chinese, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish, Russian, for example. . . .
To separate permissible and impermissible use of race in legislative apportionment, the Court orders strict scrutiny for districting plans "predominantly motivated" by race. No longer can a State avoid judicial oversight by giving, as in this case, genuine and measurable consideration to traditional districting practices. Instead, a Federal case can be mounted whenever plaintiffs plausibly allege that other factors carried less weight than race. This invitation to litigate against the State seems to me neither necessary nor proper. . . .
The Court derives its test from diverse opinions on the relevance of race in contexts distinctly unlike apportionment. The controlling idea, the Court says, is "the simple command (at the heart of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection) that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class." . . .
In adopting districting plans, however, States do not treat people as individuals. Apportionment schemes, by their very nature, assemble people in groups. . . .
That ethnicity defines some of these groups is a political reality. Until now, no constitutional infirmity has been seen in districting Irish or Italian voters together, for example, so long as the delineation does not abandon familiar apportionment practices.
If Chinese-Americans and Russian-Americans may seek and secure group recognition in the delineation of voting districts, then African-Americans should not be dissimilarly treated. Otherwise, in the name of equal protection, we would shut out "the very minority group whose history in the United States gave birth to the Equal Protection Clause." . . .
Under the Court's approach, judicial review of the same intensity, i.e., strict scrutiny, is in order once it is determined that an apportionment is predominantly motivated by race. It matters not at all, in this new regime, whether the apportionment dilutes or enhances minority voting strength. . . .
Special circumstances justify vigilant judicial inspection to protect minority voters, circumstances that do not apply to majority voters. A history of exclusion from state politics left racial minorities without clout to extract provisions for fair representation in the law-making forum. The equal protection rights of minority voters thus could have remained unrealized absent the Judiciary's close surveillance. . . .
The majority, by definition, encounters no such blockage. White voters in Georgia do not lack means to exert strong pressure on their state legislators. . . .
The Court's disposition renders redistricting perilous work for state legislatures. Statutory mandates and political realities may require States to consider race when drawing district lines. But today's decision is a counterforce; it opens the way for Federal litigation if "traditional . . . districting principles" arguably were accorded less weight than race. . . .
This enlargement of the judicial role is unwarranted. The reapportionment plan that resulted from Georgia's political process merited this Court's approbation, not its condemnation. Accordingly, I dissent.
 
BY JUSTICE STEVENS,
Dissenting
 I believe the respondents in these cases, like the respondents in United States v. Hays, have not suffered any legally cognizable injury. . . . Respondents, plaintiffs below, are white voters in Georgia's 11th Congressional District. The Court's conclusion that they have standing to maintain a Shaw claim appears to rest on a theory that their placement in the 11th District caused them "representational harms."
The Shaw Court explained the concept of "representational harms" as follows: "When a district obviously is created solely to effectuate the perceived common interests of one racial group, elected officials are more likely to believe that their primary obligation is to represent only the members of that group, rather than their constituency as a whole." . . .
Respondents' standing, in other words, ultimately depends on the very premise the Court purports to abhor: that voters of a particular race "think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls." This generalization, as the Court recognizes, is "offensive and demeaning.". . .
In particular instances, of course, members of one race may vote by an overwhelming margin for one candidate, and in some cases that candidate will be of the same race. "Racially polarized voting" is one of the circumstances plaintiffs must prove to advance a vote dilution claim. . . . Such a claim allows voters to allege that gerrymandered district lines have impaired their ability to elect a candidate of their own race. The Court emphasizes, however, that a so-called Shaw claim is "analytically distinct" from a vote dilution claim. . . .
Neither in Shaw nor in Hays nor in the instant cases has the Court answered the question its analytic distinction raises: If the Shaw injury does not flow from an increased probability that white candidates will lose, then how can the increased probability that black candidates will win cause white voters, such as respondents, cognizable harm?
The Court's equation of Shaw claims with our desegregation decisions is inappropriate for another reason. In each of those cases, legal segregation frustrated the public interest in diversity and tolerance by barring African-Americans from joining whites in the activities at issue. The districting plan here, in contrast, serves the interest in diversity and tolerance by increasing the likelihood that a meaningful number of black representatives will add their voices to legislative debates. . . . That racial integration of the sort attempted by Georgia now appears more vulnerable to judicial challenge than some policies alleged to perpetuate racial bias . . . is anomalous, to say the least.
Equally distressing is the Court's equation of traditional gerrymanders, designed to maintain or enhance a dominant group's power, with a dominant group's decision to share its power with a previously underrepresented group. In my view, districting plans violate the Equal Protection Clause when they "serve no purpose other than to favor one segment, whether racial, ethnic, religious, economic or political, that may occupy a position of strength at a particular point in time, or to disadvantage a politically weak segment of the community."
I do not see how a districting plan that favors a politically weak group can violate equal protection. The Constitution does not mandate any form of proportional representation, but it certainly permits a State to adopt a policy that promotes fair representation of different groups. . . .
The Court's refusal to distinguish an enactment that helps a minority group from enactments that cause it harm is especially unfortunate at the intersection of race and voting, given that African-Americans and other disadvantaged groups have struggled so long and so hard for inclusion in that most central exercise of our democracy.
I have long believed that treating racial groups differently from other identifiable groups of voters, as the Court does today, is itself an invidious racial classification. Racial minorities should receive neither more nor less protection than other groups against gerrymanders. A fortiori, racial minorities should not be less eligible than other groups to benefit from districting plans the majority designs to aid them.
I respectfully dissent.

HEADLINE: Outgoing N.R.C. Head Sees Nuclear Industry Revival

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
As he prepares to leave as chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Ivan Selin has predicted that the nation's 109 commercial nuclear plants, some now threatened by lower-cost electricity producers, will prosper if they can survive the tough economic conditions of the next few years.
And orders for new reactors, unseen in 20 years, could come in 10 years or so when the electricity market is more competitive and air pollution controls are stricter, Dr. Selin said. That will happen, he added, only if the Republican majority in Congress does not derail the nuclear waste disposal program first. 
 Dr. Selin, who leaves office on Friday, said a major threat to the industry's future was in the House budget resolution, which instructs the Energy Department to "downgrade, suspend or terminate its activities at Yucca Mountain," a government-owned site near Las Vegas, Nev., that is under study for a permanent waste repository. If financing is sharply cut back for more than just next year, he said, then "unequivocally there won't be any new nuclear plants."
For the short term, Dr. Selin said, gas-fired power plants, with their relatively low capital costs, would be built, but construction of nuclear and other kinds of high-capital plants was out of the question. And nuclear plants that need big repairs may be retired, he said. "Capital investments are anathema," he said.
Dr. Selin, 58, was appointed by President George Bush and took office four years ago. He is leaving a year before his term expires to go into business building Asian electrical plants that will run on natural gas.
In an hourlong interview, Dr. Selin also criticized moves in Congress to limit Government regulations, especially a proposal by House Republicans that if a regulation has been promulgated and companies have taken action to comply, the regulation cannot be changed. Such a rule could compromise safety, Dr. Selin said.
The idea of Republicans as a threat to nuclear power is a switch from the last few years. The administrations of Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush both supported the industry.
In the Clinton Administration, the commission under Dr. Selin has instituted "licensing reform," intended to simplify approval of new plants, and a mechanism for utilities to apply to have their reactor licenses extended to 60 years from 40. But the question of new power plants has been moot since the mid-1980's, because of unfavorable economics. At times the question of license extension has seemed moot, too, with utilities hard-pressed to justify continued operation of their reactors, amid a surplus of cheap power.
But Dr. Selin predicted that existing reactors would be seen as valuable assets in the next few years, when older coal-fired power plants will face advancing age and tighter pollution regulations, and as electricity demand continues to grow.
In fact, the category of better nuclear plants is expanding, according to utility industry statistics; the reliability of the plants is way up, with unplanned safety shutdowns having fallen to 0.8 per 7,000 hours of operation -- roughly the number of hours that a reactor runs in an average year. That figure is down from 1.3 in 1991, and more than 7 in 1980. Worker radiation exposure, the volume of radioactive waste produced and the rate of industrial accidents are all also generally down.
But today, with no plants under construction, there are fewer flashpoints for public debate. The accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union occurred nine years ago and the one at Three Mile Island, Pa., more than 16 years ago, and while few nuclear plants are popular, only a handful have active opposition.
Where there is opposition, it is over fuel storage; by 1998, a quarter of the nation's reactors will be running out of space in the earthquake-resistant swimming pools that they use for spent fuel, and many want to build fenced-in parking lots covered with steel and concrete casks for storage. Nevada, meanwhile, is fighting the proposed permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, aided by some environmental groups.
Dr. Selin said that environmentalists were misguided, because the alternative to burying the wastes in one place was storing the spent fuel above ground in circumstances that were not good for permanent disposal. And if the time comes when utilities want to order new plants, opponents will argue that there is still no place for the wastes. Without Yucca, he said, "those arguments will resonate."
The House plan is for "monitored retrievable storage," a fenced-in parking lot full of casks. Dr. Selin said that the idea was fine as an interim measure, but that as a permanent solution, it would doom nuclear technology in this country.
Dr. Selin's replacement, Shirley Jackson, a physicist, was sworn in on May 2. On Saturday she will not only become chairwoman, but will also have all the powers of the commission vested in her, because with three of the commission's five seats vacant, there will no longer be a quorum.

HEADLINE: Consumer Protection Laws Undercut in Proposed Bill

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
The House Banking Committee approved early today a broad bill that would repeal decades of consumer protection laws. At the same time, the measure appears to have sharply diminished the odds of any banking legislation emerging from Congress this year.
The problem does not lie in the bill's original goals, to roll back requirements that banks have found onerous but that Democrats contend have provided crucial guarantees to depositors and opportunities to borrowers in poor neighborhoods. 
 The new controversy stems from an amendment passed Wednesday, which used the bill to reopen a question that most House members had thought was already settled: how far to go in dismantling the Depression-era barriers that separate different parts of the financial services industry. The amendment would allow banks to affiliate with insurance companies, an idea that the Banking and Commerce committees had previously agreed to ignore.
Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, the upstate New York Republican who heads the powerful Rules Committee, said that given the House's crowded legislative schedule, today's bill and a closely related bill to eliminate barriers between banks and securities firms may not come to a vote this year or even during this Congress.
"The question is where do you find the time to put something like this out there, and it could go by the boards until next year," Mr. Solomon said in an interview this evening. Given the difficulty of tackling touchy banking issues in an election year, this means that both bills "could very well be" dead, he added.
Mr. Solomon is close to the insurance industry, which strongly opposes the provision added on Wednesday. But while his position could be interpreted as an effort to put pressure for a compromise on big banks and securities firms, which favor the amendment, his comments also reflect the judgment of a top Republican with an important role in controlling what legislation reaches the floor and in what form.
Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who heads the Banking Committee and tried without success to persuade his panel not to approve the insurance amendment, said that he was less gloomy than Mr. Solomon. "It would be premature either to be overly optimistic about consensus emerging or overly pessimistic that a death knell should be tolled," he said in an interview this evening.
In another problem for banking legislation, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin threatened today to recommend that President Clinton veto today's bill unless consumer protections are restored.
The committee's Republican majority passed today's bill on a party-line vote of 27 to 23. Republicans contended that the bill would eliminate unnecessary red tape, allowing banks to operate safely and more efficiently and ultimately pass on some of their savings to consumers.
But House Democrats and Mr. Rubin objected that the bill would undermine protections that many depositors have come to take for granted, and would allow bank executives to engage in reckless activities that could endanger institutions' solvency.
The bill would eliminate or water down many provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to lend in poor neighborhoods if they lend in nearby rich neighborhoods. It would also reduce the requirements for independence of banks' audit committees; repeal the requirement that banks use a standard formula for calculating annual yields on deposits; eliminate the three-day "cooling off" period during which consumers can back out of many mortgage refinancings, and allow banks to share with their affiliates previously confidential information about customers' bank accounts.
"The bill would seriously weaken important safeguards for assuring the safety and soundness of F.D.I.C.-insured depository institutions, and would eviscerate the Community Reinvestment Act, so critical to the economic life of many urban and rural communities," Mr. Rubin wrote.
House Democrats are solidly united against these provisions, and House Republicans do not have the votes by themselves to override a veto. Representative Kweisi Mfume, a Maryland Democrat on the committee, said today that "I'd rather go in with a veto, or the threat of a veto, and start from scratch."
The House Republican leadership had previously agreed not to tackle insurance issues, and Mr. Solomon was upset that the House Banking Committee had outvoted Mr. Leach to allow banks to merge with insurers in 33 states that do not explicitly ban such affiliations. "The inclusion of the banking affiliation violates the agreement everyone had on keeping the bill neutral, from taking sides with either the banking or insurance industries," he said.
Representative Richard A. Baker, the Louisiana Republican who sponsored the amendment but has temporarily lost his voice as a result of the long debate, said in a written statement today that his amendment would "allow consumers to have greater choice when they purchase financial products, and that has to be the ultimate goal of the legislation."
Securities industry lobbyists said they would begin fighting for the bill, which with the new amendment would allow securities firms with insurance affiliates to enter the banking industry.
The House Republican leadership had initially hoped for a House floor vote before the Fourth of July, but Democrats on the House Banking Committee blocked that by dragging out the committee hearing over two weeks; then they voted to add the controversial insurance provision on Wednesday, partly to try to doom the overall bill.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Lower on Rates Outlook

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks closed lower yesterday as signs of renewed strength in the economy dashed hopes that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates at its policy-setting meeting next week.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 6.23 points at 4,550.56. In the broader market, declining issues topped advances, 1,188 to 1,040, on active trading of 315.6 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 "Hopes for a Fed easing next week are declining faster than water going over Niagara Falls," said Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney.
Technology stocks, however, rebounded, pushing the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index 6.29 points higher, to 926.81.
In the bond market, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped nearly two full points, and its yield soared to 6.64 percent, from 6.51 percent on Wednesday.
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, said that stocks would have been stronger if "bonds weren't getting clobbered." The sharp rise in interest rates "neutralized the good news on home sales." he said.
The Commerce Department said home sales jumped 19.9 percent in May to an annual rate of 722,000 units -- the fastest rise in nearly threee and a half years and far above Wall Street economists' forecasts of a 593,000-unit sales rate.
The data, seen as a sign that the economy was still growing, quashed hopes that the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would push rates lower when it meets on July 5 and 6.
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans seeking first-time jobless benefits tumbled by 28,000 last week, retreating from a 17-month high. "The data confirm there's life in the economy, and the economy may pick up momentum in the third quarter and fourth quarter," Mr. Johnson said.
Recent economic reports had sent stocks on a roller-coaster ride as investors tried to gauge when or if the Fed would next lower rates.
David Shulman, United States equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said he believed the Fed would cut short-term rates by 25 basis points. However, he remains cautious and urges investors to "hold more cash than normal."
Mr. Acuff said stocks could be in the early stages of a minor correction "but the trend for the next 12 months will be higher."
Technology stocks rose strongly after being on the defensive in the last few days. Microsoft was up 1 1/2, to 89 3/8; Micron rose 1 1/2, to 55 1/8; Compaq added 1, to 44 1/2, and Texas Instruments jumped 4 1/8, to 136 7/8.
Elsewhere, Scott Paper rose 1 3/8, to 49 7/8, on rumors that Britain's Unilever or Procter & Gamble might buy the company. Kimberly-Clark has been reported to be in takeover talks with Scott Paper. P.&G. was off 3/8, to 72 1/4. The stock of Paradigm jumped 5 1/2, to 19 1/2, in its first day of trading. Rollins shed 2 1/2, to 23 3/4, after issuing an earnings warning for the second quarter. Parcplace tumbled 2 5/8, to 8 1/2, after forecasting a loss for the latest quarter.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.86 of a point, to 543.87. The American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.75, to 496.38.
The Big Board's Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.42, to 291.26. The average share was down 6 cents.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Spurt By 19.9%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 29

 BODY:
Sales of new homes during May rose 19.9 percent, the fastest rate in nearly three and a half years, the Commerce Department said today, as buyers responded strongly to lower mortgage rates.
Sales jumped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 722,000 units, far above Wall Street economists' forecasts of a sales rate of 593,000 units. It was the biggest monthly increase since a 21 percent rise in January 1992 and brought the monthly sales rate to its highest level since March 1994. 
 In another report today, the Labor Department said new applications for jobless benefits fell to 368,000 in the week ended last Saturday from 396,000 in the previous week, a sign the labor market might not be as weak as some economists thought.
The two reports come a week before the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee is to meet to consider interest-rate policy and the stronger-than-expected housing and labor data dashed speculation that the central bank would lower short-term rates at the meeting.
On Wednesday, before the release of the new data, the Economic Advisory Committee of the American Bankers Association said it considered it "likely and appropriate" that the Fed would lower short-term rates for the first time since September 1992.
The Commerce Department revised upward the level of monthly new-home sales for February, March and April to show a stronger pace than previously reported. As a result, it said April sales fell only 1.5 percent, to a rate of 602,000, instead of the decline of 2.7 percent reported earlier.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said the average rate for a 30-year mortgage late in May was 7.91 percent, down from 8.32 percent in April and 8.60 percent in May 1994.
Sales in May of new homes were exceptionally strong in every region except the Midwest, where they were unchanged from April. Sales rose 31 percent in the South, the strongest rate for the nation's biggest sales region since May 1986. They rose 19.7 percent in the West and 18 percent in the Northeast.
The average home sales price rose to $158,100 in May from $157,800 in April. The median price increased to $134,900 from $133,000.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Trade in Financial Services Is Dealt a Setback by U.S.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 29

 BODY:
Dealing a significant setback to the newly created World Trade Organization, an effort to liberalize trade in financial services apparently collapsed tonight after the Clinton Administration said certain other countries were not offering American financial institutions enough access to their markets.
American officials said they would give a binding commitment to the organization that would allow foreign financial service companies already established in the United States to continue operating there under the same regulatory conditions as their American counterparts. But they said the United States would not accept a new international agreement under which it would undertake to give all foreign financial service companies full access to its market and treat them as if they were American companies. 
 The negotiations covered such financial businesses as banks, insurance companies and investment houses.
In making their announcement, the American officials said foreign financial companies seeking to enter the United States, as well as foreign companies already there but seeking to expand, would be given clearance only if their home countries agreed to offer adequate access to American companies.
"This is not the end of the negotiation because we are ready to work with other countries or groups of countries to improve access," Jeffrey R. Shafer, the Assistant Treasury Secretary for International Affairs, said at a news conference at the end of the talks. "We will have the option to treat countries that treat us well better than others."
Many trade officials said the American decision -- which came only one day after the United States and Japan averted at the 11th hour a trade war over Japan's automotive market -- had dealt a significant setback to the new trading system that was set up earlier this year to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In particular, they said, it called into question the trade organization's hopes of brokering new trade agreements this year and next in such other service fields as telecommunications and maritime shipping.
Negotiators had agreed to try to liberalize financial services with a global agreement, not through the bilateral deals that the United States is now offering.
Renato Ruggiero, the trade organization's Director General, said in a statement that he was "bitterly disappointed" by the American decision.
The Clinton Administration had set a deadline of midnight Friday for reaching an agreement, and American officials held out no hope that an accord could be reached during the final day.
"After nine years of negotiation, I do not believe the next 24 hours will bring significant concessions," said Jeffrey Lange, the assistant special trade representative. "All countries knew this day would come."
Now that the talks for a global pact are apparently over, officials said that some countries might reduce the offers of market access that they were willing to make at the trade organization. It is thus possible that a negotiation that was aimed at freeing up world trade in financial services is going to conclude with reduced market access.
Delegates from other countries were angered by the decision by the United States to pursue its own accords. The 15-nation European Union, which negotiates on trade as a bloc, said it was "confused and perplexed" because it "thought the U.S. was negotiating in good faith."
While the United States said that developing countries in particular were not offering enough market access, European officials said they were ready to accept the existing access offers by the developing nations. They said they viewed the offers as a good first step that could be improved upon in four years, when members of the trade organization will hold new negotiations on financial services.
Japan's delegate said he was "surprised and very disappointed" and warned that the American decision could lead other countries to restrict access to their financial markets.
American negotiators said they did not expect foreign countries to retaliate against American financial services companies operating in those markets because the Clinton Administration was guaranteeing the rights of foreign financial companies operating in the United States.
Officials of the trade organization estimated that international trade in financial services totaled about $300 billion a year, or about one-third of total world trade in all services. The United States believes its share of that trade could be substantially increased if its banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms had better access to the fast-growing economies of Asia and Latin America, whose own financial sectors are still relatively underdeveloped.
Along with other industrial countries, the United States has said it believes that freer trade in financial services is necessary if countries are to reap the full economic gains from last year's agreement to increase trade in goods. But many developing countries have said they should be allowed to protect their young financial sectors until they are stronger. Some have had their faith in economic liberalization shaken by Mexico's financial crisis, which they attributed to overreliance on foreign capital.
Rather than opening up their markets to more foreign financial institutions, they want to concentrate on regulating those they already have more closely.

Drop in Treasury Bond Prices Is Blamed for Dollar's Decline

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday after a sharp drop in United States Treasury bond prices raised concern that foreign investors would abandon American markets.
The dollar slipped to a one-month low against the German mark and also declined against the yen, as optimism ebbed that Wednesday's accord on automobile trade would reduce the United States trade deficit with Japan anytime soon. 
 The bond market and the dollar were also pushed down after the Government said sales of new single-family homes rose a larger-than-expected 19.9 percent in May, the biggest increase since January 1992.
That increase raised speculation that the American economy was still growing fast enough to generate inflation, which erodes bonds' fixed interest payments. With such strong growth the Federal Reserve is considered less likely to lower rates, a move many analysts say would help bonds.
Declining bond prices often hurt the dollar by prompting worries that overseas investors will abandon domestic markets and sell dollars for other currencies.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.3799 marks from 1.3968 marks. Earlier in the day, the dollar slipped to 1.3777 marks, its lowest level since May 29, when it fell to 1.3740 marks.
The dollar dropped to 84.47 yen from 85.52 yen, a decline that traders attributed to pessimism about the new trade accord.
Although the agreement helped to avert a trade war, it may lack the teeth to cause Japan's trade surplus with the United States to narrow, many analysts said.
Japan's trade surplus -- $66 billion last year -- is often cited as the main reason for the yen's strength against the dollar.
"I think the euphoria has worn off," said Jim Phoenix, vice president of foreign exchange at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York. "People are concerned that both sides are declaring victory, which smells more like a political settlement than something that will narrow the trade gap."
In other trading, the British pound recouped some of this week's losses as concern about Prime Minister John Major's battle for control of the Conservative Party ebbed. Mr. Major resigned as head of the Tories last week and called a party leadership election for July 4.
Only a Cabinet minister, John Redwood, has stepped forward to challenge Mr. Major. The pound rose to 2.2060 marks from 2.2010 marks. Against the dollar, the pound rose to $1.5981 from $1.5756.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Prices Climb the Limit On a Big Jump in Home Sales

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lumber prices rose sharply yesterday after a Government report showed an unexpected surge in sales of new homes in May.
On other commodity markets, wheat prices rose while crude oil fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell 0.34 point, to 235.01. 
 The Commerce Department said sales of new homes rose 19.9 percent in May, as falling mortgage rates lured home buyers back into the market. The gain surprised analysts, who had expected a 3.1 percent increase.
The report suggested that building activity could pick up, increasing demand from lumberyards at a time when many lumber mills plan shutdowns for seasonal maintenance.
"We've been buying lumber in order to have supplies when the shutdowns come," said Edy McCartney, a buyer for the Parr Lumber Company in Portland, Ore. "For the first time in a long time, we're seeing demand outrunning current supplies."
July lumber rose its $10 daily limit, to $254.80 for 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It was the highest price for the active lumber contract since May 24.
Wheat prices rose for the sixth time in seven days as heavy rains and cool temperatures in the Midwest hurt the winter wheat crop.
The International Wheat Council, based in London, trimmed its outlook for world wheat production to 540 million metric tons from 545 million tons because of poor weather in the United States and Canada. The council said the decline would push wheat reserves as of June 30, 1996, to 97 million tons, a 20-year low.
The drop is forcing wheat buyers to search for enough wheat just to maintain current operations.
"Flour buyers who buy from the millers are living hand to mouth," said Fred Bursey Jr., vice president at Morrison Milling in Denton, Tex. "It's a very precarious position for all of us."
On the Kansas City Board of Trade, hard red winter wheat for July delivery gained 11 cents, to $4.96 a bushel, a 14-year high. Soft red winter wheat for July delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade rose 8.75 cents, to $4.475 a bushel, the highest in three years.
Prices of crude oil tumbled amid perceptions that production was increasing around the world, easing concern that American inventories were low. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for August delivery tumbled 41 cents, to $17.56 a barrel.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The P.L.O. Papers

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Should the United States continue giving hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestine Liberation Organization, and under what conditions?
Has Yasir Arafat lived up to the existing conditions of American aid? For instance, is all international money distributed through the P.L.O. being used for the economic benefit of Palestinians in territory turned over by Israel? Or has he used foreign help for his own personal and political purposes? 
 That is what is going on, according to copies of 28 letters in my possession. They deal with orders from Mr. Arafat's top finance aide in the Palestinian National Authority to Pecdar, the Palestinian economic development organization, which handles international aid and is supposed to be independent of political direction from Mr. Arafat.
With admonishments of secrecy, the letters contain instructions, and Pecdar notices of compliance, to allocate money to such projects as buying a large chicken farm, other land, apartments and companies for P.L.O. notables, enlarging holdings in Jerusalem -- and $2.5 million for an expanded propaganda apparatus, the money to be channeled through Mr. Arafat's mother-in-law.
Pieces of the correspondence have been printed in Israel, but have not surfaced publicly in the U.S, until this column.
The P.L.O. says they are forgeries. The Israeli Government does not want anything to interfere with U.S. aid to the P.L.O., as these letters could, but has been interestingly noncommittal about the letters.
The Clinton Administration also does not want any glitches about U.S. aid to the P.L.O. But American intelligence has been asked to examine the letters by Representative Ben Gilman, New York Republican, chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
I got them from Israeli and American sources who feel the Labor Government's negotiating techniques with the P.L.O. and Syria amount to a giveaway of Israeli security that will not bring a lasting peace but make it impossible.
Israeli officials finger Yigal Carmon, former adviser on terrorism to the previous and current Israeli Prime Ministers, as the source. He certainly was not mine. After I showed him the letters a month ago he returned with a reply he said he wished he did not have to make: certain informalities in Arabic usage gave him pause. Now he says that after consultations with other Palestinian and Israeli specialists, his linguistic questions are answered and the letters are authentic. Other anti-terrorist experts, who spent four months checking the letters, say they are not forgeries.
Spokesmen for the U.S., Israel and the World Bank tell me that the political projects outlined in the letters do not come from their contributions. They volunteered that the money could have come from other contributing nations or that international funding could have freed up more P.L.O. funds for secret political actions.
The letters are not the only question that the House and Senate will have to consider about continuing the $500 million U.S. aid to the P.L.O.
Why has Mr. Arafat not lived up to the condition that the P.L.O. eliminate the death-to-Israel clauses from its covenant? Will he ever stop encouraging Palestinians to believe that the peace negotiations are the first phase toward the covenant goal of control over all of what is now Israel? Why have more Israelis died in terrorist attacks since the Oslo agreement than before?
But the basic question before Congress is this:
Will peace be killed by insisting on P.L.O. compliance with conditions already outlined by the U.S. but unfulfilled by the P.L.O.? That is what Israeli and U.S. officials say they believe. Or could that make a lasting peace somewhat more possible? (My belief.)
In the Senate, Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, demands proof of P.L.O. compliance on anti-terrorist action and changing the covenant as a price of aid. In the House, Democrats and Republicans have introduced wording that would also reduce aid if any is misspent. Among them are Democrats Eliot Engel and Charles Schumer of New York and Republicans Jim Saxton of New Jersey and Tom DeLay of Texas.
That's one great thing about Congress -- there are always members of both parties around who insist on bringing up issues about which the Administration of the day wants only considerable shut-up.

HEADLINE: Rambling Through Ulster County

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
LONG before Ulster County, New York, came into being, Indians of the Mingua nation planted maize in the fields around present-day Kingston. They fished and hunted. They lived the good life. They called their domain "the pleasant land."
Well, fair enough. The no-frills appellation suggests that the Mingua (the Mingos of James Fenimore Cooper's "Leatherstocking Tales") were a judicious people, not inclined to boosterism, ill-adapted to practice the dark arts of public relations and advertising. In short, reliable. 
 The pleasant land of Ulster County lies along the west bank of the Hudson River, about 100 miles north of Manhattan. It is neither spectacular nor chic. If its principal towns -- Kingston, Woodstock, Saugerties and New Paltz -- could qualify as jewels, they would be small carat. The scenery delights and soothes rather than overwhelms. It is a land of small pleasures.
Ulster County has a little of this, a little of that. It has vineyards and rolling hills. It has large forests, lakes and reservoirs. It has ice caves. It has not one but two mountain ranges, the Shawangunks and the Catskills, and two splendid parks. It has decent restaurants, a microbrewery and its very own wine trail. It has an annual garlic festival. It is, in the words of a turn-of-the-century guidebook, "a land flowing with milk and honey, a land of corn and wine." Thumbs up to all of the above.
Manhattan's Dutch heritage survives only in its place names. But in Ulster County, the Dutch influence pops up at every turn in the form of stone houses, many of them built in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Built of Shawangunk (that's pronounced SHON-gum, locally) grit, with sloping, high-pitched wooden roofs, the houses have distinctive jambless fireplaces that date back to medieval Flanders.
Ulster County takes great pride in these little houses. Huguenot Street in New Paltz has six, making it the oldest street in the United States with its original houses. One, the Jean Hasbrouck Memorial House, was named by the Architectural Record of March 1926, a monthly trade publication, as the finest example of medieval Flemish stone architecture in North America, a rather arcane honorific, but the house is indeed eye-catching. The local Huguenot Society operates tours of the houses on Huguenot Street and of Locust Lawn, a nearby 1814 Federal mansion once occupied by Josiah Hasbrouck, the local grandee. The little town of Hurley has 10 stone houses and 15 others are nearby.
Many of the stone houses carry on as private homes and inns. One is Baker's Bed and Breakfast, outside Stone Ridge, a farmhouse built in 1780. Baker's sits on high ground overlooking a few nearby farms, a gaggle of geese and, off in the distance, the tower at Mohonk Mountain House, the county's most renowned resort. The farmhouse is a gem, a tight-knit package of stone, thick beams and foot-wide floor planks. Upstairs, it still has the original wall paint, made with buttermilk and blueberries. The smell of wood smoke permeates the place, and in cool weather, a cast-iron stove in the communal living room radiates warmth and slowly sends the resident cat, curled underneath, into a narcotic daze.
My wife and I took a room with private bath for $98 a night. It had a solid old four-poster bed, a rusticated armoire and a dresser. They built solid in the old days, but they didn't build big. The bathroom and the closet occupied mere niches. Nevertheless, the room was cozy and pleasing to the eye.
There's something important to know about geese. They rise early, and they celebrate the morn with a "Hallelujah" Chorus of honks that continues for a very long time. You'd think that a toot or two would do it, but no. Geese go at it with the gusto of a barroom drunk into the third verse of "My Way."
No problem rising for breakfast, which is huge. One morning it was eggs Benedict with sauteed Jerusalem artichokes, scones with raspberry jam and smoked trout. The next it was homemade granola and yogurt, ham and something called a Dutch baby, sort of a glorified popover with a thick, almost custardy base. It comes out of the oven in a crock, it's eaten with maple syrup and it is very, very good.
 
Heading Out
 Stone Ridge turned out to be a good base of operations. It is attractive but not twee, little more than a few stone houses strung along a state road, along with the imposing Inn at Stone Ridge (known locally as Hasbrouck House). The inn, a Dutch Colonial mansion, has a highly inviting little tavern just inside the entryway with three local beers on tap, all from the Woodstock Brewery in Kingston: Hudson lager, Big Indian porter and St. James ale. The inn's restaurant, Milliways, specializes in regional American cuisine. The extensive wine list is all-American.
Another advantage to Stone Ridge is its proximity to High Falls, a tiny hamlet with much historical interest. Like many other towns in Ulster County, High Falls is witness to an economy that came and went. It flourished in the heyday of the Delaware & Hudson Canal, built in 1828 to carry household coal from northeastern Pennsylvania to Kingston, where it was transferred to large barges that floated down river to New York City. High Falls had the highest concentration of locks on the canal, five of them, which raised or lowered barges 70 feet. The railroad made the canal obsolete by the late 19th century, and High Falls settled into a doze.
The Delaware & Hudson Canal Museum in High Falls tells the tale, and it offers self-guided walking tours to the canal, the locks, an old ice house, a telegraph office and the remains of sawmills that predate the canal.
 
A Tavern From 1795
 High Falls is also home to the county's most celebrated restaurant, the Depuy Canal House, a comfortable tavern from 1795. The menu is ambitious and, if you take advantage of the set menus, a bargain. The three-course menu for $23 consists of soup or salad, entree and dessert. The restaurant also offers a four-course menu for $33 and a seven-course menu for $46.
We started with a half-bottle of Veuve Clicquot and nibbled on free hors d'oeuvres: chickpea puree on endive and a mock black caviar in a phyllo pastry cup. The caviar was made of amaranth, a grain, which had been soaked in brine and then cooked in squid ink and a little Vietnamese fish sauce. Although it didn't taste all that much like caviar, it was at least cruising in the neighborhood.
Things got rolling with the appetizers: morels and cottage goat cheese in an essence of mushroom sauce ($12.50) and a smoked-salmon quesadilla with smoked Gruyere and capers on a sesame sake sauce (also $12.50).
At the Canal House, the food gets a real make over. Do not look on its text-heavy menu for a simple turbot in beurre blanc. Think in terms of rare duck breast and polenta served with hot dandelion and green-olive salad with a red wine, shallot and roasted garlic brown sauce ($24.50) or red snapper poached with red bell pepper miso sauce served with mushrooms, peas, tomatoes, black salted beans and a potato croquette ($21). Fortunately, the waiters do not announce specials. It would make a long evening.
 
All-American Main Street
 Ulster County has no mandatory tourist destination. Therefore, it is perfectly O.K. to browse, guilt-free. An hour here, a couple of hours there should do it. Saugerties gets my vote as having the main street most likely to restore faith in traditional American values. Around one corner lies the heartwarming sight of a real, live small-town movie theater, the kind that has to be described as the local bijou.
At the same time, Saugerties has more than its share of spiffy restaurants, including Cafe Tamayo (nouvelle-ish), the Oasis (Mediterranean) and Featherstone's (English).
Woodstock no doubt has abundant charms, but for purely personal reasons, I made a wide detour around it. Any town boasting of its artists' colony earns my instant suspicion. The term conjures up images of bad, overpriced jewelry and unspeakable objects labeled "sculptures." I prefer to visit a good reptile farm.
Although Kingston shows every sign of having fallen on irreversible hard times circa 1920, it should have historical interest for New Yorkers. It was once the state's third-leading city, after New York City and Albany, and for a time was the state's capital. The river made it. The fortunate confluence of Rondout Creek and the Hudson transformed a small Dutch settlement into a thriving center for the warehousing and distribution of flagstones, bluestone, cement, gravel, coal and agricultural produce. After the Revolution, New Yorkers voted to make Kingston the capital of the United States.
A whiff of the glory days can be felt at Rondout Landing, on the river, and along the West Strand, a block of 19th-century Italianate commercial buildings that have been restored. The chief feature of the waterfront is the Rondout II Lighthouse, built in 1913.
 
Along the Wine Trail
 Enough history. On to the wine trail, Ulster's highway of pleasure. Actually, there are two trails. The Shawangunk Wine Trail, marked by signs decorated with a cluster of grapes, starts south of New Paltz at Modena. Follow Route 44-55 west to Route 7. Turn south, then west again on Route 52. The white-streaked Shawangunks loom off to the west. A second string of wineries is off Route 9W between West Park and Marlboro. Most wineries offer tastings and sell their wares. (Some impose a small tasting fee, which is deducted from the price of the bottle if you buy.)
The Hudson Valley is not the Cote d'Or, but there are some decent chardonnays to be found. West Park Wine Cellars is probably the best known. The bold few may wish to sample a Hudson Valley red. The standout wine on my visit was a grape variety new to me, a weirdo French hybrid called ravat, after its inventor. Walker Valley Vineyards in Walker Valley produces a sterling specimen, off-dry or off-sweet, depending on where it hits the taste buds. It's a fairly hefty, fruity white that makes a terrific aperitif. It's a good souvenir and a good symbol for Ulster County. It's not a great wine, but a good wine, a little off the beaten track and worth the search. It's the wine you'd expect from a pleasant land.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Windows That Chastise

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
A merchant in Antwerp or Ghent in, say, 1500 might rise of a morning to wondrous sights: a martyrdom in progress, a prodigal son brought low, or the figure of Death, cloaked in gold and sailing through the air. Mystical visions? Tricks of the eye? Neither. He would be looking at pictures painted on small translucent sheets of glass inserted among the panes of his bedroom windows.
Dozens of these exquisite objects, along with related prints and drawings, are on view in "The Luminous Image: Painted Glass Roundels in the Lowlands, 1480-1560" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Although the production of such roundels had become a minor industry by the 16th century in what is now Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, the Met's show, organized by Timothy B. Husband of the Cloisters, is the first ever devoted to the subject. 
 Made of single pieces of clear glass, usually circular, roundels were coated with a silver-sulfide compound, then fired and buffed to a light gray. An image was drawn on the surface, with some of the modeling and shading achieved by scraping away parts of the coating with a stylus, in some cases leaving areas of glass transparent. Finally, the finished composition was touched up with another silver solution, which appeared as an amber or honey-yellow stain.
The results resemble a species of illuminated etching and, in fact, major graphic artists of the day like Lucas van Leyden and Maerten van Heemskerck designed compositions for the medium. Even if they had not done so, chances are that images from their prints would have ended up on roundels. Glass workshops routinely cribbed popular images, sometimes cobbling together parts of several to please their art-literate, bourgeois clientele.
The process of borrowing and adapting is evident in the show's opening works. An expressive pen and ink drawing in Late Gothic style, "Rebecca Taking Leave of Her Parents" (1480-90), incorporates a subsidiary figure from an earlier drawing by the Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes (active from 1467-1482) but reverses it. The Old Testament scene is faithfully copied on the roundel, but enriched with painterly applications of gold-yellow stain.
Despite the secular contexts for which they were intended -- affluent homes and civic buildings -- most of the roundels are religious in theme and moralizing in intention. The scene with Rebecca leaving to meet her future husband, for instance, may be taken as an example of conjugal obedience. Steadfast faith is the lesson of a grisly vignette of St. James being cut to bits on an executioner's block. And an emblem of two skulls crawling with snakes is the kind of chilling memento mori that suggests just how close much of this work was to a medieval sensibility.
Such conservative, devotional and cautionary themes remained a constant, even while the styles of the roundels changed. The literary source for "The Triumph of Fame," by Pieter Coecke van Aelst (1502-1550), is drawn from Petrarch rather than from Scripture, but the edifying intention is the same. And the "Judgment of Cambyses," by Dirick Vellert, employs a refined Mannerist elegance to depict a corrupt judge being flayed alive in a roundel probably meant for a courtroom window.
Vellert, who was admired by Durer, not only designed but painted roundels, a task ordinarily assigned to workshop artisans. This dual accomplishment may also have been undertaken at least once by Lucas van Leyden. The show's catalogue speculates that "The Triumph of David," a rectangular glass panel of extraordinary technical polish, on loan for the first time from the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, is a youthful work from his hand.
The exhibition ends with a flourish in the magnificent windows designed by the glazier Dirck Crabeth in 1543 for a house in the city of Leiden that still exists. With their Biblical scenes surrounded by Italianate swags and putti, they are among the only surviving silver-stain works from a secular setting whose precise provenance can be traced, and they are displayed at the Metropolitan in their original carved wooden frames.
Within a few decades of the completion of Crabeth's windows, production of roundels would taper off in the Lowlands. If the chastising spirit of their imagery may be taken in part as evidence of a middle class pressing hard to maintain its stability in a turbulent time, that turbulence became overwhelming by the mid-16th century as the economy faltered and religious and political strife intensified.
Great fortunes -- and many windows -- were shattered in the process. And judging by the panels that survived, their loss is much to be regretted. Seen at their best in "The Luminous Image," their beauty and virtuosity fully equal art in more privileged mediums, and they certainly tell the psychological and spiritual story of their time with variety and panache. Examining them in the Metropolitan today we see only the blank white walls against which they are displayed. But once upon a time their stories of faith and violence, reward and retribution, were the filters through which men and women viewed the world around them.
"The Luminous Image: Painted Glass Roundels in the Lowlands, 1480-1560" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82d Street, through Aug. 20.

HEADLINE: Major Restoration Is Planned for Erie Canal

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
The Erie Canal, whose mule-drawn barges opened the nation's heartland to the Atlantic 170 years ago, would be turned into a recreational waterway for boaters, hikers, cyclists and tourists under a plan prepared by the New York State Thruway Authority.
The Erie and three linked canals stretch for 524 miles from Buffalo to Albany and up to Lake Champlain, but their commercial clamor has stilled to a whisper. Last year, the canal system carried less than 68,000 tons of cargo, a tiny fraction of the 5.2 million tons it handled in 1951. 
 To revive the canal, the authority drew its inspiration from the lively traffic of pleasure boats on sleepy canals in France and Britain and conceived of the Erie Canal as a serpentine playground, with charter boats plying its waters, and hikers and cyclists using its former towpaths.
While the authority is already spending $60 million to dredge the canal and repair locks, and is negotiating contracts with private developers in Syracuse, it is not entirely clear where the $146 million needed for the remainder of the project over the next 15 years will come from.
A spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki, while endorsing the plan's goals, questioned the financing.
"We certainly support the concept and the plan," said the spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, "but we need to review the funding mechanism to make sure it's real, and from our initial review there are many unanswered questions. We want to make sure it's not pie in the sky."
A memorandum circulated in the Governor's office calls the plan "an expensive cross-subsidy from thruway toll payers and taxpayers generally."
Ms. Mucha said the state's Urban Development Corporation would be asked to review the authority's plan, its financing and its economic impact.
More than half the financing -- $75.3 million -- would come from thruway authority bonds that would be paid off by tolls on boats, revenue from retail leases and sales and a portion of the $330 million in highway tolls the authority collects annually. But the project also counts on the financial participation of private developers and $41.7 million in local, Federal and state contributions.
Technically, the authority can proceed with the canal's revival without approval by the Legislature and the Governor, but in practice, Mr. Pataki would have many ways to undermine the project if he chose to, like blocking Federal transportation funds that go to the state, not the authority.
Peter Tufo, the authority's chairman and chief executive officer, said that the proposed state contribution would be small -- no more than $1 million a year -- and that local legislators might prevail on the State Legislature to provide it.
Mr. Tufo, an appointee of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo whose term expires in January, said his two fellow board members are expected to endorse the plan when a formal vote is taken in September.
The project, which will be formally unveiled July 11, would provide piers, restaurants, retail shops, information kiosks, picnic tables and trail amenities whose absence is blamed for the limited recreational use of the canal.
In Syracuse, development rights have already been negotiated for a $40 million aquarium as well as a marina and restaurant. In Rochester, an artists' rendering foresees a broad canal-side promenade with gazebos and piers. In Waterford, a rendering depicts a cafe alongside a canal bridge.
It was, in part, the thruway authority's superhighway that led to the decline of the Erie Canal, which had been opened by Gov. Dewitt Clinton in 1825. In 1992, the State Legislature transferred the moribund canal system from the Transportation Department to the authority.
"Ironically, we were in part responsible for the canal's decline and so there's a symmetry to our taking it over and revitalizing it," Mr. Tufo said.
Seven public hearings will be held in August, but so far there has been no groundswell of opposition. One reason is that Mr. Tufo has carefully avoided talk of condemning private property, even though private ownership clouds prospects for an uninterrupted hiking trail. Seeking to allay fears about overdevelopment of bucolic areas, he has restricted plans for major structures to eight canal cities and towns.
In addition to those for Syracuse, tourist clusters are being planned for Tonawanda, Rochester, Oswego, Seneca Falls, Little Falls and Whitehall. Another 96 smaller areas are also contemplated.
No environmental group has taken a position on the canal's development, though individual members express concerns about overdevelopment and dredging silt that may contain toxic materials. The reaction yesterday of Clara Sauer, executive director of Scenic Hudson, which has been overseeing the designation of the Hudson River Greenway, was typical.
"By connecting the Erie Canal with the Hudson River, it would be an absolute home run," she said. "It would extend the greenway from one end of the state to the other."
The New York State Canal Recreationway Plan, as the project is called, capitalizes on the canal's history, encouraging visitors to see discontinued canal segments and antique locks, aqueducts and bridges. Mr. Tufo grows animated when he describes the scenic vistas that appear, as through an opening curtain, when a lock lifts travelers to a new water level.
"It's like a Verdi opera," he said.
But the plan seems aimed mostly at more active pursuits. The most important goal is to spur use of the canal by motorboats, charter boats and canoes, and Mr. Tufo said he has already spoken to French boat operators to enlist their bids. Mr. Tufo spoke of an ambitious canal trip taken by Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, and his wife that took them west across the canal, northeast up Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence Seaway and down Lake Champlain and the Champlain Canal.
Last year, locks were opened for pleasure boats 116,000 times, a figure that suggested underuse to the consortium that studied the canal, which was headed by the Manhattan architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle.
Another goal of the project is the creation of an end-to-end trail stretching from Albany to Buffalo that would use old towpaths and roads for cyclists and hikers. Roughly 220 miles is open for such use now. Another 150 miles is owned by the Canal Corporation, an authority subsidiary, and needs to be developed for trails, and Mr. Tufo believes he can buy easements across much private property.
The planners believe that increased tourism would create 2,700 jobs and pump $230 million into the state's economy by attracting 1.3 million visitors. That is why the plan calls for spending $11.3 million on marketing the canal as an international attraction.
The plan does not surrender commercial hopes for the canal. Mr. Tufo believes his agency can lure back shippers for whom time is not of the essence or those moving extremely heavy materials.
Asked why he felt an agency that is expert at building highways can take over a waterway, Mr. Tufo mentioned the agency's engineering and financing expertise as well as its expertise at collecting tolls. The authority already charges tolls of $2 to $10 per lock.

HEADLINE: MAIL BOMBER LINKS AN END TO KILLINGS TO HIS MANIFESTO

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Unveiling an apparent motive and a possible way out of his murderous ways, a serial mail bomber has delivered to The New York Times and The Washington Post a 35,000-word manifesto calling for revolution against what he says is a corrupt industrial-technological society controlled by a shadowy international elite of government and corporate figures seeking to subvert human freedom.
The self-described anarchist, in a series of accompanying letters, said that if his full manuscript was published by one of the newspapers within three months, and if that paper printed three annual follow-up messages, he would stop trying to kill people. But the bomber, who threatened to blow up a plane this week, did not pledge to stop property destruction in his 17-year campaign of postal terrorism. 
 The documents were contained in parcels received by The Times on Wednesday and The Post yesterday and were turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After examination and laboratory tests, the bureau said the manuscripts were apparently authentic writings of the terrorist who has killed 3 people and wounded 22 others with 16 mail bombs since 1978. The series of crimes has come to be known by the F.B.I. code name for the case, Unabom.
The killer, in a letter to The Times in April, said he wanted to tell his story and was working on an article of 29,000 to 37,000 words "that we want to have published" in The Times or in Time or Newsweek magazines. He said he would end his killing if his publication terms were met. The documents received this week apparently were a follow-up to that letter.
The Times and The Post, in separate statements yesterday, said they were considering whether to publish the manifesto, a 62-page, single-spaced document that often reads like a closely reasoned scholarly tract, touching on politics, history, sociology and science as it posits a cataclysmic struggle between freedom and technology. If published, the document would fill about seven pages of The Times.
The manifesto sketches a nightmarish vision of a deteriorating society and a future in which the human race is at the mercy of intelligent machines created by computer scientists. He urges a revolution in which factories would be destroyed, technical books burned and leaders overthrown. Out of the chaos, he expresses the hope that a return to "wild nature" might prevail.
The document, mixing revolutionary rhetoric and back-to-nature sentiments in a blend that might have come from Trotsky or Thoreau, laments increasingly overcrowded cities, the rapidity of social change and the "breakdown" of traditional values; rails against leftists and conservatives, and seems to add definition to the terrorist, about whom little is known.
The bomber, whom the F.B.I. believes is a man but who generally refers to himself as "us" or "we," claims to represent a terrorist group that he calls FC. But he is believed to be a loner who lives somewhere in the area of Sacramento, Calif.
In a series of accompanying letters that were delivered to The Times and are in the possession of the F.B.I. -- letters addressed to The Times, to Scientific American magazine and to Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse magazine -- the bomber twitted the F.B.I. as "surprisingly incompetent." He scoffed at journalistic inaccuracies in reporting his exploits and claimed that his recent killing of a California lobbyist was not inspired by the terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City.
In addition, describing himself as "angry," the bomber appeared to be summing up the motivations and emotions of 17 years of violence and death, and, in a kind of epiphany, offered himself and the nation a way out of the killing.
Even so, he did not promise to end his campaign of terrorist bombings completely if his manuscript were published by The Times or The Post.
Distinguishing between terrorism, which he said was intended to cause death or injury, and sabotage, intended to destroy property, he reserved what he called the right to engage in sabotage even if the manuscript were published by one of what he called the "respectable" newspapers.
In his letter to Mr. Guccione, the bomber said The Times and The Post were being given "first claim on the right to publish," and that if both refused, Penthouse would be given publication rights thereafter, but on terms that might add one more death to his string and therefore increase pressure on the newspapers to publish the document.
"To increase our chances of getting our stuff published in some 'respectable' periodical we have to offer less in exchange for publication in Penthouse," he wrote. "We promise to desist permanently from terrorism, EXCEPT that we reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, AFTER our manuscript has been published."
Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times, said in a statement yesterday that the newspaper was considering whether to publish the manifesto. "The manuscript is long and we're just starting to look at it closely and study our options," he said. "There seems to be an implicit promise that bombs will not be sent while we're considering the document."
Mr. Sulzberger added: "We will act responsibly and not rashly, knowing that lives could be at stake. It seems we've been given three months to think the issues through. One issue that we find especially troubling is the demand that we not only publish the initial document but then open our pages for annual follow-ups over the next three years. Such a commitment is not easily made."
In Washington, Donald E. Graham, publisher of The Post, said: "The Post takes this communication very seriously. We are considering how to respond, and we are consulting with law enforcement officials."
Yesterday's developments came in a bizarre week in which the bomber, who had never previously issued warnings, first sent a letter to The San Francisco Chronicle threatening to blow up an airliner out of Los Angeles International Airport before the Fourth of July, and then -- in a brief message included in the package of documents sent to The Times -- called the threat a prank.
"Since the public has a short memory we decided to play one last prank to remind them who we are," he said. "But, no, we haven't tried to plant a bomb on an airliner (recently)."
The F.B.I. said the messages to The Chronicle and The Times were both the work of the bomber.
Prank or not, the threat prompted tightened security at California airports, delaying many flights and disrupting mail deliveries throughout much of the state on Wednesday. Yesterday, as travelers prepared to depart for the long Fourth of July weekend, tension was still evident among passengers at airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere in California.
While airlines reported normal service and no drop in the number of passengers, it was not a typical day. Some passengers were interrogated. Luggage was carefully scanned with X-rays. Extra police and security officers patrolled terminals. Postal authorities maintained a close watch over packages big enough to contain a bomb.
And Jim R. Freeman, the San Francisco special F.B.I. agent in charge of the Unabom case -- a code name adopted because the early targets were people associated with universities and airlines -- said all the precautions were justified.
"The F.B.I. reiterates that based on the Unabomer's prior history of violence, and specifically violent acts directed against airline passengers, the F.B.I. is continuing to take the threat as stated in the letter to The San Francisco Chronicle very seriously," Mr. Freeman said.
The Chronicle building in San Francisco was evacuated for an hour yesterday after someone noticed an unattended toolbox outside. A three-block area was cordoned off, while police closed in, but the toolbox turned out to be harmless.
While the bomber's lengthy manifesto outlined his complaints against society and his apparent aims, the letters that accompanied it were in some respects more pithy, particularly as they touched on the F.B.I., which has been unable to trace him.
"For an organization that pretends to be the world's greatest law-enforcement agency, the F.B.I. seems surprisingly incompetent," he asserted in the letter to The Times. "They can't even get elementary facts straight. Many news reports based on information provided by the F.B.I. are incorrect and even contradict each other."
Contrary to published reports, he said, the bomb that killed the lobbyist, Gilbert Murray, in April was not a pipe bomb and was set off by "a home made detonating cap." He also complained that the name on the address label was erroneously reported.
In another passage, he addressed questions of "morality of revolutionary violence," saying it was senseless to apply moral criteria to such violence. As for his own motives, the bomber said: "The answer is simple: Anger. Why are we so angry. You would do better to ask why there is so much anger and frustration in modern society generally. We think our manuscript gives the answer to that question."
In the letter to Scientific American, the writer displays a technical virtuosity in discussing an article on whether advanced nuclear reactors could initiate runaway reactions, and cites the subject as "a good example of the arrogance of scientists, who routinely take risks affecting the public."
The manifesto, entitled "Industrial Society and its Future," opens with a basic assertion: "The industrial revolution and its consquences have been a disaster for the human race." While benefiting some in advanced countries, it says, they have caused widespread suffering, robbed human beings of dignity and damaged the environment.
Technology, he argues, has only made matters worse, "permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine." There is no way to reform the system, he contends, adding: "We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system."
The document calls the desired revolution political, with the object of overthrowing the economic and technological basis of society, not governments.
He defined freedom as "being in control" of one's own life, free from the power of others "no matter how benevolently, tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised." Constitutional rights, he said, are not as important as they are made to seem, with personal freedom more determined by economics and technology than law.
The manifesto makes only a few oblique references to the bombings attributed to its author and refers to them not as opening shots in a revolution but as part of an effort to draw attention.

Limit on Parcels
 LOS ANGELES, June 29 -- In the aftermath of the threat to blow up a Los Angeles flight, the Postal Service today said it would refuse to accept parcels flown into California or mailed from the state if they weighed more than 12 ounces and were sent by anyone other than a known shipper.
The only other time the service instituted a similar measure was during the Persian Gulf war.
To stop the flow of parcels into California's mail drops, the Postal Service has put notices on collection boxes telling people to send their packages either parcel post or through international surface mail, neither of which use airlines.
Packages left in collection boxes will be returned to the sender, said David Mazer, a spokesman for the Postal Service. Parcels from known shippers -- like Sears and L. L. Bean -- are still being accepted by the post office but are not being sent on commercial airliners.
Postal officials said the policy would affect about 30 percent of the 400,000 parcels usually mailed daily in California. The policy will continue indefinitely.
Postal authorities said that by tomorrow they expected to clear all of the hundreds of thousands of packages that have piled up over the past two days as they checked for suspicious markings, odors and wires.

HEADLINE: Rise in Auto Insurance Minimums Is Voted

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 29

 BODY:
As they sped toward their summer recess, state lawmakers today approved the first mandatory increase in minimum automobile insurance limits in nearly 40 years, a measure that would provide greater protections for accident victims but would drive up premiums for every driver in the state.
Also today, after hours of chaotic negotiation and intense lobbying, the Republican-led Senate and the Democratic-controlled Assembly passed a resolution that could start New York down the path toward legalized casino gambling. [Page B6]. 
 The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, had agreed on Wednesday to language for a constitutional amendment that would end the state's century-old prohibition against casinos.
But Mr. Bruno had trouble through much of today putting together the votes needed to pass the legislation. Only after cajoling more than a dozen members to change their positions was Mr. Bruno finally able to put the resolution on the floor, narrowly avoiding a major embarrassment for the leadership.
With the 1995 session expected to end tonight or Friday, many legislators still said they expect to be back in the fall for a special session.
A number of significant blls died today for lack of a consensus between the two houses, including proposals to require disclosure of H.I.V. test results for newborns, to force insurance companies to pay for experimental drug treatments for patients with cancer or AIDS, to raise the state's minimum wage above $4.25 an hour, and to provide property tax incentives for new development in lower Manhattan.
The lower Manhattan bill had strong support from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani but apparently was killed by Mr. Bruno because the bill's sponsor, Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor of Brooklyn refused to provide Democratic votes for the casino gambling resolution.
Both houses did pass legislation that would require health maintenance organizations to offer individual subscribers a choice between two standardized coverage plans. The bill is supported by Gov. George E. Pataki.
Unlike some H.M.O. plans now, both new plans would include coverage for prescription drugs. And one of the plans would give policyholders the right to go outside of their H.M.O. to see doctors of their choice as long as they are willing to pay a share of the cost for those services.
Late tonight, leaders of both houses said they had reached agreement on a bill that would allow the state Board of Regents to appoint a panel that would design a plan of improvement for the troubled Roosevelt school district in Nassau County on Long Island. Unlike an Assembly proposal, the bill would not require the immediate suspension of the school board, but it would allow the regents to disband the board if it does not carry out the plan of improvement.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had vetoed previous versions of the automobile insurance bill, but it took on a sudden new life this year when Mr. Pataki endorsed it two weeks ago. It will mean increased coverage limits for 1.7 million of the 7.5 million policies written in the state, and increased premiums of at least $100 a year for those policyholders, according to the State Insurance Department.
This year's debate pitted two of Albany's most ferocious lobbies against each other. Trial lawyers, who typically receive a percentage of their clients' proceeds in automobile liability cases, fought vigorously for the bill. The insurance industry, which fears both higher payouts and an increase in uninsured motorists, led the opposition.
Ronald S. Kermani, a spokesman for the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, noted that the current coverage limits were set in 1957, when the $5,000 minimum limit for property damage "would buy four cars."
"Thirty-eight years later, we still have a $5,000 minimum and that might buy the hood or the trunk for a new Plymouth, with a little grill work thrown in," he said.
But Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, the Democratic chairman of the Insurance Committee and an opponent of the bill, said it was "a dollars and cents issue" for the trial lawyers. "These cases are almost always brought on a contingency basis, and the standard take is one-third for the lawyer," he said. "If the limit is higher, the lawyer's take is higher."
Forty-two states currently have higher minimum limits than New York, Mr. Kermani said. New York's minimum limits are $10,000 for bodily injury for each person involved in an accident, a total of $20,000 in bodily injury protection for everyone involved in the accident and $5,000 for property damage. The bill would raise the limits to $25,000-$50,000-$10,000.
Most New York policyholders already have coverage that matches or exceeds those limits. But about 1.2 million policyholders who are considered high-risk drivers, and an additional 500,000 who are not, do not have enough insurance and will have to buy more.
The average premium increase for low-risk drivers will be $100 above previously anticipated increases for inflation, according to the Insurance Department estimates. But high-risk drivers -- those placed in the state's so-called assigned-risk plan because of poor driving records -- would see premium increases that average $240, the Insurance Department said.
For young, unmarried men who live in areas where traffic infractions are most frequent, the assigned-risk plan premiums could increase by much more. Twenty-year-old unmarried men would pay an additional $343 in Manhattan, $384 in Bronx and $476 in Brooklyn.
Even good drivers who already have enough coverage can expect to pay $15 more a year because their premiums subsidize the policies of high-risk drivers.
Recent insurance industry studies show that New York already ranks seventh-highest among states in average automobile insurance premiums, but the new limits would probably raise the ranking.
 
H.I.V. Test Disclosure
For the second year in a row, the Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-led Senate failed to reach agreement on a bill that would require the state to inform mothers of the results of the H.I.V. tests that are now performed anonymously on their newborns.
Two weeks ago, the Senate passed a bill that would have required mandatory post-partum testing and mandatory prenatal counseling about the benefits of testing.
While the Assembly Democrats favor mandatory prenatal counseling, they have been deeply divided on the subject of mandatory testing. Their Speaker, Mr. Silver, decided today that he would not force his members to vote on the issue, particularly since there was no agreement with the Senate on a consensus bill.
Instead, he said, he was delaying action to await the outcome of a similar debate in Washington. Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a Queens Democrat, has introduced legislation that would withhold Federal funds for AIDS prevention and treatment from states that do not require testing of new mothers.
"It is clear that there is imminent Federal legislation that would supersede anything that we do," Mr. Silver said.
But Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn, the Queens Democrat who has championed mandatory disclosure of H.I.V. test results for newborns, said Mr. Silver had given in to pressure from liberal interest groups with "a Manhattan agenda."
"I think it's immoral," she said. "We're going to continue to send babies home without telling them they're at risk of a fatal disease. It's just mind-boggling that the Assembly is not going to vote on this bill."

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Friday showing how automobile insurance premiums will rise under new legislation passed in Albany labeled the figures incorrectly. They showed rates for drivers categorized as high-risk, not for safe drivers. (The figures in the article differed because they had been adjusted for inflation.)
